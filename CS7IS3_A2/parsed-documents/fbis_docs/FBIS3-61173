In discussing the drafts of the citizenship law of the Republic of Latvia and other related documents in the Supreme Council, as a draft author and referee, I had to answer a variety of questions and proposals -- both sensible, and ridiculous. This is how annexionist and racist citizenship acts were adopted during the fascist "Third Reich". According to these, non-Aryans could not obtain citizenship in the empire, and Jews and Gypsies were later annihilated. After the fall of this empire, the allies declared these fascist laws to be invalid, and in the American and Russian occupied zones, they were invalidated retrospectively -- up until the very point of enactment [.sup]1[/]. Thus, it is possible to adopt very strict citizenship laws, but only within defined, internationally accepted boundaries, which should be know. At least those deputies in Latvia who have been elected for a second term will have learned as much as to know that Western governments and experts evaluate the level of democracy of a post-communist country, including Latvia, according to four or five major, i.e. constitutional, laws: the constitution, which must include a section on human rights, the election law, the citizenship law, and the law on the legal system. The Satversme (constitution) is finally in effect. However, without the incorporation of the December 19, 1991 constitutional law "The rights and obligations of humans and citizens", it remains on the same level as the pre-war "Weimar" type of constitution, without any regulation of human rights. Regarding the proposals by the "radicals" to revoke all laws passed by the Supreme Council or to immediately renew all pre-war laws, I can only respond that carrying out such proposals would create total legal chaos and anarchy in an already poor situation with respect to rights protection, when neither citizens nor the rights protecting institutions will know what the laws in effect are, and will be unable to function. Furthermore, in such a case, all of the pre-war property denationalization and land reform laws that were passed by the Supreme Council will also be revoked. The pre-war owners just might start looking around the Saeima building for resolution proponents with pitchforks. It seems that the recently elected representatives to the Saeima from "Fatherland and Freedom" do not know that scores of new laws passed by the Supreme Council, such as the laws of "accounting procedures", "the return of property to religious organizations", our current law package on business activities, banks, author's rights, and others, were adopted and are in conformity with a whole string of international laws following strict recommendations by Western governments and experts. Included among such conventions, for instance, are the International Labor Organization Conventions, the Hague Convention on the Matter of Civil Process, as well as the 1949 Geneva Convention, which the self-same "Fatherland representatives" refer to so often. I would also recommend taking extreme caution when correcting the constitutional law "Rights and obligations of humans and citizens", because it has received high grades by the United Nations and the European Council. According to the expertise of European Human Rights Court Judge J. de Meyer and European Human Rights Commission member, C. Rozakis, the December 10, 1991 constitutional law, "with respect to the determination and protection of rights and freedom, as provided by this document, is comparable in rights and freedom as guaranteed by constitutional documents of the majority of member nations in the European Parliament, and what is collectively guaranteed within the bounds of the European Council, as well as the European Human Rights Convention" [.sup]2[/] . The repeal or correction, without careful consideration, of this law, which has received the highest evaluation by high ranking experts of European human rights institutions, could give the wrong impression in the United Nations and European Council of instability in the main political laws, especially at a time when we must become accepted into the European Council, and cause a new and unnecessary influx of international experts into Latvia. Naturally, the human rights law can and should be corrected, but only with very careful consideration, so that some of the norms would be more in line with the 1950 Rome Human Rights Convention and its appendices on the question of specific rights restrictions, as well as to determine the minimal rights standard, which can never be overstepped, not even under emergency or war conditions. It is also necessary to refine this law to totally eliminate the removal or restriction of a person's main constitutional rights, specifically political and due process, without a court decision, as occurs at present. In such a case, this law will be even more democratic than the 1950 Rome Convention with all of its appendices. In addition, there is no system to insure overall human rights, and political rights, in particular, in Latvia through the help of a state administrative institution, and especially the courts. Likewise, there is also no system to fight against organized crime and to provide people with personal safety. This is also a further verification of the words of Thomas Jefferson [.sup]3[/] , i.e. that "the longevity of a law is more important that its creation" [.sup]4[/]. But these initiatives must be focused first on the reform of the legal system, the institution of which in Latvia, the same as with the 1950 Rome Convention in the participating nations, must give every person the possibility to address the courts with complaints about the violation of their human rights. In this respect, it is also necessary to create a special punishment system. The Satversme courts must be created and it must be determined what type of court would handle human rights matters. As per the Scandinavian model, so-called ombudsmen must also be provided [.sup]5[/], or a state-empowered human rights institution, which would investigate all complaints regarding human rights violations on the part of state employees or institutions and would be involved with the reinstatement of these rights within the context of the administrative process, or if the case should require, to introduce the matter to the courts. Therefore, the human rights law must be incorporated as a permanent part of the Satversme, since the present-day constitutions of all European countries include a section on human rights, which is formulated on an overall principle level, so that it does not have to be constantly changed, and thus guarantees the stability of the constitution. The regulation of each specific right is being detailed in non-constitutional laws, such as for the freedom of the press, speech, demonstrations, awareness, etc. The constitutions of developed nations usually also include various basic principles of citizenship. We should do likewise. If the Saeima deputies do not declare all Supreme Council laws to be ineffective, then we also cannot ignore the fact that the Republic of Latvia Citizenship Law was adopted at the first reading. The second reading was overturned at that time by the combined votes of the Latvian National Independence Movement (LNIM) and the Interfront deputies. The former felt that the law was overly liberal towards immigrants, the latter felt it was too restrictive. This law draft cannot be ignored also because, at that time, a great deal of attention was paid to its analysis by United Nations and well as European Council human rights experts, evaluating it to be more favorable than the October 15, 1991 Supreme Council resolution "On the renewal of Republic of Latvia citizenship rights and naturalization basic principles". The United Nations Center for Human Rights Group Director I. Fall, in the report by experts, directed attention, not to the resolution, but to a detailed analysis of the citizenship law draft, finding that "after examining the Latvian citizenship law draft, the mission finds it to be suitable, recalling the overall recognized international rights principles on the question of granting citizenship, as reflected by the International Court decision in the Noteboma case. In accordance with the court decision, "each sovereign nation has the right through its legislative process to define laws on granting its citizenship, and on the naturalization process by which citizenship is conferred, as performed by the state institution, in according with legislation..."[.sup]6[/]. Further, the report by experts finds: "Therefore, it cannot be stated that Latvia is violating international rights through the fact that it is defining how it grants citizenship"[.sup]7[/]. That is also the final evaluation of the citizenship law draft adopted at the first reading. At the same time, the report also criticizes various norms in the October 15, 1991 Supreme Council resolution. And thus, the Saeima deputies would be acting intelligently if they would recognize the texts of the reports by experts of the United Nations Human Rights Center Director Ibrahim Fall[.sup]8[/], as well as of the European Human Rights Judge J. de Meyer and European Human Rights Commission member C. Rozakis[.sup]9[/]. Every citizenship law, provided that it is prepared by qualified specialists, is technically similar, with the exception of various norms, whose goal is to accommodate it to the political and demographic situation of each specific nation. The so-called immigrant nations of the new world, in their initial attempts to colonize "native" territories, created citizenship laws that would promote immigration and form "national melting pots". On the other hand, the nations of Europe, through their citizenship laws, attempted to maintain their national identities (homogeneousness). For instance, the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Federal Republic of Germany, in its December 15, 1977 statute on naturalization guidelines, clearly and plainly stated that "the Federal Republic of Germany is in no manner a country of immigrants"[.sup]10[/]. The entire discussion could be covered by these few paragraphs. But since the Saeima factions have decided to waste time and present five law drafts, then we may as well compare their good and bad points. Naturally, this complicate task should be started with the law draft submitted by the ruling coalition with "Latvian Way" as the flagman. And especially because the wayfarers party leader, Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs, in the October 27 interview, officially reminded everyone that this coalition's pre-election slogan was "the Latvian Way is the law and order way!" We have all already started to notice what and who this order applies to. Naturally, political "chickens" are counted around election time. However, from the law drafts already published[.sup]12[/], we can already see that even though this ministry faction has the greatest number of lawyers, even some who have received their legal training abroad, the Latvian Way law draft is the weakest in terms of an abundance of ideas and norms. The wayfarers have not realized that it would be desirable to define in the law (as was done in the law draft adopted at the first reading) what Latvian citizenship is, since the qualified lawyers are unable to explain this in an understandable manner. I do not know why the law draft developed by the working groups of wayfarers (who were the members?) did not contain any sections referring to the citizenship of children from mixed marriages, which are the most complicated and essential sections of any national citizenship law. It is not clear whether the Latvian Way believes that Latvians will not have any children in the future, or are attempting to prevent mixed marriages with foreigners. That could be done, because during the time of Stalin's rule, there was a period during which marriages between soviet citizens and foreigners were completely outlawed. And, in the USSR, up until the middle of 1990, there was an unlawful practice by which marriages with foreigners were only possible by consent of the central committee. At one time, this author prepared the legal foundation on which such an idiotic practice at the end of the soviet era was repealed. The Latvian Way does not realize that adoption, whether a citizen adopts a foreigner, or a foreigner adopts a Latvian citizen, also has an effect on citizenship, which is why this matter should be regulated by the citizenship law. In comparison with United States legislation, the Latvian Way lawmakers have defined the group of people who are denied naturalization very liberally. They have practically erased these same very few norms for possible denial by the condition: "if determined by a court ruling". This is not how it is done in the world. Citizenship by court proceedings (actually official ceremonies) is only obtained in the United States. Elsewhere, the immigration institutions, which do not even have documents available to them, but only compromising police investigative materials, can irrevocably deny naturalization, because it is almost impossible to demonstrate in court that, for example, "N" is an Italian maffia "godfather" or a member of the terrorist "red brigade". The United States immigration and naturalization law section 313 defining the group of persons for whom citizenship is denied is three pages long[.sup]13[/]. Germany considers as non-intragratable and therefore non-naturalizable, those persons who maintain contact with their emigrant organization[.sup]14[/]. The majority of nations will not naturalize persons who have no legal means of support. I have always had an objection against the fact that ever since the republic of May 4 Supreme Council came to power, official state acts are no longer published, specifically --international treaties, which, following their ratification, become a component part of every state rights norm. During the soviet era, all USSR international treaties were properly published in Latvian. At present, almost no Latvian international treaty, despite my repeated protests to the Supreme Council, are not only not published, but are very often not even submitted to the deputies before the vote for ratification. Thus, for instance, prior to the vote for joining the International Monetary Fund, the text of the treaty was not presented, and the deputies were voting as if they were bidding in a poker game. Could the wayfarers explain how the Latvian state administrative and rights protection institutions will insure that our international treaties are fulfilled when they have no access to the texts of the treaties? In pre-war Latvia, the texts of our international treaties were published not only in Latvian and, for instance, Russian, if the treaty was with Russia, but also in English and French, because the texts in these languages were submitted for filing in the League of Nations. Now, the texts of our treaties -- according to the existing procedure --must be translated into English and sent to the United Nations for publication in the "United Nations Treaty Series". Is anyone doing this? Regardless of all of the wayfarers promises about organizing the laws and legal system, there is no order in the publication of law and law drafts. Thus, for example, the publication of the Latvian Way citizenship law draft in the Diena supplement, without any sort of warning or explanation, gets carried away with paragraph 14, section 2. Along with this, according to the published text, everyone has the right to believe that the Latvian Way bill allows Russian Army Colonel Victors Alksnis to claim Latvian citizenship, but that thw renouncing of citizenship or its revocation is not possible -- as in czarist times. There is more in addition to the Latvian Way law draft circulated in the Saeima. And that is the mess in which we find the publication of the state acts and their bills! If the Latvian Way "while in power" cannot even bring about any order in the publication of its law drafts, then how will they be able to do it with more difficult matters? The Latvian Way bill also contains some very strange phrases, as, for instance, in paragraph 12: "In granting citizenship under naturalization procedures, the number of years of residence in Latvia should be taken into consideration". How should it be taken into consideration, and what number of years, if in paragraph 10, a ten year criterion is already defined? Just as strange is the condition described in paragraph 14, section 2, that naturalization can be restricted in the case of a person who, "due to the committing of a serious crime, has been sentenced to removal of freedom for a period of not less than one year"... If this refers to a heavy crime, then a one year sentence is not typical. Only racketeers, when caught red-handed, sometimes receive a "suspended" sentence. Also ridiculous is Latvian Way bill paragraph 23, which states that the only documents which can confirm citizenship are the Republic of Latvia citizen's passport and a "notification" issued by the Republic of Latvia diplomatic and consulate representatives. First of all -- why a "notification" instead of a citizenship certificate, as issued by other countries? Second, what confirms the citizenship of a child born in Latvia, especially one who has no parents in whose passports such information could be confirmed? Obviously, a child's citizenship must be confirmed either through a birth certificate, which would not be desirable, or a certificate of citizenship, which could be issued to the child as soon as his citizenship is determined. In other words, the Latvian Way law draft leaves a poor and superficial impression as far as norms and concepts are concerned. It is also no surprise that each leading wayfarer is at least a minister at the same time as a deputy. Serving in two parliaments in three years, I am convinced that, in order to properly perform the duties of a deputy, it is necessary to work from early morning until far into the night, and then it is not possible to accomplish everything to personal satisfaction. If we want to establish a true democracy in Latvia, a seat as a deputy in the next Saeima must be maintained strictly apart from other state official positions, and according to the Swedish model, a replacement deputy must be instituted, while the deputy holds a ministry position. The "Fatherland and Freedom" faction (henceforth, referred to as FF) has been more serious in developing its bill[.sup]15[/], although, and I hope they forgive me, because of the modest volume of the law draft submitted -- two pages-- I am unable to confirm an abundance of ideas or knowledge of the subject. Apparently, FF still maintains the dogma that whatever is inherited from pre-war Latvia is a priori good on its own. Wake up! Latvia is not Sleeping Beauty's fairytale castle. Seventy-four years have passed since the citizenship law was adopted. Such primitive citizenship laws are no longer used nor revised anywhere in the world. In England during this period of time, eight such laws have already been adopted. Don't pace around in place. I cannot deny that FF, in its opinions, is attempting to act for the good of the Latvian people. Probably, some of their norms should not be spurned, and could be utilized in the final variation among the norms of a consolidated, detailed law. However, Latvian lawmakers should realize that the European Council is expecting as an entrance fee a legally qualitative, new, modern citizenship law. If FF is determined that, in this millennium, it will not allow the naturalization of any immigrant, this is not wise, neither in the eyes of the world, nor for practical reasons. Don't think that I am for the indulgence of foreign (even Western) people. Quite the opposite. My motto is: "Whatever the foreign folks are saying, don't talk along with them!" We will be able to survive as a people, if we are smarter, more cleaver, or at least not as dumb as the surrounding major groups of people. Take an example from the Jews! A small group of people cannot punch a hole through the wall of a large group of people by using its forehead. It can get ahead through wisdom or wealth. And that is also all that has to be said about the FF bill. Footnotes 1. Mann F.A. The Present Validity of Nazi Nationality Laws. --The Law Quarterly Review, Vol. 89, 1973. Apr. P. 199. 2.

Bad laws weaken good laws.(Montesquieu: "On the length of laws".) The Democratic (Center) Party (D(C)P), with its name, the loudness of its propaganda, and large monetary resources from undeclared sources, attracts genuine interest. According to the party's last congress and new name, it turns out that it alone is standing up for democracy, and no one else. In addition, the punctuation of its name, with the parenthesis, is a warm reminder of the AC(b)P (All Union Communist (bolshevik) Party)... Of course, according to the September 15 statement on citizenship by the party, renewal of the 1919 law is not acceptable, due to the above-mentioned reasons. I also cannot agree with the DP proposal that only Latvians and Livs be given "preference" in receiving citizenship. They should not only be given "preference", but an absolute right to automatically receive citizenship upon their return to the fatherland (if the specific repatriate is not affected by the regulations restricting these rights, as for example, participation in mass repression). In the same manner, the Jews have stated in paragraph 1 of the Israeli Constitution: "Every Jew has the right to immigrate to Israel and receive Israeli citizenship"[.sup]16[/]. I should remind you that shortly before the election, I submitted a law draft to the Supreme Council on the absolute rights of Latvians to receive unconditional citizenship upon their return to the fatherland. That was adopted at the first reading. The Satversme bill was successfully blocked, although there was success in obtaining the vote, unique in the Supreme Council's experience, to send the bill to the United Nations and the European Council's human rights commission for an expert evaluation. From the United Nations, I. Fall sent a positive evaluation of the law draft, indicating that, according to international practice, this would be the widely used and accepted so-called positive discrimination. The Europeans replied that they would discuss these questions at their September seminar in Riga, and sent some people to attend, who have not written a word about citizenship. The DP bill makes provisions for language "facilitation" (only) for "the hearing and visually impaired". But are they speech impaired, respectively, born that way, are have they lost the ability to speak because of a trauma? Naturally, the DP statement also contains some rational proposals. The Latvian National Independence Movement (LNIM) bill is incomparably more detailed and refined than the one "churned out" by the wayfarers. Overall, it is based on the structures and norms of the first reading of the citizenship law, which suffered a long and hot fight, and includes specific terms and also a proper definition of Latvian citizenship. Debatable could be norm 2.1., which has been adopted from the 1919 citizenship law. With point c) being extended to all descendants, it could involve an unexpectedly wide circle of people related to those who left Latvia prior to World War One, including the descendants of the Czar's governor generals, secret police, beat patrolmen, imperial army officers. etc. Thus, it will be obviously acceptable to the Russian-speakers, and "Equal Rights" will vote for it. Controversial is the LNIM bill's paragraph 10 on dual citizenship of emigrants, which has already been accepted in the first reading by the Supreme Council. As I have already said, it is not true that the refugees were "forced" into naturalization in their host countries. If this were true, then about 20 thousand of them would not have been able to maintain only Latvian citizenship. Naturalization, naturally, has widened the political and social scope of Western Latvians and increased the career opportunities in their host countries. That is also the major, and quite understandably human reason. However, I am opposed to dual citizenship, as are various Saeima factions and Latvian parties. By allowing dual citizenship "in the West" and not in the East, we are making it possible to be sued not only by persons of Eastern origin, but even for "discrimination" of Latvians in Latvia. By accepting a one-sided "Western" dual citizenship, we have created a category of privileged Latvians, who can fully enjoy the political rights of citizens, but who do not have to perform any of the obligations of the local Latvian citizens. This category also enjoys an additional unanticipated advantage. Any Western Latvian, as pure as a white archangel, free of all dirt from the soviet occupation era, flies over to our valley of sorrows, calmly runs as a candidate in the Saeima and even presidential elections, and if he doesn't like something, then he forgets all his patriotism and goes back across the ocean "to the big salary or pension". He is quite possibly a very pleasant person, but we don't have any prior evidence of this! And overall, a system in which the Latvian people wake up one morning and have a president about whom they knew nothing yesterday, is not good for anything. Any sort of phenomenon involving privileges and "political voyagers" should be rejected. The merits earned by exile organizations in promoting the Latvian cause in the West are all recognized, but it should be resolved: either here or there. This should be the main point in selecting a candidate for a higher national position. After all, the local people were the ones who suffered under the occupation and repressions, and they also managed to hold on to the Latvian land with their flesh and bones. And the local people will always be the first to clean out the "stables of Augeus". By allowing dual citizenship, we are hastily creating for ourselves a whole group of problems, the first of which are the so-called migrating politicians. To be quite honest, first of all, this category is mainly made up of pensioners; from this, certain conclusions about their energy reserves can be automatically assumed. Second, as demonstrated by Mr. Ritenis, they have difficulties coping with the local situation. Third, there are no high level specialists among them. All emigrants of Latvian origin who are high level specialists are either in Western universities or hold responsible positions in their host country. If I am wrong, then show me a professor who has returned to live in Latvia permanently, and I will gladly invite him to my institute to present lectures. Naturally, because of our 30 to 50 times lower salaries and our enormous local problems, only the fools among them of working age would return to Latvia. The advisors who are coming here are either adventurers, or those who have failed in the job market of their host country. In the beginning, I was also occasionally taken in by them, but I no longer allow them to present lectures in the University of Latvia International Affairs Institute. A few enthusiasts do come along, but there are very few of them. For the most part, young Latvian wanderers come here to work either in Western national diplomatic or company agencies. And I heartily thank those Latvian professors who come here from time to time to share their expertise. But now we have a whole string of Saeima deputies, who are serving as ministers at the same time, and hold dual citizenship. From a national and international legal standpoint, their status is quite controversial. For example, in the United States Immigration and Citizenship Law, section 101 on "Definitions", points (21) and (22), we read that the term "citizen" means "a person whose obligation is to maintain a permanent loyalty to the nation"[.sup]17[/]. Similar regulations are found in the legislation of all nations. And now answer the question of which nation are they loyal to and whose -- Latvia's or that other nation's -- interests are Latvia's deputies and ministers working for, those who have foreign citizenship crossbred with Latvian citizenship? Furthermore, in connection with the United States Immigration and Citizenship Law section 349, even a citizen born in the United States, not only naturalized, will lose citizenship if: 1)he is willingly naturalized by another nation; 2) swears loyalty to another nation; 3) joins the military service of another nation, if prior to doing so, he has not received permission from the United States Secretary of State or Defense Minister; (Latvia's Minister of Defense is a citizen of the United States). Further on in the American law, in the same section, point 4, there is a more restrictive norm: a citizen of the United States will lose his citizenship if he enters into the service of any foreign nation, even if he is or has obtained citizenship of this foreign nation. If such a case, the American law does not allow any exceptions or permission by the state. Therefore, from the standpoint of the state and legal order that was promised by the Latvian Way, anyone may express an interest in whether or not the United States citizenship of the honorable Mr. Pavlovskis has been revoked, in accordance with section 349, points 3 and 4, and if not, then what does the United States stand to gain, especially since the United States law does not provide for any exceptions? International rights, through the International Court of Arbitration (The Hague) 1912 decision in the Canavero matter, gained the so-called active or effective citizenship concept. The court concluded that Canavero, who, according to birth by the blood relation principle (jus sanguinis), had received Italian citizenship, but according to the place of birth principle (jus soli) -- Peruvian citizenship, and was factually a citizen of Peru, because he was in reality taking advantage of these citizenship rights, being elected senator in Peru, and as this nation's Consul General in Holland[.sup]18[/]. Taking the above into consideration, anyone, who is not completely naive to matters that influence international politics, may start to ponder a major theoretical problem -- whether Mr. Pavlovskis, against whom I have no personal complaints, is providing us with defense that is needed specifically by Latvia; or is it needed by the Americans, or by the Americans when they join with the Russians, when we are not around? Forgive the directness, but international politics is not some fool's game, and we know quite well from history how many times the major powers have joined in deciding the fate of the Baltics behind our backs. With the show of a reduction of Russian forces in the Baltics, there has been an immediate rush of active competition attempting to fill this void on all levels. Only a total fool could believe it was mere coincidence that there were candidates for presidents and ministers in the Baltics coming from the "West" (the former Minister of Defense of Estonia was Hain Rebass -- a Swedish citizen). Naturally, the still unresolved "KGB sack and deputies sitting in the sack" problem clearly shows that not just the truest Latvians, nor strictly Latvian citizenship can guarantee against national betrayal. Nevertheless, for the good of Latvia's security, it is necessary to carry out all necessary precautions to insure that national policies are created only and uniquely in our interests. Now, what kind of organization do we have, when two major national security structures in Latvia -- the Defense Ministry and Internal Affairs Ministry -- have people working alongside them who are receiving money from one major power, and yet others who receive money from another major power? Finally, I would like to remind you that Latvia is a participant of the 1930 Hague Convention "On specific questions that affect the confliction of citizenship laws". This League of Nations document is now on file with the United Nations Secretary General. The 1930 Hague Convention denied dual citizenship and supported the principle, in accordance with which each nation determines its circle of citizens, and other nations must respect these rights[.sup]19[/]. It would be more correct to resolve the question of dual citizenship, if we were to allow it, through international treaties with each country. It would also be essential to incorporate into the election law a permanent residence census, similar to what is done in the United States. For example, 10 years for the right to be elected to the Saeima, but to run for President, it would be necessary to have received citizenship through birth here, and to have resided permanently in Latvia for the past five or ten years. The loyalty oath should also be instituted for Saeima deputies and ministers. Up to paragraph 36, overall, the LNIM bill is in accordance with the former bill voted on at the first reading and would be acceptable. Nevertheless, I feel that: if the LNIM are such patriots, then the law must incorporate the principle on the absolute rights and citizenship of persons of Latvian and Liv origins (maintaining certain exclusionary conditions), because applying quotas to them is not sufficient. Likewise, quotas should not be applied to Estonians, Lithuanians and Poles, because, for example, many repressed Lithuanians, who were not allowed to return to Lithuania settled on the Latvian side of border with Lithuania and have lived there for all of the post-war years. These persons should also be eligible for the mentioned "positive discrimination" process, since they present no threats to the sovereignty of Latvia. The bill of the "Harmony for Latvia" faction does not contain anything particularly progressive and new from that of the Supreme Council's first reading. The only thing they did was to introduce similar numbering for the earlier Central Committee and Council of Ministers decisions and many old norms have been unnecessarily crossed out, ones which the faction authors had not understood. The "Equal Rights" faction bill contains some legally quite illiterate "pearls", which it would be worth mentioning. The preface to the bill starts off by outlining the goals of the bill written in a rather soviet propaganda style, "to establish harmony between the Latvian state and the inhabitants"(!), which is completely ridiculous from a legal point of view. First of all, the subjects of a citizenship law are "citizens", not "inhabitants", who include citizens as one part. Therefore, a citizenship law cannot establish "harmony" with "inhabitants", because it does not regulate questions of "harmony" among inhabitants (who would fall under the auspices of the "Harmony" faction, not "Equal Rights"), but questions about who is a citizen, how is citizenship obtained, lost, what is the citizenship of a child or adoptee, if there is a foreigner among the parents or adoptive parents. Further, if this is not a typographical error in the newspaper, the equal righters made some horrible mistakes in the bill, referencing an entire group of international treaties, without capitalizing any of the names and even calling them by wrong names. In addition, they are attempting to base their concept on documents that have nothing to do with citizenship, as for example, the International Pact on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights. It is declared in the draft that "no one in Latvia can be arbitrarily revoked of citizenship, nor arbitrarily denied the possibility to change citizenship". What does "arbitrarily" mean? If such a resolution is passed by the competent state institution (since no one else can revoke citizenship) according to the law, will this be "arbitrarily"? Moreover, "Equal Rights" is not correct also because Russia, according to its law, can basically revoke citizenship from any one of its citizens who resides in Latvia. I can't see that anyone here would attempt to prevent someone from changing their citizenship. A legally absurd statement in the bill is that "the Republic of Latvia guarantees within its territory to each and every citizen, foreigner, stateless person (...) human rights, the rights of citizens, observance of freedom, as mentioned in the Satversme and in this law". First of all, as I already stated, the purpose of a citizenship law in any country is to regulate only citizenship, not the rights of humans and citizens, which are regulated by a completely different law, and this is why all of the beautifully packaged norms on the rights of humans and citizens do not belong in the bill. Second, the Satversme, at this time, has no section on human and citizen rights, and thus referring to it is pointless. Further in paragraph 4, the declaration of the "zero" variation, naturally, is not supported by any other faction, and therefore there is no reason to discuss it. In paragraph 11, the norms referring to the status of foreigners belong in a law on foreigners, not in the Republic of Latvia citizenship law. Likewise, the idea of "Equal Rights" that citizenship cannot be revoked also seems unfounded. Even in such a democratic nation as Sweden, in accordance with their citizenship law, paragraph 7 [.sup]20[/], citizenship can be revoked. The rest of the bill consists of the Supreme Council's first reading, and a crossbreeding the Russia's citizenship law norms, not all of which are absurd, but could be useful in Latvian legislation. In ending, while I do not have a close friendship with either the LNIM nor "Equal Rights", I am forced to conclude that both of these factions have submitted the most detailed bills. The rest of the factions will not be convinced to vote for the latter's law draft. I am left to conclude that the closest to the long discussed and completed first reading of the Supreme Council citizenship law draft, which has gained acceptance by international experts, is the LNIM version, which should also be used as a basis for further work. If only for a moment, the Saeima deputies should put aside their attitudes, already formed in the Supreme Council, whereby they are more concerned about drowning their opponents than about Latvian national interests, and then we could gain the possibilities to reach a legally correct, modern citizenship law, one which would guarantee the future of the Latvian people.
