FR940610-2-00008 FR940610-2-00007 National Institute of Standards and Technology [Docket No. 930521&hyph;4076] RIN 0693&hyph;AB18 Approval of Federal Information Processing Standards Publication 173&hyph;1, Spatial Data Transfer Standard (SDTS) AGENCY: National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Commerce. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The purpose of this notice is to announce that the Secretary of Commerce has approved a revised standard, which will be published as FIPS Publication 173&hyph;1, Spatial Data Transfer Standard (SDTS). This revision adds Part 4, Topological Vector Profile (TVP) to the specifications adopted by the Spatial Data Transfer Standard and makes minor changes and clarifications to the Parts 1 and 3 of the SDTS. On July 26, 1993, notice was published in the Federal Register (58 FR 39792) that a revision to Federal Information Processing Standard 173, SDTS, was being proposed for Federal use. NIST reviewed written comments submitted by interested parties and other available material. On the basis of this review, NIST recommended that the Secretary approve the revised standard as a Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS), and prepared a detailed justification document for the Secretary's review in support of that recommendation. The detailed justification document which was presented to the Secretary, and which includes an analysis of the written comments received, is part of the public record and is available for inspection and copying in the Department's Central Reference and Records Inspection Facility, Room 6020, Herbert C. Hoover Building, 14th Street between Pennsylvania and Constitution Avenues, NW., Washingotn, DC 20230. This FIPS contains two sections: (1) An announcement section, which provides information concerning the applicability, implementation, and maintenance of the standard; and (2) a specifications section, which deals with the technical requirements of the standard. Only the announcement section of the standard is provided in this notice. EFFECTIVE DATES: This revised standard becomes effective December 30, 1994. ADDRESSES: Interested parties may purchase copies of this revised standard, including the technical specifications section, from the National Technical Information Service (NTIS). Specific ordering information from NTIS for this standard is set out in the Where to Obtain Copies Section of the announcement section of the standard. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Henry Tom, (301) 975&hyph;3271, Computer Systems Laboratory, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899. Dated: June 6, 1994.
