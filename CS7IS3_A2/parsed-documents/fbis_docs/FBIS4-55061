Do all the deviations at the top ranks of state power--whether they relate to unconstitutional allotments of apartments to officials, ownership transformation, "managerial loans," smuggling under the auspices of the state, or similar matters--find an alibi in the government's official announcements? Although the demagogic nature of similar government announcements in several former cases was utterly obvious, the government flinched a little after HSLS [Croatian Social-Liberal Party] deputy Mladen Vilfan repeated his question at the relevant hour in the House of Deputies, whereby he demanded an explanation from Valentic of the controversial 1986 decree on the basis of which around 140 mostly luxurious apartments in Croatia were allocated "for use with the option to buy" to state functionaries, i.e., high-ranking HDZ [Croatian Democratic Community] officials. Specifically, Vilfan said that five months ago Valentic only partially answered his question of who received an apartment on the basis of the decree in question, and in what manner, while in response to his related question "how many apartments were distributed through public enterprises and with whose money were they all bought?" the prime minister said that that is a "delicate question that demands serious study of the material and information-gathering" and that he was not yet in a position to provide an answer. HSLS sources talk about 40 apartments that were allocated through public enterprises, and Vilfan considers it unacceptable that the government and Prime Minister Valentic have been avoiding an answer for nearly six months, but that very silence is itself significant enough, Mladen Vilfan believes. Minister's Silence At the same time, the silence of Minister Ivica Mudrinic also seems very significant. Checking on the statements made by Mladen Vilfan and Boze Kovacevic in the House of Deputies, when Mudrinic's 203-square-meter apartment in the elite Zagreb neighborhood of Zelengaj was "pilloried," we tried to learn from Minister Mudrinic by fax whether it is true that his ministry bought him that apartment for DM570,000, only for him to then purchase it for only DM43,000. However, we did not receive any response from the ministry in Zagreb's "little cube." Judging from the "minister's silence" and from the firm guarantees expressed by the HSLS to the effect that they are in possession of all the purchase and sales contracts relevant to Mudrinic's apartment, the reasoning behind the issue is very simple and in fact tragically clear--the state gave the minister of trade and communication nearly half a million German marks. No one from the cabinet was present at the HSLS interpellation on rescinding the controversial decree on functionary apartments in the House of Deputies. Although that proposal was rejected, Marijan Prus, as the government's representative and otherwise the head of the Office for Legislation, acknowledged in a certain sense that the decree in question is in conflict with the Croatian Constitution, which does not recognize the institution of "social ownership." Using hackneyed legal terms, Prus tried to explain to the deputies that among the "resources in social ownership that have not been transformed to state ownership there are apartments, so that based on the Law on Housing, apartments can be turned over for use by state officials," noting that the deadline for bringing the law into line with the Constitution is 31 June [as published]. One must not forget that that deadline has already been extended twice thus far, so that Prus's reply prompted uncertainty concerning whether the government can freely violate the Croatian Constitution up to 31 June simply because the law has not yet been fully brought into line with the Constitution. Unconstitutional Allocation Despite public attempts by the political leadership to minimize the affair surrounding functionaries' apartments in the sense of "don't make waves," the manner in which apartments are allocated to republican officials is completely transparent and unconstitutional. Specifically, the notion of "tenant housing rights" is in correlation with the notion of "social ownership," and since the 1986 decree on functionary apartments corresponds directly with obsolete tenant housing rights, the unconstitutional positions on the basis of which the government housing commission has allocated 136 apartments to state officials since 1990 are quite clear. Moreover, according to reliable information that the HSLS intends to bring before the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Croatia very soon, all of those apartments were repurchased at extremely low prices, on the average for around 5 percent of the actual market value of such apartments. Vilfan says that in this regard he has concrete data on the apartments of Gojko Susak (237 square meters), Vladimir Seks (65 square meters), and former Minister Babac (151 square meters), while the most curious case is undoubtedly the five-room residential apartment of Minister Mudrinic. Gojko Susak's apartment on Torbareva Street was completely renovated with money from the Ministry of Defense, and Branko Babac moved into his spacious apartment a month before ceasing to perform his ministerial duties. Experts have also spoken up about the unconstitutional character of the "allocation of apartments to state officials for use with the option to buy." The editor of the specialist journal INFORMATOR, jurist Ljerka Abramovic, concludes in one of her expert commentaries that the allocation of "all 136 apartments to state officials is a violation of the Constitution of the Republic of Croatia, which implies criminal accountability, for which the public legal office and state attorney are responsible." The same opinion is held by Dr. Bojana Tomasevic, a professor at the School of Economics and expert on the housing issue. In her opinion, "giving apartments away for use free of charge is a practice adopted from Soviet collective ownership, while here this right has been expanded to privileged leaders and has become unlimited, permanent, and transferrable to all family members. This has made it possible to satisfy the private interests of beneficiaries of tenant housing rights contrary to the interests of all `receivers' of apartments and of personal funds-revenues with which the social housing fund was created." Fox Hunt In the hopes of finding legal "substantiation" to sanction the unconstitutional decree on giving apartments to state functionaries for their use, former state attorney Stjepan Herceg secretly invited experts from the School of Law to a consultation on the issue. However, all of that remained under a veil of mystical silence. We were unable to learn any further details even from the Office for Property Administration of the Republic of Croatia, where we were told by the assistant director of that office, Mr. Martinic, that after the prime minister's response to the liberals in the Assembly "it would be stupid for me to repeat or refute it because I am only a civil servant, but from my perspective the liberal initiative looks like a fox hunt, or rather an attempt to use those apartments for political ends." Regardless of whether this was an expression of awkwardness or, more likely, a lack of more appropriate counterarguments, the liberals are inclined to maintain that members of the Valentic cabinet simply lacked both the professional and the moral justification that would have allowed them to attend the HSLS's latest Assembly interpellation on apartments for state officials. In accordance with the logic of the voting machinery, the House of Deputies flatly refused to accept a revision of either the communist Law on Housing or the notorious decree on apartments for state functionaries. The Valentic government, which has passed more than 300 laws and decrees during its term, has apparently not found "credible" reasons to intervene in the area of functionary apartments. "And how could they," we were told by one HDZ member who is regarded in the party as a "Manolicist," "when all of them view their political position as a privilege of the privileged and when they are directly interested in seeing to it that the Croatia Constitution is not fully respected." A flat calculation indicates nearly DM30 million that the state has benevolently given to the "lucky recipients" of the 136 apartments in one way or another. Although under the present-day circumstances in which the state finds itself any moralizing about such actions by the state leadership is utterly superfluous, the "political apartments" of Minister Mudrinic, Minister Susak, and Vice President Seks are only the tip of the iceberg of profound and significant hypocrisy, in which the very people who should be most interested in ethical practices by virtue of their position and corresponding reputation are in fact becoming its generators through their actions. What the 50,000 homeless people in Zagreb alone would have to say about this is indeed a rhetorical question. Rule of the Stronger Comparing this with the fact that families whose houses were completely destroyed by the war (category 3) have each received DM6,000 is perhaps the best indication of the discriminatory character of allocations of budgetary resources, in the implementation of which all citizens of Croatia are equal participants every day. In the Spanish political system at a time of a pronounced increase in corruption in the mid-1970's, the name "caudillism" took root among the public for this social phenomenon, signifying the criminal coupling of political and economic centers of power, among which the distribution of public property was systematically carried out. This "alliance" quickly broke up due to mutual discord, but the notion of "caudillism" has remained as a real danger in the modern age. A danger that threatens us like Damocles's sword in so-called interim periods when the rule of law gives way to lavish privileges, abuses, and plunder. Although it is not fair to link the situation in Croatia to such extreme deviations, in any emerging legal system, and thus in the Croatian one as well, tolerance of any forms of corruption--beginning with "apartments for functionaries" and including all other forms of societal pathology--means that rule of the stronger is favored over the rule of law. Minister Mudrinic's reward for his work at the Ministry of Trade and Communication, amounting to half a million German marks, is greater than the annual income of the U.S. President, some people have concluded. Various things from an older Constitution, the U.S. one, have been incorporated into the Croatian Constitution, but apparently it is very hard for one old American rule to penetrate the consciousness of local politicians, namely: If you enter the world of politics with one dollar, you may not take a single cent more than that dollar back out, only one cent less.
