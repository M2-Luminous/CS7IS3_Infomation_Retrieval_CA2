"I delivered a letter to Letta for the premier on Maroni's irresponsible words. I chose to talk to Letta and not with Berlusconi because he is too high up for me, he's the premier and also the chairman of Fininvest," said the outspoken ex-president with reference to Berlusconi's business empire based on publishing and commercial television. "I'm not so presumptuous as to ask or demand to be received by the person who is also chairman of Fininvest," he emphasized. The minister's "irresponsible words" were spoken in response to a question on the query in which Cossiga, now a life senator, claimed he has been placed under investigation by Sisde, the domestic intelligence agency, and asked the premier for an explanation of this step. Maroni was quoted as saying, "Evidently Senator Cossiga has a solution in mind for Sisde, one which works through the destabilization of the structure. But the government and I do not intend to submit to any type of pressure." Cossiga, in his letter to Berlusconi and in remarks today, also challenged the minister's statement that he would not consider replacing the national police chief, Prefect Vincenzo Parisi, "for the time being," as "an act of unpardonable thoughtlessness...which destabilizes the head of the police and de-legitimizes him in front of the law enforcement services of all Italy." The life senator, who has served in his long career as interior minister and an undersecretary at defense in charge of special security and internal defense areas, said later he intended to have a talk with Head of State Oscar Luigi Scalfaro.
