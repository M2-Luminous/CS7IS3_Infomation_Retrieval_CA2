So the curtain at the end of this year will not be the final curtain on the Trust Agency stage. The reason for it was outlined by Trust Agency President Birgit Breuel during a visit to the offices of DIE WELT: "We were dipped into West German bureaucracy" -- with all its regulations, guidelines, and laws that became bloated over 40 years. The commercialization of the property in real estate and land will even reach into the next millennium, a total of 200,000 claims for restitution have been filed. Mrs. Breuel's blood pressure is going up whenever there is an argument about the future number of personnel in the successor organizations: "Those who want fewer people have to say which tasks they want to put off or which tasks they do not want to fulfill at all." People in Bonn should hear that. After all, in Bonn, various expert opinions from the Federal Audit Court and from Kienbaum enterprise consultants have been circulated, providing arguments for a radical reduction of the Trust Agency staff. And the responsible Bundestag committee has decided that "in all appropriate cases" work will be awarded as federal orders to private companies -- without separate Trust Agency successor corporations. "In principle, I like the idea very much," Breuel said. However, this would leave questions of liability unclear, and in the case of putting off investment promises, equal treatment would become impossible if there are various private controllers of a contract, Breuel said and added: "Why send our east German experts home to provide work for west German consultants?" Still, looking back leaves the president satisfied. Although the Agency will leave a mountain of debts of almost 275 billion German marks [DM], "this is less than a single industry, west German coal, has cost the taxpayer." She said she was also proud of the approximately 2,600 companies that went to their own -- in most cases east German -- management. Apart from that, "individual mistakes" have been made, but, all in all, eastern Germany has embarked on the direct path to become a "highly modern industrial center, albeit with problems on the labor market." Indeed; although job and investment promises are widely met, and although, according to Breuel, only 77 of the 13,500 privatized companies have gone bankrupt, three out four jobs in the industry have disappeared since 1989. Hardly anything remains of research, which used to be part of the old combines, because research was the first thing that Trust Agency enterprises began to cut. "That is not our fault," Breuel said categorically. However, at the same time, she admits that, at the beginning the Trust Agency was the only powerful authority in eastern Germany -- even though it was not one that should or wanted to make politics. And it certainly did not want to indulge in structural policy, which did not fit into the Berlin Agency's desired "entrepreneurial behavior." When, one after the other, the new laender gradually began to try to fill this vacuum, cooperation was very good. Breuel: "The land governments have gone very far." With similar respect she looks at the work forces and work councillors in the enterprises that had to undergo these radical changes. "After all, everything, really everything has changed for these people." It is thus, all the more astonishing that protests like those in the Bischofferode potassium mine, did not happen earlier and more often. "I never went there because it would have led to an explosion," the president said. Yet, it was in Bischofferode where, for the first time, "politics" intervened massively and made the potassium miners false hopes. "The Gysis of this world" were seeking and managed to find new fields for their activities in Bischofferode.
