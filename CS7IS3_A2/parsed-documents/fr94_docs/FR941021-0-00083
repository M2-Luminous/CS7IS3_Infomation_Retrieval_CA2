FR941021-0-00083 FR941021-0-00013 (iv) *␣*␣* (F) Commission cable television system regulatory fees imposed pursuant to 47 U.S.C. 159. * * * * * 3. Section 76.924 is amended by redesignating paragraphs (f)(5) and (f)(6) as paragraphs (f)(6) and (f)(7) and adding a new paragraph (f)(5) to read as follows: §76.924 Cost accounting and cost allocation requirements. * * * * * (f)(5) Commission cable television system regulatory fees imposed pursuant to 47 U.S.C. 159 shall be directly assigned to the basic service tier. * * * * * 4. Section 76.933 is amended by adding paragraphs (e) and (f) to read as follows: §76.933 Franchising authority review of basic cable rates and equipment costs. * * * * * (e) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section, when the franchising authority is regulating basic service tier rates, a cable operator may increase its rates for basic service to reflect the imposition of, or increase in, franchise fees or Commission cable television system regulatory fees imposed pursuant to 47 U.S.C. 159, upon 30 days' notice to subscribers and the franchising authority and, where required by §76.958, to the Commission. For the purposes of paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section, the increased rate attributable to Commission regulatory fees or franchise fees shall be treated as an ``existing rate,'' subject to subsequent review and refund if the franchising authority determines that the increase in basic tier rates exceeds the increase in regulatory fees or in franchise fees allocable to the basic tier. This determination shall be appealable to the Commission pursuant to §76.944. When the Commission is regulating basic service tier rates pursuant to §76.945 or cable programming service rates pursuant to §76.960, an increase in those rates resulting from franchise fees or Commission regulatory fees shall be reviewed by the Commission pursuant to the mechanisms set forth in §76.945. A cable operator must adjust its rates to reflect decreases in franchise fees or Commission regulatory fees within the periods set forth in §76.922(d)(3)(i) and (iii). (f) Cable television system regulatory fees assessed by the Commission pursuant to 47 U.S.C. 159 shall be recovered in monthly installments during the fiscal year following the fiscal year for which the payment was imposed. Payments shall be collected in equal monthly installments, except that for so many months as may be necessary to avoid fractional payments, an additional $0.01 payment per month may be collected. All such additional payments shall be collected in the last month or months of the fiscal year, so that once collections of such payments begin there shall be no month remaining in the year in which the operator is not entitled to such an additional payment. Operators may not assess interest. Operators may provide notice of the entire fiscal year's regulatory fee pass-through in a single notice.
