If, in the world as a whole this move is supported on a mass scale, in Ukraine attitudes toward this statement and its assessments are ambiguous. Our correspondent Petro Ostapenko met Oleksandr Tarasenko, the deputy chairman of the Supreme Council of Ukraine's Commission for Issues of Defense and State Security, and asked him to express his attitude toward the trilateral statement by the presidents of Ukraine, the United States, and Russia. [Begin recording] Ostapenko: Ukraine's President Leonid Kravchuk and representatives of the executive bodies of power are saying today that the trilateral statement is the result and continuation, let us say, of the decisions by the Supreme Council on nuclear weapons. Oleksandr, what is your opinion? Is this true? Tarasenko: Well, this document still needs in-depth comprehension. First, it is called a statement, a trilateral statement by the presidents of Ukraine, the United States, and Russia. How should we assess it today? Does it have a legal force as an international document and as an agreement, or is this just a statement? Upon studying it profoundly -- yesterday our commission was considering this document -- upon studying it profoundly, it can, in the long run, be qualified as an international agreement. In compliance with our current legislation -- the Constitution first and foremost -- and in compliance with the law on the president, on his plenary powers, the international agreements that Ukraine -- that is, the executive power, concludes in the field of defense, military construction, military relations with neighboring and other states, are subject to mandatory ratification by the Supreme Council. Why did I say that this document is an agreement and not a statement? Because, there is a supplement to the trilateral statement by the presidents of Ukraine, the United States, and Russia as of 14 January, and this supplement provides specific dates, the terms in which our strategic nuclear weapons should be fully deactivated, their number, and so on. This goes beyond the limits of the resolution that was adopted by the Supreme Council. What does this supplement stipulate? This supplement gives, for example, such parameters: Ukraine ensures the elimination of all nuclear weapons, including strategic offensive weapons -- that is, strategic air force, TU-160 and other aircraft carrying nuclear missiles, located on its territory, in compliance with its relevant agreements within the term of seven years as is envisaged by the START I Treaty and within the context of the statement by the Supreme Council of Ukraine on Ukraine's non-nuclear status, all the RS-22 missiles -- to be more specific they are called SS-24 -- on Ukraine's territory will be deactivated within 10 months by means of removing their warheads. What does it mean? You know that in two thirds of our silos launcher vehicles are filled with liquid fuel -- that is, heptyl. The entire world already knows what kind of a liquid fuel this is. This heptyl is a super poisonous substance, and the launcher vehicle itself is even a bigger powder keg than the launcher vehicle and the warhead as a whole. Proceeding from this, Ukraine and its plenary bodies and persons must take into account their own interests, first and foremost, and not the interests of those who benefit from this unilaterally. I believe that the Supreme Council, either the present or the future one, should seriously ponder over this document, and it can be ratified only after its parameters are specified. Ostapenko: I am sorry to interrupt you. You have just read out the item that has to do with all sides without exception. But nothing is said here about the Supreme Council resolution on the ratification of START I with reservations. It clearly stipulates that 36 percent of launcher vehicles and 42 percent of warheads are subject to elimination today. That is to say, these parameters have been extended to all nuclear [word indistinct]. Tarasenko: Absolutely. They run contrary to the Supreme Council resolution. The Supreme Council resolution and START I envisage percentage and here is says about the complete elimination. In this connection I would like to say the following, so that our radio listeners and our compatriots, our half-brothers, as they say, would know it: All those strategic nuclear systems located on the territory of Ukraine are targeted at certain objectives in the United States of America and relevant bases beyond the borders of the U.S. Correspondingly, approximately the same number of nuclear weapons are targeted at our territory. Well, this is military strategy and tactics and there is nothing incomprehensible here. Everybody understands this: If you target me, then I target you. But this document should also envisage adequate moves on the part of the United States of America, and our control over this, because everyone will control us, control how we eliminate nuclear weapons, remove nuclear warheads, transfer them from Ukraine to Russia. The only thing envisaged here is that Ukraine will have the possibility to control Russia neutralizing the nuclear warheads. However, this agreement does not envisage what the United States will do with that quantity of strategic nuclear weapons that are targeted at us, and what will be Ukraine's role in carrying out control over this process, as far as the actions of the United States are concerned. Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin declared that they would decode their missiles, which would then be retargetted at some deserted islands, or something like that. Ukraine's participation here is not envisaged, is that right? Tarasenko: Ukraine's participation here is not envisaged. Moreover, I disagree with such a stand, just as a citizen and just as an inhabitant of this planet Earth. If Ukraine eliminates these weapons, the former weapons of the Soviet Union, as is known, then the United States of America should eliminate and neutralize the same quantity of weapons. This is what we are talking about, not about retargetting at some other states, and so on. That is to say, there is no alternative in the world to universal nuclear disarmament and appropriate actions by all nuclear states. This is what our politicians should insist on, and at this point I again repeat and emphasize that the given document needs in-depth comprehension in legal terms, in terms of international law. What obligations, what guarantees can we talk about? Because, they already guaranteed us something to a certain extent. Let us not mention any names today, because there has already been enough talk about this. Who is to blame and who, let us say, ordered the transfer of tactical nuclear weapons from the territory of Ukraine? Those are our weapons. They would have been of paramount importance for the defense capacity of Ukraine. However, we transferred those weapons and could not cope with these ones. Here we outwitted ourselves. Ostapenko: I know, Oleksandr, that you are familiar with the technical condition of the strategic nuclear weapons, missiles, and warheads located on Ukraine's territory. Today, in numerous interviews, the military say that it is difficult for Ukraine to service them, that Ukraine will be unable to service them, therefore, the sooner we deactivate and transfer these weapons, the better for Ukraine. What do you think about it, please. Tarasenko: You, Petro, probably touched upon a very important aspect of this problem. It is quite clear that nuclear warheads and their systems are the most sophisticated systems because they should be sophisticated as they guarantee the safety of a nuclear warhead itself and a silo as a whole. This is why there exists a practice in the world according to which the given warheads are serviced by the authors who manufactured them. The authors themselves can destroy them. There is no other process, as they say. In this respect, we could find a state that would do this [word indistinct] but we cannot do this without Russia because the one who will have access there should know what it is, and so on. Therefore, every launching system and, moreover, nuclear warhead has relevant terms which guarantee their safety, and systems. We cannot do this without Russia. Therefore, it is necessary either to have very specific, responsible bilateral agreements toward that end with Russia on ensuring periodic servicing of the warheads and the silos as a whole or to neutralize and transfer them after their guaranteed service life expires. There is no other way around. Also, it could be possible to do as follows: A certain number of warheads and silos could be dismantled without their periodic servicing after their guaranteed service life expires. This is the way to follow. This would be the most correct, most appropriate way. Following it, one should move from the warhead, from the head, as they say, to the tail. That is to say, to dismantle the entire silo and not just remove the warheads and leave the rest with ourselves. It would be the same kind of a powder keg. Therefore, the most correct way is to act in line with a stage-by-stage, unit-by-unit principle. Both the warhead and the launcher vehicle should be dismantled completely. This would ensure the highest level of security to our state. Ostapenko: One more, very important aspect, as far as this problem is concerned. Did you see the guarantees of Ukraine's national security in this statement and in the supplement, the guarantees that Ukraine and the Supreme Council were striving for and which all those living in Ukraine wish to have. Tarasenko: Undoubtedly, there are certain aspects and elements of security here. There are such provisions, and so on. But, as they say, history and mankind know instances when such guarantees were given, when there were agreements, but there was the Second World War despite these bilateral and multilateral agreements, and 22 million people died and the economies in a whole number of countries were destroyed. This is why one should rely on God but have his own mind, as they say. Both our military and scientific potentials should work toward ensuring our state security -- not at the expense of nuclear weapons now but at the expense of other highly effective means. Such measures are being taken today. This is why, simultaneously with the reduction and elimination of nuclear weapons, fulfilling that resolution by the Supreme Council, we should work concurrently toward ensuring the combat readiness of our Armed Forces. Our commission, together with military departments, is carrying out this work. [end recording] [Announcer] Such is the attitude of people's deputy, deputy chairman of the Supreme Council Commission for Issues of Defense and State Security Oleksandr Tarasenko toward the trilateral statement by the presidents of Ukraine, the United States, and Russia on the elimination of nuclear weapons in Ukraine.
