Citing well-informed sources, the Zagreb daily blames the operation on Delta, a five-member Muslim commando unit commanded by Ismet Bajramovic. According to VJESNIK, three Palestinians and members of a pro-Syrian organization monitored Juka's movements for several weeks. One of them introduced himself as an arms dealer and took Juka to a parking lot near the Liege-Aachen road where he was killed. "The liquidation of Juka Prazina was financed by the son of Alija Izetbegovic, Bakir, who left Sarajevo six months ago," VJESNIK says in its unsigned article. According to the Zagreb daily, Bakir Izetbegovic "frequently travels between Brussels, Paris, Frankfurt, Baghdad, Tehran, and Ankara, using Pakistani and Iraqi passports." It is believed that Bakir Izetbegovic was in Belgium at the time of the assassination. VJESNIK goes on to say that "Hasan Cengic, responsible for army logistics in the Sarajevo government, was directly involved in the assassination of Juka Prazina." "Immediately after the assassination, those responsible left for Cairo and Khartoum via Brussels and Paris and Hasan Cengic left for Islamabad using a false Pakistani passport," VJESNIK writes.
