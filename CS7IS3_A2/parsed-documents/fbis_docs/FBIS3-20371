Yesterday the government submitted a document to the Riksdag that will make it possible for Sweden to join soon. The first exercises could be held this fall. "It is important to initiate Swedish involvement in PFP as soon as possible," the government writes. Swedish involvement in PFP will take place "on the foundation of military nonalignment. This cooperation represents no defense commitments." It is part of the attempts to construct a new pan-European defense order. On 10 January the NATO nations invited the rest of Europe to join Partnership and as early as 13 January the Foreign Affairs Council was already agreed that Sweden should join. Initially the government wanted to say yes to the invitation immediately. But the Social Democrats in particular wanted to give time for the Riksdag Foreign Affairs Committee to deal with motions shelved on the subject of PFP. The committee has reached an agreement in principle, but last week the Social Democrats, the Left Party, and New Democracy surprisingly called for a separate document that the government delivered yesterday after a lightning action. It means that new motions can be submitted up to 12 April. All countries around the Baltic Sea are participating in PFP or have said that they will do so. The first step is to sign the framework document that the NATO summit set out. Today 13 countries have done so. The government will sign as soon as the Riksdag has completed its consideration of the matter in a month, government sources have told SVENSKA DAGBLADET. The document is primarily intended for the countries of East Europe and does not represent any complications for Sweden. It is true that the participating countries are promised the right to consultations with NATO if their security is threatened. But an unofficial Swedish interpretation is that this is chiefly a "reassuring teddy bear for the countries of the East" (that want to but as yet are not allowed to become NATO members). Officially the government is saying: "No state can be included unless it wants to be involved. Sweden's freedom of action is not therefore restricted by this offer." In saying this the government ignores the fact that Sweden is acquiring yet another diplomatic card to play in a serious crisis in our immediate environs if the United Nations and the CSCE fail in their missions. In only a month Sweden could therefore take the step of entering this cooperation. There is a so-called document of introduction, with a list of Swedish offers to NATO. This document is effectively already complete, SVENSKA DAGBLADET's source has said. Sweden is offering courses for other states on how to carry out peacekeeping actions and humanitarian operations. In addition Sweden is prepared to support the peacekeeping force that the three Baltic states want to set up for operations in other countries. Finally Sweden is offering to promote democratic control and openness in military structures in East and Central Europe. The third step along the road to PFP is consultations between NATO and the states involved about what in concrete terms should be done. Here increased Swedish military contacts with the NATO headquarters in Brussels and NATO military headquarters in Mons, also in Belgium, will be needed. The government stresses how important it is for Sweden to be involved at an early stage in order to be able to influence the discussions that have already begun at diplomatic and military level. A fourth stage is that a fixed-term agreement between NATO and each PFP country is concluded about what is to be done. Sweden is already prepared to take part this fall with at most a company (this will require a change in the law that the government will propose later this year) in the first exercise abroad involving peacekeeping forces. The cost through to the spring of 1995 is estimated at 26 million kronor and will be met from the Foreign Ministry's budget.
