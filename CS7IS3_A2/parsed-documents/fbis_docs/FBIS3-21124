At present the heat exchanger is about 55% completed and is scheduled to be transported to the construction site in September 1994. The HTTR heat exchanger is being built at Yokohama Plant No. 1 (Yokohama City) of Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries. The device will transfer the heat from high temperature helium gas coming out of the reactor at 850-950�C to a secondary helium gas system. The secondary helium gas will reach a temperature of 900�C and become a heat source for thermal systems other than those used for power generation. These will be the highest temperatures in the world for a heat exchanger installed in a reactor to operate under. To assure durability under these high temperatures, the body of the heat exchanger has a two-layered structure, and the space between the inner and outer casings will be cooled by secondary helium gas flowing through pipes at about 400�C. This design will help maintain the pressure-resistant outer casing at a lower temperature. The high temperature gas reactor uses [omission] as fuel, graphite as the core structural material, and helium gas for cooling. It offers advantages because high temperature heat can be obtained for a variety of uses in addition to power generation. Construction began on the HTTR at the research facility in March 1991, and work is proceeding with a target of attaining initial criticality in 1998.
