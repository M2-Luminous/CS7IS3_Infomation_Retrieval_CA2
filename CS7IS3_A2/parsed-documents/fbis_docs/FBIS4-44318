More precisely, of a dollar crisis, the umpteenth since 15 August 1971, when it stopped being convertible into gold. What are the symptoms? Depreciation of the dollar compared with the other currencies (a drop of more than 10 percent in six months against the franc) and a resulting drop in currency values on the Stock Exchange, which was almost continuous yesterday. There is no talk of a crash but people are thinking in those terms. The main cause of this new collapse of the dollar is the increase in long-term interest rates in the United States and, even more, the fears of the consequences which could result from this upward readjustment of interest rates. In short, the operators fear they have reason to be afraid. Two observations: - The European Monetary System, in its adjusted form set up last summer, is holding firm. That is a good sign; - The drop in interest rates on the markets is being carried out without any panic. Small bearers now know that will only lose if they sold and they are accustomed to weathering squalls. However, this new summer storm ought not to be taken lightly. It is particularly unwelcome at a time when we are seeing that the recovery of European economies well underway. Edouard Balladur, who yesterday explained his policies for the next six months, has tried to be reassuring. It is true that, if you simply looked at the economic indicators of the French economy and the forecasts of the independent institutions, there would be no objective reason for the Stock Exchange falling. But, if the disturbances were to persist, they would eventually jeopardize this recovery. Investors do not like troubled times and, in the long run, a de facto devaluation of the dollar would jeopardize all the international activities of the United States' trading partners, be it sales of Airbus planes or oil, Ariane launch costs, or the purchasing power of raw materials exporters. The United States is therefore giving itself a considerable commercial advantage beside which the concessions it has from GATT are insignificant. It is survival of the fittest. However, it is considered certain that, after spectacular interventions by the central banks to curb the speculation and perhaps the few records which will be registered by the traders, order will be restored. Only those who lost their cool and hastily rid themselves of a hot potato will come off badly. Others will have gained that lost money. The world will only avoid these recurrent monetary crises when everybody lives within their means and when a coherent exchange system is established. There is no need to reinvent a single standard, but if we started by creating a few simple mechanisms which would organize the floating of currencies or would penalize speculation, we would at least avoid a great deal of chaos. That can be done at any time. On one condition: provided Washington is willing.
