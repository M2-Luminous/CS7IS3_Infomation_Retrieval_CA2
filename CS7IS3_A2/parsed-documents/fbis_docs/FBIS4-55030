Kata Peli Nagy went to a press briefing by the Socialists. [Peli Nagy] To preserve, to renew, and to surpass -- these are the guidelines for the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] after its partial victory yesterday; that is, to preserve the values of the past four years and to achieve what the previous government forgot to accomplish. So there will be no big clearout, or even a little one. This was confirmed by Zoltan Gal, leader of the MSZP parliamentary group. The intention behind these tactics, according to the party, is that the position of the left has to be consolidated during the next four years and this can only be accomplished through successful governing. Talking about the more and more pressing coalition questions, Imre Szekeres confirmed that a decision will only be made after the second round. However, he listed four criteria which will form the basis of negotiations. The most decisive factor in choosing partners will be to establish an agreement about the first six months' government program, about the structure and style of the new government, and on whether the other partner will be able to accept that negotiations will have to be carried out with the civil and interest protection organizations. Szekeres announced that the MSZP does not regard Gabor Kuncze, Viktor Orban, Laszlo Surjan, Jozsef Torgyan, or Peter Boross as prime minister candidates of the MSZP. Even in case of an absolute majority they would like to unite the country's best forces. [passage omitted]
