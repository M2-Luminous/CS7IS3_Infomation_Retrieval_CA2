Rudy Lengkong, head of the National Agency for Export Development (BPEN), was commenting on reports that the United States was threatening to revive its "Super 301" Trade Act and apply it to countries Washington believes are guilty of unfair trade practices toward the U.S. Lengkong said many countries other than the protectiomist developed ones, were still "wide open" for Indonesian goods. "We should widen our marketing reach among the developing countries, in other words: diversify our markets," he said. The Latin American countries, former communist countries in Eastern Europe and Middle Eastern countries were potential markets for Indonesian products, he added. Meanwhile , business circles in Jakarta said Indonesia should diversify its overseas markets not only in response to the protectionism of certain developed countries but also because its traditional foreign markets were suffering from a protracted recession. Previously Foreign Minister Ali Alatas had said the United States should no longer use its Super 301 Trade Act against its trade partner because such action would not be in line with the GATT's (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) Uruguay Round accords. "Super 301 should no longer be used since the Uruguay Round of GATT has duly provided for certain clauses governing settlement of disputes among countries," Alatas said. Lengkong said Indonesia should be working hard to accomplish the diversification of its markets and reduce its dependence on its traditional markets. According to private business observers, Indonesia is lagging far behind its partners in ASEAN (Associatcon of South East Asian Nations) where export market diversification is concerned.
