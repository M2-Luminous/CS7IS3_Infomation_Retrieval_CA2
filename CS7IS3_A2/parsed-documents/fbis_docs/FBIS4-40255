[Lanovyy] No such strict mechanism exists in Ukraine, and this means, no matter how sad it seems to be, that there is no democracy. In the United States, for example, there are 18 levels of state officials' responsibility for various crimes and misdemeanors. Have you ever seen a report by our finance minister on his work performed over the last six months? Under current political and economic circumstances, he simply must regularly explain how much of the state money is spent and for what. He must provide reports every month, and he must bear the responsibility for money resources working for nationwide interests, not for the interests of certain social groups. [Kabanov] How do you assess your chances for victory in the upcoming elections? [Lanovyy] I would like to appeal to the people: Look who has been leading you, and what these activists have achieved? Do you trust current President Leonid Kravchuk, former Supreme Council Chairman Ivan Plyushch, or former Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma? They had, in my opinion, every opportunity to introduce positive reforms. I worked with them pursuing one goal -- to reform the Ukrainian economy as quickly as possible -- but apparently, I worked too fast -- I stepped on the throat of their personal desires and aspirations. As you recall, I was removed... [Kabanov] In your opinion, are any of the other candidates for the presidential chair in a better situation than Parliament Speaker Oleksandr Moroz regarding propagandizing populist ideas? [Lanovyy] As a matter of fact, having become speaker, Oleksandr Moroz is in the most convenient situation, even compared with the current president. He now has the rostrum, the microphone, and television -- all means to influence a sufficient number of voters. [Kabanov] What is your opinion on the Crimean issue? [Lanovyy] In terms of strategy, the Crimea must remain within Ukraine. They want to separate? They want to obtain the status of an independent state? This will not take place. Let them take advantage of any liberties, but the Crimean parliament must work in accordance with the Ukrainian Supreme Council resolutions. I am for a peaceful resolution to this issue, by means of agreement. [Kabanov] How do you assess the activities of the Ukrainian National Assembly-Ukrainian National Self Defense [UNA-UNSO]? [Lanovyy] When I was reading UNA-UNSO documents, the position presented in them seemed very attractive to me. Although I accept the actions of UNSO units in Georgia, similar actions should be planned at the state level without amateurishness. I respect both left- and right-wing forces for their confidence and willingness to act. Yet, it would be better if these forces agreed on one point -- on the need to work for the future and real reforms in our state. UNA-UNSO, as well as other public and political organizations, has the right to exist within the framework of the law. However, I do not support the methods, with the help of which the aforementioned organizations have been looking for self-affirmation. [Kabanov] Who should have the initiative in all transformations within society, the president or the parliament? [Lanovyy] The presidential authority has great powers in Ukraine. The president can make legislative decisions, he can even change the system of local administration. The parliament is waiting for the president's initiation, his program for socioeconomic reforms, outline of strategy for joint actions, and consolidation of all forces and means to resolve nationwide problems. The current president does not have any initiative. Here is a recent example: Kravchuk has recently stated that we do not have a law on presidency, and it therefore makes no sense to hold presidential elections. But why do we not have such a law? Who, if not Leonid Makarovych [Kravchuk] himself, should display initiative in the adoption of such a law? [Kabanov] How do you assess the current economic situation? [Lanovyy] Seventy percent of Ukrainian enterprises are currently standing idle. The government claims that there is stabilization. The rights to payments and credits have been restricted. This is why there is no money for trade. Nobody buys anything. Real stabilization of prices is maintained by balancing supply and demand through either an increase in the volume of production (either domestic production, or imports), or structural redistribution (surplus production in one sector is compensated by selling the overstock abroad and importing scarce products). In Ukraine, apparent stabilization has been achieved by the artificial damming of trade. Someone once told me a very apropriate analogy: I want to pull you out of water because you are drowning. I throw a noose over your neck and pull. I will eventually pull you out of the water, but will this do you any good? Prices in Ukraine have been bridled in such a way that everybody will eventually die. Thus, all the talk about stabilization in groundless. As a matter of fact, another collapse and disorder is coming.
