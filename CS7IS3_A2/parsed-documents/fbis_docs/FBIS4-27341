Not only will Matsushita Electric Industrial and Hitachi, Ltd. soon build resident offices in Ho Chi Minh City, Mitsubishi Electric will also open an office with this fall as the goal. That is because Vietnam has a large population, said to be about 70 million people; and, not only is a large demand for home electronics products such as televisions anticipated, an expansion of infrastructure demand is expected, such as communications and electric power facilities due to the social capital provision program of the government. Vietnam has been promoting the "doi moi [renovation] policy," an open economy policy, since 1986, but in particular, a big incentive for the various electrical machinery firms to expand has been the U.S. Government's lifting of economic sanctions against Vietnam in February 1994. The resident office that Matsushita is opening has the objectives of a survey of the Vietnamese home electronics market and preparation of distribution and sales systems. Now that it has received permission by the Vietnamese Government to open, it is studying the lineup and will dispatch a resident representative from Japan. Since televisions and refrigerators are flowing into Vietnam via local distributors from the company's plants in neighboring Thailand and Malaysia, the plan is to first establish an after-service system and build an independent sales network for the future. In addition to sales of home electronics products, Hitachi is aiming at the infrastructure demand for power plants and communications facilities. Moreover, Hitachi Sales, the home electronics sales subsidiary, will open an office in Ho Chi Minh City with July 1994 as the goal. In expansion aimed at orders for public works projects, NEC newly established a resident office in Hanoi in July 1993; Fujitsu also established an office in Hanoi in March 1994. Mitsubishi Electric is also proceeding with preparations to open a resident office in Ho Chi Minh City with this fall as a goal, and Toshiba also is studying it. Behind the promising view of Vietnam, the point cannot be avoided that the people have more purchasing power than appearances due to money sent from Vietnamese in the United States. According to Victor Co. of Japan, which has been producing color televisions since 1985 by providing technology to a local state-operated plant, the 1994 television market is about 400,000 televisions. The outlook is for it to expand to 3 million sets within 10 years.
