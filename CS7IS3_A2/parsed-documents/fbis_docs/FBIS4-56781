Jose Vicente Maldonado, the Ecuadoran minister of industry, commerce, and integration, said that the foreign ministers of the Andean Group (Colombia, Bolivia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela), will study a new date for the summit. Maldonado ruled out that possible differences among group members, especially on trade issues, were the reason for postponing the presidential meeting. Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Diego Paredes confirmed the suspension of the Cuenca summit and added that it will take place in "the first half of 1995." He said that the Andean Group presidents are interested in directly promoting subregional integration, but the meeting in Cuenca was postponed due to various commitments they have in the coming weeks. The presidential meeting in Cuenca, third most important city in Ecuador, would have been held on 26 May, on occasion of the 25th anniversary of the signing of the Cartagena Agreement that gave birth to the Andean Group.
