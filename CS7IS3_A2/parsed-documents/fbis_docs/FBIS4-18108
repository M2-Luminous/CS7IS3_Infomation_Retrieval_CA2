The Chinese minister responded to Minister Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger's calls that human rights be observed by drawing a distinction between individual and collective human rights. It is "only natural" that, "because of differences related to the social order, economic development, and cultural background," views about human rights should differ. Yang Xiao said that human rights possess both a general validity and a validity under special circumstances. "In the Chinese view, human rights constitute a dialectic unity, and collective human rights are a precondition for guaranteeing individual human rights." Mrs. Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger gave Yang Xiao a list of 12 human rights activists who have been imprisoned. Yang Xiao assumed that the list was the same one that had been handed over by Chancellor Kohl during his visit to Beijing in November 1993 and according to information provided by the prison service, 11 of the 18 people [on Kohl's list] do not exist, two are in prison, and the others have either been freed or placed on probation. Others are receiving medical treatment outside prison after bonds had been paid. Mrs. Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger insisted that the list had been prepared on the basis of "concrete information." Mrs. Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger said that "a basic consensus on fundamental and human rights issues" is the essential basis for cooperation between the two justice systems. China has acceded to UN agreements and like all member states, it must adhere to them. Even dialogue between states is a fixed element in international law. That is why German reminders do not constitute interference in China's internal affairs. Germany respects regional and national differences and can also understand the viewing of legal matters in collective terms. Nevertheless, there is a generally applicable basic human rights core. "I would welcome it if the Chinese Government gave a clear indication that it would strengthen the political will to achieve a real change in the human rights situation in China." It is true that there are signs that the independence of the courts is being enhanced and law enforcement functions exercised by bodies not connected with the courts are being reduced. However, reports provide grounds for concern. People accused must have the opportunity to defend themselves. International norms on eliminating torture and other inhumane or humiliating forms of treatment must be adhered to. Following talks at Bonn's Justice Ministry, there was another confrontation at the Petersberg. The bloody crushing of the peaceful demonstration on the "Heavenly Peace Square" in Beijing in 1989 and the wave of arrests and prison sentence have had a very negative impact on relations, said Mrs. Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger at the dinner. "The basis, which had developed over years, of exceptionally great trust and intensive, successful cooperation between our countries was endangered and open to serious questions." Now, "present obstacles" must be freely discussed and eliminated. "Objections about impermissible interference in internal affairs only eliminate discussion and not the actual obstacles to fruitful cooperation." It is not a question of patronizing. It is possible that a liberal view of man involving guarantees for individuality, independence, decisionmaking freedom, and personal responsibility cannot be transferred to the Chinese Constitution, which has a collective character. More cooperation in the judicial sphere can only be achieved "if the indissoluble link between economic and political freedom, between closer political ties and progress in the field of human rights is more apparent and adhered to." Yang Xiao responded that states have the right, in accordance with their laws and within the framework of their legal order "to combat all criminal acts, including counterrevolutionary crimes." No one has the authority, not even the Chinese justice minister, to interpret laws or change them at their discretion: "The state has the right to use coercion within the framework of its laws." However, "China is ready on the basis of equal rights" to hold discussions with Germany about "differences of opinion." China is working on developing its legal system as it creates "a socialist free market economy." Beijing wants to use the experiences of other countries in "developing a legal system connected with a free market economy." The legal order is an important instrument for safeguarding peace and promoting development. Cooperation between the Chinese and German Justice Ministries should be geared toward jointly combating international crime, protecting investments, and safeguarding "interests in the civilian field."
