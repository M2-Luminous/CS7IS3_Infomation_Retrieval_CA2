Kotenok and O.G. Gavrilov, Pedagogical Institute imeni V.I. Lenin; UDC 614.718-078] [Abstract] A portable device has been designed for bacteriologic air sampling at positive and negative temperatures. The device (M-15) consists of an intake inlets, an aerosol generation chamber, and a chamber for trapping bacteria on neutral granules coated with 1.5-2.0% starch solution for adhesiveness. Subsequent sample recovery and routine bacteriology yield bacterial counts per cubic meter of air. Figures 1; tables 3; references 6 (Russian).
