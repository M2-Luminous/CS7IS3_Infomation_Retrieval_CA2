However, we understand that NATO was forced to resort to this drastic measure, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko told a briefing on Wednesday. "We are above all concerned over the failed attempts to solve the conflict in this region by political means," he noted. "We believe there is a possibility of going ahead with political dialogue, which successfully got under way in Bosnia-Herzegovina," the foreign minister stressed. "In my opinion, a positive solution to it is quite possible. We see to it that the situation remain under control, since a lot of U.N. peacekeeping forces are deployed in this region, including our Ukrainian battalion. I think we are doing our utmost to prevent any unpredictable developments there, the more so as the situation is under control of U.N. troops and NATO forces. I believe the conflict will be avoided," Zlenko emphasised.
