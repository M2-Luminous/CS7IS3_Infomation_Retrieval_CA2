A group of experts examined the policy statement and drew a number of conclusions regarding it. The group's overall conclusion was that the scales assumed regarding the development of nuclear energy for the production of power and heat are based on a single unfounded scenario for the future development of Russia's economy and power industry. The group went on to suggest that the policy statement be rejected in its present form and revised to include a special program of emergency measures to prevent the possible occurrence and development of large-scale accidents at now-operational nuclear power facilities until they are shut down and to reduce the harmful environmental effects of stored radwaste and spent nuclear fuel during its storage and reprocessing. Included among the other points raised in the group's 11-point reaction to the policy statement were the following: 1) the policy statement does not acknowledge the existence of alternative, economically sounder versions of covering that portion of Russia's future power demand that is slated to be covered by nuclear power; 2) the assessment of the current status of Russia's nuclear power industry presented in the policy statement significantly distorts the true state of the industry and paints it in a manner favorable to the RF Ministry of Atomic Energy; 3) the extensive program of construction of new nuclear power facilities, including facilities with RBMK reactors, in all parts of the country called for in the policy statement is unacceptable; 4) the ecological arguments in favor of expansion of the nuclear power industry (especially the argument that increased use of nuclear power will result in decreased burning of fossil fuel) that are included in the policy statement are not, either individually or in their entirety, sufficient grounds for further expanding nuclear power generation in Russia by 2000-2010; 5) the harmful effects of nuclear power generation on the environment, both because of accidents and because of flaws in the technology, are well known and eliminate any basis for the statement that atomic energy is safe on an ecological plane; 6) Russia's unified electric power systems are sufficient to meet her fuel and power demands for several decades without any need to increase her nuclear power industry; 7) the projected cost estimates of the proposed plan for augmenting Russia's nuclear power industry are unfounded because, as previously stated, the plan only considers one possible scenario; 8) Russia has a broad spectrum of alternatives to expansion of its nuclear power industry (including controlling heat use in the domestic and industrial sectors, redesigning new gas-fired boiler units to produce electricity and heat in the form of steam and hot water, equipping existing steam turbine units with gas turbine-based topping stations, and increasing the use of coals from the Kansk-Achinsk and Kuznetsk basins; 9) the policy statement largely ignores international experience in the area of nuclear power plant construction; 10) the policy statement does not provide any mechanism for the public's involvement in decisions regarding constructing nuclear power enterprises or for providing the public with objective information regarding Russia's radiation situation.
