In a change from the previous over-elaborate formalities, more and more Chinese, who are leading a better and more efficient life, are turning to faster and more economical ways of conveying their greetings. In Guangzhou, which has the most telephone users among all cities in China, many people dialled to express their good wishes on New Year's day this year. A few simple words on the phone easily bring people closer despite the distances between them. Central China's Hunan Province opened a greeting wire service during the New Year festival and cut fees for trunk calls by half. In Dongshan Island, southern Fujian Province, the number of calls sent by local villagers to their friends and kin in Taiwan increased by half over the previous years. During China's traditional Spring Festival, sounds of pagers could be heard everywhere in large cities. Digits appearing on pagers indicated all kinds of good wishes. In Taiyuan, capital of northwest China's Shanxi Province, it was counted that during the Spring Festival, the pager system of the city's telecommunication bureau sent over 100,000 greetings each day. In the past, telegrams told people of emergencies. However, many post offices have opened telegraph greeting services. Along with telegrams, people could also receive gifts, such as flowers or cakes, which were sent at the request of their friends. A young man who was in love with a girl but was too shy to say it, sent a greeting telegram and a bunch of flowers on New Year's day. Since then he has sent a greeting telegram as well as a rose to her every day. The telegrams helped him to show his affections. Officials said that the booming of the greeting wire service comes with the booming of the country's telecommunications. Last year, 18 cities widened their handling capacities of telecommunication systems. In Taiyuan, the capacity of the city's telephone network has reached 304,000. With the improvement of living standards, more and more people ask for modern communication channels. As a result, experts say, greeting wire services are bound to become even more popular.
