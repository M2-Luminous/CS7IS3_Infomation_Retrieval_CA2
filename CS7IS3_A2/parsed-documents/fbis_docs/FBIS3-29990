Personnel officers from Navy Headquarters met up to seven officers with the rank of rear admiral and commodore, who face age-limit discharge in December, and asked if they would step down voluntarily in advance, navy sources said Thursday. The concerned rear admirals responded to the request with anger, labeling it "forced discharge," the sources said. "The military personnel law sets the age limit of rear admirals at six years and says the age-in-grade of general officers can be extended for up to one year when their service is required," said one officer allegedly asked to leave. "We cannot accept such a proposal that not only dampens military morale, but which is also against the status guarantee of professional soldiers," another officer said. They reacted strongly to the move by navy authorities, saying they could be mistaken for the targets of a purge in connection with irregularities and thus would have difficulty finding another job. In the army as well, some 10 senior generals belonging to Hanahoe, who were pushed into inactive posts or relieved of their duties early last year, have reportedly been asked to leave voluntarily because there are no available positions. Most are said to have taken a dim view of the request for "voluntary discharge" and demanded as a condition for their voluntary discharge that discrimination against field-grade-level members of Hanahoe be withdrawn. Army and navy authorities said the request for early discharge was part of efforts to reduce the number of generals, whose ranks had expanded in the past administrations. Some observers, however, point out that the move may do more harm than good to a military that has recently shown signs of recovering from earlier purges. The authorities said their meeting with the generals was part of procedures before April's appointments, adding they had just sounded out the generals on voluntary discharge and had no intention of forcing them out.
