During a meeting held this afternoon with the National Intelligence Service (SIN) high command, the president gave several guidelines to the official forces to encourage them to continue struggling effectively against the subversive groups. Fujimori demanded more protection for the population, particularly now when the nation is preparing to celebrate the new year. Fujimori later traveled to the southern Andean city of Arequipa, where he will celebrate the year's end. There he evaluated the country's political violence along with the intelligence services chiefs and the military high command. Armed Forces and police authorities increased security measures in the capital city after several attacks this week resulted in two deaths, dozens of injured, and considerable property damage.
