[Zedillo] Thank you for inviting me. [Zabludovsky] Dr. Zedillo, a few days ago you were the coordinator of Luis Donaldo Colosio's campaign. After his tragic demise, you are now a presidential candidate, as a result of your party's decision. What are your feelings? How do you feel? [Zedillo] First, I think that like all Mexicans, I have a deep and heartfelt feeling of pain over the tragic death of Luis Donaldo Colosio. Like all Mexicans, it is my great hope this crime will be cleared up very soon and that all Mexicans will know the truth about the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio. It is a desire, a demand which we all make. Also, I am firmly determined to assume the responsibility given me by my party. [Zabludovsky] You have said that you will continue what Mr. Colosio began. How do you view this presidential race? [Zedillo] I see it as highly competitive. The parties that are different from mine, the PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party], are serious, organized political organizations that have been working quite effectively and arduously in their campaigns. I can see that all the presidential candidates deserve my utmost respect and consideration. They are conducting intense political activities. I clearly recognize that this is a competitive race in which our party will face serious contenders. At the same time, however, I am convinced the voters, the Mexican people, on learning about the background of the different candidates and on learning about the different platforms each of us is proposing to solve the problems of Mexico, will choose the option I represent. [Zabludovsky] You speak about experience, your background in public service. In a nutshell, what is that background? [Zedillo] In a nutshell, it dates back to many years of experience, exactly 25 years ago. I began as an assistant auditor in the National Bank of the Army and Navy. Later, in the early 1970's, I went over to the Presidency Secretariat. After that, I left to study abroad. Upon my return, I worked in the Banco de Mexico for several years. Later, after 1987, I was appointed by the president as undersecretary for programming and budget. On 1 September 1988, I was appointed programming and budget secretary. In early 1992, I held the post of public education secretary. It is a 25-year career that has taken me to different sectors of public administration, two of the most modest posts, and to the post of state secretary. [Zabludovsky] Dr. Zedillo, we are especially interested in hearing about your experiences as state secretary. First, can you expand a bit on what you did when you were undersecretary in the Programming and Budget Secretariat and when you headed that Secretariat? [Zedillo] With great pleasure. There is something that I consider singular in my experience as undersecretary: that was participating in the drafting and implementation of the first national pact designed to banish the threat of hyperinflation, which loomed large over us in late 1987. Perhaps this action by the government was particularly important for the country's development. Above all, it was important for the people's welfare because inflation at that time hit the poor sectors especially hard, as it did salaried workers; those whose buying power deteriorates constantly with inflation. Hence, my satisfaction at having been there at that time and having participated at that moment in the overall planning for several years, which we must consider successful. [Zabludovsky] Dr. Zedillo, that satisfaction of which you speak, the economic achievements in which you played a leading role to create the economic system we now have in Mexico, has been criticized by many people. Not only has it been criticized, but changes in the economic system have been accused of causing all our ailments. What do you say? [Zedillo] I would respectfully but emphatically oppose that view. We have to recognize, and I would be the first to recognize, the serious problems we still have in our country. In our country, there are many Mexicans, millions of Mexicans, who are living in extreme poverty. These are Mexicans who lack the most essential necessities. They are facing a situation of marked inequality, not only among people but among regions of the country. It would be absurd to assume an air of triumph when confronted with this reality. Likewise, I believe we should not deny the merit of what has been done in the past few years. It was the product of efforts not only by the government but by Mexican society as a whole. We have spent these years facing our country's deepest crisis in decades. We have laid the groundwork for a future that holds better opportunities for all Mexicans. It has been complex work, work that has led us to reform different aspects of national life, but I believe we can truly say that the transformation has been implemented with the Mexican people's welfare in mind. If you allow me, I would like to cite a specific example. A while ago you asked me about my work at the Planning and Budget Secretariat. One of the essential aspects of that work was making sure that public finances would stop being the principal cause of inflation. We went from a huge deficit in public resources needed to cover public spending to a situation where we had virtual equilibrium. That was necessary to bring inflation under control, to restore minimum order to the economy. But the great merit of this economic policy was that not only public finances achieved equilibrium and even surplus, but that an unprecedented policy was applied to increase social spending in our country. This is the most important spending because it is spending on people, on human beings. Just as we were achieving equilibrium in our public finances, our social spending went from nearly 30 percent of total public sector spending to 50 percent during the first three years of this administration, when I was planning and budget secretary. I believe that is the outlook that must be adopted when analyzing efforts by all Mexicans over the last few years. We have to look ahead. We have to recognize that renewal is necessary in many aspects of the national life. Changes will be necessary, but these changes will always have to be oriented by the need to first serve the Mexican people. We must not diminish the value of efforts of so many people in the past few years. [Zabludovsky] Bearing this in mind, what is the future of the NAFTA? [Zedillo] NAFTA, as the other measures to open up trade, must only be seen as one of the many instruments we have obtained in the last few years to generate better job opportunities, better wage opportunities for Mexicans. That is the treaty's role. We must not confuse the means with the end; the end is the welfare of each Mexican family. NAFTA is one of the many means we have available to increase the welfare of the Mexican family. [Zabludovsky] You were also recently in charge of the Public Education Secretariat. As public education secretary, what were your most important experiences during your tenure? [Zedillo] I came into the Public Education Secretariat with instructions from the president to promote and coordinate, with the participation of many people, thorough and profound educational reform. This plan for educational reform was based on an very basic-level diagnosis of the condition of our country's schools and educational system. We were facing a severe problem with centralization and bureaucracy in our country's basic education system. As a result, the first instruction I received was to reach an agreement with the governments of each state and with the largest labor union in Latin America, the National Teachers Union, on the federalization or decentralization of the basic education system. This means that all those schools, elementary schools and high schools, that were supervised in all aspects from Mexico City, had to be transferred to the governments of each state so that the government authority would be closer to the interests, the needs of the school itself. This was necessary in laying the groundwork for a new educational system. It was a very complex political, administrative, and financial endeavor. Some months later, thanks to the participation, in the first place, of the union, which played a key role in this decision and its implementation, and thanks to state governments, we were able to undertake what must be viewed as one of the largest decentralization operations in the world. We handed over to local governments 100,000 schools, 13.5 million students, 700,000 education workers, and a budget of 20 billion new pesos. This was the budget already earmarked for education by the federal government plus an additional amount to improve the operation of said schools. I think this is a very important example because it sets a guideline for the future. This shows the federal government's determination, based on political consensus, to transfer authority, responsibility, and resources to local governments. People must have confidence in local governments because they are closer to the people. This was the first aspect of educational reform. We also set out to revise for the first time in 20 years the lesson plans and programs which had been in force since 1972. Thanks to this reform of lesson plans and programs we were able to satisfy, within the educational system, long-standing desires of parents and teachers. For instance, we reinstated the way in which we learned our national language, that is by emphasizing reading and writing instead of the structural linguistics to which children were being exposed since the first grade of elementary school. We decided to teach children mathematics the way in which you and I were taught, with numbers, basic mathematics, and, above all, problem solving. Something especially rewarding to those who participated in that reform was the reinstatement of the systematic study of the history of the fatherland, national geography, and civic values, which were lost in the 1972 reform. Parents and teachers had demanded that the aforementioned subjects be reinstated. Also as secretary of public education, but always as part of a large team and counting on the support of many people and the union, we undertook an academic reform in the higher technological institutes of the country, which number about 130. This was the first in-depth reform since the creation of technological institutes. It was also very rewarding to have participated in the consolidation of the national system of researchers, to have taken part toward the end of my term as public education secretary in the creation of the national system of authors, and to have presided over the in-depth reform of the National Council of Science and Technology and in general of all the institutions for scientific and technological research in our country. Education is truly one of the most satisfying areas in my public life, for what it represents for Mexico and for the contact I established with teachers, Mexican children, and parents. There is no nobler task than education. [Zabludovsky] While you were at the helm of the Public Education Secretariat, the measures adopted by the government were not superficial. A profound transformation was effected. [Zedillo] These were the instructions of the president of the republic, to institute profound reform. During the implementation of said reform, Article 3 of the Constitution was reformed. This reform is very important because it established, for the first time in our Constitution, the right to education. Paradoxically, our Constitution did not guarantee this right. This reform established secondary education as mandatory for all people and as a mandatory obligation of the state. This did not exist before. It was also very satisfying that this reform of Article 3 of the Constitution received support from all political parties in our country. Until that time, there was no precedent for constitutional reform of the kind approved for Article 3. Another indication that the reform was structural is the fact that the process generated a new general education law, based on the new foresight the educational system should have. This new general education law, which I believe is innovative legislation, was approved by over 90 percent of the deputies present for the debates on this new legal instrument. I agree that the main objective of this was to implement profound reform. This reform is already in motion, it is being applied, and it will surely bear fruit in the coming years. [Zabludovsky] I also believe, Mr. Zedillo, that one of the consequences of this deep transformation of our educational system was that it brought together all sectors of society to participate in a very intense public debate. The debate took several months. People expressed their opinion and managed to guide certain solutions in the field of public education. [Zedillo] That is right. There was a big debate on several issues. One was the issue of decentralization. Thanks to a very complex but very interesting negotiation with the union, which I personally found very enlightening, we approved the federalization of the education system. There was a debate of the Education Secretariat's decision to reinstate the systematic study of Mexican history and how we would provide the children emergency study material -- as we called it at the time -- to study Mexican history, once the Secretariat issued the order. There were many differences of opinion over these books. In the end, however, the result was clear: the study of Mexican history was reintroduced, after 20 years of absence from Mexican schools. We laid the foundations and established the criteria to produce, write, and edit new and more specific textbooks, which Mexican children are using today. The debates and the controversy were well worth our while. [Zabludovsky] We know the country has many problems, all of which would be difficult to enumerate. Of all of these problems we Mexicans face, which do you believe are the most important? [Zedillo] Mr. Zabludovsky, I believe our country faces many problems, but given your question and in an effort to summarize, I would say that we face four basic problems. First, we must recognize that there is a serious problem with injustice and insecurity in our country. It would be wrong to deny this reality. The second problem is unemployment. This is a problem that, by the way, has worsened recently. Unemployment has worsened significantly during the past year, after several years of improvement. The third very serious problem I see is the very low, and in many cases, insufficient income of our country's working classes. The fourth serious problem I see is the enormous social imbalance that persists in our country. Consequently, we have the conditions of poverty in which many Mexicans live. I would rather not assign these problems specific priorities. Each is as important as the others. Furthermore, I believe it will be difficult to address any one of them without seriously and decidedly addressing the others. [Zabludovsky] There we have four serious problems. How do we plan? Admitting that we need to very closely examine our system for administering justice. This means we need to evaluate our justice system's current situation and have the Congress examine the results. Then, if need be, they can approve the appropriate reforms that will permit the judicial system to execute its basic duty more efficiently. The other three problems that you have mentioned are very interconnected. They are social and economic problems. One is unemployment, another is the working class' low salaries, and the fourth problem you mention is poverty in general. Let us group them together. I would like to ask: How do you plan to confront this situation that so concerns and obsesses all Mexicans? I am talking about solutions to the problems of poverty and economic inequality. [Zedillo] I think these four problems must be solved in an integrated, development-oriented fashion. We cannot just deal with one problem at a time. We must take the four problems as one. Thus we can identify at least four areas in which the government can act. First, we need to strengthen justice and democracy in our country. We need to have fairer laws that can be better applied. This speaks to the issue of the country's social, economic, and political life. If we do not take care of these problems, we will have serious difficulties in confronting the other problems. The first thing we must do is strengthen justice and democracy. The second area for action is social development, which is nothing more than investment in human beings. We have to spend more on education, health, housing, basic urban services, and social security, this with our retirees in mind. We need an extremely ambitious social policy. Through this extremely ambitious policy, citizens will be more aware of their rights but also more willing and able to participate in national life. The third part of the solution necessarily has to do with the problem of competitiveness or productivity of each person, in each company, and in each economic unit. These are the microeconomic aspects of development. The fourth issue we already know about. It concerns the country's economic stability, which is necessary but not sufficient, I admit, for the nation's development. The country needs financial and price stability, things that we have achieved in the past few years through great effort. The four issues are justice and democracy, social development, productivity, and economic stability. If we can come up with an integrated -- I believe this is completely feasible -- policy that includes these four issues, we will create a virtual circle of economic growth at a higher pace than in the past, accompanied by price stability and an indubitably more equitable distribution of wealth. This will help us progressively -- and we hope rapidly -- eliminate the conditions of extreme poverty in which many Mexicans live. [Zabludovsky] We cannot avoid discussing a problem that emerged on 1 January. We can call it the Chiapas problem. How do you view this problem, and how do you view the peace process? [Zedillo] First, I believe that, as all Mexicans have, I must express my feelings regarding the regrettable social conditions behind this problem. Poverty, backwardness, lack of education, and lack of health services are all at the root of this problem. We must accept this first. We must recognize that these conditions exist in Chiapas and other parts of our country. We have a great responsibility as Mexicans to face these social conditions that are so regrettable. At the same time, with all due respect, with all frankness, I deplore the use of violence in the country under any circumstances. I believe that in the face of what has happened, it was very fortunate our Army acted to protect national security, sovereignty, and peace. At the same time, I am very satisfied the government of the republic immediately sought peaceful ways to resolve this conflict. In this regard, I want to take this opportunity to express my full support for the job the president of the republic and his government have done to achieve a peaceful solution in Chiapas. I support the government's decisions. I support each and every one of the steps it has taken through its representatives, especially the commissioner for peace, so we can soon attain an absolutely peaceful solution which can guarantee that we Mexicans will remain united. [Zabludovsky] Dr. Zedillo, returning to Mexico's problems, what are your plans for Mexicans' health? [Zedillo] The health problem is very important. Historically, in past decades, although Mexico has made great strides in extending its health care, we have to recognize that public health care is still insufficient. Even more serious, however, is that the health care system has not reached the country's poorest sectors. In the coming years, therefore, we must make an enormous effort to build more hospitals, increase the numbers of doctors and nurses, and guarantee that there will not be a single Mexican in this country who does not have access to this service. Of course, in the case of people who do not have access to social security, through the Mexican Social Security Institute and other institutions, we must ensure that the state's free medical service will take care of them. This is fundamental for humanitarian reasons. Nobody thinks there should be human suffering as a result of illness, or even death, as happens in many cases. Also, for economic reasons, we need better health in order to work better, produce more, earn higher incomes, and ensure income for all society. We must assume an enormous commitment to achieve better health for all Nexicans. [Zabludovsky] One of Mexico's main problems is the countryside, Dr. Zedillo. [Zedillo] I believe this is one of the state's most important areas of action. Approximately 28 percent of the country's total population, virtually 30 percent of Mexicans, live in rural areas. We have two types of problems. Please accept my simplification. On the one hand, we have an acute social problem in the countryside. The poorest of the poor live in the countryside. The greatest needs for education, health, housing, potable water, and electricity are precisely there in the countryside. But we also have a production problem. We have a situation where it has become increasingly difficult to have the Mexican countryside produce products demanded by the Mexican people for their sustenance. We must therefore attack problems in those two areas. We must have a very ambitious social policy to attack the root of that existing rural poverty. We must have a strategy to attack production problems. The answer, as I said earlier, is to invest in human beings, which is the most important thing. Also, with regard to production, I think we must act on several fronts. We must apply, with great justice, Article 27 of the Constitution and reform the laws. We must invest in infrastructure, in technical assistance for the countryside. We must invest in training for farmers, support them in developing the new marketing system, and make sure that they obtain timely and sufficient credit -- as they say now -- at competitive costs. If they are to compete abroad, we must make sure that we give them competitive conditions. A fundamental factor in the countryside is credit. We cannot expect farmers to compete with imported foodstuffs unless we make sure that they also have raw materials and elements obtained at competitive prices on the international market. I think it is a very important and complex task, but I am sure the transformation of the Mexican countryside can be achieved. With a strong social policy and with a coherent policy for increasing productivity in the countryside, we can help many million Mexicans living there to overcome conditions of extreme poverty that affect them. [Zabludovsky] Doctor, in your proposal, what is the role of small and medium-sized businesses? [Zedillo] Micro-, small-, and medium-sized businesses have always played a fundamental role in the economic life of the country. Some 52 percent of the jobs in Mexico are generated by these businesses. Some 98 percent of businesses in our country are either small or medium-sized. There are 1.3 million micro-, small-, and medium-sized businesses. Evidently, the state and society must pay close attention to small and medium-sized businesses. It is not a matter of paternalism. Those businessmen would be the first to reject turning the clock back. I have many friends who are small businessmen, who have assumed with great dignity their new responsibility in light of the new circumstances but who also asked that they not be left alone. We must promote small and medium-sized businesses. I believe there are very specific ways to achieve this. In the first place, the whole process must be made easier for them. All the red tape that encumbers small and medium businessmen must be eliminated. I am referring to the various regulations, including of course those related to taxes. In the second place, it is necessary to know that for these businesses to succeed, they need to be up-to-date technologically. I believe that given the number of those businesses, specific state action is required, without paternalism, so they become aware of the need to seek new technology. All opportunities must be provided for this modernization to take place. In the third place, I think it is very important for the state and businessmen to unite, making unprecedented efforts in Mexico's history to train the work force. In my opinion, this is one of the most significant challenges we face in the coming years. I believe this is possible because there is a great deal of experience in our country in this field. The problem is that the effort has not been widespread. In the fourth place, it is also very important to foster models for partnerships among these types of businesses. Therefore, sir, I realize there is a very serious problem with regard to the small-, micro-, and medium-sized businesses. I am also convinced, however, there are solutions, and if these are applied we can overcome the obstacles. This is very important for all Mexicans that this occur. [Zabludovsky] Doctor, what is democracy's role here? [Zedillo] As I said before, we cannot seek to progress in one area of the nation's development and lag behind in another. Democracy is one of the fundamental political principles of the Mexican nation. It has been around since our Constitutions were drawn up during the last century. Democracy started the Mexican revolution: the holding of elections without reelection. This political principle was clearly established in the 1917 Constitution, and therefore it is a principle that Mexicans must honor every day. I must admit that this is an incomplete process. Our democracy can still be more perfect; a great deal of progress still has to be made. Nevertheless, I have a great deal of faith that if we can sustain that momentum, that drive in the progress made in the past years, very shortly all Mexicans will be able to say: We live in a fully and absolutely democratic nation. I believe, sir, that progress in democracy is imperative to progress in the other sectors of the nation's life. [Zabludovsky] So then, as candidate for president, who does Ernesto Zedillo call on to do this? [Zedillo] I call on all Mexicans who are willing to work so that at the beginning of the 21st century Mexico can be a sovereign and united country, a country that lives in peace and progress, a country that has left way behind very serious problems of inequality and poverty, a fully democratic country, as I said earlier. I call on all Mexicans who want to work to build the country in which we all believe and about which we all dream to participate with me in this election. [Zabludovsky] What do you think of the other candidates? Do you think a debate would be useful? [Zedillo] As I said earlier, I have great respect for and hold in high esteem the other candidates for president. I agree with Colosio and the other candidates that a debate is necessary. It is necessary to present to the Mexican people not only the problems of which we are all aware but also the proposals for solving those problems. I want my proposals to face off against the proposals of the other candidates. The Mexican people should be given an opportunity to compare these proposals so that everyone can cast his vote freely on 21 August. And I expect the voters to cast their votes for me after they have compared the different proposals. As I said earlier, I have assumed this responsibility with determination, and I want to be president of the republic. [Zabludovsky] Dr. Zedillo, is Mexico's existing electoral system reliable? [Zedillo] My answer is yes. May I explain? First, in recent years, the Federal Congress or rather the Constituent Congress in the case of the Constitution -- or the Permanent Constituent Congress, as it is called, juridically speaking -- and the Federal Congress, in the case of Cofipe [Federal Code of Electoral Institutions and Procedures], has implemented a number of very important reforms. At least two basic facts can be pointed out in connection with these reforms: the existence of autonomous electoral institutions and the existence of an exemplary list of names, exemplary because of its outline, control, and verification characteristics. These reforms, which are very important, provide a much more trustworthy electoral system than the one we had up until a few years ago. In addition, I must point out that the proposals PRI has drafted in past years to reinforce this electoral system and the proposals of other parties have crystallized, through consensus, in decisions to improve the electoral system. I have to recall that, on 27 January, the candidates for president from eight political parties signed an agreement for peace, democracy, and justice. Based on this agreement, the parties reached a consensus to reform Article 41 of the Constitution. This reformed article will surely be translated now into action as additional reforms to Cofipe. This enables us to expect -- we truly desire it and I fully endorse all of these agreements, as well as any others that derive from the Cofipe reform -- that we will have a fully reliable electoral system for the coming elections. So my answer is yes, we will have pure elections by virtue of all the effort made in the past few years. [Zabludovsky] Speaking of political parties, how long have you been an active member of the PRI? [Zedillo] Formally, since 1971, when I started activities at the Institute for Political, Economic, and Social Studies with then deputy director Leopoldo Solis. From a family standpoint, I can say I have been a party member for a long, long time. I am the son of an active female member of [words indistinct], who became leader in my state, and a PRI political activist, who always took me by the hand to all her activities. So I can say that I have been a proud member of the PRI since very early in my life because of my mother's influence, and formally a member since 1971. [Zabludovsky] In light of the new laws, how do you view church-state relations, Dr. Zedillo? [Zedillo] This is a very complex matter. Of course, I endorse and support the amendments of Article 130 of the Constitution approved two or three years ago. At the same time, I would like to point out some aspects of Article 130 of the Constitution. The role of the state has been historically defined. The state must preserve and defend national sovereignty, encourage and enforce just laws, and look after the people's general well-being. In other words, the state's role is more on the material side. The church's role, on the other hand, has to do with the people's consciences and beliefs and therefore is on the spiritual side. Hence, it is very important to have a clear separation between the activities of the state and the church. This is a tradition and a concept with deep historical roots in our country. I would like to reiterate my support for the amendments of Article 130 of our Constitution, stressing the importance of maintaining the separation, not only in the Constitution, but through actions, between the church and the state. I believe this is very important for national coexistence. [Zabludovsky] I would like to make a pause between political and economic matters. Please tell us about the person named Ernesto Zedillo. [Zedillo, laughing] Well, I am a normal person. I come from a large family. My mother, who died when she was relatively young, was born in Irapuato, Guanajuato. My father was born here in Mexico City in the Morelos neighborhood, between Sastreria and San Antonio Tomatlan. He was born and raised in a house that still stands. My grandmother lived there until not too long ago. She died the day I was appointed general manager of the campaign. I have two brothers and three sisters. I have a family, as a man of my age normally does. My wife's name is Patricia. We have been married almost 20 years. We met when we were students at the Higher Economy School. Later on I became her teacher. She was a good student. We got married and now have five children: Ernesto, Emiliano, Carlos, Linda Patricia, and Rodrigo. We are a normal and loving family, very united, as are all Mexican families. [Zabludovsky] Did you say your mother passed away? [Zedillo] Yes, very young. [Zabludovsky] How old were you when she died? [Zedillo] I was 18 or 19. It was a hard blow. [Zabludovsky] Is the Morelos neighborhood north of La Merced? [Zedillo] Yes, the house is near the former penitentiary. It is still there. That is where I lived as a student in Mexico City, in the Morelos neighborhood. [Zabludovsky] Where else have you lived? [Zedillo, laughing] I have lived in many houses. The list would be too long. We lived in Mexicali when we arrived in Pueblo Nuevo, which is a very dear and traditional neighborhood. We then moved to the newest part of the city. When I arrived in Mexico City I lived with my grandparents for a while in the Morelos neighborhood, then I moved to Jardin Balbuena. I am now living in La Magdalena, Contreras, where you are welcome to visit any time. [Zabludovsky] Thank you. We gather from your biography that achieving the level of responsibility you have right now, considering your humble background, has undoubtedly required great tenacity. [Zedillo] It has required tenacity, effort, discipline, and enthusiasm. It would not be fair, however, to claim all the credit. I believe it is the result of my own effort as well as the efforts of many other people. This of course includes my parents, who contributed with their work and through their example, and my family, particularly my wife, and my children who have always encouraged me. I must also mention my teachers. I always acknowledge their role, as what I learned from my teachers means a lot to me, particularly from those in grade school, high school, and at all educational levels. I always remember them with special affection. I want to say something to those people with whom I have worked throughout my life and who have given me the opportunity to keep working and advancing in my career. I wrote this a long time ago in the introduction to my doctoral thesis. In the foreword of my thesis, I thank Mexicans because they pay the taxes that enable the government to open public schools, which I attended and 90 percent of Mexicans also attend. The resources from the National Council of Science and Technology [CONACYT] that sponsored my doctorate also belong to the Mexicans. Therefore, mine is not a personal endeavor; it is the result of the support of many people. [Zabludovsky] Did you always attend public schools? [Zedillo] Yes, except for my doctorate, for which I attended a private university. However, my doctoral degree was sponsored by CONACYT. [Zabludovsky] As the PRI candidate, what do you expect from the 21 August elections? [Zedillo] I expect these elections will be absolutely clean and will take place within a legal and peaceful framework. I also hope that they will be an exemplary civic event for us and future generations and that they result in a more united nation with increased confidence that will help us be a great nation. I hope, Mr. Zabludovsky, to win the coming elections because I reiterate: I want to be president of Mexico. [Zabludovsky] Have you resumed the campaign that was interrupted by Colosio's death? [Zedillo] We will be resuming it very soon. [Zabludovsky] Many thanks, Dr. Zedillo. Do you have anything else to add? [Zedillo] I only want to thank you and especially the viewers for this opportunity. [Zabludovsky] This was PRI presidential candidate Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon. Thank you. Good night.
