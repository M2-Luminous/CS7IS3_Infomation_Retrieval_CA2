Recently, this type of advertisement, which has no ties to the romantic ones that abound in times of crisis, proliferates in two new Cuban economic newspapers addressed to foreign readers. According to the monthly CONTACTOS magazine of the Cuban Chamber of Commerce and the weekly OPCIONES periodical, which began being published in Havana in January, the wanted partner must have funds to invest in the island or a market abroad where Cuban products can be sold. The request for partners comes from very diverse as well as unexpected prospects in a country that continues to declare itself Communist and that practically eliminated foreign investment since the victory of the revolution in January 1959. Such is the case because not only do small- and medium-sized firms advertise their interest in foreign partners but the most important government associations, oil refineries, sugar factories, textile firms, distilleries, and cement factories do so too. They are organizations that have been partially paralyzed since the fall of the Soviet Union and the divorce from Russia. Cuban authorities have established a list of 132 priority "investment opportunities," which they are proposing throughout the world in an effort to attract investors with a certain amount of incentives, mainly in the fiscal sector. Those proposals have not prompted great enthusiasm for the Cuban market of 11 million people up to now. However, they have prompted interest by certain businessmen, mainly Europeans, Latin Americans, and Canadians. According to members of the French National Council Foundation delegation that visited Cuba recently, there is no doubt that President Fidel Castro's regime is willing to open the economic system. Castro met with them for eight hours to confirm the "irreversible" character of the ongoing economic reforms. Communist leaders have asserted that "the Cuban economic opening is not a tactical or circumstantial response but a realistic strategy to permanently adapt the country to a new international economic scenario. Concerned that their bulky foreign debt could prompt difficulties, mainly with European countries, Cuban leaders have also asserted that "Cuba is willing to consider flexible renegotiation of its foreign debt, taking into account the creditors' interests." Parallel to this, the Castro government has created the International Commerce Bank and inaugurated an area for merchandise in transit that has many of the characteristics of a free zone. The number of mixed firms is still relatively small -- 112 in January 1994 -- but the number of foreign firms being established in Cuba -- 505 currently -- is increasingly rapidly. Out of the 112 mixed firms, 28 are in the tourism sector, which Cuban authorities present as the "salvation" of the economy and foreign specialists view as the most promising market in the entire Caribbean.
