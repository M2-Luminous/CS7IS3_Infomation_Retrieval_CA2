A spokesman announced here today that the commission will jointly build Xiamen University with the Xiamen Municipal Government. The university, which is located in the Xiamen Special Economic Zone facing the Taiwan Straits, was previously mainly financed by the central government. In the next four years beginning this year, the Xiamen Government will provide 10 million yuan each year to support the university, with the State Education Commission providing the rest. Another three universities and colleges jointly built by the State Education Commission and the local government are in Shanghai. They are Fudan University, Shanghai Communications University and Shanghai Foreign Languages College. The reform is the latest effort to ease the funding difficulty in universities. Teachers' salaries are expected to rise after the reform. The local governments will acquire part of the rights to run those universities.
