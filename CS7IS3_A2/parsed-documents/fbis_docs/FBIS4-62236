The common characteristic of this talk is that it is futile, and sometimes harmful. This is a matter of a state monopoly, and it should be in the hands of people vested with certain powers and, naturally, possessing high professional and civil qualities. This is essentially why broad discussion of the problem of arms exports is futile. Another issue connected with the excessive boom in information about this topic is directly harmful, since as a result our rivals, clients, and ill-wishers get the opportunity to take advantage of this information. I am no advocate of covering up the disgraceful phenomena that take place here (dubious deals, the misappropriation of proceeds, unscrupulousness on the part of the participants, and so forth). What I am talking about is excessive loquacity, and not about the negligence of certain individuals, but about the essence of our state interests. Because while we are throwing up our hands in horror, sighing, and lamenting we may lose the market once and for all without ever having learned to trade. And it is the sacred truth that we have never traded in arms, because we always supplied them on the basis of secret and non-secret talks between contracting parties' top people, often according to the principle: "Do you respect me, do you support my socialism?" And if you do respect me and support it, you can have a consignment of tanks or aircraft on a credit of around 30 or 40 years (until the final victory of communism on the planet). We garnered so much respect that nowadays many countries and regimes that respect us owe us several tens of billions of dollars which they are very unlikely to repay either today or in the future. It is now very difficult to name the annual sums that our state used to make in those days out of arms sales and it is even more difficult to determine where the money went. Especially as for a number of reasons this question interested few people then, and of those who were on top of it, "some are no longer with us, and others are far away." But the most important point was that this money was not spent on the reproduction of our industry, but frittered away in our struggle for a bright future on a world scale. Since the latter half of the eighties there have been a number of trends and phenomena in world arms exports which Russia must take into account if it is to avoid serious losses. The main trend of the "new era" is that the world arms market has begun to shrink both in real terms and in current prices. This stems from a number of political, economic, and strategic factors. The Cold War has ended (at present more in notional terms than in reality) and there has been progress in the sphere of cuts in conventional arms. The conversion of defense enterprises is under way (and not only in our country). Economic difficulties in the Third World countries -- our traditional partners in arms exports -- have worsened. UN sanctions have been tightened up, again mostly against our traditional and most solvent partners. Some importer-states now have their own military industry. Simultaneously with this factors tending in the opposite direction, namely directed toward increasing arms exports, have emerged and are beginning to operate. New "trouble spots" have emerged on the map of the world. The world community and its numerous agencies have proved unable to settle conflicts by political means. The structure of demand in the world arms market has changed, and the market is now more geared to purchasing modern and state-of-the-art models of military hardware. Countries which in the recent past were regarded as arms importers are attempting (with some success) to break into the arms market. Analysis of these two trends shows that, despite a reduction in the volumes of arms exports on the world market, the market will not vanish. Competition will sharpen, and the market will acquire a clear craving for state-of-the-art arms systems and technologies. These trends have affected Russia from two directions, but their tendency is the same -- willy-nilly to squeeze Russia out of the international market. The first is based on "purely Russian" factors which we encounter daily and hourly: the general mismanagement and laxity which parasitizes on shortcomings in the economic reform and the controllability of the state. Its essence is that overly large numbers of "experts" and "specialists" in the delicate matter of arms sales have appeared in Russia since the early nineties. On the most plausible pretexts (social protection, saving producers, and so forth) they are setting up state and "quasi-state" funds, organizations, and other parasitical structures (on the principle that every cockroach considers itself a homeowner). They have got their eyes on this "tasty morsel," are competing with each other to the detriment of our state, and are locked in covert and overt struggle against each other, with the result that clients are confused, the market is lost, and our country's prestige in the eyes of potential and actual partners declines. They view us as an unstable country, with all ensuing consequences. The answer to the eternal question "Who benefits by this?" is clear -- our competitors benefit, as do all these newfound parasitical structures and particular (but numerous) individuals who do not care about the country's interests. They want profits, offices, imported cars, foreign travel, and more profits. The aforementioned "purely Russian" features are certainly harmful, dangerous, and criminal. They must be stopped (rooted out) "by revolutionary means" -- I will not shrink from that expression. But there is another aspect which is just as dangerous -- dangerous in that in a few years we may find ourselves in a position where we not only have nothing to sell, we have nothing to defend ourselves with either should the need arise. I will be revealing no secret if I say that our military-industrial complex is in extremely profound crisis today. The roots of that crisis go back to the late eighties, but it has emerged most clearly since 1991-1992. The liberalization of prices emphatically changed the conditions of enterprises' economic activity, the main essence of which was the decline in demand for many types of output. Galloping inflation, the continuous rise in prices, and the ineffectiveness of the credit system led to insolvency on the part of the state and, of course, of enterprises. This was followed by a sharp decrease in the volume of production of both consumer goods (especially metal-intensive goods) and military output (equally metal-intensive), which resulted in a sharp decrease in metal consumption by our industry. I will cite just one example, that of aluminum. Aluminum production in Russia declined by only 8 percent from 1990 through 1993, while consumption declined by 50 percent, but exports from Russia more than tripled. The regions received sales quotas. But, lacking trade experience, they began to seek middlemen, often dubious ones; the latter in turn began to find insolvent and unscrupulous partners (see the analogy with arms sales?). The market was flooded with aluminum. As a result aluminum prices on the international market have almost halved ($1,950 per tonne in 1989, $1,000 per tonne in 1994). Thus less and less metal is being produced and consumed in our country, exports are increasing, and prices are falling. (This applies not only to aluminum but also to other raw material commodities.) It is easy to see that unless this process too is stopped, we will be forced to close our production capacities and to switch to exporting metals, energy sources, and other raw material resources. Who benefits by this? Not Russia, of course. By way of illustration I will tell you the value of certain goods in the international market. Reducing them to weight terms, 1 kg of a modern fighter is worth $3,000, 1 kg of a civilian aircraft is worth $1,000, 1 kg of electronics is worth $100, and 1 kg of metal shovels is worth $1 (the same as 1 kg of aluminum). It is easy to see that it is very profitable to sell modern fighters, like other military and civilian products. They embody the highest scientific potential, the most complex technologies, huge labor resources, and the best trained specialists. It is not only stupid but criminal to destroy and lose all this. On the other hand it is also unreasonable and unprofitable to support the military-industrial complex in its old form. Especially as the leaders of the military-industrial complex themselves not only are aware of but also understand the necessity of reform. Their only "shortcoming" is boundless faith in the strength of the state and its structures, where, though there has been talk of reasonable sufficiency in defense building and of the need for conversion, downsizing, and privatization, they have never answered the questions that are most important to producers: What to cut and by how much, which defense enterprises should be privatized, what to convert and how much, what arms does our Army need, what science and production infrastructure should be left for the future, how many production capacities should be modernized to produce promising weapons, and how many should be kept in reserve for a special period? You will agree that these are the tasks primarily of state organs, not of the "Red directors," who are having an increasingly hard time between the hammer and the anvil, namely, between silent state structures and uneasy labor collectives. The main shortcoming of state structures today is that there is no integrated concept for the reform of the military-industrial complex in the light of the country's real defense needs both today and in the future. The ministries and departments studying these problems (the Defense Ministry, the State Committee for the Defense Industry, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economics) are unable to resolve them alone. Gathered together, they defend departmental interests. There is no organ such as the Council of Ministers Military-Industrial Commission (which existed under the USSR). But there is a military-industrial complex that is flying off the rails, there are the remnants of our arms and strategically important raw materials flying abroad. Thus it is easy to see that where we should be engaging in reform, survival, and rescue there are no reformers and rescuers, but where there is something to sell there are swarms of them, and, along with the economic damage, this is leading us to moral degeneration: People are being torn away from productive labor, gradually turning into storekeepers to whom the state's interests mean nothing. And this is just as much of a danger as losing the military-industrial complex. What am I proposing should be done? First, in view of the creation of "Rosvooruzheniye," the state company for the export and import of arms and military equipment, all other organizations, structures, and funds must be debarred from the arms trade. Second, we must urgently adopt a legislative and legal basis regarding the arms trade, placing this process within the mainstream of state interests and under the state's control in such a way as to ensure that both amateurs and "professionals" at making easy money cannot pass through the legislative barriers and enter it. Third, we must elaborate a concept for the reform of the military-industrial complex which could be made up of a number of harmonized, coordinated, and interconnected state programs: an armaments program clearly defining our Army's real needs both today and for the future; a program of military-technical cooperation with foreign countries (especially with the CIS states) taking into account Russia's long-term interests and the potential and features of our traditional and potential partners; a program for the recycling and destruction of arms, military equipment, hardware, and ammunition that our Army does not need and that are unsuitable for the national economy and unacceptable for sale on the external arms market, tasking reserve production capacities with this, thereby also retaining the requisite number of them for a special period; a program for the conversion and reduction of science and production capacities or for tasking them with producing consumer goods on the basis of technologies as close as possible to military output. Fourth, on the basis of these state programs we must carry out a kind of inventory of all the science-and-production capacities of the military-industrial complex in strict accordance with the concept for its reform and in order to reach a decision and leave the necessary capacities, convert duplicate ones, allow surplus ones to be privatized, cut unnecessary ones, and provide work for reserve ones. Fifth, we must impose strict order in the sale of strategically important raw materials. I am convinced that if we carried out a total inspection of all deals regarding these materials since 1992 and returned all the financial proceeds to our country, the budget deficit would decrease substantially and the authority of state structures would increase. There are a few special areas. Reducing the number of different models and versions of military hardware and arms. No country in the world can stand diversity here (around 100 models and versions of combat aircraft in the air force alone). Add to that the plethora of types of ammunition, fuels and lubricants, and spares. And you get a really mind-boggling picture. There is a need for the strictest standardization. The time has also come to preclude the duplication that is all too rife in scientific development work too. There is a need for measures to shorten the time between projects on paper and their actual implementation, maybe even via the sale of these projects or developed prototypes to long-term and reliable partners. The proceeds could be used to develop and introduce new arms systems for our own use.... The successful solution of these most important state problems, in my view, involves a switch from reasonable sufficiency to the principles of sufficient reasonableness, and not only in defense building but also in other spheres. The aforementioned directions are largely organizational and do not require much material investment. They will take time, the desire, responsibility, and resolve. And they will bring savings and profitability. But, of course, before that and during the transitional period the profound reform of the military-industrial complex and its upkeep will require considerable funds. The state lacks these. Therefore there is no point in waiting for something to turn up. There is a great deal of talk at the moment about creating financial and industrial groups in the defense complex. This has its supporters and its opponents. I don't want to be the repository of ultimate truth, but I must say that, despite a number of shortcomings with respect to authorization to set them up, these are a kind of lifebelt for the military-industrial complex. And the potential shortcomings can be balanced and eliminated via organization and monitoring on the part of, once again, state structures and their organs without leaving everything to the hapless producers and all kinds of financial entities -- especially those with a dubious reputation -- that are dying to get their hands on them. We need a plan, we need conditions, there must be a mechanism based primarily on state interests. For instance, we need a strict tender imposing certain requirements on banks wishing to be founders of financial and industrial groups. On the other hand, we also need state aid to these financial and industrial groups: to some in the form of subsidies, to others in the form of exemption from certain types of taxes, at least initially. But at any rate the process must be regulated and controlled by the state. Because if the state leaves this to the mercy of fate, there are grounds for believing that these financial and industrial groups will abandon the state. And this too is not in Russia's interests.
