This could happen only in Russia: The new constitution, a bombastic panegyric in its honor, and two edicts which totally contradict it and cancel out the contents of several articles of the constitution at once are published on one and the same page in the government newspaper. One of the edicts is entitled "On Guarantees of Local Self-Management in the Russian Federation," but it would be more accurate to call it "On the Elimination of Local Self-Management in the Russian Federation," for it virtually eliminates the rights of local self-management. Elections to organs of local self-management are scheduled at the suggestion of the superior administration head, who also decides on the election procedure. Local administration officials are permitted to combine their post with work on the representative organ, and the administration head is also permitted to chair its sessions. If such a perfectly "tame" representative organ turns obstinate for some reason, this does not matter -- the administration head himself has the right to put the statute on local self-management to a referendum. Here is a very eloquent detail, albeit, of course, not the most important one: It is not the soviet but the self-same local administration head who now gives his consent to a people's deputy's discharge from work, to his exclusion from a collective farm, cooperative, or educational institution, and also to his transfer to lower-paid work. Know, deputy, who is master of the house! How familiar all this is: the same ploys, the same tricks. Only they have been switched from the all-Russia level to the local level. And there is the same total disrespect for the law and the constitution. Please forgive my juridical tediousness, but I will indicate specific articles: This edict violates Article 10 (separation of powers), Articles 15 and 76 (supremacy of the constitution and laws), Articles 85 and 90 (president's competence), and also Chapter 8 (local self-management) of the new constitution which has just been announced. Since the edict came into force the moment it was signed, not the moment it was published, it also violates universally recognized human and civil rights enshrined both in the Constitution (Article 15) and in international treaties. The second edict, which exempts from value-added tax the turnover from sales of precious metals and precious stones, is also equally unconstitutional. According to Yeltsin's constitution (Articles 71, 76, and 104), such decisions have to be drawn up in law and can be adopted only after a government conclusion. Under the constitution the approval "retroactively" of presidential edicts is permitted in just two cases: on the introduction of martial law and a state of emergency. Does this mean that a state of emergency has been secretly introduced in the country? I have touched on just two edicts, remarkable for being published simultaneously with the new constitution. But the same can also be said of many other documents from the president's desk: on accelerating agrarian reform, on approving the program for the privatization of the mass media, on approving the new coat of arms, on eliminating the Ministry of Security.... The authority to adopt them was exceeded in every case, and they do not conform with either the former or the new constitution. If anyone had any illusions that law and order would finally be established in the country with the adoption of the new constitution, he will, alas, have to abandon them. The fresh-baked constitution has been violated by its very creators from the very first day. To fanfares and toasts in its honor the country is continuing to sink into a quagmire of arbitrary rule and lawlessness. Figures Do Not Balance Again I have before me three newspapers from Stavropol Kray: STAVROPOLSKAYA PRAVDA for 17 December, the same newspaper for 22 December, and STAVROPOLSKIYE GUBERNSKIYE VEDOMOSTI for 18 December. All three publish the results of the elections and the referendum in Stavropol Kray, and they are different in all three! The list of voters is different, and the number of voting papers handed out does not coincide. How could this happen, if the same voters voted and all four voting papers were issued simultaneously? This is called a "pitchfork." By tying the vote on the constitution in with the elections, the organizers of the referendum did, of course, secure a considerable number of additional votes. But they underestimated the fact that in such complex voting it is very difficult to "tidy up the loose ends." Whereas the referendum was held practically without control, the candidates' results were closely observed by their numerous agents. This was why it took so long for the voting results to reach Moscow in dribs and drabs. Of course, the question of the results of the voting in the deputies' elections and the referendum on the new constitution will be raised both in the press and at sessions of the State Duma. It would also be not at all out of place for the Russian Federation Prosecutor's Office, which stands guard over the law, to institute criminal proceedings in respect of the aforesaid facts. On the threshold of an unpleasant discussion on this subject the presidential press unobtrusively hints that if the results of the referendum on the new constitution are canceled, the president in turn will cancel the results of the elections to the Federal Assembly. Either the Constitution imposed by means of a deception or presidential rule not limited by any laws -- this is the poor choice offered Russians today by the "Russia's Choice" limited partnership. There Will Be a Black Obelisk But what about the international observers? Why did several hundred very experienced politicians, gathered from all over the world, assure the country and the whole world that the elections in Russia were held according to the highest standards of democracy? This was despite the fact that the elections were preceded by the shooting up of parliament and the introduction of a state of emergency (during which it is forbidden by law to hold elections). The elections were held not according to the law but according to a statute which was adopted personally by the president and was changed repeatedly in the course of the elections. A number of public organizations were banned illegally, by presidential edict, on the eve of the elections. An entire section of the political spectrum -- movements of a national-patriotic orientation -- was criminally cut off. The opposition press was blocked for practically the whole duration of the election campaign. The government made attempts to exert crude pressure on electoral associations and individual candidates (a ban on campaigning against the constitution, the institution of criminal proceedings). Despite the fact that foreign observers responded to the question "Would you like such elections to be held in your country?" by opening their eyes wide and starting to wave their hands in horror. Despite all this, the elections and the referendum in Russia were acknowledged a model of democracy. Congratulations poured in from all over the world.... There can only be one rational explanation for all this. To all appearances, the West has decided firmly to categorize Russia among the countries to which panhuman notions of legality and a rule-of-law state cannot apply: "What can you expect from them -- they are savages!" Thank you. We have probably deserved this. But do not take it amiss if a tablet is set up in the Russian parliament at some time inscribed with the names of those foreign statesmen who approved of the shooting up of the Supreme Soviet and applauded the shameful machinations over the new Russian Constitution. To remind your descendants and ours. [passage omitted]
