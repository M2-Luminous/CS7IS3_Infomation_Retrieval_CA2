The Nagorno-Karabakh Republic Defense Army Press Service reported that heavy fighting continued on the north and northeast fronts on the evening of 3 January. After losing one tank, one infantry fighting vehicle, and 90 soldiers and officers, the enemy retreated to its initial positions. Five fighters were killed and 13 wounded on the Karabakh side. The fighting has continued in these sectors since this morning. The same source says Azerbaijani soldiers frequently surrender. Four gave themselves up on 3 January alone and 14 have surrendered over the past three weeks. They confessed to being forced to fight fearing execution by the so-called deterrent detachments, which stay behind the Army formations. According to the prisoners, the deterrent detachments are basically formed of Afghan mojahedin because the Azerbaijanis themselves refuse to fire on their own soldiers. Friends, for many days now we have been unable--through no fault of our own--to report on the situation in the border regions of the Republic. Telephone links have been disrupted preventing us from receiving reports from the Defense Ministry's press service.
