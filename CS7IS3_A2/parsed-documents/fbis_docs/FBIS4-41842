Mayor of St. Petersburg Anatoliy Sobchak told the first plenary session of the Commission on Tuesday that he viewed this measure as an attempt to solve a social problem by violating the Civic Accord Agreement. Sobchak was supported by President of the Russian Union of Manufacturers and Entrepreneurs Arkadiy Volskiy, who proposed that the Commission condemn Shumeyko's statement. Volskiy said that Shumeyko's proposal had given rise to the movement for recalling the deputies. Vice-Chairman of the Federation Council Ramazan Abdulatipov opposes all statements of condemnation because, he said, this means a roll-back to the times when the Communist Party "condemned all kinds of dissidence." His position was supported by chief of the president's staff Sergey Filatov. However, Filatov backed the proposal by representative of the Liberal-Democratic Party Vishnyakov, who condemned Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev's phrase about the opponents of Russia's participation in NATO's Partnership for Peace program. In a TV interview Kozyrev described them as "red-brown political bastards". On Filatov's initiative, the Conciliatory Commission instructed Academician Vladimir Kondratyev to draft a statement on unparliamentary expressions. "If we are to appease society, we must choose expressions which do not discredit state leaders," said Filatov. The president's aid Georgiy Satarov told Interfax that formally Shumeyko's proposal did not contradict the Civic Accord Agreement. This document says that early elections unstipulated in the Constitution are inadmissible. "In this particular case, the extension of powers after the expiration of the term is meant," said Satarov. "Theoretically, such a possibility cannot be excluded, but one must seriously assess whether or not to make such a step," he said. Whatever the circumstances, the final decision is to be taken by the electors, who must state their opinion in a referendum, said Satarov.
