Liang Lifeng, on behalf of the Guangdong Committee of the China Democratic League, made a speech at the meeting pointing out that although Guangdong had made great achievements in agricultural reform, it had not fundamentally changed instability in agriculture's position, instability in agricultural production, and instability in the peasants' minds. A sharp decrease in farmlands and a rapid increase in the population are Guangdong's important characteristics upon entering the 1990's. In 1992, the net decrease in the province's farmlands amounted to 1.1423 million mu, equivalent to the area of a medium-sized county; whereas in the first three years of the 1990's, the population increased by 1.6667 million annually, equivalent to the populations of two medium-sized counties. In 1992, the province's per capita possession of farmland was 0.56 mu, 74 percent of the amount in the previous 10 years. Facing this grim situation, a provincial meeting on protecting farmlands held at the end of last year clarified that farmland in the province should be increased instead of being reduced. On this point, Liang Lifeng suggested formulating a policy to actively support and encourage the work of restoring and expanding farmland, adding that certain percentages of the taxes and charges collected by land management departments from renting out and transferring farmland should be used for restoring and expanding farmland. Last year's decrease in Guangdong's grain production was the third decrease, subsequent to 1991 and 1992. It was also the second major decrease since the founding of the PRC (the first happened in 1985). It is true that to a certain degree, natural disasters caused this major decrease, but a more important factor was the reduction in the acreage of farmland. An authoritative person said that Guangdong should have at least 50 million mu of land planted to grain, but last year Guangdong's grain acreage had fallen below the critical line, to stand at 48 million mu. The cost of growing grain is high, 50 kg for 47 yuan; but the selling price is low, 50 kg for 42 to 55 yuan. So the peasants are far from being able to get average profits from social production. "Low grain prices have hurt the peasants" and have caused their initiative in grain production to drop. Liang Lifeng appealed by saying: First, investment in agriculture, which is a "weak industry," should be increased. Last year, Guangdong's agricultural investment accounted for only 7.27 percent of its financial expenditure, a decrease of 5.81 percent in comparison with 1980. The percentage of agricultural investment in financial expenditure should be raised to 10 to 12 percent. Second, grain protection prices should be raised; the grain protection price of 50 kg for 70 yuan, which has been fixed by the provincial government, should be observed. Third, agricultural loans should be ensured so that they are used for grain and other agricultural production. Fourth, it is necessary to develop economies of scale.
