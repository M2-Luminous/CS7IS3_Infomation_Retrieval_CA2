The French Constitution did not make it possible for de Gaulle to be elected directly by the citizens, and he thus proposed, acting in contravention of the Constitution, that he be granted this right in a referendum. Otherwise, he would step down. He was accorded this right in a referendum and this [the direct election of the French president] is still valid. This means that a referendum can go beyond the constitutional framework and that even questions can be asked in it that are not quite in conformity with the Constitution. This is the case because a referendum is the most democratic form of expression. The conclusions of an all-popular vote are generally valid and respected everywhere, and, because this referendum [initiated by the HZDS] is the first ever in this state, it deserves support and not to make voters disgusted.
