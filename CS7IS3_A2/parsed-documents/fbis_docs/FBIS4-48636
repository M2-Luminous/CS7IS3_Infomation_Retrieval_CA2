FBIS4-48636 "drafr100_c_94007" FBIS-AFR-94-100 Daily Report 23 May 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Cabinet Plays Down Political Differences Cabinet Plays Down Political Differences MB2305173294 Johannesburg SAPA in English 1656 GMT 23 May 94 MB2305173294 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [By Patrick Bulger] [Text] Cape Town May 23 SAPA -- The cabinet on Monday played down political differences arising from the KwaZulu land transfer, presenting a united front on the day before President Nelson Mandela's historic address to South Africa's first all-race Parliament. Meeting at Tuynhuys from about 11AM until well into the evening, the cabinet did not allow the land transfer issue to develop into a controversy that could detract from Mr Mandela's address. A statement issued by Deputy Presidents Thabo Mbeki and F W de Klerk said cabinet approached the discussion "with a view to reaching a consensus that will contribute to the process of nation-building and reconciliation". The statement said all the parties reaffirmed their commitment to such an approach. A cabinet committee was formed comprising Land Affairs Minister Derek Hanekom and Ministers Kader Asmal, Roelf Meyer and Ben Ngubane. Both Mr Meyer and Dr Ngubane were central to the constitutional negotiations process which formed the political background to the passage of the Ingonyama [King's] Trust Act. The legislation ceded 1.2 million hectares of communal land to Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini. The committee will report on the background and reasons for the establishment of the trust, examine and report on the implications of the act and make recommendations to the cabinet. It will pay attention to security of tenure of residents in the prescribed area, the functioning of a land claims court should disputes arise, and the impact on a future land reform programme. The land issue was discussed in cabinet following a meeting between President Mandela and Home Affairs Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi. After the meeting, Chief Buthelezi denied that the land transfer had anything to do with securing his Inkatha Freedom Party's participation in the elections in April. However, the issue was resolved in less than two hours as cabinet members turned their attention to Tuesday's opening of Parliament and in particular Mr Mandela's speech to the nation. Mr Mandela's speech is expected to set out his vision of how the government of national unity will address South Africa's political and socio-economic challenges in its five years of existence. Mr Mandela will speak after a ceremonial drive through central Cape Town along streets lined with troops. There will be a flypast and a 21-gun salute as he takes the salute from the guard of honour. Parliamentary staff were making last-minute preparations for the opening and getting the historic house of Parliament into shape for the event. Cabinet colleagues apparently discussed aspects of Mr Mandela's speech at length and made inputs. Mr Mandela's staff were not giving away many clues, but he is expected to once again stress the importance of reconciliation. "Reconciliation is important where there is a lot of uncertainty," said a source close to the president's office. "Our approach in general terms is that reconciliation and social upliftment go together. We can never have true reconciliation if the conditions of the people remain the same." The source said Mr Mandela's speech would deal with the main themes of the Reconstruction and Development Programme. Mr Mandela would point to the need to make certain immediate changes. These could involve the education system and a job creation programme. Mr Mandela will also be seeking to reassure potential foreign investors that strict fiscal discipline will be maintained in the government's approach to reconstruction and development.
