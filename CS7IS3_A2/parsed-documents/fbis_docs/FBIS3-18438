Hesse Environment Minister Joschka Fischer (Greens) had previously announced in the afternoon that he would order the Rheinisch-Westfaelisches Electrizitaetswerk (RWE) operating company temporarily to close the nuclear plant, which was put into service in 1974. In the morning, Fischer had obtained the support of the red-green land government. The Hesse supervisory authorities have serious doubts about the plant's safety, since RWE did not put additional safety equipment into Biblis A within the three-year period, as ordered by former Hesse Environment Minister Karlheinz Weimar (CDU) in 1992, and meanwhile has filed a complaint against this order. Biblis A is the oldest reactor in all of Germany with a capacity of more than 1,000 megawatts. The reactor is currently switched off for routine checks and, according to RWE plans, it is to be put into operation again next Tuesday. If Hesse gets its way, this would be the first time that a German land closed down a nuclear power plant for an extended period against the will of the operating company because of a marked need for equipment on several counts. RWE would then have to undertake major reconstruction work before the plant is put into service again -- among other things, for improved fire protection and an earthquake-safe cooling system. Toepfer also thinks this equipment is necessary "within an appropriate period," but he no longer gives a definite deadline. According to the Bonn order, Fischer is now forced to keep still -- for the time being -- until a "federal supervisory talk" at civil servant level takes place on Thursday.
