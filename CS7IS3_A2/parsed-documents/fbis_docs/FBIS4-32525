Radio Velkaton, based in Velika Kladusa, the centre of the Muslim autonomous province of West Bosnia (APZB), reported on Sunday that troops loyal to fundamentalist leader Alija Izetbegovic were not chosing means in an effort to enter the territory held by APZB forces. According to the same source, there are dead, wounded and captured on both sides. Radio Bihac, held by Izetbegovic's supporters, said that forces loyal to APZB President Fikret Abdic unsuccessfully attempted a number of infantry breakthroughs on the night of June 25-26 and Sunday morning. The APZB was proclaimed in 1993 on the basis of the outcome of a referendum held in the Cazin Krajina, which is predominantlx populated by Muslims. Shortly after, President Abdic, a successful local businessman, signed peace accords with the Bosnian Serbs and Croats. There followed an outbreak of fighting between APZB troops and troops loyal to Izetbegovic. Several hundred people have been killed in the inter-Muslim fighting.
