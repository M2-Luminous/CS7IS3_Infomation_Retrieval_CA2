The economic exchange between Budapest and Warsaw dropped drastically after the dissolution of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance. Last year, our economic exchange amounted to only $330 million. [begin recording] [Andrzej Olechowski] We have two projects in common that will have a symbolic significance for our links and will give them additional strength. One of them is our joint application for full membership in the European Union; the Hungarians will do this as early as 1 April, and we will follow soon afterwards. The other thing is Partnership for Peace. [Waldemar Pawlak] We have talked about the idea put forward by us in Prague: Partnership for Development. We should seek cooperation as partners within this region, so that cooperation between our countries can make use of both the human potential, the potential of friendship, and the potential of our economies. [end recording] [Reporter] Tomorrow the Hungarian president will visit Poznan.
