He praised, above all, the security forces, who worked around the clock, but also the Kurdish families, who did not let themselves be instigated by agitators. However, one cannot give the all-clear regarding the terror of the Workers Party of Kurdistan (PKK), he said in Bonn. The challenge continues. The minister affirmed that all proceedings of criminal and aliens' law against PKK members who committed acts of violence are to be concluded as quickly as possible. A deportation agreement with Turkey, which guarantees that those deported will not receive a death sentence, is as necessary as the determined enforcement of the PKK ban in Germany.
