Was it in 1783 when the Crimea was annexed by the Russian Empire or in 1954 when the devastated peninsula, lacking a national affiliation, was handed over to Ukraine, which played the role of an intensive care unit? Or, was it in 1991 when Ukraine permitted the referendum and then acknowledged Crimean autonomy thus planting a time bomb? What is the underlying cause of the Crimean problem, how should it be resolved, and what consequences can it produce -- these were the central questions asked at a press conference called by the group of strategic researchers, "Young Europeans for Security," (the Institute of Strategic Research), the Mejlis of the Crimean Tatars, and the "Reforms" Ukrainian Supreme Council deputies' group. In the opinion of Refat Chubarov, leader of the Kurultay faction at the Crimean Supreme Soviet, the Crimean problem emerged when it was separated from the problem of the Crimean Tatars. This is why it needs to be resolved based on these people. Chubarov believes that this is possible when three conditions are met: the legal basis, money, and stability at the Crimean peninsula. Only, how can it be achieved? By turning a blind eye on illegal actions of the Crimean parliament and accepting relations between Ukraine and its integral part on a treaty basis? Politicians advocating this option make a mistake. There is no guarantee that in half a year, those treaties will not be unilaterally broken. Chubarov cited a draft appeal by the majority in the Crimean parliament to the Russian State Duma that said: "The Crimean Supreme Soviet counts on decisive actions taken along with the State Duma regarding the final determination of the Crimea's status as part of Russian Federation." Obviously, the far-reaching plans of the present Crimean parliament cannot be changed even by an agreement between Ukraine and Russia on the Black Sea Fleet (if one is possible any time soon). In this situation, the Ukrainian Supreme Council ought to assume full powers and responsibility for resolving the conflict. As for practical implementation of decisions by the Ukrainian parliament, the Crimean people, perhaps the most powerful force in the Crimea upholding the Ukrainian interests, is willing to handle this issue. "The Crimea's native people must be returned to their homeland, and they will decide about the future of the peninsula," Mustafa Dzemilev, head of the Crimean Mejlis, stated at a press conference. But of 492 billion karbovanets [K] in capital investment and the K197 billion allocated from the Ukrainian budget, Crimean Tatars have so far received only K100 billion. This makes Turkey's assistance in financing and building 1,000 apartments even more valuable and timely. However, may be for the first time ever, the problem was raised at the press conference of Ukraine's weakening control over the Crimean economy and on privatization, in particular. In the words of Vyacheslav Shved, an expert from the strategic research group, Russian capital intensified its influence in the region. For example, Russian corporations "Twentieth Century," "Arbat-Moscow," "Alpha Capital," and others surprisingly quickly buy out Crimean assets, capturing 10 to 15 percent of all sanatoriums. By the end of 1994, according to Meshkov's edict, it is planned to privatize 19 enterprises key for the Crimean economy, including ports. There is no guarantee that this Ukrainian property, too, will not change its "citizenship." The most regrettable thing is, as deputy Viktor Pynzenyk, leader of the "Reforms" legislative group, noted, that although it was an illegal action, Meshkov was right signing this and other edicts concerning taxes, currency regulation, and the banking system. Ukraine has no laws that would provide enterprises with free access to currency and credits and that would not hinder privatization. The Crimeans very deftly shifted emphasis from economy to politics, covering at the same time their tails by progressive, if not perfect, reforms. So, it is obvious that the Crimean problem was caused by many reasons and has many solutions. Yet another one was proposed by Ukrainian President L. Kravchuk during a meeting at the Ukrainian Supreme Council: one should straighten out relations with Russia. The most important thing is not to miss the chance, even though they say "hurry without haste." But does it really have to be that way in all our history?
