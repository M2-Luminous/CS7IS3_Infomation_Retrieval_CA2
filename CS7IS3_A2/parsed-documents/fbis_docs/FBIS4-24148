There were few big surprises and as expected the emphasis was on social spending for education, housing, and welfare, as well as tax incentives for businesses. But with its proposals for a [words indistinct] wealth's tax, some have called it a Robin Hood budget -- taking from the rich to help the poor. Carol Williams spoke to Neil Coleman from COSATU, the Congress of South African Trade Unions, and asked him for the union's reaction to the budget. [Begin recording] [Coleman] Well, you know, we are still studying it and looking at the full implications of the budget, but our initial response would be that it is a budget which lays the basis for the implementation of the Reconstruction and Development Program which COSATU and the trade unions were a very important part of designing. However, we have to recognize the fact that we are inheriting an apartheid bureaucracy and monetary amounts don't necessarily mean delivery. So, what we are already looking at are processes which will result in the restructuring of the public sector and ensure that the money in the budget actually results in delivery to the poorest communities which actually need the services. [Williams] You mentioned that you quietly welcomed the budget, but there have been reports in some ANC grass roots circles that they are disappointed, that this budget (?isn't enough) to actually [words indistinct] apartheid. [Coleman] What we are saying [words indistinct] to a tax system is that you have a 5 percent levy which is going to pay for the transition costs, but on the other hand there are certain areas which we believe could have been addressed better. For example, spending on defense has gone up from 9.3 billion to 10.6 billion [rand] and we don't believe that in a time of peace in which we are reconstructing our country that we can justify spending such a high amount on defense. We are calling for the government to engage in an urgent defense review. So, there are weaknesses in the budget, but for us the critical question is to make this bureaucracy, which is attempting to implement a reconstruction budget, to make that bureaucracy much, much more accountable and receptive to the needs of the public. [Williams] And just how can the trade unions actually do that? [Coleman] Well, I think we can do that in a number of ways. For a start, the problem that we are facing at the moment is that we have inherited a public service which is extremely stratified. At the bottom you have workers who are actually delivering the services, being paid poverty wages, while the bureaucrats who are delivering very little at all are getting paid fairly high wages. We want to look as a trade union movement at (?flexing) the hierarchies to ensure that the service delivered are actually remunerated fairly. We also want to ensure that we are part of the processes of restructuring those departments and making them more accountable to the public. [Williams] I know COSATU and your trade unions have been very closely aligned to the ANC and also very instrumental in setting up its reconstruction program. Yet, this budget is a very, very business, corporate friendly budget. Do you think this is in any way going to affect your relationship with the present government? [Coleman] Well, we are not against a budget which encourages investment, encourages business, but the question is at the end of the day for us to ensure that the business activity and the economic activity benefits everyone in the country and not just a privileged few. That is why, as I said, we would have liked to have seen much more emphasis on incentives to companies to create jobs, to engage in training, and in productive investment so that there would be some areas where we think too many concessions have been made. But on a whole it's quite a move away from the old apartheid South Africa where the only presence in the budget were the white minority and the business community. Here, clearly you have got the stamp of the majority beginning to imprint itself on the programs of government. [end recording]
