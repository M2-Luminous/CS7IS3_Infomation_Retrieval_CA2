The five new facilities would have a combined power generation capacity of 1.57 million kilowatts, according to government officials. Construction of the nuclear power generator would be the first such project allowed in six years. The Electric Power Development Coordination Council presented the recommendations to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. With the recommendation, the government will initiate legal procedures to implement the five projects by the end of month, the officials said. The newly planned nuclear power generator is to be the third at Tohoku Electric Power Co.'s Megawa Nuclear Power Plant in Miyagi Prefecture. Construction of the nuclear generator, set to have an output capacity of 825,000 kilowatts, is expected to be completed in March 2002. The other four facilities include one using heat recycled from an incinerator at Takahama Electric Power Plant in Gunma Prefecture, a hydroelectric power plant in Hyogo Prefecture, another hydroelectric plant in Tottori Prefecture, and a thermoelectric station on an island off Niigata Prefecture. These latest projects bring the total implemented by Japan in fiscal 1993 to 19 new electric power facilities -- seven hydroelectric, 11 thermoelectric, and one nuclear generator. The total generation capacity of the 19 facilities will come to 4.45 million kilowatts, the officials said.
