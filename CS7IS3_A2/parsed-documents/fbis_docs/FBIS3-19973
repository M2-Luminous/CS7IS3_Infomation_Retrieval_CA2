While these acts may achieve welcome effects for the media, they by no means bring about the solidarity the Kurds want, the association said in Bonn on Wednesday [23 March]. KOMKAR is not associated with the Workers Party of Kurdistan (PKK), which has been banned in Germany. However, the association spoke out against deporting the perpetrators to Turkey: They would fall "directly into the hands of the torturers and executioners."
