In statements to the Egyptian daily AL-AHRAM published [words indistinct] that considering that their families will accompany them, a total of 30,000 Palestinians will enter Gaza and Jericho within a week. Most of these, he noted, belong to the refugees who were displaced in 1948. Together with them will also enter the entire political Palestinian leadership [passage indistinct] to look into the return of the persons displaced in 1967. Sha'th emphasized that the presence of a national authority inside will lead to the institution of some symbols of sovereignty like measures related to economic development. He indicated that the donor countries that have decided to contribute financial grants toward the development of Gaza and Jericho are waiting for the signing of the accord and the installation of the Palestinian authority. Economic development and water, he said, will be the most pressing issues for the Palestinian authority. If a solution is not found to the water issue, there will be a retrenchment in the agricultural sector. We will rely more heavily on pollution free modern technology, tourism, and trade, said Sha'th.
