Hangzhou's Wanxiang Group has decided to appropriate 100,000 yuan for soliciting "westward-bound" strategic plans from across the country. According to the enterprise group's "westward-bound plan," it will invest 100 million yuan in developing markets in central and western China. Before this, hundreds of Zhejiang's town and village enterprises had already established enterprises in central and western China. Xiaoshan City's Hangmin Industrial Corporation, in the richest village in Zhejiang, has invested 20 million yuan in the last two years to establish a few textile dyeing factories in Henan's Zhengzhou and other localities. The corporation's president, Zhu Chongqing, said gaining a foothold in the central and western parts of the country had expanded his company's markets and added new assets to the company. The sales of industrial products of Zhejiang's approximately 700,000 town and village enterprises total 240 billion yuan annually, accounting for two thirds of the province's total industrial sales and 11 percent of the total sales of the country's town and village enterprises. The province also has more than 280 large enterprises, each of whose annual output value exceeds 100 million yuan and whose annual exports exceeds 30 million yuan. An official of the Zhejiang Provincial Bureau of Town and Village Enterprises said: Due to lack of energy and raw and processed materials in the province, local enterprises are unable to get necessary resources locally. Moreover, because the major products of local town and village enterprises are daily consumer products, inland markets have become increasingly important to us. According to a survey report, the petroleum, coal, steel products, cotton, and other important materials currently needed by Zhejiang's town and village enterprises' production are primarily supplied from the central and western parts of the country. And, at least more than 100 billion yuan of the province's annual sales of industrial products comes from central and western China. Since the state called for promoting economic and technological cooperation and exchange in 1993 in an organized and planned manner between the eastern and western parts of the country, some farsighted town and village entrepreneurs of Zhejiang have begun to set their eyes on gaining a foothold in the central and western regions of the country, deciding to develop cooperation with these regions to seek common prosperity. The Zhejiang Provincial CPC Committee and government have fully approved such moves by local town and village enterprises, and quickly set up a leading group for coordinating cooperation between local town and village enterprises and regions west of the province, to ensure that local town and village enterprises gain a foothold in these regions. So far, the group has proposed to local town and village enterprises nearly 100 cooperation projects with Xinjiang, Henan, and other localities. Cooperation on many of these projects has begun. Zhejiang's town and village enterprises have entered the central and western regions using three major approaches: The first approach is by way of contracting or leasing, that is, Zhejiang's town and village enterprises contract or lease loss-making enterprises in central and western China and then use their more skillful management to improve these enterprises' economic performance. So far, at least more than 100 town and village entrepreneurs from Zhejiang have settled down in central and western China. After contracting to run a state-owned Chinese medicine factory in Shanxi's Taiyuan, a peasant entrepreneur from Zhejiang's Wenzhou boldly adopted new management mechanisms to run the factory, enabling the debt-ridden "long-established" enterprise to regain vitality before long. The second approach is by way of joint business operations, that is, Zhejiang's town and village enterprises, making use of their better technology and management expertise and the rich resources and lower wages in central and western regions, establish new enterprises in these regions and sell their products locally. The Shijia Sports Wear Company in Zhejiang's Cixi established a factory in this way in northern Anhui. The third approach is by way of establishing energy and raw and processed materials bases and sales outlets in central and western China. For instance, more than 20 town and village enterprises in Zhejiang's Huzhou have established energy bases in Shanxi -- a major energy-producing province -- and assisted local enterprises to improve storage, transportation, and processing equipment. Realizing that the country's western region borders some Central Asian nations, many town and village enterprises in Huzhou have jointly established trading companies with enterprises of the region, enabling them to use border port cities as their "jumping boards" for entering Central Asian and European markets. The Bosaidong Garment Company in Huzhou's Zhenxi Township was a little- known enterprise; but, since it set up a few "trade windows" in Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang last year, its products have quickly entered East European countries, enabling the company's per capita tax payment and profit to reach 10,000 yuan last year. Zhejiang's town and village entrepreneurs who have established enterprises in the central and western parts of the country said their opening up markets in central and western China was an economic move based on market demand and prompted by mutual economic benefits and that the purpose was to enable the eastern and western parts of the country to enjoy common prosperity through reaping common economic benefits.
