FBIS TRENDS-06MAY94-JAPAN-U.S. Agriculture Ministry Moves To Limit Rice Imports Agriculture Ministry Moves To Limit Rice Imports SUMMARY In an apparent effort to limit the amount of rice imported into Japan and keep rice prices high, Japan's Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) seems to be taking steps to restrict competition in the country's rice trade, including limiting the number of companies that can trade in imported rice and cracking down on growing imports of rice through the international mail. MAFF may try to use similar tactics to limit rice imports after Japan formally opens its rice market in 1995. END SUMMARY Recent Japanese press reports suggest that MAFF is attempting to restrict both competition in the rice trade and the quantity of rice that will be imported into Japan after the country opens its rice market by allowing only a limited number of companies to handle imported rice. According to the 25 April Asahi Shimbun and the 26 April editions of Nihon Keizai Shimbun and Yomiuri Shimbun, MAFF's Food Agency rejected the applications of all of the more than ten new companies that applied to handle imported rice in Japanese fiscal year 1994. This decision leaves the importation of rice in the hands of 20 companies that have been registered to handle emergency imports or restricted imports for special purposes in the past, Asahi Shimbun and Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported. Judging from press reporting, MAFF may have deliberately excluded the new companies by setting vague or arbitrary requirements for handling rice imports that they could not meet. The 26 April Nihon Keizai Shimbun quoted Kyuzo Saito, the chief of the Food Agency's Import Division, as saying that none of the firms met the standards for "experience and credibility" set by the agency for importers. Among these standards, according to Nihon Keizai Shimbun, are requirements that a company be capitalized at over 100 million yen and have an unspecified amount of "experience" in the rice trade. In addition, Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported that some firms claimed not even to have known that the Food Agency was accepting applications for additional government-approved rice importers. MAFF may also try to limit rice imports and maintain high rice prices by cracking down on the reportedly booming imports of rice through the international postal service. According to the 26 April Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japanese consumers have been increasingly taking advantage of a loophole in Japan's food control regulations that allows individuals to import up to 100 kilograms of rice a year through the mail. The major attraction of this arrangement, judging from various press reports, is that rice purchased through such channels is significantly cheaper than rice available on the domestic market. According to the 26 April Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Chinese rice imported by mail through one consumer cooperative cost 3,500 yen per 10 kilograms, including postage and taxes. By contrast, according to a 27 April Kyodo report, the average price of top-quality domestic rice was 6,365 yen per 10 kilograms in February, while Chinese and California rice imported through regular channels cost between 4,100 and 4,300 yen per 10 kilograms in March. Suggesting that MAFF may crack down on such ventures, the 26 April Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported that the ministry's Food Agency has described the increasing import of rice through the mail as "problematic." The paper speculated that questions might be raised about the lack of health inspections on rice imported through the postal system and about the possibility that such rice might be contaminated by excessive pesticides or mold- -arguments that MAFF has used to bar imports of other items, such as U.S. apples, in the past. Outlook MAFF's efforts to restrict competition in the rice trade may help to keep the price of imported rice on the Japanese market relatively high, thus limiting its appeal to Japanese consumers and keeping high-cost Japanese rice growers in business. MAFF may attempt to use similar tactics to limit imports starting in 1995, when Japan is scheduled to partially open its rice market as part of an agreement reached in the recently-concluded Uruguay Round of international trade talks.
