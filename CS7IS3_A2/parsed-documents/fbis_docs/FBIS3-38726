The development is expected to put more pressure on Ankara's ties with Tehran aimed at curbing regional terrorism. Official sources said they expect now more than ever for Iran to abide with its guarantees to Turkey and fulfill its obligations underlined in mutual security protocols. There are already reports that some of the wounded PKK militants have been transferred to the so-called Halil Cavus camp, some 70 kilometers from Zhalah, in Iranian territory. Officials said on Monday that although an exact damage report was still not available with regard to last Friday's air strikes on the PKK camp in Zhalah, some 110 kilometers from the Turkish border, the separatists could not use the camp again. The camp, consisting of underground tunnels, caves, at least 21 buildings and dozens of tents, has reportedly been totally destroyed. Military sources say one of the main priorities of the operation had been to make the area unusable for the terrorists. According to Chief of Staff spokesman Col. Cogu Silahcioglu, constant monitoring of PKK wireless communications over the past three days has shown that none of the separatist units in the region can raise anyone at Zhalah. Meanwhile, regional sources have said that (Ferhat) Osman Ocalan, brother of PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan, is currently in Iran and suspected of being in Orumiyeh. Official sources say that since they are not able to use Zhalah again, the remainder of the PKK forces in the region would seek a new camp. About 1,600 terrorists were thought to be in Zhalah at the time of the attack. One view is that the PKK may return to its camps in Iraq, near Ochnevieh, and use these for both training and cross-border attacks into Turkey. This depends mainly on Iran's sincerity in its pledge to Ankara to hit back at terrorism. If not, the PKK can continue to shelter in Iranian territory in which it has had a constant force of 800-1,000 fighters up till now. According to another view, some of the leading militants may be transferred to Armenia where the PKK has official protection and aims at opening a major training camp. Osman Ocalan has had constant relations with Iranian officials in the past three years and has recently held a high-level meeting with representatives of the Iranian Information Ministry. Retaliation Meanwhile, Turkish security officials have upgraded precautionary measures against a possible terrorist attack in retaliation for Friday's operation. Security sources, over the weekend, took measures at all entrances to the Turkish capital and police have been warned in major metro- [sentence as published].
