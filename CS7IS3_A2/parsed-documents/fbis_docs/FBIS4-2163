It will, as always, together with the world community strive to enhance international cooperation in the field of human rights, said Qian at a meeting with Dr. Kurt Waldheim, former UN secretary general and president of the UN Association of Austria, here this afternoon. Qian told Waldheim, also former federal president of Austria, that the Chinese Government has given consistent support to the UN's efforts for promoting and protecting human rights and basic freedom according to the UN Charter's aim and principles. He said that China holds the "Universal Declaration on Human Rights" approved by the UN in 1948 as the first international document to systematically put forward specific premises for respecting and protecting basic human rights. He added that the declaration has exerted far-reaching influence on and played a positive role in the development of international human rights activities after the war. Qian said the Chinese Government has time and again stated that it will contribute to protecting human rights and basic freedom by abiding by the "Universal Declaration on Human Rights" and in accordance with stipulations related to international documents on human rights formulated according to the declaration. He said that, as a member state of the UN Commission on Human Rights, China actively takes part in all UN activities on human rights, including its involvement in drawing up and formulating UN documents on human rights. China has joined in drawing up the eight international documents on human rights and respected the "Universal Declaration on Human Rights", the "Teheran Declaration" and the "Declaration on the Right to Development", he said. Qian noted that China was actively involved in discussing and formulating the "Vienna Declaration and Program of Action" approved by the World Meeting on Human Rights last year and has made important contributions in this regard. He said China is willing to cooperate internationally on the human rights issue, adding that such cooperation should be based on equality and mutual respect. Meanwhile, he said, it is China's view that it cannot politicize the human rights issue or regard it as a means for political struggle and exerting political pressure, nor turn it into a tool for interference in other countries' internal affairs. Waldheim, who visited China on four occasions as the UN secretary general, said that he appreciated Qian's statement that China is willing to conduct international cooperation in the human rights field. It is of vital importance to strengthen cooperation and exchanges among countries in all the world, he said. Waldheim and his party arrived here on Monday for a 10-day visit to China at the invitation of the UN Association of China. During his stay here, Waldheim delivered a speech on the international situation at the headquarters of the host association.
