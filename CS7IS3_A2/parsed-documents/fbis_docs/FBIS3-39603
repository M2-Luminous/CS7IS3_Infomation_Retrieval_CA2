Claes also talked about the speeches by some six other senators -- including Paul Pataer, Herman De Croo, Hugo Van Rompaey, and Nelly Maes -- who took part in the debate. Generally speaking, the speeches contained a carefully worded positive reaction to the NATO ultimatum. However, the questions asked were primarily about the scope of the ultimatum and the role of the European Union. As for the future of the southern Slav region, a number of different voices could be heard. Pataer rejected an ethnic division. On the other, Van Rompaey and Maes stressed that the conflict between the peoples there is already centuries old. Foreign Minister Willy Claes defended the role of the European Union in the conflict and also clarified the NATO ultimatum. He put the emphasis on the fact that "the creation of a new element following the failure of the latest negotiations in late December was inevitable." He explained that "he wanted to see no introduction to a generalized military scenario" in the ultimatum. He did feel that the ultimatum must be carried out with the necessary strictness and that it must not be watered down on the ground. The ultimatum concerns only Sarajevo and the surrounding area, but can be broadened geographically if necessary. Claes said that any such negotiated solution would not really be convincing without Russia and the United States. However, that does not mean that "Moscow should think that it has a say in determining the European Union's position." America must be involved in a solution because the Muslims in Sarajevo feel that only Washington can provide a convincing guarantee for a peace agreement. Claes came down against lifting the arms embargo, because this would increase the risk of war for the UN troops and the neighboring countries, but also because "some countries, which are known for their support to fundamentalism and which are already active on the ground in Bosnia," would not hesitate to send advisers and mercenaries. The minister finished by warning of a "mistaken vision of nationalism that can deteriorate into racism and egoism," but at the same time stressed that he "does not want return to the idea of the right to self-determination."
