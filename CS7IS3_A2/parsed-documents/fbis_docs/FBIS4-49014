FBIS4-49014 "drchi084_a_94001" FBIS-CHI-94-084 Daily Report 29 Apr 1994 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS General Spokesman Comments on MFN, Nuclear Testing Spokesman Comments on MFN, Nuclear Testing OW3004003294 Beijing China Radio International in English to Western North America 0400 GMT 29 Apr 94 OW3004003294 Beijing China Radio International English BFN [From the "Current Affairs" program] [Text] China has urged the U.S. Government to abide by the 1982 Sino-U.S. Joint Communique on U.S. arms sales to Taiwan. At a weekly press conference on Thursday [28 April], Chinese Foreign Ministry's Wu Jianmin made the statement in response to the U.S. adoption of a new legislation. The modified Murkowski Amendment was adopted ten days ago by the joint conference of the U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives. The document asserts that the Taiwan Relations Act takes primacy over the 1982 Sino-U.S. Joint Communique in which the two governments pledged to resolve the issue of U.S. arms sales to Taiwan. Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin criticized the American legislation, saying its essence negates the bilateral communique. Wu Jianmin said the modified amendment not only undermines the relations between the two countries, but sets up obstacles to the reunification of China's Mainland and Taiwan. He urged the U.S. Government to abide by the guiding principle governing bilateral ties and take immediate measures to keep Sino-U.S. relations from serious harm. On another issue concerning the U.S., spokesman Wu Jianmin expressed opposition to a reported meeting between President Bill Clinton and the Dalai Lama. Wu Jianmin said Dalai is not only a religious leader, but a political exile. And for a long time, he has engaged in activities aiming to split China. Therefore, the spokesman concluded any official meeting with the Dalai Lama is an act of support for a separatist attempt and amounts to an interference in China's domestic affairs. The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman also dismissed the linkage between the MFN [most-favored nation] status and China's nuclear tests. Reports say some American legislators have warned that China's continued nuclear testing will do no good to the likelihood of the U.S. extending its tariff privileges. The spokesman said: among the world's five nuclear states, China has conducted the smallest number of nuclear tests, which account for only four percent of U.S. testing. Finally, Wu Jianmin described the report that China has sent an additional 30,000 troops to Tibet and deployed them along the border with India as a sheer fabrication. Wu Jianmin said such a report has an ulterior motive. He said China and India signed an agreement on the maintenance of peace and tranquility last year and have begun to negotiate on troop reduction along the line of actual control For China Radio International, I am (Li Peiquan).
