FBIS4-39388 "drsov110_h_94002" FBIS-SOV-94-110 Daily Report 7 Jun 1994 Moldova Need To Keep Army Questioned Need To Keep Army Questioned LD0706203694 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1512 GMT 7 Jun 94 LD0706203694 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: By Correspondents Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy and others] [Text] If the process of settlement in Trans-Dniestria develops favorably, the need to keep Russia's 14th Army there will disappear, a member of the Russian delegation to the talks with Moldova told INTERFAX on Tuesday [7 June]. According to the diplomat, participants in the ninth round of talks between Russia and Moldova, which opened in Moscow on Tuesday, will focus on issues connected with the status of Russia's 14th Army and the time of its withdrawal. The Russian delegation is led by the Ambassador at Large Vladimir Kitayev, and the Moldovan by the First Deputy Foreign Minister, Nicolae Osmokescu. A document on the legal status of the 14th Army may be drafted during the present round of talks, the diplomat said. "If events in Trans-Dniestria develop favorably, only purely technical problems connected with troops withdrawal will remain to be resolved. It's true, though, that such a process may take a long time," he said. During the previous round of talks, INTERFAX's interviewee said, the Russian side submitted a number of proposals aimed at fixing "technically possible times" for the Army's withdrawal. "We cannot take our servicemen to the open spaces. Three to four years are required to organize the withdrawal of personnel, military equipment, ammunition, etc. Properly. As far as we can judge, Kishinev agrees with this on the whole," he said. The diplomat drew Interfax's attention to another "extremely important aspect." "On 15 May 1993 in Moscow President Boris Yeltsin and his Moldovan counterpart, Mircea Snegur, signed a joint communique on the need to synchronize the withdrawal of Russian troops from Moldova with the process of peaceful settlement in Trans-Dniestria," he said. "Lately bilateral contacts on this issue became more productive. Besides, a dialogue between Kishinev and Tiraspol is gradually taking shape," he said. "It's indicative that the Moldovan leadership has postponed the implementation of the bill on official language, which served as a detonator of the conflict, and rejected the idea of joining Romania." The diplomat drew attention to the circumstance that some Moldovan politicians began to speak in favor of giving up the principle of synchronization. "It's quite possible that this issue will be raised at the present round of talks," he noted. Under the communique of 15 May 1993 Moldova is not in a position to abandon the principle of synchronization unilaterally. "We believe that such an approach is premature to say the least," he concluded.
