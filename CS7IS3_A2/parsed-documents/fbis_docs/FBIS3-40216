These optical characteristics present application potential.[.sup]4,5[/] The scanning tunneling microscope (STM) developed in the early 1980s has been widely used in different fields.[.sup]6,7[/] The study of polycrystalline Si thin film with STM has achieved some results,[.sup]8-11[/] mainly in the exploration of the film's surface characteristics and topography. However, so far there has been no report of STM research on the nanoscale material's crystal interface, which has an important effect on the structure and properties of the nanoscale material. In this paper, we utilize a locally made STM to study the surfaces of nanoscale Si thin films whose thickness varies from sub-micron to atomic scale. A series of data, especially on the crystal interface structures, is obtained. 1. Experimental Method The nanoscale Si thin-film specimen is prepared with a plasma capacitively coupled chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) system, with highly hydrogen-diluted silane as the reaction gas, and by the excitation of an r.f. + DC double-power source.[.sup]1,2[/] The instrument used in the research is a type CSTM-9000 STM for atmospheric use,[.sup]12[/] manufactured by the CAS Institute of Chemistry and equipped with a needle made of 80Pt-20Ir alloy (diameter: 0.25mm) by mechanical cutting or a tungsten needle (diameter: 0.25mm) made by chemical etching. In a constant-current operating mode, each image is sampled with 180 x 180 points. The surface heights are reflected by the varying shades of grayish color in the image. The voltage between the needle and the specimen tunnel junction is between 0.5 V and 2 V, with needle as positive. The maximum tunnel current selected for use has reached 1 nA, and generally is about 0.5 nA. In the following test results, the STM images are only the outcomes after the original data were smoothed. The scanning time for each image varies: from 3 min (for large images) to 15 s (for small images). 2. Results and Discussion The STM images of nanoscale Si thin film of different magnifications in atmosphere are displayed from sub-micron to atomic dimensions. Figure 1 shows the obverse STM image of the nanoscale Si thin film obtained with the tungsten needle. The needle bias is 1 volt; and the current, 0.45 nA. The scanning areas of Figures 1(a) and 1(b) are 40.9 nm (x-direction) x 48.8 nm (y-direction), and 20.5 nm x 24.4 nm, respectively. Figure 1 shows that the nanoscale Si thin film is composed of many ultrafine particles. The densities of the surface particle arrangements vary. The particle boundaries are very clear. From Figures 1(a), and 1(b) especially, the sizes of the nanoscale Si thin-film particles can be estimated as 3 nm-5 nm, which closely coincide with the results from high-resolution electron microscopy (HREM).[.sup]1,2[/] The image obtained with the mechanically cut Pt/Ir needle shows comparatively smooth regions between the nanoscale particles in the nanoscale Si thin film, due to the large radius of curvature of the mechanically cut Pt/Ir needle tip.[.sup]13[/] Figure 2 shows the three-dimensional STM near-atomic image of the nanoscale Si thin film obtained with the Pt/Ir needle. The STM parameters are: needle bias V[.sup]t[/] = 1.0 V; tunnel currents I[.sup]t[/] are 0.4 nA and 0.6 nA for Figures 2(a) and 2(b), respectively; and the scanning areas are 4.10 nm x 4.88 nm and 1.7 nm x 1.0 nm, respectively. Figure 2(a) shows that the atoms in the brighter areas arrange in an orderly pattern, and the darker areas are the boundary surfaces of the crystals where the atom arrangements are somewhat random. This observation essentially coincides with Gleiter's nanoscale material structural model.[.sup]3[/] Two scratch marks caused by the unstable needle are displayed in Figure 2(a). Figure 2(b) displays the orderly arrangement of atoms with a distance of about 3 Angstroms between neighboring atoms. At this position, we believe that the area of STM observation is focused on the particle. Since the particle is crystalline,[.sup]1,2[/] the orderly arrangement of the atoms is observable. Figure 1. Plane Image of Nanoscale Si Thin Film This experiment has found that the needle bias for image formation should not be too low to cause needle instability, which is probably due to the nanoscale Si thin-film surface oxidation. On the other hand, during the preparation of the nanoscale Si thin-film specimen, the reaction between silicon and hydrogen may hinder the surface oxidation. These results are only preliminary. Further study is in progress. 3. Conclusions The STM study of nanoscale Si thin film reveals that this film is composed of nanoscale particles with average particle Figure 2. Three-Dimensional STM Near-Atomic Image of Nanoscale Si Thin Film size of 3 nm-5 nm. Through the STM's high-resolution imaging capability, the near-atomic images on the thin-film surface are directly observed. The images show that the atom arrangement of the nanoscale particles is orderly, and the atom arrangement between the particles is comparatively random. These results coincide with past observations by HREM, and further disclose the microstructure of the nanoscale Si thin film.
