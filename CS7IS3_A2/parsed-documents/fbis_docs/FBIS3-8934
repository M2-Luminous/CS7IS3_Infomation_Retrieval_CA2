Members of government and Parliament were present, plus Budapest diplomats. A speech by Prime Minister Peter Boross recalled turning points of Hungarian history from the conquest to the present. He cited the historical importance of the 1848-49 revolution and freedom fight, the ideas of March 15, freedom, national independence, and social modernisation. Boross said distorted, alien ideas ruled the Hungarian people after World War Two. "The message of the March flame was there on October 23, 1956, when people fought for indestructible Hungarian freedom and overthrew a distorted system of ideas." "This is the fourth year that we have celebrated March 15 freely, and the third year that there are no foreign soldiers in the country," the prime minister continued. Boross said the tough years of change and recent traumas all point in one direction, that of the March ideal: To survive, and to make the life of the nation better, more secure and free. "We have not solved everything, there is unfinished business, unsolved problems, but we are on the way, as we are fulfilling the order to survive and to prosper. Let us promise not to struggle with our daily problems today or engage in politics, but to bow our heads to the great figures of the nation. The spirit of March should refresh our public life, should give faith and courage so that we can cover the road ahead of us," the prime minister said.
