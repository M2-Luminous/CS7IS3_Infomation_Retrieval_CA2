During the first half of this year, a total of 13,966 guinea worm cases were reported throughout the country compared to 25,966 cases reported during the same period last year. This is contained in the July 1993 report of Global 2000 Guinea Worm Project, a copy of which was made available to the GRAPHIC at Saltpond or Thursday after a workshop for 35 guinea-worm eradication volunteers. The report noted that with the possible exception of the Northern Region, the number of infested villages is sufficiently small enough that a monthly visit by the co-ordinators to each endemic village would ensure the adoption of preventive measures. A supplementary report on the Central Region signed by Dr. Richard Yaw Osei, Regional Director of Health Services also stated that the region achieved 100 percent filter distribution to about 42,000 households in December last year. It stated a survey carried out in January this year indicated that 80 percent of the population actually used the monofilterment filters but 20 percent were worn out due to vigorous washing. It said 120 endemic communities have been supplied with potable water since 1989 while about 130 endemic communities have been earmarked for potable water by the end of 1993.
