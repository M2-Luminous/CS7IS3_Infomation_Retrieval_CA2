FR940504-1-00003 FR940504-1-00002 Farmers Home Administration 7 CFR Parts 1823, 1910, 1941, 1942, 1943, 1944, 1945, 1948, 1951, and 1980 RIN: 0575&hyph;AA66 Denying Credit to Applicants Delinquent on Federal Debt AGENCY: Farmers Home Administration, USDA. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) proposes to amend its regulations concerning program eligibility requirements. These revisions will direct field offices to suspend processing of an application if an applicant is found to be delinquent on a Federal debt until the delinquency is resolved, and to deny credit if a Federal judgment is found against an applicant. This action is necessary to implement requirements of OMB Circular A&hyph;129, ``Policies for Federal Credit Programs and Non-Tax Receivables.'' Denying credit to applicants against whom there is a Federal judgment is mandated by provisions of the Federal Debt Collections Procedures Act of 1990. The intended effect of this action is to instruct field offices on how to obtain more information to be used in determining loan, grant and loan servicing eligibility. DATES: Comments must be submitted on or before July 5, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit written comments in duplicate to the Office of the Chief, Regulations Analysis and Control Branch, Farmers Home Administration, USDA, South Building, room 6348, 14th and Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20250. All written comments made pursuant to this notice will be available for public inspection during regular working hours at the above address. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Daniel K. Wanamaker, Senior Financial Analyst, Farmers Home Administration, U.S. Department of Agriculture, room 6446, South Agriculture Building, Washington, DC 20250, Telephone (202) 690&hyph;0501.
