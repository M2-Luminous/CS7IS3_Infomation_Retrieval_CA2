FBIS4-55364 "dreeu093__a94009" FBIS-EEU-94-093-A Daily Report 12 May 1994 ANNEX Bulgaria Economic Protocol Signed With Iraq Economic Protocol Signed With Iraq AU1205180794 Sofia BTA in English 1547 GMT 12 May 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU1205180794 Sofia BTA English BFN [Text] Sofia, May 12 (BTA) -- A protocol on the 21st session which the Mixed Intergovernmental Bulgarian-Iraqi Commission on Economic, Industrial and Trade Cooperation completed in Sofia was signed here today by Finance Minister Stoyan Aleksandrov and Iraq's Agriculture Minister Dr. Bashir 'Alwan Hammadi. The commission considered the state of bilateral economic, commercial and industrial and research cooperation and the prospects for its development in a way consistent with the UN Security Council resolutions. The document insists that Bulgaria be included among the first recipients of Iraqi repayments on state and corporate loans after the embargo is lifted, with compensation for the losses and the right to complete unfinished construction and other projects. It is insisted that the debt be repaid in convertible currency or through the delivery of crude oil at international market prices. Iraq does not contest Bulgaria's receivables. The Iraqis suggested a draft agreement on trade, economic, research and technological cooperation to replace the bilateral agreement on economic and technological cooperation which was signed on February 12, 1986 and expired on February 13, 1991. After the signing of the document, Mr. Aleksandrov expressed the wish that the embargo against Iraq be lifted as soon as possible so that contacts between the two countries could be normalized. He said that in compliance with Article 50 of the UN Charter, Bulgarian diplomacy has consulted the Security Council with regard to a solution of its special economic problems arising from the world body's resolution, but the request has not been granted. "Turkey and Jordan have already received such facilitations, but we will keep trying," Mr. Aleksandrov said. "All the more so since Bulgaria has the moral right (to such facilitation), being a country which suffered substantial losses from the observance of the embargo at a period of economic hardship."
