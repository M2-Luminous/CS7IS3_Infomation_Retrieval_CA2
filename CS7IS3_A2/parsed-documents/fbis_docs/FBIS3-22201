Rear Admiral Yurasov, head of the Nuclear Safety Inspectorate, said that nuclear and radiation safety norms were revised after the Chernobyl catastrophe. According to Yurasov, these norms are being observed in the majority of atomic installations, atomic subs, and ships. [Begin Yurasov recording] Considerable financial means are required to maintain the operation of these atomic subs. These atomic subs are a potential source of radiological contamination. [end recording] A serious shortage of personnel to man nuclear installations is another problem of the Navy. There are not enough sailors, warrant officers, and officers. Touching upon the issue of sunken submarines--specifically, the Komsomolets sub--it was noted that it would be more expedient to mothball rather than raise them. The radioactive contamination around the Komsomolets is local and does not represent an ecological disaster. The marines do not regard as necessary the Gosatomnadzor's [Federal Oversight of Nuclear and Radiation Safety] supervision of certain installations; they believe that departmental monitoring of the Navy's nuclear safety is sufficient. [Begin V. Makarov, deputy director of Gosatomnadzor] What they are proposing runs counter to the approved amendments introduced in the provision on Gosatomnadzor. These amendment were agreed upon with the chief of the General Staff, and I cannot change the list of installations to be monitored. [end recording]
