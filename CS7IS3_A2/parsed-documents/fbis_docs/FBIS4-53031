J. Strider) and Pyone Cho] [Text] The February issue of MYETKHIN THIT journal, published by the intelligence service of SLORC [State Law and Order Restoration Council], contains language detrimental to the prestige of Thai Crown Princess Mahachakri Sirinthon, and has caused embarrassment to the SLORC. On page 135 of issue no. 46 is an article in the form of a dialogue between a Vietnamese national, (Nguyen Nge) and a Burmese national, (Saw Indei). The dialogue contains terms insulting to Thai Princess Mahachakri Sirinthon, daughter of the Thai king. It makes references to Mahachakri Sirinthon being world-famous for being born as a daughter of the Thai king. It contains references saying that had she been born of a (?Burmese) peasant, Sirinthon may well have been a prostitute. The same article says prostitution has become a traditional source of livelihood in Thailand and that Thailand is achieving a high standard of living through prostitution and that the revolutionary trait has disappeared. If such a rude reference had been made to the daughter of the Thai king in Thailand, there would certainly be charges of lese majeste and harsh punishment. Such an article could not have been published without official authorization in Burma, where there are strict censorship rules and the Army strictly controls the publication of journals. MYETKHIN THIT has been published by the SLORC since 1990 and has been used to blatantly attack democratic forces inside and outside the country, political leaders, foreign countries, and Western diplomats. Po Kan Kaung's article in the February issue of MYETKHIN THIT journal has surprised many Burmese observers because relations between Thailand and Burma have been good. Thailand, which has been enjoying special privileges in timber and fishery concessions, has been opposing international efforts to isolate the SLORC. Lately, the SLORC, which has been expanding economic relations with other countries, including Singapore, has accused Thai businessmen of illegal fishing and logging. It is possible that the article, which contains crude language, may well reflect the SLORC government's displeasure with the Thais. The article also contains references that could damage the prestige of the Thai military. The article says that since the end of World War II, Thailand has been instrumental in spreading U.S. imperialism in Southeast Asia, and that the Thai Armed Forces have been under the patronage of the U.S. Army. While the Burmese and the Vietnamese Defense Services were discharging their national duty, the Thai Armed Forces lacked revolutionary characteristics. Despite the allegations made by MYETKHIN THIT, there has been a surprising lack of reaction from the Thai Armed Forces and entrepreneurs. According to one source, although Thai military intelligence obtained the article, they suppressed the report to prevent it from leaking to the Thai public. It can be seen that although the Burmese generals are insulting the prestige of Thailand, Thai military officials are remaining silent over the matter for their own self-interest.
