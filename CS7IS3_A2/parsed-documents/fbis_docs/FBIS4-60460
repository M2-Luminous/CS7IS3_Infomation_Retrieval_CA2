Anwar al-Khalil, minister of state for Chamber of Deputies affairs, asked about the U.S. stance on the kidnapping operation. He said the United States might, intentionally or otherwise, have paved the way for Israel to pursue its terrorist policy, first, by ignoring Lebanon on its shuttle tour and second, by including Syria on the list of terrorist states. He stressed that the kidnapping will increase Lebanon's determination to adhere to the resistance as one of the most legitimate methods to liberate the land. The Loyalty to the Resistance Bloc [Hizballah parliamentary bloc] has stressed that the kidnapping represented overt defiance and provocation. It called for the highest degree of alertness and vigilance. The act of piracy was also denounced by Deputy Muhammad Baydun, the Amal Movement, the Progressive Socialist Party, and the Syrian Social Nationalist Party.
