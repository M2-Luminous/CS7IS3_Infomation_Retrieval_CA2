My name is Darius Mokori, I am a car mechanic and I am going to vote for the National Party. So are hundreds of other young, self-employed people like me, who are struggling to keep their small businesses going. I work with my brother Aron, who is also going to vote NP -- and we specialise in panel beating and respray jobs. I worked for other people for 14 years -- mostly in big garages -- and I saw the damage that the ANC and their friends do to businesses, particularly the car business. There were strikes and stay aways and sanctions -- and now hardly any cars are made in this country, and many good repairing firms have gone out of business. Finally I was made redundant last year and I decided to set up on my own. It is a struggle -- but I know it will be easier for me if the NP win, than if the ANC do. You see, the NP believe in business -- the ANC do not. The NP want people to succeed -- because that way they will make money and jobs for people and then we can all afford the things this country needs -- like schools and hospitals. The ANC do not want people to be successful -- they want strikes and stay-aways. If you make any money, they will want try to take it away from you with heavy taxes. They will be corrupt like the rest of Africa. The fact is they are not ready for power. They are promising too much -- and they know they can't deliver. And they are trying to bully people and force everyone into line. Step out of line and they persecute you and threaten you and beat you up. I know hundreds of people who are going to vote for the NP, but are just too scared to say so. As soon as the comrades find out, they approach you in the street and say they will necklace you. But the vote is secret -- so threats won't stop us voting for the NP. I have big dreams for the future. I want to educate myself more. I want to study more about paint technology. I want to build up my business. These are the sort of dreams many young men have for the future. So I ask myself: Who is best for education -- the NP who will build it up, or the ANC who have destroyed it for black people? And I ask myself: Who is best for business -- the NP who will build it up, or the ANC who have destroyed it? The only answer I can come up with to help me make my dreams come true -- is the NP. BE SURE OF A BETTER LIFE Vote for F.W. De Klerk and the new National Party We've made the change [Second advertisement]I am a teacher and I'm voting National Party. My name is Winnie and I'm going to vote for the National Party. So are hundreds of other black teachers like me. We will not be intimidated. Now we have the vote, we must put aside the past, and vote on one thing: Who will give us -- all of us -- the best future? The answer is the NP. I am a mother of two young boys; and like all mothers, I wonder what the future will bring for them. I know for certain that their future will be a lot better under the National Party, than it ever would be under the ANC. Only the NP has the strength and experience to run the country. The ANC can't. They just don't have the experience. I have been teaching in a High School in the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] region for 17 years and, in that time I have seen the ANC and their friends destroy the education of a whole generation of township children. It makes me so angry, because children are the future of this country. The ANC are promising that everyone will have free education -- but how on earth are they going to afford it? They have no hope of delivering on their promises. The NP has a proper plan to get the money to build factories and businesses, so that the jobs will come -- and then we will be able to build the schools and hospitals we need. That way ALL our children will get the best affordable education, and we will be able to make the most of their gifts. Also the ANC don't understand democracy -- to them there is only their point of view. No one else is allowed an opinion. They are autocrats. I try to teach my children to think for themselves. This is vital if we are to have a proper democracy in this country. A lot of people say that their hearts are telling them to vote for the ANC. I tell them that their hearts are for emotion. This election is not about emotion. It is about the future, our future. Our children's future. And only one party can deliver that: The NP. BE SURE OF A BETTER LIFE Vote for F.W. De Klerk and the new National Party We've made the change.
