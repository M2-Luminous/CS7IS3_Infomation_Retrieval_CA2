According to the source in the second phase during the year 1994-95 prototype field exercises will take place for giving it final shape before its large-scale production for the induction in the Pakistan Army. Defence observers believe that the induction of Al-Khalid tanks, which are being built in Heavy Industries, Taxila (HTT) in collaboration with China, would surely narrow the quantitative gap in armour between Pakistan and India. It may be recalled that first phase of Al-Khalid project has already been completed and the prototype have undergone trials in Pakistan in various conditions. Experts from China and Pakistan are now exploring further methods for improving the tanks with more powerful engine, better fire control and electronic system, before its production, source added saying "production line would be expanded to manufacture in such a number that can meet the country's defence requirement adequately". It is also worth mentioning here that the Chief of the Army Staff General Abdul Waheed after taking over as army chief in January this year is said to have directed the army authorities to also examine the possibility of buying other types of tanks including the Chinese T-85. Two-hundred T-85 Chinese tanks are already in the process of being inducted in the Pakistan Army as a part of Pak-Sino deal signed earlier. Pakistan Army has budgeted a total of 311 million dollars for the purchase of new tanks over the next three years. A deal for buying T-691 IMP from China has also materialised which will further strengthen the defence line of Pakistan against any external threat.
