A rumor was begun in local circles that generals not linked with Army Commander General Lino Oviedo had requested Wasmosy's resignation to protest Oviedo's excessive influence over the military institution. Foreign media sources, particularly in Argentina, repeated the rumor. A rumor circulated during the meeting of the Argentine, Bolivian, and Paraguayan presidents in Formosa yesterday, indicating that there was strong dissatisfaction among young Paraguayan officers for the excessive power that the Army commander in fact holds. Wasmosy was asked about the matter after a meeting at the commander in chief's offices this morning. The president said the rumor was not true. "It is absolutely false. It seems the papers are short of real news," Wasmosy said in referring to the foreign press. Defense Minister Hugo Estigarribia characterized the foreign press publications as real nonsense. "It is real stupidity. I do not know where this disinformation might be coming from. It is absurd to even think that generals could ask for the resignation of the president of the Republic," Estigarribia said. The minister said if the information originated locally, it was just "nonsense," invented by the press interested in destabilizing the democratic process. If it originated abroad, it was pure disinformation, Estigarribia added. Today, Wasmosy travelled to Salvador (Bahia). Not all the generals -- and not even Oviedo, who usually comes to see the president off -- were present at the airport. The defense minister explained that the absence of some generals was due to the fact that they were carrying out tasks in the interior of the country.
