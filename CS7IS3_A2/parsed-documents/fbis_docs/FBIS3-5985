This is considered the first move after a four-year impasse during which there has been no formal agreement. The Thai delegation will be led by Mahidon Chantharangkun, permanent secretary of the Ministry of Transport and Communication; Sisuk Chantharangsu, director-general of the Civil Aviation Department, and Mr Thamnun along with THAI marketing and corporate planning staff. Mr Thamnun declined to reveal the Thai position in the negotiations. Currently THAI flies to the US four times, Bangkok to Los Angeles. US airlines Delta, Northwest and United operate a total of 21 flights a week to Bangkok. Flight routing and capacity levels are still at 1991 levels despite significant economic changes in the region. Mr Thamnun said THAI had no plan to increase flights to the US in the short term, especially this summer while it tries to expand domestic service and develop other new routes. An informed source in the Ministry of Transport and Communication said the US wants to increase flights to Bangkok now that the embargo against Vietnam has been lifted. Washington expects a lot more US tourists and businesspeople will want to travel to Vietnam via Bangkok. As well, American Airlines is eying the Southeast Asia market, into which it wants to expand in a big way. The conflict began in 1990 with a difference of opinion between Thailand and the US on allocating a reasonable number of flights between the two countries. Washington supports an "open skies" approach in which US carriers can freely increase the volume of passengers and cargo to Thailand. Thailand believes in the principle of "capacity predetermination". THAI believes "open skies" will hurt Thailand, because the US has more capacity to accommodate vast numbers of passengers and cargo on its many airlines. The US-Thailand route is considered very lucrative since it includes significant stopover points such as Tokyo, Taipei and Seoul.
