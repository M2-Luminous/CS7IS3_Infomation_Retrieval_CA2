At a high-level strategic meeting presided over by Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang on Thursday morning, the government discussed other measures against North Korea in the wake of Wednesday's unsuccessful meeting on exchanging envoys, informed sources said. Among the measures is resumption of preparation for this year's joint "Team Spirit" military exercise with the United States if North Korea does not cooperate in international inspections of its seven declared nuclear sites and if the third round of high-level U.S.-North Korea talks is postponed. The meeting focused on whether the next high-level U.S.-North Korean meeting should be held if an agreement is reached before March 21 to exchange envoys after this date, sources said. In case either North or South Korea sends an envoy to the other side, instead of a mutual exchange, the government will support holding the next high-level Washington-Pyongyang meeting on March 21 as scheduled. The government will discuss this policy with U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Military and Political Affairs Robert Gallucci when he arrives on Thursday evening. Attending the meeting were Deputy Premier and Unification Minister Yi Yong-tok, Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae and Senior Presidential Secretary for Foreign and National Security Affairs Chong Chong-ok.
