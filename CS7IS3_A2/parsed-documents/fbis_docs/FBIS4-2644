The meeting was presided over by Governor Zhu Senlin. Vice Governor Ou Guangyuan briefed the participants on the guidelines laid by the national meeting on rural work, and gave some opinions on the actual circumstances of the province. Ou Guangyuan said: Party and government cadres at all levels must treat agriculture, especially grain production, as a major task that must be accomplished to stabilize society and the country. He stressed that this year's task of growing grain over 49 million mu of land must be completed. This is mandatory, he said. If the early rice-growing quota is not fulfilled, then the deficiency must be made up by growing more late rice. He pointed out that how well the grain-growing task is completed must be taken as a principal criterion for the assessment of the performance of leading people at all levels. Ou Guangyuan said: While completing the grain-growing task, we are to apply the method of subsidizing agriculture with profits earned from industry to increasing grain growers' income. Addressing the meeting, Governor Zhu Senlin stressed that it is necessary for people to be fully aware that grain production is an important factor to ensure social stability. Grain and food supply is an important matter in our efforts to keep commodity prices stable. All local authorities must persistently implement the system by which designated officials assume responsibility for production, supply, marketing, and storage of grain, as well as the relevant performance assessment system. Since grain production promises low economic returns, one cannot totally rely on market regulation with regard to grain trade, instead, one must strengthen macroeconomic regulation by administrative and economic means. Zhu Senlin said: In order to implement all the measures for increasing grain output and returns, all kinds of services must be introduced in good time, thus ensuring that peasants' income will increase. We can no longer tolerate cases such as those in which grain growers' income remains constant or even decreases despite increase in grain output.
