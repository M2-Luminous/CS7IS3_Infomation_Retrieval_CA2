CRI's [China Radio International's] (Li Ben) has filed a two-part story on the (?real scenario) behind China's prisons and the life of prisoners in prison farms. Here's Dong Jun with the first story in our series: [Begin recording] [Dong Jun] China believes that criminals can become better people and China always tries to give prisoners a new life. Our reporter talked with Zhang Xiufu, the vice minister of justice. [Zhang speaking in Mandarin fading into English translation read by Dong] Zhang Xiufu said: There are many ways to reform prisoners. For example, all criminals receive political, moral, and law education while in jail. China wants the whole society to work together for this endeavor and the first step is labor reform. At present, China has more than 1 million convicts in about 600 prisons scattered all over the nation. These prisoners are engaged in various forms of labor, such as working on farms and in factories. Zhang Xiufu said only through labor can criminals be tamed. He said one of the main motives for crime is to gain without working; through labor, a prisoner will cultivate a work habit, know to cherish his own creation, and form a sense of discipline. Zhang said: In 1950's, China successfully reformed Japanese war criminals and the last feudal emperor, Pu Yi. They all began a new life after working for a while in a farm. Wang Minbing is an official in charge of prison affairs. He said: All their work is to prepare prisoners for their future. The prisoners have many opportunities to attend courses and learn skills in their work. These skills will be essential when they look for jobs in the future. Every year, more than 200,000 prisoners obtain a diploma confirmed by educational departments or vocational skill certificate granted by labor departments. Wang Minbing explained: [Wang speaking in Mandarin fading into English translation read by Dong] Wang said the correctional administrators must be warm-hearted to the convicts and let them see hope. Their goal is to transform the prisoners into better men and women. Wang said it is a humanitarian deed to the prisoners, their families, and society. Wang Minbing said: Only 6 to 8 percent of those released after serving sentences commit crime again within two years. Ninety percent are transformed into law-abiding citizens. However, the living conditions in some jails are sometimes not good. Vice Minister of Justice Zhang Xiufu said: This is because China is still a developing country and the people's average standard of living is low. In fact, the prisoners' cost of living is similar to that of ordinary citizens. He believes the situation in prison will be improved along with the country's economic growth. [end recording] That was Dong Jun with the report on China's reform through labor prison. Our reporter (Li Ben) also visited (?Xiyuan) Prison in Shanghai to talk to the inmates there. Tomorrow at the same time, you will hear some prisoners talk about their lives behind bars.
