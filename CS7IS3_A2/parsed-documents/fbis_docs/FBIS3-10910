Selin Valenzuela Galdamez, 49, has been at large since 1992, when he was indicted by the Swedish courts on charges of having financed many drug shipments, including 40 kg of cocaine hidden in packages of dried grapes. Two other Chileans were sentenced in Sweden for the same crime. The Chilean police reported that Valenzuela has been involved in drug trafficking since the 1970's, but that his arrest had not been possible because he was using a false name. An Investigative Police officer said that Valenzuela is undoubtedly the most wanted drug trafficker in the country because of his link with international rings. Valenzuela was arrested in the city of Villa Alemana on charges of fraud against many companies for over 70 million pesos, and not because of drug trafficking. [passage omitted] The police also arrested two of Valenzuela's partners, identified as Ruben Calderon and Raul Oyarsun. The police reported that they were using their money to build a luxury inn in the Fifth Region.
