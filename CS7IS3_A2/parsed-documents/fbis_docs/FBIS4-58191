He underlined the positive results achieved by this visit. [passage omitted] Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said that his visit to the Great Jamahiriyah had dealt with the so-called Lockerbie case and the recent development that occurred at the meeting of the Arab League council, at the level of Arab foreign ministers in Cairo. He said: At the council we achieved a unanimous Arab decision that the Arab League should put forward an initiative, with the accord of member-states, for finding a peaceful settlement of this artificial case. He pointed out that the idea of a trial at the International Court of Justice in The Hague had won the support of the Arab countries. Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said that bringing the suspects before a neutral side accords with the requirements of justice and with the discovery of the truth. He said further: I have informed the U.S., Britain, and France of this decision agreed upon by the Arab League, and I have also informed the secretary general of the United Nations and the chairman of the Security Council in March. He stressed that there was nothing there to justify a rejection by the Western states of this proposal, and he underlined in this respect that the position of the Great Jamahiriyah was founded on legitimacy and a sound legal basis and that we must stick to it, insist on it, and call for its implementation. He made clear that this issue was exhaustively discussed, and that when he returned to Cairo he would make moves in this respect. He said: We will carry on our moves together with our eagerness at the same time to stress the legitimate nature of the Libyan position and its tallying with international law, because the Great Jamahiriyah had tackled this crisis with the appropriate legal means. Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid also said: Right is on our side and we must stick to it, insist on it and discuss it, and the coming stage will witness a coordination in order to explain the Arab viewpoint on this position, which has become an all-Arab position and not just that of the Great Jamahiriyah. Concerning the possibility of the Arab states abandoning the unjust measures imposed on the Great Jamahiriyah, particularly now that much evidence has emerged that proved that the Great Jamahiriyah was innocent of this accusation, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said: The Arab countries have the power of decision in what they do, and he stressed that the decision taken by the recent meetings of the Arab League council to back and support the Arab Libyan position was now an all-Arab position that must be also taken into account by the Western sides. The secretary general reiterated the rejection by the Arab League of the unjust resolutions, and he underlined that the so-called Security Council had double-standards. He said: I have said frankly that we did not accept this style and this situation. He said: We will strive for a debate on this matter, and we will try all possibilities to refute the position of the West in this respect, and we will strive to clarify the issue to a number of the Security Council member states. This will be done in the coming weeks, he said. [passage omitted]
