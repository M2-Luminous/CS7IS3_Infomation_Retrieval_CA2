He said that if they did not transfer the technology, they would lose their market niche to European countries and the United States, not only in Malaysia but in the region too. The Japanese, however, now realise the negative consequences of not transferring technology and are moving fast towards this goal, he told reporters after launching the Finger-Lock System of Polytron Resources Sdn Bhd [Private Limited] here. The security system uses finger print instead of a key or a card to gain access into a building or home. Law said the rapid development in the Asia-Pacific would entail Japan to change its policy in respect of technology transfer.
