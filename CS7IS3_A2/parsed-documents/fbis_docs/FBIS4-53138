Amnuai said he had ordered the government panel in charge of drawing up new laws, in cooperation with Chulalongkon University's Faculty of Law, to study money laundering laws already in use in other countries. "We have discussed the matter and all government agencies have given their full support," Amnuai said. "I have also raised the issue with the Bank of Thailand. There should be no problem (in introducing the law)." Amnuai, who oversees the Office of the Narcotics Control Board (ONCB), said he was advised by the anti-drug agency that such a law would make it difficult for drug traffickers to convert their proceeds into legal currencies and assets. "The measures against money laundering are a good thing. And it would not hurt law-abiding citizens either," Amnuai said. "No private individual's rights will be compromised." He sought to allay fears expressed by some members of the banking community and politicians that a money laundering law would turn away foreign investors and shoot down Thailand's aspiration to become a financial hub in Southeast Asia. "I don't think a money laundering law, if introduced, would affect local or foreign investors. And there is no question about whether commercial banks would cooperate with the government on the matter. All we need is appropriate guidelines and procedures. Amnuai said a money laundering law would require banks to report to law enforcement agencies "unusual transactions", particularly large cash deposits, by their clients." The anti-money laundering measures will seek to control and monitor cash transactions. No restrictions will be imposed on the issuance of personal cheques which can already be monitored." Senate Speaker Michai Ruchuphan, a legal expert, said a money laundering law was like a "two-edged sword" because although it would be useful as an instrument against drug traffickers and other organized crime, it would have a wide-ranging effect on all members of the public. "The money laundering law would affect everyone of us. The law would require everybody -- no matter who he is or what he does -- to identify the source of his money," Michai said. He said the government should carefully consider the advantages and drawbacks of such legislation before deciding whether to enact it. Among possible drawbacks is abuse of authority by government officials who have access to people's financial records. Earlier this week, Prime Minister Chuan Likphai said he approved of the proposal by anti-drug officials to introduce a money laundering law provided that it did not infringe upon the freedom of the individual. Also yesterday, John Gieve, president of the Group of Seven's Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) said senior Thai government officials he met during a two-day visit Thursday and yesterday had expressed support for the proposed introduction of a law to combat money laundering. Gieve, also under-secretary of the United Kingdom's Treasury, met Bank of Thailand Governor Wichit Suphinit on Thursday and Finance Minister Tharin Nimmanhemin yesterday, among other senior Thai officials. The FATF was established by the Group of Seven Economic Summit in 1989 to develop a multilateral response to the threat posed by the growth of international money laundering, particularly the laundering of drug trafficking proceeds. The body now has 26 member countries. FATF member countries in Asia-Pacific include Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong and Australia. Dilwyn Griffiths, secretary to the FATF, said although money laundering was never an issue in Thailand because the country has not made it a criminal offense, there must be some laundering activities given the fact that Thailand is a major transshipment point for heroin from the Golden Triangle to the world market.
