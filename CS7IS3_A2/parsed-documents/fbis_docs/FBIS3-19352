Over the last few months, we have witnessed an alarmism about the number of jobs lost or "in jeopardy," whereas over the last few weeks lots of figures have been provided on how many jobs could be created through measures that need to be adopted in all sectors. They range from flexibility in the job market to a policy of rigorous containment of public expenditure, from salary restraints to the use of taxes. Most of the cures cannot be compared, above all because they refer to different timeframes (two, three, five years) within which the objective of creating new jobs should be attained. The Government Plan According to the white paper drafted by Labor Minister Gino Giugni, "it is possible to put forward as an hypothesis, for the 1994-99 five year plan, the objective of an average 3 percent annual GDP growth rate. In this way 125,000 jobs would be created per year," an increase of 625,000 jobs over five years. However, the Labor Ministry sees this measure as totally insufficient to guarantee the European employment level convergence criteria. Thus, we need to adopt a medium-term strategy which aims at a 3 percent GDP increase, a development of human resources (raise compulsory school attendance to the age of 16, double the number of workers with a high-school diploma), an increase of "standardized flexibility" of working relations, and promotion of part-time work. This is to be based upon the commitments made by the government and the social partners in the July 1993 agreement. Luigi Spaventa's Recipe Budget Minister Spaventa, who is now election candidate on the Progressives' list, has focused on resuming public investments. In case 30 trillion lire is made available for public investments over three years, he claims that 300,000 jobs will be created. However, economic growth is only expected to be 1 percent a year, not enough to reactivate the job market. There is a need for greater flexibility, and forms of "gray work" substituting for "black work." Spaventa also proposes a substantive reduction in company contributions, which needs to be balanced by an "ecological tax," among other things. Confindustria's Forecasts In December 1993, the employers' federation had calculated that if 200 projects were to be released immediately (blocked thus far by bureaucracy) 60,000 people would get a job. As for the economy in general, Confindustria [General Confederation of Italian Industry] has put forward two opposing scenarios for the 1994-96 timeframe: the forecasts based upon the Ciampi government's policy, and those based upon a stricter control of inflation and public expenditures. In terms of employment, the differences in absolute figures deriving from the second scenario compared to the first are 55,000 more in 1994, 140,000 more in 1995, and 197,000 in 1996. These increases in the number of jobs would result from a considerable shifting of public expenditures from consumption to investments and from the complete elimination of health care contributions for labor, which would be financed through indirect taxes. In this case, inflation would be lower because the effect of indirect tax increases would be more than compensated for by a decrease in labor costs and an increase of productivity. Berlusconi's Promises The provision in Forza Italia's program to create 1 million jobs is based upon a series of propositions: lower taxes on new hires by reducing the fiscal and social security burden on labor costs, and to experiment in areas with high unemployment with "complete tax exemptions" for three years, with social security reductions for all activities aimed at creating jobs. Apprenticeships, professional training, and greater flexibility in the standards of the job market are other measures to which Berlusconi's job plan appeals.
