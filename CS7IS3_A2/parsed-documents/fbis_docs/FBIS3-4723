Nonetheless, the prospects for the coming year are not necessarily bright because imports are expected to increase sharply as economic growth speeds up and increasing foreign fund inflows will strengthen the won's value on the foreign exchange market. Together with anticipated high inflation, these factors will in turn blunt the competitive edge of Korean products on world markets. In addition, the yen's continued strength, which has helped sharpen the competitive edge of Korean exports, remains uncertain in the coming year. The Bank of Korea on Friday reported a current-account surplus of 450.3 million U.S. dollars for 1993, a striking reversal from the deficit of 4.528 billion dollars recorded the year before. A favorable trade balance and decreased remittances abroad thanks to the real-name financial transaction system are credited for the turnaround. The surplus was the first since the 5.054 billion dollars recorded in 1989. In the four years from 1986, the nation had enjoyed a favorable balance of international payments thanks to the three lows -- low oil prices, low wages and a weak won. In the ensuing three years, however, South Korea suffered current-account deficits due chiefly to high wages and failure in industrial restructuring, with deficits of 2.179 billion dollars in 1990 and 8,727 million dollars in 1991. In 1993, exports rose 7.8 percent to 81.023 billion dollars on a balance-of-payments basis and imports edged up 2.1 percent to 78, 946 million dollars to produce a surplus of 2,077 million dollars, compared with a deficit of 2,146 million dollars in 1992. The favorable trade balance was attributed to a two-digit increase in exports of heavy and chemical industry products and an upturn in light industry exports. The transfer account also recorded a surplus of 712 million dollars, up from 232 million dollars in 1992: Outward remittances fell from 1,744 million dollars in 1992 to 1,569 million dollars as a result of the real-name financial transaction system, while inward remittances rose from 1,817 million dollars to 1,825 million dollars. But invisible trade, including insurance and transportation, continued to suffer a deficit last year, though the amount fell from 2,614 million dollars in 1992 to 2,339 million dollars. The transportation account incurred a deficit of 3.029 billion dollars, while travel and investment-yield accounts suffered deficits of 589 million dollars and 1,339 million dollars, respectively. So Pyong-su, a research economist at the Bank of Korea, predicted a current account surplus of up to 1 billion dollars this year, saying shipments of light industry goods and exports to advanced countries are emerging from the doldrums. Increasing inflows of foreign capital on the strength of the economy's growth pace are feared to cause the won to appreciate in the foreign exchange market and this, together with uncertain price movements, makes it hard to make a reasonably accurate prediction for the coming year, he added. In capital transactions, a surplus of 6,751 million dollars was registered thanks to rises in foreign fund inflows for stock investment, in overseas issues of corporate bonds and other debts and in short-term trade credit. The central bank's foreign exchange holdings rose 3.11 billion dollars to 20.26 billion dollars last year from 1992.
