In a statement to the IRAQI NEWS AGENCY, the source said that these statements represent a desperate attempt to cover up the large-scale conspiracy being carried out by the U.S.-led colonialist forces through their agents in the region, including the rulers imposed on the Kuwaiti region, to plunder oil wealth. The source added that the current collapse in the world oil market and the drop in oil prices to levels unprecedented for years are due to the overproduction of oil by the Kuwaiti region and Saudi Arabia, which are pumping more than 10 billion barrels per day in order to flood the market, lower prices, and deprive their peoples and those of the developing countries of their only source of income. He asserted that what is going on in the market is a conspiracy being carried out by the rulers imposed on the Kuwaiti region and Saudi Arabia at the orders of their American masters to reduce oil prices and create obstacles to Iraq's return to the market. He said that these rulers are increasing their production of oil and dropping oil prices to delay Iraq's resumption of its legitimate role in exporting oil. The source said that Iraq's resumption of its natural right to export its oil will only have a positive repercussions on prices, and that the states which have shared Iraq's quota should reduce their production to allow the absorption of the quantities to be exported by Iraq. Concluding, the Oil Ministry source said: The return of Iraq, which believes in OPEC's principles and in the protection of the interests of its member states, will have positive repercussions that will serve its people's interests.
