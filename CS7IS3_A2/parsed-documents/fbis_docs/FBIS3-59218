[Van Miert] The Commission could not let such large public payments be made to a company in a normal commercial environment without reacting. The amounts transferred in December were already an illegal act, because paying them contravened the rules of the treaty. We did nothing new by making the decision to which you referred. We decided to apply the provisions laid down in the Community acts. Recently, for example, we demanded the reimbursement of two- thirds of the aid received by the company Grundig from the Austrian Government. Yet, Austria is not part of the Community. One should be aware that in the Grundig case, France wanted us to intervene in this way. The same is true for the steelmaking industry in Italy: The French Government felt the Commission's arbitration to be legitimate. The decisions we take on one side must also be taken on the other. That is a matter of consistency. [LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES] In other words, this was not an expression of distrust vis-a-vis the French authorities? [Van Miert] Not at all. [Foreign Trade Minister] Gerard Longuet made a lot of effort. He tried to come along with documents. The steps he took were correct. We can see that the minister is still going down the proposed path. We understand that there was a change and that that has consequences. However, we must also acknowledge that the explanations given to us by the French Government were insufficient and that we were extremely patient. [LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES] The French Government explained its hesitancy to give precise information about Bull because of its confidential nature. What do you think of that? [Van Miert] We are used to dealing with hundreds of matters under such conditions. It is a question of confidence. One thing is sure: We will not be in a position to make a decision based on the aid given to Bull until we have a detailed restructuring plan for the company. This plan must convince us of Bull's long-term viability. Otherwise, it will not even be possible to privatize the company. I can see that the industry minister is showing a desire to reorganize the group, but one must play by the rules of the Community game. [LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES] Is this recapitalization for full settlement, along with a privatization, not enough for you? [Van Miert] Absolutely not. This is not the first time that we have examined the Bull case. People have so often told us "You will find out what you find out" that we might be allowed to harbor a few doubts. We are responsible for getting to the bottom of this matter -- if only out of consideration for Bull's competitors. I have received many letters from foreign firms, including European ones, which do not understand our patience and which feel that this situation is intolerable and cannot go on. [LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES] Is there the possibility of the Commission asking for the aid received to by paid back? [Van Miert] At this stage, it is not possible to speculate and I refuse to do so. Let us examine the strategic plan and then we will see. However, it must be clear that I am not suspicious about France. I have confidence in Gerard Longuet and I can see that things are now moving at Bull. [LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES] What will the next stages entail? [Van Miert] I plan to meet with Gerard Longuet in the coming days and then use that meeting to get to the bottom of the Bull affair.
