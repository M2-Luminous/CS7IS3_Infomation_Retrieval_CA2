Every concerned citizen would agree with Mr. Sajjad's opinion about the deteriorating educational system in our country. Our educational system was never coordinated with the needs of the nation and we could not get rid of the British system of education even after independence. The main purpose of that educational system was to create office clerks. This system is totally decayed now because of bribery, nepotism, corruption, and political interference in schools. Cheating in examinations has become the rule. "Cheating mafia" and other control groups have taken over the examination centers. Kalishnakovs and political influence are used to allow students to openly cheat in examinations. Thus, some students pass examinations without learning anything, and the bright students who really want to learn are deprived of their right and feel discouraged. The political parties have affected the educational atmosphere in these institutions very badly. The students waste more time in political activities than in learning. Many schools are closed because of confrontations between student groups. The hands that should carry books carry kalishnakov rifles. Thus, we are moving towards degeneration very rapidly. The world is changing very fast and the speed with which science and technology are making progress calls for us to improve our educational system. However, because of our administrative weakness, dishonesty, and corruption, we are moving toward the goal of ignorance. This unfortunate situation has deteriorated so badly that mere ceremonial talks will not alleviate this problem. All sections of our society have to unite and try with full responsibility to improve this situation. Otherwise, our paralyzed education system will make Mr. Wasim Sajjad's fear that our national identity and existence is in danger become true. Our leaders should understand fully that unless we improve our educational system thoroughly, we will cannot make an important place for the nation at the international level.
