FR940822-2-00120 FR940822-2-00061 Demonstration and evaluation of communications technology, e.g.: interactive computerized information systems to assist pro se litigants; the use of FAX technology by courts; a multi-user ``system for judicial interchange'' designed to link disparate automated information systems and share court information among judicial system offices throughout a State without replacement of the various hardware and software environments which support individual courts; a compu-terized voice information system permitting parties to access by telephone information pertaining to their cases; an automated public information directory of courthouse facilities and services; an automated appellate court bulletin board; and a computer-integrated courtroom that provides full access to the judicial system for hearing-impaired jurors, witnesses, crime victims, litigants, attorneys, and judges. Demonstration and evaluation of records techno-logy, including: the development of a court management information display system; the integration of bar-coding technology with an existing automated case management system; an on-bench automated system for generating and processing court orders; an automated judicial education management system; testing of a document management system for small courts that uses imaging technology, and of automated telephone docketing for circuit-riding judges; and evaluation of the use of automated teller machines for paying jurors; and Court technology assistance services, e.g., circulation of a court technology bulletin designed to inform judges and court managers about the latest developments in court-related technologies; creation of a court technology laboratory to provide judges and court managers with the opportunity to test automated court-related systems; enhancement of a data base documenting automated systems currently in use in courts across the country; establishment of a technical information service to respond to specific inquiries concerning court-related technologies; development of court automation performance standards; and an assessment of programs that allow public access to electronically stored court information. Grants also provided support for national court technology conferences; preparation of guidelines on privacy and public access to electronic court information; the testing of a computerized citizen intake and referral service; development of an ``analytic judicial desktop system'' to assist judges in making sentencing decisions; implementation and evaluation of a Statewide automated integrated case docketing and record-keeping system; a prototype computerized benchbook using hypertext technology; and computer simulation models to assist State courts in evaluating potential strategies for improving civil caseflow. g.
