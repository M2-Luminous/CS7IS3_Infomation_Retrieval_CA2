FR940719-1-00009 FR940719-1-00002 As previously discussed, §923.55 of the order provides that whenever cherries are subject to grade, size, quality, maturity, pack or container regulations, those cherries must be inspected by the Federal-State Inspection Service (FSIS). Since this rule would establish minimum size and maturity requirements for Rainier variety cherries, such cherries would have to be inspected and certified by the FSIS as meeting the applicable requirements of the regulation. Based on available information, the Administrator of the AIMS has determined that this action would not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Interested persons are invited to submit their views and comments on this proposal. A 15-day comment period is deemed appropriate because the committee has held several meetings concerning the need to regulate Rainier variety cherries, and all interested persons were invited to participate and express their opinions on this issue. In addition, to be of maximum benefit to the industry, any regulation covering Rainier cherries should be in place for the 1994 season, which begins in mid-June, and adequate time is needed to advise producers and shippers. All written comments timely received will be considered before issuance of any final rule. List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 923 Cherries, Marketing agreements, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.
