Interviewed by the Colombian radio network RCN, Lage noted that the decision when and if to visit Cuba is up to Gaviria. Lage also stressed the open dialogue between the countries that began during President Fidel Castro's visit to Cartagena last August. He added that the fundamental purpose of his visit, as was that of Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina in December, is to further dialogue and the exploration of possibilities to increase economic, commercial, and political ties that began when diplomatic relations were resumed in October. Lage has met with the ministers of foreign commerce and agriculture and livestock and with the planning chief. He also held a long meeting with President Gaviria, the most important aspect of which, in Lage's opinion, was the frankness of the analysis of bilateral relations, the current situation, and problems between the two countries. In his conversation with RCN and statements published today by the daily EL ESPECTADOR, the Cuban leader recapped the different economic measures his government has adopted, including opening to foreign investment, and said all measures necessary to defend socialism will be adopted. Lage said tourism and the pharmaceutical industry have prompted great interest on the part of Colombian businessmen, with whom he held broad discussions today during a meeting organized by the Industrialists Association and attended by the major economic groups. When asked about the illegal departure of Cubans from the island, Lage replied that his country's policy is to allow emigration and that anyone who wishes to leave can obtain a visa. The United States, on the other hand, denies visas but then accepts and grants immediate residence to anyone who arrives illegally in that country. Lage also noted that the majority of people support the revolutionary system, which could not continue without this support. In replying to another question, he said that Cuba is the most drug-free country in the world, since it has no narcotics, corruption, or organized crime. Lage will conclude his visit today as the last leg of a tour that included Brazil and Venezuelan.
