FR940323-1-00057 FR940323-1-00007 II. Regulations Governing Eligibility of Indian Tribes A. The Existing Process The Agency has promulgated five regulations that utilize the ``TAS'' process to date: (1) Safe Drinking Water Act, National Drinking Water Regulations and Underground Injection Control Regulations for Indian Lands, 53 FR 37395 (September 26, 1988), codified at 40 CFR parts 35, 124, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, and 146; (2) Indian Tribes: Water Quality Planning and Management, 54 FR 14353 (April 11, 1989), Comprehensive Construction Grant Regulation Revision, 55 FR 27092 (June 29, 1990) (governing grant programs under the CWA), codified at 40 CFR parts 35 and 130; (3) Amendments to the Water Quality Standards Regulation that Pertain to Standards on Indian Reservations, 56 FR 64876 (December 12, 1991), codified at 40 CFR part 131; (4) Clean Water Act, section 404 Tribal Regulations, 58 FR 8171 (February 11, 1993), codified at 40 CFR parts 232 and 233; and (5) Treatment of Indian Tribes as States for Purposes of sections 308, 309, 401, 402, and 405 of the Clean Water Act (``NPDES'') rule, 58 FR 67966 (December 22, 1993), codified at 40 CFR parts 122, 123, 124 and 501. Under all of these regulations, before a tribe can obtain financial assistance available to states or obtain approval to operate a program which states are authorized to operate on state lands, the tribe must first formally qualify for ``treatment as a state.'' To qualify, a tribe must submit an application establishing that it is federally recognized, has a governing body carrying out substantial duties and powers, and has adequate jurisdiction and capability to carry out the proposed activities. Once a tribe obtains ``TAS'' approval, it is eligible to apply for financial assistance and program approval. 1. Recognition and Government A tribe typically establishes recognition by showing its inclusion on the list of federally recognized Tribes published by the Secretary of the Interior in the Federal Register . A tribe establishes that it meets the governmental duties and powers requirement with a narrative statement describing the form of the tribal government and the types of functions it performs, and identifying the sources of the tribe's governmental authority. 2. Jurisdiction and Capability To establish jurisdiction under the CWA grant regulations, a tribe must submit a statement signed by a tribal legal official explaining the legal basis for the Tribe's regulatory authority over its water resources. The CWA grant regulations do not require that a tribe submit any specific materials to establish capability. The other regulations specify that a tribe must submit various specific documents to establish jurisdiction, including: a map or legal description of the area over which the tribe claims jurisdiction; a statement by a tribal legal official describing the basis, nature, and subject matter of the tribe's jurisdiction; copies of all documents supporting the jurisdictional assertions; and a description of the locations of the systems or sources the tribe proposes to regulate. Similarly, to establish capability a tribe must submit a narrative statement describing tribal capability to administer an effective program, and certain specific, listed materials in support of that statement. 3. Comment Process Upon receiving a ``TAS'' application under these regulations, EPA notifies all ``appropriate governmental entities,'' 4 as to the substance of and basis for the jurisdictional assertions in the application, and invites comment on those assertions. Where comments raise a competing or conflicting jurisdictional claim, the Agency must consult with the Department of the Interior before making a final decision on the tribe's application. 4 The Agency defines this to include contiguous states, other tribes, and federal land agencies responsible for management of lands contiguous to the reservation. (Amendments to the Water Quality Standards Regulation that Pertain to Standards on Indian Reservations; Final Rule. 56 FR 64875, 64884 (December 12, 1991)). In response to public comments, EPA has considered, but decided against, providing interested political subdivisions of states, including local governments and water districts, the opportunity to comment on tribal jurisdictional assertions. Id . In practice, this comment process has sometimes led to delays in the processing and approval of tribal applications. Indeed, it has proven to be the single portion of ``TAS'' review most responsible for delays. The comment process also has created a perception that states have an oversight role in EPA's treatment of Indian tribes, which some tribes find objectionable, particularly since tribes have typically not been asked to offer their views on the scope and extent of state jurisdiction. 4. Subsequent Tribal Applications The regulations require a separate ``treatment as a state'' application for each program for which the tribe seeks such treatment. However, after an initial approval, applications for each additional program need provide only that additional information unique to the additional program. B. Workgroup Examination of Process The Agency's ``TAS'' prequalification process has proven to be burdensome, time-consuming and offensive to tribes. Accordingly, in 1992 EPA established a working group to focus on ways of improving and simplifying that process. The Agency formally adopted the Workgroup's recommendations as Agency policy by Memorandum dated November 10, 1992. That Memorandum explicitly recognized that the policies it adopted would require amendments to existing regulations. The purpose of this regulation is to propose amendments to existing regulations under the Safe Drinking Water and Clean Water Acts in order to implement the new policy. To the extent possible, the Agency plans to use the same process in future regulations regarding determinations of tribal eligibility.
