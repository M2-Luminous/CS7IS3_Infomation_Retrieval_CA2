Nastase mentioned that these consultations have only an exploratory character and that it is difficult to accomplish several steps in a brief time, given the big differences between parties in approaching various issues. However, for the time being it is very clear that the revitalization of the executive is necessary because the only realistic formula today is a monocolor, reshuffled PDSR government, meaning that it will be a government that has acquired a greater degree of competence and efficiency. The parliamentary forces on both sides of the political spectrum will be able to support such a government in accordance with the initiatives that the executive is going to suggest. Adrian Nastase did not wish to mention for the time being which are the portfolios that will be affected by the reshuffle, but stressed that the modifications in the government team could be carried out very soon. Mircea Cosea, state minister and president of the Council for Coordination, Strategy, and Economic Reform, also talked about negotiations between political parties during an interview broadcast on Bucharest Radio this morning. He mentioned that there is a very encouraging development on this subject, meaning that the mutual accusations of anti-reformism have disappeared and the sides reached a stage where they accept reform as the only chance to come out of the current impasse. Likewise, the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate have given positive signs in connection with the memorandum concluded with the IMF and there is justified hope that in a reasonable time, the few laws that are still to be passed by the parliament and which are unquestionably necessary for the implementation of the memorandum will be adopted and will serve as a basis to reformulating the prognosis for 1994, an activity to start as early as next month. Mircea Cosea warned the population that this year no economic miracle or a radical improvement of production and life conditions should be expected, but rather a gradual, step by step accumulation and a positive tendency, which would permit the revival of economic activity. Privatization will have to be accelerated indeed because it is high time to move on from words to facts. Thus, as of May 1994, the enterprises put on sale will be auctioned and thus a secondary market will be created for ownership certificates. Cosea also announced that Iacob Zelenco was appointed secretary of state at the Privatization Agency on the basis of his experience and competence. As far as the issue of attracting foreign investors is concerned, substantial progress has been achieved in negotiations with important firms such as [?Credit Bank] and [name indistinct] and finalization of accord is expected with the latter during President Ion Iliescu's upcoming visit to South Korea. Mircea Cosea also approached the issue of inflation and increase of prices, which he considered as being normal for the present situation, when the issue of exchange rate is being worked out. He added that certainly, in the second half of this year, a more adequate rate of inflation will be reached as wel as a relative decrease of prices. His conclusion was that our country has reached a phase of real and irreversible reform, which consists of a more alert pace of privatization and restructuring but also a more careful evaluation of social costs of transition.
