Clinton has announced the capture of the biggest foreign spy in the U.S. intelligence service. Aldrich Ames, a 52-year-old CIA staffer, had worked since 1985 first for the Soviet KGB and then for its Russian successors. The president called this a "very serious case" and stated that an official protest would be made to the Russian Government. Russian charge d'affaires ad interim V. Chkhikvishvili was summoned to the State Department where Secretary of State W. Christopher presented him with a protest note. The Russian Federation Embassy has reported that the note contains nothing to indicate the likelihood of a complication in relations between the two countries. Nor does it contain a call for any actions by the Russian authorities. Nonetheless T. Pickering, the U.S. ambassador to Moscow, has been instructed to lodge an official protest with the Russian Government. A. Ames was arrested on Monday on his way to work, where he headed an anti-drugs subdivision. Soon his 41-year-old wife Maria was also arrested at home. According to information which is coming in she was also a paid CIA staffer -- but also a better paid Russian agent. In a statement issued in her name Attorney General Janet Reno also called the case "extremely serious." The majority of experts here agree, taking into account that before he was moved to the drug fighting department Aldrich Ames had for a number of years headed the counterintelligence service resisting the Soviet Union. R. Kessler, author of the well-known book The CIA from the Inside, who swiftly questioned his acquaintances in that organization, believes that A. Ames was informed of all the CIA's secret operations connected with the USSR and Russia. President Clinton has ordered an immediate investigation into the size of the damage to U.S. national security. It could be colossal, considering that America has few intelligence links left of whose reliability it can be firmly confident. Over the past decades the communist states' intelligence services have incurred very serious losses. Despite the high professional reputation of the relevant services of the GDR, Czechoslovakia, and the Soviet Union, the wounds inflicted by traitors in high positions were too deep. The actions of V. Penkovskiy, who worked successfully for the West for several years, really shook the USSR's defensive system. The collapse of the KGB networks in Britain, Italy, and Sweden have been described in sufficient detail in Western literature. The impression was created that since the era of Kim Philby and his renowned Cambridge colleagues who were the glory of the NKVD-MGB-KGB all that is best in Soviet intelligence is in the past. If all the buzzing in the U.S. mass media today is true then in 1985 the Soviet special services made a breakthrough to sources of enormous value by recruiting A. Ames and his wife. In contrast to Philby, Burgess, and the other aces of espionage, Ames and his wife found the fascination of serving the Soviet Union lay not in ideological unity but in the level of remuneration. Radio and television reports are announcing not without concealed delight that the USSR and Russia paid the Ames over $1.5 million. The generous payments, many times in excess of the family's official income, proved fatal to it. Calculations showed that in the period between April 1985 and November 1993 Aldrich was able to take home no more than $335,164, but during this time the Ames' spent at least $1.3 million. They bought a house in Arlington, a suburb of Washington, for $540,000. They made ostentatious purchases with their seemingly unlimited credit cards: in all $455,000. They bought a Jaguar sports car for $25,000 -- an automobile which is not so much expensive as provocatively useless for a normal working family. Yet the majority of CIA employees are people of very modest means by U.S. standards. They do not throw money about themselves and are very suspicious of those colleagues who are inclined to luxury. President Clinton said he was informed long ago that the Ames' were under constant observation. Top secret documents with no direct bearing on his activity were found in Aldrich's official cupboard. They managed to establish his method of communication with his patrons from the Russian intelligence services. The meetings took place after a discreet sign drawn in chalk appeared somewhere on a mailbox in Georgetown not far from the Russian housing complex. Incidentally, that was the subject of the couple's "spy" talk which was recorded on tape and has been broadcast on the radio several times. Maria was asking angrily why he was slow in drawing the sign and Aldrich was trying to justify himself, saying that there was heavy rain and the chalkmark would be washed away at once. By studying the contents of the trash cans outside the Ames' house U.S. counterintelligence agents discovered last September old tapes from his computer printer and (or) typewriter. Laboratories had no difficulty in reconstituting the printed texts from which advance information was obtained about a meeting with Russian agents scheduled in Caracas, the capital of Venezuela. He was an experienced agent and had served in Turkey and Mexico and was then responsible for recruiting Soviet officials and in particular KGB officers. He was promoted for his successes in this job, heading the department for fighting Soviet intelligence. But he probably came up against a top-class Soviet professional, who cunningly recruited him in turn. The materials handed to the court to obtain an arrest warrant for the Ames' bear out that they had passed on to the Russian special services information about CIA operations and personnel. Their activity against the United States began in 1985 although the CIA suspected the existence of a well concealed Soviet agent in its ranks at the end of the seventies. If the court fines the Ames' guilty they face life imprisonment and a fine of $250,000. President Clinton called the exposure of the Ames' a "very good joint operation by the FBI and the CIA." The CIA has no right to operate on U.S. territory although it gave the FBI full assistance in exposing its employee. FBI Director Louis Freeh paid tribute to his CIA colleagues for their readiness "to help us unhesitatingly at each step" of the investigation, and CIA Director James Woolsey noted in an official statement that "this joint effort shows how our counterintelligence agents and FBI employees have cooperated over the recent period." This mutual praise is an indirect response to criticism of past years when differences between the two intelligence departments allowed CIA staffer E. Howard to flee to Moscow in 1985 and betray several U.S. agents to the KGB. U.S. observers are angered most by the perfidy of Russia which, they say, is seeking new aid from the United States yet itself spending millions of dollars on anti-American espionage. The picture of intelligence hostilities since the end of the Cold War has become motley and chaotic. The countries with powerful special services -- the USSR, the GDR, and Czechoslovakia -- no longer exist. The successors to the GDR and Czechoslovakia have completely halted their work against the West. Russia has not and is believed to have no intention of doing so, primarily because such activity against it has not ceased for a moment. The commentaries of experts, who include many former professional intelligence workers, contain anger at the fact that, tempted by the Russian millions, Ames betrayed many U.S. agents to Moscow. Although this claim is to all appearances true it also attests to the hypocrisy of this anger since Russia has no less right to secret operations in the United States than America has to espionage in Russia. On Tuesday U.S. journalists laid siege to the Russian Embassy in Washington requesting comments on the main sensation of the week. In the absence of a response from Moscow this was impossible. Accepted practice is for governments to keep quiet if agents working for their countries are exposed. The State Department asserts that questions connected with Aldrich and Maria Ames may be raised with Russian Foreign Minister A. Kozyrev if there is confirmation of persistent rumors that he is coming to Washington toward the end of the week.
