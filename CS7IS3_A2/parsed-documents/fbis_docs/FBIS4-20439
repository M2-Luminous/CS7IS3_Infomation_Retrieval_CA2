The results indicated that there was a positive correlation between AT and body weight (BW) (P < 0.01) and a negative correlation between AT and heart rate (HR) during stepping exercise on a 40 cm stool at a frequency of 25 step/min for 5 min (P < 0.01). Further, it was found that AT was correlated with BW and HR (r = 0.799). The multiple regression equation was Y = 126.8278 + 1.4625 BW - 0.8213 HR, where Y is estimated value of AT (w); BW is body weight (kg); HR is heart rate during stepping exercise (beats/min). In order to test their reliability, AT was determined in another 24 males exposed to an altitude of 3700 m with the same method (group 2). The analysis showed that measured value of AT was highly correlated with that estimated by the regression equation. Coefficient of correlation, slope and standard error of estimate were 0.820 (p < 0.01), 1.292 and 6.7 w (8.6 percent), respectively. This slope was statistically not different from that for group 1 (1.001). It is suggested that the regression equation can be used in evaluation and investigation of aerobic capacity and physical work capacity in men exposed to high altitude of 3700 m for longer time.
