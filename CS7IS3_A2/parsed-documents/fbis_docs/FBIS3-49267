[Krasnicky] How stable is the coalition after 18 months of existence? [Lux] Just as it was at the beginning. It will last for the entire electoral term. [Krasnicky] The Civic Democratic Party [ODS] represents 30 percent of all voters, your party just 6 percent. The ODS members dominate the Cabinet. Does their greater responsibility imply also a greater "right" to enforce their views? [Lux] I reject any deliberation on diverse responsibilities. It is the same in the coalition. The only difference is in strength. The ODS is the strongest in the coalition, and it also uses the strength. The equality of the parties is given by the coalition treaty. If equality of the parties did not exist, we could speak not about a coalition but about a vassalage. The fundamental issues must be accepted by all coalition parties. [Krasnicky] At the Olomouc congress of the Christian Democratic Party [KDS], you delivered a speech that has been favorably viewed by the KDS members. Is an association of the two parties feasible? [Lux] It is true that I felt as if I was among good friends at the KDS conference. We have the same ideological basis, the same world view.... If I compare our policy statement with the KDS program, it is difficult to distinguish any substantial differences. Therefore, I see a lot of room for practical cooperation at all levels. The need for this cooperation is even more urgent if we realize that the Christian democratic concept of politics truly is the universal political alternative to all socialist and liberal egotist models. I hope that together we will be able to push through our model. I myself have two ambitions: first, to prove to people that it is not necessary for them to attend church services to be able to vote for a party with a Christian democratic program, as the propaganda is trying to make them believe, and second, that social regard and solidarity are not prerogatives of the left wing but, rather, are characteristic for us. [Krasnicky] Public opinion surveys regularly attribute to you relatively few votes near the magic 5-percent limit. Does it make you uneasy? Do you believe that the third time around, in the 1996 parliamentary elections, you will be lucky again and manage to keep slightly above the limit? [Lux] We do not feel at all uneasy. We work according to our concept, holding the entire four-year electoral cycle in perspective. The mistrust in election results that you indicated is based purely on lack of knowledge of our party. No other party has dared to advocate, at first sight, so many unpopular issues as ours. One instance is agriculture. Some people whispered to me: Do not touch the farmers; you would lose traditional voters. I am convinced that it is necessary for this country to reduce the number of farmers by 50 percent, as is usual in the world, and therefore I am pushing through certain measures. Similarly, I refused to continue the practice of granting subsidies from the state treasury to private farmers and for each hectare. If they farmed individually, those 5- and 10-hectare farmers would soon go bankrupt anyway because such small farms cannot be competitive. I told them this immediately. Many have held it against me until today, but most understood that this saved them from the unhappy fate of bankrupts, and they will further combine in larger partnerships.
