FBIS4-46347 "jptot024__l94024" JPRS-TOT-94-024-L JPRS Terrorism FOUO 6 June 1994 EAST ASIA PHILIPPINES Abu Sayyaf Group Bomb Detonates in Zamboanga City Abu Sayyaf Group Bomb Detonates in Zamboanga City Police Launch Manhunt BK0606080794 Quezon City PTV-4 Television Network in Tagalog 0500 GMT 6 Jun 94 BK0606080794 Quezon City PTV-4 Television Network Tagalog BFN [Text] The government has launched a massive man-hunt operation against the Abu Sayyaf group in connection with the bombing incident in Zamboanga City, which wounded 32 people. The Philippine National Police [PNP] ordered the manhunt following the severe explosion, which took place at around 8:30 P.M. [Philippine time) along Urdaneta and Tomas Claudio Streets in Zamboanga City. PNP Director for Operation (Sagerico) Kagawan said that this was probably a tactic of the Abu Sayyaf group to divert the attention of the military and police from their continued operations in Sulu. [Begin Kagawan recording] As of now, about 10 local leaders, both civilian and military, are negotiating with the Abu Sayyaf for them to come out and maybe surrender. And of course they will be accorded due process. [end recording] Meanwhile, military and police authorities have announced that they are ready to stop any operations against the Abu Sayyaf group. This was announced by Kagawan in spite of the ongoing operation staged by the combined forces of the police and the military. Based on the latest report, the military and police have already started besieging the island of Patikul, where 40 rebels have already been killed -- including one of the leaders of Abu Sayyaf, who was alleged to be responsible for the kidnappings in Mindanao -- while government troops suffered six casualties. Kagawan said that the rebels still have the opportunity to surrender and enjoy their rights of due process. [Begin Kagawan recording] It is very logical; it's part of their strategy. They usually do such things to ease the pressure there in Patikul. They have to create a diversion, giving an impression that they also have a sizable force in Zamboanga so that maybe some of the forces that are utilized there in Patikul will have to be withdrawn and run after the perpetrators there in Zamboanga. It's like you dissipate the forces so that maybe the pressure on you will decrease. [end recording]
