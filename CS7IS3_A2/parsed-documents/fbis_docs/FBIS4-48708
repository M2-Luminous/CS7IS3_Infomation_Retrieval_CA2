Some parties expressed concern over the implementation of the Reconstruction and Development Plan and the amnesty issue. But politicians across the political spectrum said it would boost investor confidence. [Correctional Services spokesman Sipho Mzimela] I think it was a very comprehensive speech. It dealt with all the major areas which government has to attend to and it touched on the major issues and problems which are facing the county. So in that sense I think it's a very good speech. [Freedom Front leader Constand Viljoen in Afrikaans] I think the reconstruction program which President Mandela talks about is a very ambitious plan. He is talking about big amounts of money. I hope it will be possible. For it to become possible will entirely depend on a, Foreign aid, and b, to what extent our economy is going to produce. There is quite a strong feeling among many people that the economy can pick up strongly. I hope that will be the case because if the economy is not strong, then we will not be in a position to get this reconstruction program off the ground. [Minister Without portfolio Jay Naidoo] I believe it's a very realistic program. It offers us a kick start to the Reconstruction Development Program and we are wanting to deliver the goods now. And that is what the president has instructed us to do, and that is what we are going to do. [Democratic Party acting leader Tony Leon] The Democratic Party is very encouraged by the tone and by the content of the speech. We think President Mandela went a long way toward reassuring all the communities which need to be brought into nation-building and reconciliation, particularly the financial and investment community. [Pan Africanist Congress leader Clarence Makwetu] Well, it is not easy for me to comment on the speech as it is, but it was a well balanced one because it covered quite a number of issues affecting our country -- the issues like health, gender issues, education, unemployment, housing etcetera. And these are the issues we need to address. [Environmental Affairs, Tourism Minister Dawie de Villiers] I think it is a speech that will encourage confidence. The president succeeded in marrying the objectives of the Reconstruction and Development Program with sound economic and financial management. I believe the speech will be well received by the private sector. [end recording]
