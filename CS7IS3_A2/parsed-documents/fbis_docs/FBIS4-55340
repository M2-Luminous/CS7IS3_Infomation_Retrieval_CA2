According to reliable information, the aggressor will withdraw by tomorrow morning 3 km from the center of Gorazde, from both banks of the Drina River. In order to make this possible, the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army will temporarily hand over the point Mala Biserna to the control of a British unit of the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR]. If the aggressor does not comply with the agreement in full, the British have given guarantees that the positions on Mala Biserna will be returned to the Gorazde defenders at 1200 on 14 May. This offer has been conveyed to our side by the aggressor via UNPROFOR. Sefid Buljubasic, commander of the Eastern Bosnian Operative Group, has informed the General Staff about this offer. President Izetbegovic has agreed to the plan since the departure of the Serbian aggressor creates the conditions not only for the further normalization of life in the enclave, but also for the return of the expelled population to the right bank of the Drina River. This is contained in a statement from the office of the president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency.
