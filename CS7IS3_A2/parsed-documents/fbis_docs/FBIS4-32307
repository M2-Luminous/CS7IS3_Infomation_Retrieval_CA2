However, none of these groupings can afford to wield self-governmental power on their own. All of them must hold talks on the formation of a coalition. In democratic states, local policy does not have much to do with policies conducted in a given country's capital. In gminas [smallest administrative units], even municipal gminas, there is more that links people together than there are differences on Wiejska Street [location of the Sejm]. I am afraid, however, that typical Polish scenarios may emerge. Thus, UW may set up self-governmental coalitions with the right wing only because this fits the image of an opposition (on Wiejska Street) party. Then municipal authorities may be in programmatic opposition to parliament and the government, based on the coalition of the Polish Peasant Party and the SLD. It will be a political game. The issue of indispensable self-governmental reforms will become politicized; UW will lose its virtue of freedom because it will become involved in compromises and activities pushing it to the right. As can be seen, the selection of partners for municipal self-governmental coalitions will contribute to changes in both the character and the programs of parliamentary parties.
