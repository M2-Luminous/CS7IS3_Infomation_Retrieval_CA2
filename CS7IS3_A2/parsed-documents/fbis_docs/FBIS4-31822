In the first part of his memoirs, Josip Manolic for the first time reveals a bewildering fact: The war between the Croats and Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina costs Croatia three million German marks a day! In the first installment of GLOBUS's feuilleton "Political History of Croatia from 1989 to 1994," the vice chairman and founder of the Croatian Independent Democrats, Josip Manolic, who five years ago, together with Dr. Franjo Tudjman, founded the Croatian Democratic Community, and who from 1990 to present occupied a series of very important state and party positions, talks about how the Croatian currency came to be named the "kuna" [marten], how preparations were made for introduction of the Croatian dinar, how much the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina cost Croatia, and who actually oversaw the money that Croatian emigres collected for the needs of national defense. At last year's final session of the Assembly on 29 July 1993, prior to the annual vacation, the Law on Changes in the Law on the National Bank of Croatia was adopted. One of the changes was in the name of the Croatian currency: The expression "Croatian kruna" was replaced by the word "kuna," while "banica," as one-one hundredth of the Croatian kruna, was replaced by "lipa." The original text of the Law on the National Bank, with the designations "Croatian kruna" and "banica," which were replaced by "kuna" and "lipa" last summer, was adopted in early November 1992. Thus, the Croatian Assembly changed the name of the Croatian currency twice in only nine months! "Historically, the Croatian currency has never been called the kuna," says Mr. Manolic. "Marten furs were only one form of exchanging goods back when currency did not even exist in the Croatian region, just as sea shells, goats, or sheep were also used. Thus, marten furs were only a means of barter payment, so that the name `kuna' for Croatian money cannot be derived from any genuine tradition. By the same token, the currency could be called `koza' [goat] or `ovca' [sheep] just as easily as `kuna,'" Manolic believes. "Prior to last year's decision on changes in the Law on the National Bank of Croatia, the kuna had been legal tender only in the Independent State of Croatia [NDH--World War II fascist state]. Personally, I feel that historically speaking there is in fact no reason whatsoever to call Croatian money kuna, but also that the name of money is not a critical political question. That certainly did not appear to be the case when the decision on the name of money was adopted, when the state leadership obviously did not consider all the consequences of the name `kuna' for the new Croatian currency." [Butkovic] Do you think that it is a good thing politically for the money of the new Croatian state to be named after the money of the state that was on the wrong side in World War II? [Manolic] No, of course that is not good. We here have not yet confronted the fact that during that period of history, in only four years, there were a very large number of pogroms against members of other nations who lived and live in Croatia, but also against many Croats. We must now be realistic. Neither Jews nor Serbs will be able to accept the kuna as their currency. In addition, although it was a state, the NDH was not a bright spot to which anything in present-day Croatia should be linked. [Butkovic] How was the name "kuna" even selected? Who insisted upon it? [Manolic] It is obvious that some people felt nostalgia for the symbols of a certain period that was not the happiest one for Croatia. But that was not the only reason. Specifically, in the initial period after the Croatian Democratic Community victory, in 1990, the prevalent conviction among the party leadership due to the euphoric--and nationalistic--attitude of the victors was that all the symbols of the new state must have a radically Croatian quality to them, so that the majority of HDZ leaders at the time were in favor of the kuna, as a symbol of something Croatian that was banned for 45 years. After the homeland war and amid international recognition of Croatia, the mood became more sober. Then, the prevalent conviction was that it is more sensible and useful to call the Croatian currency the Croatian kruna, which was in fact enacted in the Law on the National Bank of Croatia of November 1992. But then the attitude that the kuna is a better solution came to prevail. Mr. Manolic remembers well who decided that the Croatian currency should be called the kuna, and when. [Manolic] During the period of initial discussion of changes in the Law on the National Bank of Croatia, a meeting of 14 prominent deputies of the Croatian Democratic Community--the majority of whom are not currently in my new party--was held at the Assembly. Of the 14 of them, 12 were opposed to the kuna, and only two were for it! Shortly thereafter, at a meeting of the Presidency of the Croatian Democratic Community, Dr. Tudjman said that the new Croatian currency must be called the kuna and that the Law on the National Bank of Croatia must be changed to that end. At that meeting, Dr. Tudjman instructed the chairmen of HDZ parliamentary caucuses that all deputies of the Croatian Democratic Community must vote for the kuna! [Butkovic] Thus, the president himself insisted on the name kuna? [Manolic] Yes, at a meeting of the Presidency of the Croatian Democratic community held last year, he stipulated that the new Croatian currency be called the kuna. The Assembly deputies simply executed his decision. [Butkovic] How did Dr. Tudjman explain his insistence on the kuna? [Manolic] He said that the kuna is one of the expressions of the Croatian nation-building tradition. Specifically, although Dr. Tudjman participated in the war against the NDH, he nevertheless regarded the Independent State of Croatia as an element in the Croatian nation-building tradition, and for that reason he wanted the kuna specifically, as the currency of that regime and as a symbol of that nation-building approach, to become the official Croatian currency. [Butkovic] How did Dr. Tudjman defend the kuna against the objections of international and domestic public opinion? [Manolic] At the time of the adoption of the decision by the HDZ Presidency, but not by the Assembly, he did not accept any negative consequences whatsoever of the name kuna--not only from an international, but also from a domestic-policy viewpoint. I repeat once more that we cannot serious count on reintegration of the occupied territories with things like the kuna. [Butkovic] Who was for the kuna in the Croatian Democratic Community, and who was against it? [Manolic] Pressure to rename the currency the kuna was exerted by the Herzegovinan lobby. At the time, I got the impression that Tudjman made that decision under pressure from the Herzegovinans, as a concession to the Herzegovinan lobby. However, there were many other prominent HDZ figures besides the Herzegovinans who defended the kuna. One of them was academician Dalibor Brozovic, by no means an ardent rightwinger or nationalist, but who did support the kuna. On the other hand, Ivan Aralica presented arguments against the kuna. Almost no one from the President Tudjman's innermost circle, including the president himself, was willing to listen to him. I spoke out openly against the kuna on several occasions, contending that such a name for the Croatian currency will only be politically damaging to the Republic of Croatia. [Butkovic] Still, at the end of last July, after bitter parliamentary debate in which nearly all opposition Assembly deputies cogently challenged the HDZ bill on changing the Law on the National Bank of Croatia, that proposal passed, thanks to the unanimous support of Croatian Democratic Community deputies. It is interesting that the HDZ, in which bitter factional infighting had been going on for some time, was unwilling to split over the name of the currency. Why? [Manolic] We felt that the name of the currency was too minor an issue to provoke a serious political split in the HDZ. That is why we preferred to remain silent, so that the majority of HDZ deputies voted with the party's--i.e., Tudjman's--decision. We felt that it was much more important for our money to be solid and stable than for us to quarrel and expose our positions in the then-internal struggle on the issue of what the currency is called.... [Butkovic] Speaking of the name of the currency, what did the leaders of the government have to say about that? [Manolic] No one asked the government anything about it. I repeat: The decision on the name of the Croatian currency was made by Dr. Tudjman under pressure from the Herzegovinan lobby, and the government was given the task of implementing that decision. It is a major illusion to think that the government could have had any degree of autonomy in that regard. Both the government and the National Bank of Croatia had to obey President Tudjman's decisions, and they have never been autonomous in making important political or personnel decisions. [Butkovic] The Croatian currency first began to be discussed in earnest at the end of 1990 and the beginning of 1991, during the first attempts at a Yugoslav coup against the legally elected authorities of the Republic of Croatia and the Republic of Slovenia. Shortly thereafter, Serbia conducted the famous raid on the SFRY [Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] monetary system, when more than $1 billion "disappeared," which dealt the death blow to the convertibility of Ante Markovic's dinar. Soon the war broke out, so that it became necessary to introduce a Croatian currency. However, it is a less-known fact that the founders of the HDZ were thinking about the need to introduce Croatian currency back while the communists were still in power in Croatia.... [Manolic] When we founded the Croatian Democratic Community, our goal was to emancipate Croatia from Yugoslavia. That meant creating all the instruments of an independent state, including Croatian currency. Thus, we were planning the introduction of Croatian currency back in the early 1990's.... [Butkovic] When was it decided to actually introduce the currency? Did the first armed fighting with Serb rebels around Easter 1991 influence the final decision to introduce Croatian currency? [Manolic] In my judgment, the war did not begin at Easter 1991, but rather on 17 August 1990, when the Serb rebels erected the first barricades at Knin. Even then, what was going to happen had to be clear to all mature people in Croatia. But as far as currency is concerned, we had to follow our other political decisions. As you know, we did not simply want to leave Yugoslavia. We wanted to separate from Yugoslavia in order not to leave a huge amount of property in Belgrade's hands, so-called federal property, in the creation of which Croatia played the biggest role. Negotiations on distributing that property are still going on, and have been very unsuccessful. Similarly, no peace agreement detailing compensation for war damages has yet been signed since the end of this war. Thus, we wanted to separate from the SFRY, with maximum protection of all those rights, all that property that we created in the SFRY. The decision to introduce an independent monetary unit could be made only in the context of that separation process, and that is why I think it is unjustified to claim that Croatia could have introduced its own--albeit temporary--monetary unit, the Croatian dinar, before the end of 1991. [Butkovic] How long did it take to prepare for introduction of the Croatian dinar? [Manolic] The intensive preparations took around six months. The main role in these preparations was played by the minister of finance at the time, (the now late) Marijan Hanzekovic. During that time, there was much discussion of the economic justification of introducing Croatian currency, about printing costs. I recall that there were negotiations with numerous foreign money printers, that an effort was made to reduce costs as much as possible. [Butkovic] Who made the decision on the exact date for introducing the Croatian currency? Is it true that in the Government of Democratic Unity, under the prime ministership of Franjo Greguric, there was a desire to introduce the Croatian dinar for use as soon as possible? [Manolic] It is true that there were tendencies in the government to speed up the introduction of our own currency. But it was really impossible for preparations to take less than six months. At that time, Croatia was in the middle of the homeland war, and was unable to function normally. Naturally, the decision on when to introduce the Croatian dinar was made by the president of the republic. Even though it had a multiparty composition, the Greguric government too was by no means autonomous in relation to the president of the republic, even though that impression existed among the public. [Butkovic] During the period when the currency was being replaced, rumors circulated to the effect that large quantities of the replaced Yugoslav money was ending up in Croat towns in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Is that true? [Manolic] It is true that there was a great deal of manipulation present during replacement of the currency. I cannot tell you about the nature of those manipulations. There are still living witnesses to those events who could tell you exactly what happened. [Butkovic] As head of the Office for the Protection of Constitutional Order at the time, do you really not know where the bags of Yugoslav dinars ended up? [Manolic] The intelligence and counterintelligence services were unable and unauthorized to deal with that problem. Other people were responsible for placement of the Yugoslav dinars, and they can now give you all the necessary explanations. After the first eight almost idyllic months of the Croatian dinar's existence, amid Greguric's "programmed inflation" of 10 to 15 percent a month, hyperinflation erupted in Croatia after the Croatian Democratic Community won the August 1992 elections, and that hyperinflation completely devalued the Croatian dinar and lasted nearly 14 months. Josip Manolic, at that time the head of the intelligence service and President Tudjman's closest associate, explains now that entering into hyperinflation was a necessary political move. [Manolic] Hyperinflation was the only way to finance the Croatian state. Croatia exhausted all its financial resources on the homeland war, and one must not forget that the Dubrovnik seaboard was not liberated until June 1992. All funds and all reserves were exhausted, and there was no chance of borrowing money from anyone. In order to survive, in order to be able to pay for the state's most elementary needs, such as weapons and maintenance of the armed forces, we had to enter into hyperinflation. That is why I think that it is important to say that the supposed weakness of the Croatian dinar was not the cause of the hyperinflation. The state simply had no money, so that hyperinflation was the only possible political decision. At that time, we had no opportunities whatsoever for foreign loans or revenues from tourism, nor for any real revival of the economy. That is why we decided to finance the state through inflation.... [Butkovic] But during that time, when the state had no money for the most elementary needs, so that it had to cause hyperinflation, state institutions decided to purchase a presidential airplane and a number of luxury cars. Who made the decision to buy the Challenger, worth at least $12 million? [Manolic] The decision to buy the presidential airplane was made by the president himself. The president felt that as a statesman, he must have a corresponding airplane, that such an airplane is a symbol of Croatian statehood. I actually do not know how much the presidential airplane cost. As far as the cars are concerned, however, I must say that they were acquired at an exceptionally favorable price. Specifically, used cars were bought for the needs of the Assembly. For example, my official BMW Series 5 cost no more than 7,000 German marks [DM]. [Butkovic] At a time of hyperinflation, the Croatian state not only enriched its motor pool and housing fund for state officials, but also--which is much worse--entered into the war with Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina through the HVO [Croat Defense Council] and Herceg-Bosna. In recent public appearances, you have alleged that that war cost Croatia an exceptional amount of money. Thus far, however, you have not mentioned any concrete figures. [Manolic] The war in Bosnia-Herzegovina contributed essentially to the impoverishment of the population of the Republic of Croatia. At the beginning of open Croat-Muslim fighting, wages in Croatia were below DM200. It can be proven that the state funds would be incomparably fuller, that various beneficiaries of the budget, from teachers to doctors, would have at least somewhat higher wages, if the Republic of Croatia had not had to finance the Croatian Defense Council's war against the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina. [Butkovic] Can you estimate how much money Croatia spent on the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina? [Manolic] There are only unofficial estimates of how much was spent on the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. But I do think that a more or less accurate figure can be calculated. There were 63,000 to 64,000 soldiers fighting the Muslims. All those soldiers had to be paid. All those soldiers consumed a certain amount of ammunition each day. A certain number of shells were launched, and the average price of a shell is DM50. To all of that you must add logistical costs. All together, the war with the Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina cost the Republic of Croatia at least DM3 million a day! Since the war lasted nearly one year, it can be estimated that that war cost us a total of nearly DM1 billion. The question is how impoverished Croatia could allow itself to finance such a politically and economically suicidal war! [Butkovic] One of the most important sources of financing Croatian defensive needs was money sent to the homeland from the diaspora. Today, however, it is unclear what actually happened to that money, how much money actually arrived in Croatia, on what it was all spent, and who controlled the bank accounts to which the money from the emigre community was deposited.... [Butkovic] Not one state or party body ever received a report on the money that arrived from the emigre community for defensive needs. Recently, at one of the last meetings of the National Security Council, at which I was present, the issue of this money was raised. As in the past, we did not get a single concrete response.... [Butkovic] How did the money arrive in Croatia from the emigre community? [Manolic] Our emigres began sending money back while Yugoslavia still existed, because it was seen immediately that Croatia must prepare for defense. During that period, we opened several accounts at foreign banks, because we did not want that money to go to the SFRY, to be seized by the Yugoslav authorities. After Croatia became definitively independent, there was no longer any need for our emigres' money to be deposited in secret accounts abroad, but that practice continued nevertheless. The money was never moved to Croatia from the foreign accounts, and not a single state body ever received any explanation of why that was so! [Butkovic] Who oversaw that money? [Manolic] From the very beginning, Minister Gojko Susak was responsible for gathering money from the diaspora. He is probably the only person who knows what all happened to the money gathered for national defense, and he has not submitted an account statement for that money to anyone. Minister Susak and the president of the republic were the only ones with authority to sign on all the accounts into which money for the defensive needs of Croatia arrived. The majority of other state officials knew nothing about that. We were unable to get any more detailed information about the spending of that money, or even about the actual amounts. [Butkovic] Can you give at least a ballpark figure for how much money Croatian emigres sent in for national defense? [Manolic] Most likely it involves at least several hundred million dollars, about which almost no one in the state leadership knows where it was spent. That is a question to which Minister Susak, who from the very beginning was the only one overseeing the collection and spending of that money, must in fact respond. [Butkovic] Speaking of money spent for defense, what happened to the money earmarked for Vukovar, because of which Vukovar commander Dedakovic was in prison? [Manolic] Dedakovic was not arrested because of the money for Vukovar, but rather for other reasons. However, during his arrest a certain amount of money was found on him, which he said was collected from Croatian emigres for the defense of Vukovar. The Dedakovic case has been dealt with by the criminal investigation system, and I think that there is nothing else mysterious in connection with the money for Vukovar. [Butkovic] Is it possible that some of the money gathered by the diaspora for the state's needs ended up in the accounts of the Croatian Democratic Community? On several occasions the opposition has hinted that the HDZ has used this money to pay for its extravagant election campaigns.... [Manolic] I think that that is utterly impossible. The election campaigns of the Croatian Democratic Community have been very modest in relation to the amount of money that has arrived from abroad. Moreover, the HDZ has never had problems finding sponsors for its election campaigns. I really do not believe that money collected for the defense of Croatia has ended up in the accounts of the Croatian Democratic Community.
