These results tie in to a solution for the problem of methane tanks taking up space in compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicles, which are drawing attention as low pollution vehicles. Prof. Kaneko et al. focused on the phenomenon of gasses being compressed on solid surfaces when the gas molecules are absorbed and used this on methane. Normally, porous absorbents that have many microscopic holes can absorb large volumes of gas molecules through the physical strength of the solid surface. However, since at room temperature methane is in a super-critical state that differs from normal gasses or liquids, it is a ``dry'' molecule is not absorbed easily by solid surfaces. On the other hand, numerical computations have predicted that absorbents that have pores of the size of two methane molecules absorb methane comparatively easily. This is because methane molecules are efficiently affected by the physical strength from the surface of the holes they face, and an absorbent with hole diameters of about eight angstroms (8/10,000,000) into which two methane molecules just fit is necessary. However, Kaneko et al. saw that just considering the size of the pores was not enough and also approached the problem from another direction. They found that if magnesium oxide or magnesium hydroxide is dispersed on the surface of activated carbon fibers, these materials change the properties of methane molecules and make absorption by the solid surface easier. In addition, they found that the amount of the increase in absorption varies with the type of absorbent, the type of metal oxide or hydroxide dispersed and the pressure of the methane. Kaneko et al. see that ``there are possibilities for use of absorbents with dispersed metal oxides or hydroxides in fuel tanks for automobiles.'' From here on, they will aim at development of methane absorbents on a level that can replace methane tanks in automobiles.
