"Many nations have shed ideological confrontation to seek reconciliation and cooperation, and at the same time adopted pragmatism, placing their national economic interests as top priority," Han said. "An era of boundless competition and trade wars opened with the conclusion of the Uruguay Round. With the hastening of internationalization, global problems such as disarmament, human rights, environmental protection and the fight against poverty are becoming important issues," he said. International relations in the post-cold war world shifted the focus from political and military affairs to economics and trade problems, the minister said. Seoul also places its emphasis on practical economic interests to join the world's advanced economic powers. He recalled an agreement at last month's South Korea-U.S. summit for a "thorough and broad" approach to solving the North Korean nuclear problem. While promising to keep to this principle, Han said that an international action such as by the United Nations Security Council was inevitable if North Korea did not come forward favorably in the dialogue efforts. South Korea enhanced its ties with both Asia and the Pacific at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Seattle in November and the new year will see more participation by Seoul in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), especially in regional security dialogue, Han said.
