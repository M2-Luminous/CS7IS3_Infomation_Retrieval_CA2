Our fatherland has turned into a socialist power with invincible national strength because the revolutionary party has been strengthened and developed, and world-class changes have been achieved in all sectors--political, economic, cultural, and military--under the party's leadership. In June 1964, our people came to usher in the new era of this proud history because they were blessed again with having another leader [suryong] by upholding the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il at the head of the party and the revolution. Under the wise leadership of the dear comrade leader, the party's leadership role has been extraordinarily consolidated, and the party work has been carried out in close tandem with the economic work over the past 30 years. As a result, in accordance with pushing for the economic construction and national defense building, we have seen the successful accomplishments of the Seven-Year Plan, which had been carried out until 1970; of the Six-Year Plan from 1971 to 1976; of the Second Seven-Year Plan from 1978 to 1984; and of the Third Seven-Year Plan from 1987 to 1993. The implementation of the four grand long-range plans has unfolded the heyday of our era which is shining with the esteemed name of Comrade Kim Chong-il, and has displayed to the whole world the formidable might and invincibility of the socialist fatherland in which the leader [suryong], the party, and the masses are marching forward in singlehearted unity. Our self-supporting national economy has endlessly been strengthened and developed on the basis of its own firm foundation. The industrial production had increased by more than one and a half times in each period of the plan. The industrial production increased by 3.3 times during the Seven-Year Plan period; by 2.2 times during the Six-Year Plan period as of the end of August 1975 when we achieved the goal ahead of schedule by one year and four months; by 2.2 times during the Second Seven-Year Plan period; and by 1.5 times during the Third Seven-Year Plan period. These great achievements, which have been made for the past 30 years, are precious fruitions of the leadership of the revolution and construction by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il--a great politician, a genius of creation and construction, and an ever-victorious iron-willed brilliant commander--who has with far-sighted clear-mindedness, outstanding revolutionary sweep, matchless mettle, and extraordinary determination. Herein lie the immortal achievements of the outstanding leader [yongdoja] who has added bright luster to Korea in the whole world. The 30 year-long period until today since the dear comrade leader began leading the party work has been one in which the most glorious and brilliant era has unfolded in the annals of the Korean revolution, and one of great creations and changes in which Korea unprecedentedly shines in the whole world throughout the 5,000-year old history of our nation. Our people will brilliantly accomplish the revolutionary cause of chuche along the single road to loyalty forever by cherishing deep in their hearts the greatest national dignity and pride of having established a socialist power in which they neither fear nor envy anything in the world, while upholding the great leader [widaehan yongdoja] at the head of the party and the revolution and following his seasoned leadership.
