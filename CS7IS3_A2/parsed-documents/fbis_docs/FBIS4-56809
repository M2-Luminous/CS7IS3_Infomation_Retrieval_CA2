Li, who is now on a official visit to Costa Rica where he participated in the inauguration of President Jose Maria Figueres Sunday [8 May], made the remarks during a news conference held following a breakfast meeting with Figueres. The ROC is a sovereign nation and the world should recognize that China is divided and ruled by separate governments, Li said. Under the existing situation, the ROC has two courses of action, Li said, including the promotion of substantial relations with other nations and improving cross-Taiwan Strait relations. "Developing mutual understanding between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait is important," he emphasized. But it is necessary for the ROC to enter the international community as a sovereign nation, he added.
