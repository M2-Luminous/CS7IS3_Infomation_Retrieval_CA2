FBIS4-34427 "drlat118_c_94003" FBIS-LAT-94-118 Daily Report 17 Jun 1994 MEXICO Sends Letter of Resignation to Salinas Sends Letter of Resignation to Salinas PA1906220894 Mexico City LA JORNADA in Spanish 17 Jun 94 P 6 PA1906220894 Mexico City LA JORNADA Spanish BFN [Letter from Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas, to President Carlos Salinas de Gortari issued in Mexico City on 16 June] [Text] Respected President: In the past few years, I have served the Mexican Government honestly. You know that during these years, I have dedicated my best efforts to solving conflicts and finding honorable and respectful results capable of strengthening society and its institutions. In all cases, I was able to avoid violence. I respected the rights of the parties involved. I was able to restore calm and create new institutional answers and solutions, always preferring political options to the use of force, which is unleashed when there is no foresight, no power to resist, or no courage. In all cases, I sought results through a responsible handling of the administration and the economy. Public resources were managed honestly. I have never mixed matters of public interest with private business. I have never used my political position to infringe on the rights of others or on their public image. With your continuous support, I was able to face very complex local and national problems. I committed myself to respecting public liberties, and I fulfilled my commitment. I am leaving the public administration after having held important positions during times of tension. I do so with the certainty that I have shown respect for the rights of citizens, social organizations, labor unions, and the opposition, always defending the institutions and public interest. Now, just when we had secured, with your complete support, a consolidated truce in Chiapas, my work has been publicly criticized, and all sort of resources have been used to express this position and turn it into a guideline. In light of the fact that this guideline differs from the political strategy for peace used in Chiapas, the possibility of coordinating the efforts needed in the new phase in the terms I have made public has been eliminated by reason of the nature of the current Mexican political system. To maintain the current situation, I suggested that you ask the governor of Chiapas State to participate in some of the tasks in which I have been involved. The professional capabilities of your secretaries of finance, government, and foreign relations will ensure that the Chiapas problems in their areas of authority are given the appropriate attention. Now, to secure more progress in the peace process, it is necessary to consolidate the military aspect, to avoid aggravating social conflicts in Chiapas, to carefully supervise the political campaign in the Chiapas elections, and to design a strategy for the new negotiation phase. If the Zapatista National Liberation Army [EZLN] plans to increase its political activities, as can be concluded from its recent decisions, the only true way to protect the institutions is to produce a new political strategy of decisions, agreements, and broad new starts in favor of changes that are capable of securing peace. In addition, in order to eliminate the possibility that my activities are used as a pretext by saying they generate unrest when the fact is that I have dedicated my entire life to the search for public peace, I hereby inform you of my decision to withdraw from political life and dedicate myself to family life. I inform you that I will not participate in any political activity during the current administration. I know I will be told that I am forsaking peace because no result was secured. No. We have secured all the results possible at this time. I am quitting the commission with a firmer decision in favor of peace and democracy. My commitment to dialogue with the EZLN and the search for a peaceful solution is permanent. I am taking your public and private word that I will continue to enjoy the guarantees I have as a Mexican citizen. I thank you for your permanent support and friendship and have faith that during the important period our country will experience, electoral impartiality will be strengthened and doors will be opened so civil society can help reduce tension and so there are democratic changes capable of making society feel secure and of producing economic growth. I ask you to extend my gratitude to the Mexican Army for the support it gave to the political solution in Chiapas. I also ask you to thank the members of your cabinet for the support given to my mission. I close by wishing you and your appreciated family health and well-being. Respectfully yours.
