It was the lowest since Hosokawa formed the coalition cabinet last August, the business daily said. Of those questioned, 65.4 percent opposed the "national welfare tax," compared with 32.2 percent who supported it. On Monday, TV ASAHI reported that its opinion survey indicated a significant 21.1 percentage point decline in the cabinet's approval rating to 56.3 percent, down from 77.4 percent on January 30 after Hosokawa succeeded in getting political reform enacted by the Diet. The NIHON KEIZAI's telephone poll, conducted between Friday and Sunday, covered 3,000 out of Japan's 94 million voters, of whom 1,868 gave valid responses. The poll showed 27.2 percent did not support the cabinet, up from December's 14.9 percent. Those who made no clear answer reached 20.3 percent, up from 20.5 percent. It said 40.3 percent were dissatisfied that Hosokawa decided on the new tax "without full debate" and 37.3 percent opposed the process of decision-making in which "an abrupt decision" was reached "in closed-door sessions." The poll indicated 19.0 percent voiced full-fledged or qualified support for the decision-making process. The opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) was the most popular among political parties at 28.0 percent, up from 23.2 percent in December, followed by the Social Democratic Party at 12.8 percent, up from 11.2 percent, Shinseito at 10.3 percent, down from 12.1 percent, and the Japan New Party at 9.4 percent, down from 14.6 percent. Asked who they support most among nine leading politicians, 17.5 percent said former Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, 14.4 percent House of Representatives speaker Takako Doi, 12.6 percent LDP Policy Affairs Research Council chairman Ryutaro Hashimoto, and 11.1 percent Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata. Hosokawa was not among the nine.
