Reactions here varied from resigned pragmatism to anger and disappointment that an opportunity to reconciliate Arab ranks after the Gulf war was not made use of. The King, who was officially reported to be going to Mecca and Medina on the holiest day of Ramadan to perform 'Umra, returned to Amman at 02:00 a.m. Wednesday morning. Officials have been careful not to play up the visit's political value and stressed the King's wish to be at the Prophet's burial place in Medina on Laylat al-Qadr--the night of destiny--which, according to Islam, is the night when the skies are opened to receive worshippers' prayers. Privately, however, politicians and anaylsts had expressed hope that the visit would be an opportunity to break the deadlock in relations between Jordan and Saudi Arabia which resulted from the 1990 Gulf crisis. A well-placed source told the JORDAN TIMES that King Husayn was aware that his trip to Mecca and Medina was to be a "purely spiritual visit." The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said no political significance or hopes should have been attached to this short trip except that a "psychological barier" had been removed with the King's insistence on the visit despite continued tension in political relations between him and the Saudi monarch. "The King's insistence on performing 'Umra was a duty he felt as a Muslim," the source said adding that "this was a religious trip and not a political one... there should be no disappointment." "A psychological barrier, if one is to think politically, has definitely been removed," the source said, explaining that while King Husayn had previously stayed away from the Islamic holy shrines because of the political situation between the two countries "he was able to break that barrier" with Tuesday's trip. But the source conceded that had the two kings been able to meet and resolve some of their differences "it would have been differences "it would have been perfect." However, other officials, who also acknowledge that the king had no scheduled meeting with the Saudi monarch before he left for 'Umra, did not hide their disappointment. "The attitude by the Saudis was definitely negative and not conducive to reconciliation," said a senior official. "When interests of states are at risk, top state officials should rise above personal disputes," he added. Western diplomats here concur with the disappointed officials. Analysts describe the Saudi decision as "counter productive." News agencies quoted Saudi diplomats as saying that while they had been told by Jordanian officials that there was no scheduled meeting between the two monarchs, "the royal court only informed us that the King wanted to perform 'Umra," a senior Saudi diplomat, who refused to be identified, was quoted as saying by the AP. "There was no request for any high-level meetings." A source close to the palace said there was no attempt by the Saudis to make any high-level contact with the King or any member of his delegation. "We are very disappointed," said the source. "The King was reaching out in reconciliation but King Fahd did not respond." Although neither Jordan nor Saudi Arabia officially confirmed a reconciliation meeting, official sources had privately said that the two kings were to meet Tuesday for the first time since the outbreak of the Gulf crisis in 1990. Relations between the two kingdoms soured after Iraq invaded Kuwait in Aug. 1990 when Jordan refused to join Saudi-based U.S.-led multinational forces that drove Iraq out of Kuwait. Jordan, at the time, declared that while it condemned Iraq's takeover of its smaller neighbour Kuwait it felt that the problem had to be contained within Arab ranks. King Husayn conducted a shuttle diplomacy between Iraq and Egypt immediately after the invasion, trying to withhold an Arab League condemnation of Iraq with Iraqi leadership promises that he was ready to withdraw from Kuwait. His attempts to contain the problem within Arab ranks, however, failed when the Arab League voted to condemn Iraq despite earlier promises to withhold the decision. Saudi Arabia, enraged by the Jordanian position, responded by cutting off much-needed economic aid to Jordan and discontinued its fuel supplies to the country. Relations suffered a serious setback and diplomatic missions between the two countries have operated with minimum staff since that time. Officials here hoped that a meeting between the two monarchs would have turned a new page in bilateral relations. "The Saudis had told us that the King was welcome to perform the 'Umra but that there was to be no scheduled meeting with King Fahd," a senior official said. "Yet we were hopeful that this meeting would be arranged by the time King Husayn arrived in Saudi Arabia," the senior official added. Analysts believed that King Fahd's decision to meet Palestinian leader Yasir 'Arafat and Yemeni leader 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih was an "encouraging" sign that the Saudi leadership would also move to normalise relations with Jordan. The Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) and Yemen adopted a similar position to that of Jordan after the Aug. 2 Invasion. Amman's ties with most of the Gulf states, except Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, have improved especially with Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Oman. Officially, Jordan was careful not to raise hopes by stressing that the King's visit on Tuesday was for purely religious reasons but sources had also revealed that an advance team from the palace was sent a week before the King's trip to arrange for the meeting. King Fahd normally grants courtesy audiences to most heads of state visiting his country on pilgrimage. Some analysts here now expect relations between Jordan and Saudi Arabia to worsen after King Fahd's "rebuff." "At best Jordan will try to contain the problem," said one analysts. "But the King will not try such a gesture again. He has gone out of his way." Other analysts, however, disagree and say that there were no high expectations of reconciliation at this time and that things will just have to "take their own pace."
