About 70 percent of the cases are requested by wives. Of the wives requesting divorce, intellectual women account for a bigger share, i.e., 86.1 percent. There are more divorce cases in big cities than in small and medium cities, and in particular, more cases occur in coastal open cities. More couples under 35 are seeking divorce--they account for over 60 percent of the total divorce cases. More divorce cases involve couples married shortly after falling in love --they make up 69.16 percent of the total. Also, more divorce cases are found among those who have children--64.82 percent of the total. With regard to divorcees, several "added" new trends have appeared. There are more advanced-age divorcees. There is no lack of divorcees who are in their 50's. People in their 60's getting divorced are not rare, and divorce cases involving septuagenarians are often heard of. A weird report carried in SHANGHAI FAYUAN [0006 3189 3127 5373] says that an 80-year-old woman and her 84-year-old husband insisted on divorcing each other. There are more early-married couples getting divorced, such cases now hitting a record high. More actors and actress get divorced than ever before. This is especially so among young performers whose divorce rate is as high as 70-80 percent--a fact that is known to all. There are also more self-employed and contract work households getting divorced after becoming better off. In some cities, the divorce rate among the self-employed has reached 12.4 percent. Some well-to-do people have even used money in exchange for agreement to divorce. In addition, more divorce cases have appeared among people going abroad. More and more people who have gone abroad to study or to "earn credits" have divorced their "ladies in the rear [liu shou nu shi 3966 1343 1166 1102]" or "gentlemen without wives by their side [tai kong nan shi 1132 4500 3948 1102]." As to reasons for divorce, the new trends are as follows: A remarkably increased number of divorce cases involve a "third party." Such divorcees account for about 25 percent of the total divorcees around the country, and the percentage is as high as 70 percent or so in coastal developed areas. People divorced because of "inharmony in sex" have also increased, the percentage of such divorcees being 34.7 percent nationwide and 60-70 percentage in certain areas. More people are divorced due to emotional discord. Over 95 percent of the divorce cases are attributable to emotional and personality conflicts rather than economic problems; still less are they due to political reasons. More often than not, divorce is caused by overt or covert psychological reasons or not-to-be-slighted social factors. An increased number of people seek divorce because of such factors as promotion, job transfer, or going to other places to study. Those who are mockingly described as "Chen Shimei" of the new age have increased in number. Also increased are cases in which husbands and wives separate and go different ways under the influence of the reform and opening environment or because of their different values. In addition, the following new trends have appeared with regard to the attitudes and ways in dealing with divorce. People who do not consider divorce to be disgraceful have increased to 73.90 percent. Those taking an indifferent attitude account for 14.83 percent. And only 11.77 percent think that divorce is disgraceful. There are more cases of negotiated divorce than cases of divorce based on the court's judgment. In the past these two kinds of divorce cases were in the ratio of 1:3. Now, the ratio is 3:1 in such big cities as Shanghai. More people treat divorce in a civilized manner. Some divorcees hold balls and banquets and travel on the occasion of divorce. After divorce, some still contact each other and set dates for meeting with their children. More divorcees can justly appraise and deal with their previous spouses--they account for 61 percent of the total divorcees. While 40 percent of the divorcees say they can consider remarrying, actually more of them tend to remain single in view of the difficulty and trouble in getting remarried. Throughout the country, there are about 9.9 million unmarried men aged over 30. This is about 3.3 times more than unmarried women over 25. Recently, an increase is noted in the number of unmarried people between 28 and 49 years of age, and the trend is going upward. Beijing has 600,000 unmarried adults, Qingdao has 420,000, and Guangzhou has over 1 million. In early 1991, a public official bachelors' club, the first of its kind in China, was founded in Beijing. Meanwhile, a bachelors' party also appeared in Qingdao. [passage omitted]
