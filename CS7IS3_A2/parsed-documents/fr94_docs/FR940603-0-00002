FR940603-0-00002 FR940603-0-00001 FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 12 CFR Part 208 [Regulation H; Docket No. R&hyph;0773] Membership of State Banking Institutions in the Federal Reserve System AGENCY: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Board is amending Regulation H to allow a state member bank that meets certain conditions to invest in its premises in an amount up to 50 percent of its Tier 1 capital without obtaining specific approval. The Board believes that a general approval for a state member bank to invest an amount not exceeding 50 percent of its Tier 1 capital is appropriate for a bank that meets those conditions. This action will significantly reduce the number of applications to invest in bank premises that are filed with the Board and will thereby reduce regulatory burden. EFFECTIVE DATE: July 5, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 24A of the Federal Reserve Act, 12 U.S.C. 371d, requires a state member bank to obtain the approval of the Board to invest in the bank's premises if the aggregate level of direct and indirect investment in its premises will exceed the bank's capital stock account. Section 24A applies (1) To investments in bank premises and to investments in the stock, bonds, debentures, or other such obligations of any corporation holding the premises of such bank, (2) To the making of loans to or upon the security of the stock of any such corporation; and (3) To the indebtedness incurred by any corporation that is an affiliate of the bank. The Board is amending Regulation H to allow a state member board that meets certain conditions to invest in bank premises in an amount that exceeds its capital stock account but not exceeding 50 percent of its Tier 1 capital without obtaining specific approval for the investment. Prior to this amendment, a state member bank was required to obtain Board approval for each investment in bank premises if the aggregate investment exceeded, or would exceed, the capital stock account of the state member bank. The Board believes that investments by a state member bank in bank premises in an amount in excess of its stock account but not exceeding 50 percent of the bank's Tier 1 capital generally do not present any significant risks to the bank if the bank is well capitalized, is rated CAMEL ``1'' or ``2'', and is not subject to any written agreement, cease and desist order, capital directive. The Board believes that a general approval for a state member bank to invest an amount not exceed 50 percent of its Tier 1 capital its appropriate for a bank that meets those conditions. This action will significantly reduce the number of applications to invest in bank premises that are filed with the Board and will thereby reduce regulatory burden. The amendment does not affect state member banks' ability to invest in bank premises, without conditions, up to the amount of their capital stock account. Notice and Public Participation The provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553(b) relating to notice and public participation have not been followed in connection with the adoption of this amendment because the changes relate to rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice. Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ), the Board certifies that the proposed amendment will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The proposed amendment will reduce the regulatory burden for many small depository institutions by relieving them of the requirement to file an application in certain cases, and will have no effect in other cases.
