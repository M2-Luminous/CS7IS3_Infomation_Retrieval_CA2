Cardenas made his statement when visiting Ruben Lenero and Magdalena de las Salinas Hospitals during the celebration on Nurses Day. Cardenas also said that instead of being concerned about electoral strategies, we must seek a political solution to the conflict in Chiapas and prevent any further loss of human life. [Begin Cardenas recording] Regardless of what your electoral preferences may be, regardless of your sympathies for the sides in the conflict, you are not the one directly involved in what is going on. We have to call on both sides to create the opportunity to suspend the hostilities. We need to seek political negotiations, because this is a political conflict, which emerges from the application of failed policies. We hope a solution may be found. [end recording] Cuauhtemoc Cardenas said whether or not the uprising in Chiapas is promoted by Indians, the lives of Mexican people are being lost, and this must be stopped. The PRD presidential candidate said the three Chiapas bishops have the best chance of being heard by those involved in the conflict. He said he hopes the participation of the bishops could stop the bloodshed. The PRD presidential candidate also said he will not change his campaign program, adding that within the next three months he will be going to Chiapas State.
