During it, William Perry clarified the situation regarding the debt owed to Russia. As a result of US failure to pay 60 million dollars due under the tripartite agreement, Russia has not been supplying the Ukraine with fuel for its nuclear power stations. Perry said this problem would be resolved within 10 days of his return home. The announcement by Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy that a direct communications link would be installed between the Ukrainian Defense Ministry and the U.S. Defense Department created a sensation. A 17-point working program for cooperation has been drafted. The Ukrainian defense minister said the U.S. side had shown a commitment to a just solution of the problem of the Crimean Peninsula and the Black Sea Fleet.
