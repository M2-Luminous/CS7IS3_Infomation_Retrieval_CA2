FR940405-1-00120 FR940405-1-00013 Paragraph (d)(11) proposes to require that employees working on building systems are provided with and use personal protective equipment (PPE) as required by other OSHA standards including; 29 CFR 1926, Subpart E, Personal Protective and Life Saving Equipment; 29 CFR 1926.52, Occupational Noise Exposure; 29 CFR 1910, Subpart I, Personal Protective Equipment; and 29 CFR 1910.95 Occupational Noise Exposure. OSHA is aware, through its experience and through the literature and submissions to the docket, that HVAC Operations and Maintenance (O&M) personnel may often receive minimal training regarding existing relevant OSHA regulations and the hazards that they are exposed to in the performance of their duties. Sometimes, facilities are not viewed as industrial workplaces by either the management or employees. However, the hazards do exist and therefore compliance with existing regulations is necessary to protect the health and safety of O&M employees. Respirators may not normally be used in this industry due to the perceived lack of a substance-specific hazard. But situations may occur, for instance, such as chemical or microbial contamination, that would require compliance with 1910.134. Other provisions of this section require; that buildings without mechanical ventilation be operated and maintained to provide natural ventilation; that inspections and maintenance of building systems be performed by or under the supervision of the designated person; that the employer establish a written record of building system inspections and maintenance required under this section; that the employer evaluate the need to perform modifications to the building systems to meet the minimum requirements specified in paragraph (d) of this section in response to employee complaints of building-related illnesses. Controls for Specific Contaminant Sources: Paragraph (e) This paragraph proposes to require employers to take specific protective measures to control employee exposure to specific agents such as tobacco smoke [Exs. 3&hyph;7, 3&hyph;10, 3&hyph;85, 3&hyph;291, 3&hyph;305, 3&hyph;409, 3&hyph;449, 3&hyph;496, 3&hyph;505B], outdoor pollutants [Ex. 3&hyph;496, 3&hyph;500, 3&hyph;502, 3&hyph;505], contaminant emissions from local indoor sources [Exs. 3&hyph;10, 3&hyph;17, 3&hyph;26, 3&hyph;38, 3&hyph;412], microbial contaminants [Exs. 3&hyph;10, 3&hyph;26, 3&hyph;61, 3&hyph;496, 3&hyph;500, 3&hyph;502, 3&hyph;505, 3&hyph;506], hazardous chemicals including cleaning and maintenance chemicals and pesticides [Exs. 3&hyph;56, 3&hyph;436, 3&hyph;496, 3&hyph;500, 3&hyph;505]. With respect to tobacco smoke in workplaces where smoking is not prohibited, paragraph (e)(1) proposes to require the establishment of designated smoking areas. Such areas must be enclosed and exhausted directly to the outside, and maintained under negative pressure sufficient to contain tobacco smoke within the designated area. Smoking is not permitted during cleaning and maintenance work in these designated smoking areas. Moreover, although cleaning and maintenance are specified in this paragraph, it is OSHA's intent that no work of any kind shall be performed in a designated smoking area when smoking is taking place. Designated smoking areas must be areas where employees do not have to enter in the performance of normal work activities. Signs must also be posted at designated smoking areas. Signs must be posted to inform anyone entering the building that smoking is restricted to designated areas. Finally, smoking within designated areas is not permitted during any time that the exhaust ventilation system servicing that area is not operating properly. The proposed provisions under paragraph (e)(1) addressing control of tobacco smoke are intended to ensure that employees outside of the designated smoking area will not be exposed to ETS. The Agency anticipates that the provisions as proposed will accomplish that goal. Enclosing smoking areas, exhausting them to the outside, maintaining them under negative pressure, and prohibiting smoking in designated areas even when the exhaust system is inoperable are believed to be necessary and sufficient to prevent tobacco smoke from migrating to other areas of the building. The designated smoking area must be under negative pressure compared to all surrounding spaces including adjoining rooms, corridors, plenums and chases. Negative pressure is achieved by exhausting more air from the space than is supplied to the space.
