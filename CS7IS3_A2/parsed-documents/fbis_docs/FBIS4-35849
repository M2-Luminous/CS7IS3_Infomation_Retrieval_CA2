Jordan "is determined to recover territory occupied by Israel and will not hesitate to sign a bilateral accord on this issue with the Hebrew state before there is a peace treaty," the official said on condition he not be named. Israel and Jordan are due to meet in Washington on Monday to discuss the border issue which dates back to 1922 and the outlines drawn up during the British mandate over Palestine. Jordan is claiming from Israel a strip of about 320 square kilometres (128 square miles) along their border from the Gulf of Aqaba to the Dead Sea, as well as 1.3 square kilometres (half a square mile) south of Lake Tiberias in the Jordan Valley. Jordan has so far refused to sign a separate peace treaty with Israel before all outstanding issues have been resolved, and until there is a comprehensive settlement with other Arab countries. The official said that any such accord on their common border "would not prejudice our commitment to a global peace" settlement, but added that the "return of our territories is the top priority." So far Israel has evaded any mention of the border issue in bilateral talks. But Jordanian Information Minister Jawad al-'Anani told reporters Saturday that Jordan had received signs that Israel "was ready to discuss these border questions." A Foreign Ministry spokesman in Jerusalem confirmed that the two delegations were to meet Monday in Washington to discuss the border dispute. Bilateral Arab-Israeli talks have been suspended since a Jewish settler killed 30 Arab worshippers in a mosque in Hebron on February 25.
