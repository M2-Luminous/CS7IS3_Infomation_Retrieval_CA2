The proposal, which was signed by 500,000 people, is based on the people's constitutional right to initiate laws. ILD President Hernando De Soto, who is a former adviser of President Alberto Fujimori, reported that the proposal contains 12 amendments "that seek to make governments listen to the people and to prevent the market economy from becoming a privilege of a few." One amendment proposes the establishment of a "democratic procedure for popular consultation to decentralize the government's decisionmaking power" so that the executive branch will no longer exclusively make decisions "on every subject without listening to the opinion of the Peruvian people." Other proposed amendments deal with the creation of multiple electoral districts in lieu of the current single district system "so that elected officials may be held directly accountable to their constituents" and to make the constitutional right to cancel terms in office applicable to all political representatives and officials. De Soto said that during the 5 April 1992 coup, President Fujimori said he took that extreme measure, among other reasons, to democratize political power through a constitutional reform. De Soto contended that Fujimori has not fulfilled his promise because the new Constitution has incorporated "only half" of the changes he promised. Therefore, he said, the ILD has availed itself of the people's right to initiate amendments to the Peruvian Constitution. The Peruvian Constitution recognizes this right of the people, "but only to a certain extent," De Soto said, "because it is the Congress, not the people, that has the power to approve or reject the proposal."
