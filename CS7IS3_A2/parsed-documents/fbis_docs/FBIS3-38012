Initially, Yeltsin, standing next to the British prime minister, sharply stated that Moscow would not allow the Bosnian conflict to be resolved without its involvement; and this came across as a public challenge to NATO, which had resolved to bomb the Serbian artillery around Sarajevo without enquiring about the Russian leadership's opinion. But, one day later, on 17 February, Russia's deft maneuver had resolved the very problem which the NATO countries were intending to tackle by means of combat aircraft on the night of 20-21 February. It was a masterstroke of diplomacy that, albeit to varying degrees, satisfied everyone: It secured a cease-fire and stopped the multiplication of casualties while humiliating no one, each side being allowed to save face. The Serbs withdrew their heavy armaments but not, as it were, under the pressure of a NATO ultimatum but at the request of their Russian brothers. The West, not without a sense of relief, called off (postponed?) its risky bombing experiment in the Balkans, while the inhabitants of Sarajevo came out on to the streets without fear of shells or mortar projectiles. And Russia? At a critical moment Russia's new partners had, as it were, assigned it an insignificant role, while it had -- in a single move -- placed itself at the center of attention. Yes, precisely at that moment Russia found the important and only proper place for itself and played the role which no one else could. Hats off! And, although we are not dealing with a happy end but merely with an episode in a tragedy to which no end is in sight, you cannot fail to be delighted at the skill shown by our country's diplomats, those people who brilliantly prepared the initiative behind the scenes, allowing the Russian president, who sealed the initiative with his assent and signature, to reap the reward. Such obvious successes in the search for a role and identity are very rare, and for that reason you are doubly delighted that realism mingled with a sense of dignity prevailed, while foreign policy romanticism is disappearing just as its counterpart -- market romanticism -- has disappeared. They have, by the way, exhibited common traits -- an intoxification with the West's prescriptions to the point of losing all sense of proportion and sense of personal identity. In the case of Yugoslavia this loss occurred when Russia joined in the economic blockade of Serbia, forgetting that history looks different from Moscow, Washington, or Bonn and that it is not the Americans and the Germans but the Russians who would have to pay the price. As a result we lost, I think, in the eyes of the South Slavs more than we did during the period of Stalin's split with Tito's Yugoslavia and the many years of suspicious rejection of a country building its own route to socialism. Thank God, the intolerable nature of that loss was realized pretty quickly -- and not without pressure from both moderate and implacable critics in the Supreme Soviet, which has now disappeared into history. And historically strong roots of pragmatism were preserved within the Foreign Ministry. No one has worked so hard as Deputy Minister Vitaliy Churkin in reestablishing our severed links with brother Slavs. The most recent example of Russia's restored position is the friendly reception accorded Russian peacemaking soldiers around Sarajevo. When speaking about the components of our success, in addition to the foreign elements, it is necessary to highlight the domestic, Russian ones. The foreign elements are obvious and have already been mentioned. The domestic, Russian ones reside in the fact that essentially the whole of Russian society and all political factions -- ranging from Gaydar to Zhirinovskiy -- have approved what happened. In current times such a consensus is an extraordinarily rare, extraordinarily important, and wholly understandable thing. Not only diplomats but society too needs examples of self-confirmation. Foreign policy begins at home. National interest is developed and guaranteed by a degree of national accord. It is perfectly obvious that in the latest episode in the Bosnian crisis the Russian diplomatic service operated skillfully not just because it put forward a solution which took account of the real situation and position of the direct participants in the conflict but also because (mainly because) it felt support back on the "home front." And yet until quite recently and quite often more concern was paid to the reaction of our foreign partners. From that perspective, we have also bidden farewell to foreign policy romanticism, which Vladimir Lukin, who was Russian ambassador to the United States and has now been elected chairman of the State Duma Committee for International Affairs, persists in calling -- and with reason -- "infantile pro-Americanism." Whereas previously the main thing when determining our stance on the Yugoslav question was achieving consensus with the West, for the sake of which we neglected our own public opinion, now, especially since the December elections, pride of place is taken by domestic consensus, which neither the president nor the Foreign Ministry can ignore. Foreign policy, if it is to be sound, must be based on majority support within the country -- which is an indispensable rule for democratic states. American, German, British, and other Western diplomats operate within this constraint, accepting it as a fact of life. Ultimately, whether you approve or even if you don't, it is Russian policy that takes account of Russian interest based on Russian public opinion which is taken seriously. Hence the respect for Moscow's independent initiative in lifting the siege of Sarajevo, particularly if it also holds out the promise of breaking the deadlock, a deadlock created not without the West's involvement.
