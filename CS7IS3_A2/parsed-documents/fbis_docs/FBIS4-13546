Also, in continuation of the congress, Hojjat ol-Eslam val- Moslemin Haj Seyyed Ahmad Khomeyni, made some remarks saying: The Abrahamite Hajj is the cry of the oppressed Muslims against the arrogants of the world. Hajj is also a rallying point for the resolution of problems and strengthening of brotherhood among Muslims. If Muslims had truly trodden the path of unity and equality, today Muslims of the Middle East would not have succumbed to the superpowers to such an extent. At the conclusion of the congress a statement was read out in which the silence of the so-called human rights organizations was condemned. The statement says: We, the participants of the Great Hajj Congress, announce our sympathy and solidarity with the oppressed Muslim nation of Bosnia-Herzegovina and condemn the deceitful silence of the UN Security Council and the actual collusion of the UN secretary general, and say yes to the call of the Guardian of the Cause of the world Muslims and announce our readiness for any kind of assistance, including jihad in the field of that unequal battle, and call on Islamic nations to make their cries heard by the world and turn their decisiveness in the holy arena of hajj into a hammer to smash arrogance, polytheism, and belief in polytheism.
