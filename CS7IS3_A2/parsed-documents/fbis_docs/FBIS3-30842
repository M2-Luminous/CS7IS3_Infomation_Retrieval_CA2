He will attend the meeting of the eight countries bordering on former Yugoslavia called on the initiative of Yugomediators Owen and Stoltenberg, within the framework of the international peace conference on former Yugoslavia. According to the Bulgarian diplomat, this would be an informal discussion, intended to take into account the views of neighbouring states and the influence they could have on the three warring parties, with a view to containing and a peaceful settlement to the conflict. We think the problem should be resolved in a peaceful way, said Daskalov. On the other hand, the siege of Sarajevo has to be lifted, and if military strikes should be resorted to, this should be done under UN auspices, he also said. Asked to comment on the message by Turkish President Demirel to Bulgarian President Zhelev, Minister Daskalov said it did not make clear what was meant by military intervention. Bulgaria has not changed its position, it is against the lifting of the arms embargo on Bosnia, the minister stressed. Yesterday the Bulgarian president's Press Office announced that president Zhelyu Zhelev had received a letter from Turkish President Suleyman Demirel. In connection with the tragic events in Sarajevo the Turkish president had called on the Bulgarian president to support the latest initiatives of the international community for military intervention to put an end to the bloodshed, according to the president's Press Office.
