Sir Timothy Lankester, permanent secretary of the Overseas Development Agency [ODA], told the Commons Public Accounts Committee that not only had Mr Hurd, Foreign Secretary, taken the unusual step of overruling his rejection of the Pergau power scheme, but he had done so in consultation with the Prime Minister. Both men were involved in the decision to proceed with an informal offer of assistance made to the Malaysian government by Lady Thatcher, when she was Prime Minister in 1989. The money has gone towards the 417 million pounds cost of a hydro-electric power project, being built by a consortium including British construction firms Balfour Beatty and Trafalgar House. Yet Sir Timothy, responsible for vetting overseas aid, had repeatedly warned ministers that Pergau was uneconomic and a waste of the limited overseas aid budget. He made his views clear right up until February 1991 when the final decision to proceed was taken, he said. He sent two memoranda to ministers arguing against the project, although he has been barred from providing MPs with copies of the notes. Despite the size of the project, which has increased in cost by a third since 1989, ODA officials began a formal on-site economic appraisal of Pergau only one day before Lady Thatcher met the Malaysian prime minister and offered assistance. "there was great concern at the time (about this). It was well-recognised that a more substantial appraisal was deserved before an offer of aid. "But there was resistance to an appraisal from the consortium itself, the DTI [Department of Trade and Industry] and the High Commission in Kuala Lumpur because they thought it would disturb the negotiations," Sir Timothy said. He also took the opportunity to read out a new statement on the affair from Mr Hurd, whose role has already been criticised by the National Audit Office. Praising the conduct of his permanent secretary, the Foreign Secretary said he had taken his decision "from a wider perspective" and that it was the "right decision for British interests". He added: "We needed to take account, not only of the commitment made at the highest level, but also to the consequences for the United Kingdom if we failed to honour that commitment. "Ministers decided that the Government, despite the increase in price, were bound by the undertaking given earlier." Mr Hurd pointed out that British sales to Malaysia rose from 226 million pounds in 1986 to 635 million pounds in 1992. At one time, Malaysia had conducted a "Buy British Last" campaign, Sir Timothy added. Labour MPs sought to establish links between the aid offer and a simultaneous 1 billion [U.S. trillion] pound defence contract awarded by Malaysia. It is illegal for ministers to use aid as a means of securing defence sales but Sir Timothy would not be drawn on the allegations.
