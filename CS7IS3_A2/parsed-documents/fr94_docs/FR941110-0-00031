ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This final rule implements certain provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987, as further amended by subsequent 1988, 1989, and 1990 legislation. These provisions make significant changes in the process of surveying skilled nursing facilities under Medicare and nursing facilities under Medicaid and in the process for certifying that these facilities meet the Federal requirements for participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. They also set forth a number of alternative remedies which may be imposed on facilities that do not comply with the Federal participation requirements (instead of or in addition to termination), and specify remedies for State survey agencies that do not meet surveying requirements.
