The government still hopes to reach an agreement, but it is already admitting the possibility of postponing a bit the announcement to creditor banks, which was to have been made on 10 March. A high-ranking Finance Ministry source outlined to this newspaper three areas of concern for the IMF: excessive foreign capital inflow and its impact on the monetary policy; public sector salary expenses; and the fiscal policy. A technician has said that the IMF is planning a primary surplus (discounting the payment of interest and monetary correction target of 4 percent of the GNP). The government decided to avoid placing immediate restrictions on incoming capital. Provisional Measure 438, which was released yesterday, gives the government the possibility of creating an IOF [financial operations tax] of up to 25 percent on the net value of currency exchange operations. There is currently a 3 percent tax applying to foreign capital invested in bonds and other securities, and a 5 percent tax applying to foreign investment in fixed profit funds in Brazil. There are indications that restrictions will be increased. The IMF is also dissatisfied with public servant salary spending. IMF technicians claim that 1993 spending grew too much, in real terms. The government argues that this was the inevitable effect of legal decisions on salary equalization. In addition, it argues that during the Fernando Collor government, salaries were reduced to levels that are unsustainable in the medium term. Rather than concentrating on salaries, the IMF concern has always focused on the fiscal adjustment. In this regard, the implementation of the URV [real value unit] opens new unknowns, about which the IMF is certainly concerned. Here is an example mentioned by a technician: How will the URV conversion work for the salaries and utility rates of state and municipal governments? The federal government can control its own sector, for which austere rules were established, but states and municipal districts are independent. These variables obviously have direct influence on the deficit of state and municipal governments. In the case of the direct federal administration, the rule established in the provisional measure creating the URV is clear, but the provisional measure still has to be approved by Congress. The IMF is designing a primary surplus of 4 percent of the GNP as a target for the entire public sector, including state-run enterprises, states, and municipal districts. The matter is being comprehensively analyzed. The table released by the Finance Ministry to restructure the figures of the 1994 budget after approval of the Social Emergency Fund -- which was promulgated yesterday -- estimates interest spending at $7.7 billion, which is equivalent to slightly less than 2 percent of the GNP. This figure corresponds to federal administration expenses. The Brazilian promise is to balance accounts from an operational point of view, excluding monetary and exchange rate adjustment, but including interest in real terms. This means that the bigger the spending in interest, the bigger the need for fiscal funds for zeroing the operational deficit. The objective of the economic team by reaching a balance on operational terms is to end the government need to borrow money from the financial market through the issuance of securities except to refinance the debt principal. This would reduce the pressure on the private sector and would allow, in the future, a reduction of the interest rates paid by the government. In the short term, however, high real interest rates are an important instrument for controlling the implementation of the URV until the new real currency comes into effect. There is an basic concept difference behind the fiscal debate. The IMF thinks that given that the Brazilian stabilization plan is being implemented in an atmosphere of political instability and during an election race, it will require a fiscal "overkill" [preceding word in English], that is, it will require the generation of a fiscal surplus beyond what would normally be necessary, as a sure signal of the Brazilian intention to stabilize prices. This is why the IMF initiated talks with Brazil about an operational 3 percent surplus of the GNP. It has been demonstrated in the past few months, however, that it will be politically impossible to obtain more than what has been obtained. Economic team members say that the IMF has accepted the idea of a balance in operational terms and that it is only redoing its calculations to determine the consistency of such goal. As for the "heterodox" component of the stabilization plan, a reliable source has said that there are different points of view inside the IMF. The "old guard" represented by Sterie Beza, chief of the South Atlantic Department, certainly prefers the traditional method of fiscal and monetary austerity. Younger experts support the principle of removing the indexation of the economy, as long as the "basic principles" of fiscal and monetary austerity are respected. IMF Manager-Director Michel Camdessus is in a difficult position. His image was tarnished abroad and in Brazil after endorsing the economic adjustment plan of former Minister Marcilio Marques Moreira which never took off completely. Now, he is currently much more careful to express support for something inconsistent. The IMF, however, does not want to be accused of being responsible for preventing the creditors from reaching an agreement with Brazil mainly because if the agreement fails, it would take a long time to find another opportunity, perhaps a year or two, as a consequence of the upcoming presidential inauguration. Despite everything, the government is confident that the IMF will prepare a letter of intent and a memorandum of understanding in time to allow Brazil reach an agreement with the banks. The possibility of a postponement is nonetheless already being admitted. It would be necessary to announce on 10 March the reaching of a technical agreement and to sign the agreement on 15 April, the day the agreement with the banks and bond issuance expire. Instead of postponing the 15 April deadline, which would require the approval of 95 percent of the creditor banks, it is possible that, if necessary, the date for announcing the reaching of an agreement be brought forward from 10 March. This would give the IMF experts more time to clarify their doubts and monitor the implementation of the URV. A postponement of this kind, if it happens, will not be very traumatic. A postponement would be much more serious if it were the consequence of disagreements over substantial subjects. But this possibility is currently not on the horizon. There exists a frank skepticism toward the Brazilian stabilization plan in the IMF's sister institution, that is, in the World Bank (IBRD). The idea there is that the fiscal adjustment plan so far implemented is clearly not enough. In the times of the economic plan of Minister Marcilio Marques Moreira, the IBRD was a harsh critic and clearly told the IMF that it did not agree with its endorsement of the Brazilian plan. So much so that the IBRD conditioned the approval of structural credits to Brazil on the execution of the agreement with the IMF for at least six months, something that never happened.
