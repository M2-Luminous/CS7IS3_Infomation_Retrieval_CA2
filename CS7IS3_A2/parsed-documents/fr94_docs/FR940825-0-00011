FR940825-0-00011 FR940825-0-00002 This rule will allow sweet cherries to be imported into the United States from Mexico. In 1992, Mexico produced approximately 225,000 pounds of cherries, both sweet and sour. We anticipate that any cherry imports from Mexico as a result of this action will be minimal, since presently, most of Mexico's cherry production is consumed locally. However, in the unlikely event that Mexico exported into the United States 225,000 pounds of sweet cherries, it would constitute only about 4.9 percent of current total imports, about 0.12 percent of current U.S. production and about 0.12 percent of the current total sweet cherry supply in the United States (domestic and imports). Assuming that an 0.12 percent increase in the supply of sweet cherries would lead to a decrease of about 0.054 percent in the domestic price (using the price flexibility for sweet cherries, ^0.470), we estimate that this increase in supply would result in a price decrease of about $0.65 per ton, or $0.00032 per pound, from an original price of $1,200 per ton. As a result of the price decrease, there could be a decrease in total revenue of sweet cherry producers of about $62,000, which is roughly 0.054 percent of the original total revenue of $115 million. Therefore, we anticipate that allowing sweet cherries to be imported from Mexico will not have a significant economic impact on domestic sweet cherry producers. Dasheen (Taro) In 1987, 191 domestic producers harvested dasheen, 187 in Hawaii. It is likely that most of these producers would be classified as small entities by SBA standards. In 1991, domestic producers harvested 7.0 million pounds of dasheen for the fresh market, with an estimated value of $3.0 million. This rule will allow dasheen to be imported into the United States from Indonesia. Production and export data for dasheen are not available for Indonesia. Dasheen consumption is limited mostly to the local areas, although Indonesia exports small quantities to Japan, Hong Kong, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore and Taiwan. We anticipate that very little, if any, dasheen will be exported to the United States as a result of this rule. We anticipate, therefore, that allowing dasheen to be imported from Indonesia will not have a significant economic impact on domestic dasheen producers. Plums In 1987, 8,789 domestic producers harvested plums and prunes. It is likely that most of these producers would be classified as small entities by SBA standards. In 1992, domestic producers harvested 537 million pounds of plums and prunes for the fresh market, with an estimated value of $67.7 million. This rule will allow plums to be imported into the United States from Uruguay. Plum production and export data is not available for Uruguay, and we anticipate that an insignificant amount of plums will be exported to the United States as a result of this rule. Consequently, we anticipate that allowing plums to be imported from Uruguay will not have a significant economic impact on domestic plum producers. Tomatoes In 1987, 14,542 domestic producers harvested tomatoes. It is likely that most of these producers would be classified as small entities by SBA standards. In 1992, domestic producers harvested 3.6 billion pounds of tomatoes for the fresh market, with an estimated value of $1.3 billion. This rule will allow pink and red tomatoes to be imported into the United States from the Almeria Province of Spain if they meet with the stringent growing and shipping requirements outlined above. Annual production in the Almeria Province of Spain averages between 4.4 million and 6.6 million pounds. Spanish officials anticipate that annual tomato exports to the United States will range from 440,000 to 660,000 pounds and will occur from December to April. If the volume of tomatoes to be imported from the Almeria Province were to reach 660,000 pounds, it would constitute about 0.15 percent of current total imports to the United States, about 0.018 percent of current domestic production and about 0.016 percent of the current total tomato supply in the United States (domestic and imports). Assuming that an 0.016 percent increase in the supply of tomatoes would lead to a decrease of about 0.046 percent in the domestic price (using the price flexibility for tomatoes, ^0.355), we estimate that this increase in supply would result in a price decrease of about $0.017 per cwt, or $0.00017 per pound, from an original price of $36.30 per cwt. As a result of the price decrease, there could be a decrease in total revenue of tomato producers of about $600,000, which is roughly 0.046 percent of the original total revenue of $1.3 billion. Therefore, we anticipate that allowing pink or red tomatoes to be imported from Almeria, Spain will not have a significant economic impact on domestic tomato producers. Litchi In 1992, about 205 domestic producers harvested litchi. It is likely that most of these producers would be classified as small entities using Small Business Administration (SBA) criteria (annual gross receipts of $0.5 million or less). In 1992, domestic producers harvested 685,000 pounds of litchi for the fresh market, with an estimated value of $1.1 million.
