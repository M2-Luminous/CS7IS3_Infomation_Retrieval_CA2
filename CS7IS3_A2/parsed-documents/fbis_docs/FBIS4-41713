Two slabs from the covering were damaged from being washed with water from melted snow and have caved in. This has been reported in today's issue of IZVESTIYA, quoting the heads of the oblast headquarters of the civil defense. According to these data, the radiation directly above the crack that has formed is eight milliroentgens, that is 1,000 times higher than the natural background for Kamchatka. However, the heads of the civil defense headquarters think that this radiation does not present a danger to the residents of the oblast centre and the neighboring settlements: it is local and "fades away" at a distance of a few meters. At the present time repair work is being carried out at the burial ground. What is more, no one has managed to get complete and objective information about the the situation at the storage yet: admission to this secret facility which belongs to the nuclear submarine flotilla, is closed to all civil inspectors. Even the information that the civil defense headquarters has at its disposal has been obtained from navy sailors.
