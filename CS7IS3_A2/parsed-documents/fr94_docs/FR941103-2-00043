FR941103-2-00043 FR941103-2-00029 1. Calculation of Refunds. First, we will adopt a presumption that the overcharges were dispersed equally in all of Beacon Bay's sales of gasoline during the period covered by the Remedial Order. In accordance with this presumption, refunds are made on a pro-rata or volumetric basis. 2 In the absence of better information, a volumetric refund is appropriate because the DOE price regulations generally required a regulated firm to account for increased costs on a firm-wide basis in determining its prices. 2 If a claimant believes that it was injured by more than its volumetric share, it may elect to forego this presumption and file a refund application based upon a claim that it suffered a disproportionate share of Beacon Bay's overcharges. See, e.g., Mobil Oil Corp./Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad Co., 15 DOE ¶85,788 (1990); Mobil Oil Corp./Marine Corps Exchange Service, 17 DOE ¶85,714 (1988). Such a claim will be granted if the claimant makes a persuasive showing that it was ``overcharged'' by a specific amount, and that it absorbed these overcharges. See Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Co.,/Western Petroleum Co., 19 DOE ¶85,705 (1989). To the degree that a claimant makes this showing, it will receive an above-volumetric refund. Under the volumetric approach, a claimant's ``allocable share'' of the Remedial Order fund is equal to the number of gallons purchased from Beacon Bay during the period covered by the Remedial Order times the per gallon refund amount. In the present case, the per gallon refund amount is $0.0690. We derived this figure by dividing the amount of the Remedial Order fund, $100,697.87, by 1,460,321 gallons, the volume of gasoline which Beacon Bay sold from August 1, 1979 through March 31, 1980. A claimant that establishes its eligibility for a refund will receive all or a portion of its allocable share plus a pro-rata share of the accrued interest. 3 3 As in previous cases, we will establish a minimum refund amount of $15. In this proceeding, any potential claimant purchasing less than 211 gallons of gasoline from Beacon Bay would have an allocable share of less than $15. We have found through our experience that the cost of processing claims in which refunds for amounts less than $15 are sought outweighs the benefits of restitution in those instances. See Exxon Corp., 17 DOE ¶85,590 at 89,150 (1988) ( Exxon ). In addition to the volumetric presumption, we will also adopt a number of presumptions regarding injury for claimants in each category listed below. 2. End-Users. In accordance with prior Subpart V proceedings, we will adopt the presumption that an end-user or ultimate consumer of gasoline purchased from Beacon Bay whose business is unrelated to the petroleum industry was injured by the overcharges resolved by the Remedial Order. See, e.g., Texas Oil and Gas Corp., 12 DOE ¶85,069 at 88,269 (1984) ( TOGCO ). Unlike regulated firms in the petroleum industry, members of this group generally were not subject to price controls during the period covered by the Remedial Order, and were not required to keep records which justified selling price increases by reference to cost increases. Consequently, analysis of the impact of the overcharges on the final prices of goods and services produced by members of this group would be beyond the scope of the refund proceeding. Id. Accordingly, end-users of gasoline purchased from Beacon Bay need only document their purchase volumes from Beacon Bay during the period covered by the Remedial Order to make a sufficient showing that they were injured by the overcharges. 3. Regulated Firms and Cooperatives. In order to receive a full volumetric refund, a claimant whose prices for goods and services are regulated by a governmental agency, i.e. a public utility, or an agricultural cooperative which is required by its charter to pass through cost savings to its member-purchasers, need only submit documentation of purchases used by itself or, in the case of a cooperative, sold to its members. However, a regulated firm or a cooperative will also be required to certify that it will notify the appropriate regulatory body or membership group of the receipt of the refund. See Marathon , 14 DOE at 88,514&hyph;15. This requirement is based upon the presumption that, with respect to a regulated firm, any overcharges would have been routinely passed through to its customers. Similarly, any refunds received should be passed through to its customers. With respect to a cooperative, in general, the cooperative agreement which controls its business operations would ensure that the overcharges, and similarly refunds, would be passed through to its member-customers. Accordingly, these firms will not be required to make a detailed demonstration of injury. 4 4 A cooperative's purchases of gasoline from Beacon Bay which were resold to non-members will be treated in a manner consistent with purchases made by other resellers. See Total Petroleum, Inc.,/Farmers Petroleum Cooperative, Inc., 19 DOE ¶85.215 (1989). 4. Resellers and Retailers. a. Small Claims Presumption. We will adopt a ``small claims'' presumption that a firm which resold gasoline purchased from Beacon Bay and requests a small refund was injured by the overcharges. Under the small claims presumption, a reseller or retailer seeking a refund of $5,000 or less, exclusive of interest, will not be required to submit evidence of injury beyond documentation of the volume of gasoline it purchased from Beacon Bay during the period covered by the Remedial Order. See TOGCO , 12 DOE at 88,210. This presumption is based on the fact that there may be considerable expense involved in gathering the types of data necessary to support a detailed claim of injury; for small claimants the expense might possibly exceed the potential refund. Consequently, failure to allow simplified refund procedures for small claims could deprive injured parties of their opportunity to obtain a refund. Furthermore, the use of the small claims presumption is desirable in that it allows the OHA to process the large number of routine refund claims expected in an efficient manner. 5 5 In order to qualify for a refund under the small claims presumption, a reseller or retailer must have purchased less than 72,471 gallons of gasoline from Beacon Bay during the settlement agreement period. b. Mid-Level Claim Presumption. In addition, a reseller or retailer claimant whose allocable share of the refund pool exceeds $5,000, excluding interest, may elect to receive as its refund either $5,000 or 40 percent of its allocable share. 6 The use of this presumption reflects our conviction that these larger, mid-level claimants were likely to have experienced some injury as a result of the overcharges. See Marathon , 14 DOE at 88,515. In some prior special refund proceedings, we have performed detailed analyses in order to determine product-specific levels of injury. See, e.g., Getty Oil Co., 15 DOE ¶85,064 (1986). However, in Gulf Oil Corp. , 16 DOE ¶85,381 at 88,737 (1987), we determined that based upon the available data, it was more accurate and efficient to adopt a single presumptive level of injury of 40 percent for all mid-level claimants, regardless of the refined product that they purchased, based upon the results of our analyses in prior proceedings. We believe that approach generally to be sound, and we will therefore adopt a 40 percent presumptive level of injury for all mid-level claimants in this proceeding. Consequently, an applicant in this group will only be required to provide documentation of its purchase volumes of gasoline from Beacon Bay during the Remedial Order period in order to be eligible to receive a refund of 40 percent of its total allocable share or $5,000, whichever is greater. 7 6 Under the mid-level presumption, a claimant which purchased between 72,471 gallons and 181,177 gallons from Beacon Bay would be eligible to receive a principal refund, exclusive of interest, of $5,000. A claimant purchasing more than 181,177 gallons of petroleum products would be eligible for a principal refund equal to 40 percent of its allocable share. 7 A claimant that attempts to make a detailed showing of injury in order to obtain 100 percent of its allocable share but, instead, provides evidence that leads us to conclude that it passed through all of the overcharges, or that it was injured in an amount less than the presumptive level refund, may not necessarily receive a full presumption-based refund. Instead, such a claimant may receive a refund which reflects the level of injury established in its application.
