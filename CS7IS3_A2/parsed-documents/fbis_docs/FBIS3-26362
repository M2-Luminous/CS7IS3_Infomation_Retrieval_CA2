According to information from a relevant quarter, a relevant department under the State Council has issued instruction to various localities since the second half of last year, stipulating that from then on when provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities stage business-canvassing activities in Hong Kong and overseas, they must submit their plans to the relevant State Council department for examination and approval; as for counties, cities (county-level cities), and first-grade enterprises directly under the central authorities wanting to stage business-canvassing activities in Hong Kong and overseas, their applications will be scrutinized more stringently, and they must submit applications not only to the next higher government for examination and approval, but also to the relevant State Council department for approval. The instruction also stressed that various kinds of business-canvassing activities must attach importance to practical results. At the same time, apart from strictly restricting various localities from staging business-canvassing activities outside the country and borders, the relevant State Council department also instructed that regarding various kinds of business-canvassing activities organized by the localities, and various kinds of festive activities "staged in the name of culture, but turned out to be economic and trade operas," regulation and control will be strengthened, and centralized arrangements will be made. According to information, the reason for the Chinese Government to make up its mind to exercise strict control over various localities wanting to stage business-canvassing activities outside the country and border is because many negative effects caused by the excess business-canvassing activities in the past have already gradually surfaced. Among the effects are: First, too much "untrue foreign capital." Many investment projects which are made in the name of foreign firms or foreign sources, are in fact made by mainland organizations (mainly state-run organizations) which transfer their funds overseas and then back home with a new name, and the purpose is to evade taxes and to enjoy the preferential policy in the areas of taxes and import and export of quotas for foreign-funded enterprises. Such moves not only cause losses in government revenue, but also bring about great chaos to various economic domains and links. Second, the proportion of foreign capital being made really available is extremely low. The excess business-canvassing activities have created an unhealthy practice of being "false, big, and empty," and led to a situation in which the unfulfilled letters of intent and agreements on huge amounts of investment fly in the sky everywhere. A certain big province in the north said at the end of last year that it had attracted $6 billion of foreign funds, but in reality less than $100 million of the foreign funds was really made available. Third, astonishing waste and extravagance. Over the past one or two years, business-canvassing activities staged outside the country (border), especially in Hong Kong by various localities, have involved larger and larger delegations and increasingly extravagant layouts, while some people have used the business-canvassing activities as excuses to travel on public funds, to the serious extent of practicing fraud and putting the cart before the horse. In order to cover up the economic "hole" which involved a large amount of money, they could only report false results in the business-canvassing activities. In light of this situation, and in order to check corrupt practices in economic activities, the State Council has promptly sent a strongly worded "red-letterhead document" to various localities in the whole country, strictly controlling those who want to stage business-canvassing activities in Hong Kong and overseas, and saying that violations of the regulations will be looked into according to law and discipline.
