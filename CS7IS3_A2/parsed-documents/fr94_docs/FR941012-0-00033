FR941012-0-00033 FR941012-0-00010 FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION 47 CFR Part 73 [MM Docket No. 93&hyph;321; RM&hyph;8409] Radio Broadcasting Services; Ocean Isle Beach, NC AGENCY: Federal Communications Commission. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Commission, at the request of Ocean Isle Broadcasting Company, allots Channel 228A to Ocean Isle Beach, NC, as the community's first local aural transmission service. See 59 FR 4020, January 28, 1994. Channel 228A can be allotted to Ocean Isle Beach in compliance with the Commission's minimum distance separation requirements, at coordinates 33&hyph;53&hyph;40 North Latitude and 78&hyph;28&hyph;26 West Longitude, with a site restriction of 4.3 kilometers (2.7 miles) west to avoid a short-spacing to vacant but applied-for Channel 229A at Wrightsville Beach, NC. The allotment at Ocean Isle Beach is short-spaced to the presently licensed facility of Station WLTT, Channel 228A, Shallotte, NC. However, pursuant to the modification of Station WLTT's license to specify operation on Channel 279C3, a construction permit specifying the new channel has been granted and the licensee has now filed an application for license to cover its construction permit (BLH&hyph;940210KA). Final action on a construction permit application for Channel 228A at Ocean Isle Beach may be withheld pending the licensing of Station WLTT at the site specified in its construction permit. With this action, this proceeding is terminated. DATES: Effective November 21, 1994. The window period for filing applications will open on November 22, 1994, and close on December 7, 1994.
