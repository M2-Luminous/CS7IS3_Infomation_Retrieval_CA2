FR940916-1-00080 FR940916-1-00016 The NTSB commented that cold weather operations impose additional problems regarding brake system leakage due to shrinkage of the brake components in extreme cold. This commenter stated that it would like to see some type of additional testing to assure that excessive leakage is not occurring. The Board acknowledged that, since the original recommendation, the railroads have added equipment that performs better in cold weather conditions. FRA Conclusions. FRA recognizes that few, if any, of the commenters supported the mandating of additional testing in cold weather or in mountain grade territory. FRA agrees that the development and use of welded pipe fittings, wide lip hose couplings, and ferrule clamps has greatly reduced the effects of cold weather on the air brake system. However, FRA believes that there are several extreme operating conditions that involve added safety risks and that need to be further addressed by the railroads. These include cold weather and mountain territory operations as well as the operation of long and heavy trains. FRA feels that each railroad needs to develop detailed operating procedures for these types of operations, tailored to the equipment and territory of each railroad. Furthermore, FRA believes that the use of chemicals in the trainline must be eliminated in order to prevent untimely damage and wear to the brake system components. Therefore, FRA feels that most trains operating in cold weather should be equipped with air dryers. Several railroads commented that they have already equipped their locomotives with these devices in order to curb the use of alcohol and other foreign substances in the trainlines. IV. Training of Test and Inspection Personnel Currently, the regulations require that the initial terminal test and inspection be performed by a qualified employee but does not provide any guidance as to what type of knowledge these individuals should possess. See 49 CFR ยง232.12(a)(1). An increasing number of train brake tests and inspections are being conducted by train crews and FRA has concerns whether or not all personnel performing these duties are truly qualified. Consequently, FRA sought comments and information from interested parties regarding the type of training that is currently provided to individuals charged with inspecting and testing train brake systems, and suggestions on the type of training these individuals should receive. See 57 FR 62553. The AAR and several railroads commented that employees performing air brake tests and inspections are adequately trained to perform these tasks. However, many of the railroads admitted that they could do a better job of training their employees. Several railroads presented information regarding their individual training programs. The training provided by these commenters ranged from several days to several weeks, a portion of which is dedicated to air brake tests and inspections. Most of the major railroads stated that their training includes annual testing of the employees upon completion of the formal training classes and that employees must pass these tests with scores of 85&hyph;90 percent. Several railroads also mentioned that their training involves a certain amount of on-the-job training in addition to the formal classroom training and that unannounced site checks are conducted by their supervisory personnel. The ASLRA commented that most shortline railroads engage in cross-training of their employees so they can perform all functions of the operations and that these railroads rely heavily on the Class I railroads' training facilities and video tapes. Several railroads stated that some type of list of those employees that are considered qualified to perform tests and inspections is maintained either in the form of a formal list or a list of employees who have received the necessary training. The AAR and all the other railroads providing comments believed that there is no need for FRA to impose training or certification requirements. These commenters felt that training is the responsibility of the carriers and that carriers are in best position to determine the type of training needed for their operation. The AAR contended that the decline in train accidents, derailments, fatalities, and injuries over the last ten years is a testament to the adequacy of current training provided by the railroads. The AAR and several railroads also insisted that there is no reason to require those employees performing air brake tests and inspections to be as highly trained as a carman and that something more reasonable is sufficient. These parties also felt that merely being a member of a particular craft should not automatically make a person qualified, and the AAR added that any reference contained in the regulations designating a particular craft to perform the inspections should be eliminated. Many of these commenters also stated that there is no need for FRA to certify qualified persons and that such a scheme would merely increase the costs to railroads without improving the performance of those individuals conducting the tests and inspections. Several labor organizations commented that the current training provided by the railroads to the individuals performing the air brake tests and inspections is insufficient. The BLE and various members of the United Transportation Union (UTU) stated that the training they have received is inadequate to prepare them for making the air brake tests and inspections they are currently required to perform. Representatives of the BRC and several of its individual members stated that train crews lacked the experience and training necessary to perform inspections and tests of the air brakes. These individuals also contended that only carmen are qualified by training and experience to perform these tasks based on the fact that they have completed two- to three-year apprenticeships and have completed numerous written exams. These commenters stated that elimination of various tests and inspections, such as the elimination of cleaning, oiling, testing, and stencilling (COT&S) requirements and run-through inspections, and the increase of permissible piston travel have placed primary importance on the initial terminal inspection, which is not being performed properly because train crews are not qualified to perform the tasks. Several members of the BRC recommended that carriers be required to have carmen perform all initial and intermediate inspections and any other tests or inspections required by the FRA. Every commenting labor organization and several of their individual members recommended that FRA designate qualified inspectors by specifying the experience and training that are required for these individuals rather than leaving these matters in the railroad's discretion. Most of these commenters also suggested that FRA certify those employees that are deemed to be qualified to perform these tests and inspections. Two labor organizations also suggested that FRA require railroads to maintain a list of those individuals deemed qualified in order to assure compliance with the regulations.
