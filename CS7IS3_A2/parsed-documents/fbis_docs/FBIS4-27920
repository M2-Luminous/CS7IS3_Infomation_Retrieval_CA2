FBIS4-27920 "dreas109__a94022" FBIS-EAS-94-109-A Daily Report 18 May 1994 ANNEX Japan EA Policy on Water Quality Approved EA Policy on Water Quality Approved 942A0277A Tokyo NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN in Japanese 18 May 94 p 9--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 942A0277A Tokyo NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN Japanese CSO [Text] In order to prevent the generation of trihalomethane, a carcinogenic substance which is formed during tap water disinfection by chlorine, a basic policy on preservation of water quality in tap water source water areas established by the Environment Agency [EA] was approved by the cabinet on 17. Although harmful substances such as cadmium were already regulated by the Water Quality Pollution Prevention Law, trihalomethane, a secondary generation, had been placed outside the subject of regulation. Moreover, according to results of earlier surveys by the Ministry of Health and Welfare, it has been revealed that the greatest value of trihalomethane concentration in 110 water purification plants of 94 concerns nationwide has exceeded 70 percent of the water quality standard for the past three years. In the midst of this, a special measures law was newly put into effect on 10 May with trihalomethane the target of regulation, narrowing the focus to tap water source water areas. Along with this, the EA recently established basic policy to make the law effective and provided specific application procedures. In the future, based on the demands of the waterworks industry, the EA will seek the provision of high-level water purification treatment facilities such as ozone treatment and granular activated charcoal treatment on a case-by-case basis, in addition to drainage regulations for plants and business establishments that are considered to discharge substances that are the source of trihalomethane in upstream river areas.
