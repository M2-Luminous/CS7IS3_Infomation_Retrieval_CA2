He stressed that without assistance from Russia the economic situation in Tataria would have been substantially worse. "At present we are receiving much more from the federal budget for current expenses than we remit. To conduct spring agricultural work alone the republic has received an easy credit of 65 billion rubles, which exceeds our contribution to the Russian budget by almost 10 times."
