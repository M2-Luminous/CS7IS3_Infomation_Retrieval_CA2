Our party affairs correspondent Shmu'el Tal reports that MK's Salmovitz, Goldfarb, and Segev are now seeking to reconvene Tzomet's Central Committee within two weeks in order to discuss their demand that their allegations of financial mismanagement in the movement be investigated. The MK's said that if their suspicions prove true, they will demand that Tzomet Director General Doron Shmu'eli take a leave of absence until the investigation into the matter is concluded. MK Ester Salmovitz, who is deputy speaker of the Knesset, explained that she and her two colleagues would retain their posts until the Central Committee convened. Our correspondent reports that Tzomet Chairman Refa'el Eytan announced that he would reply to the three MK's request in several hours.
