FBIS4-45001 "jpnea031___94009" JPRS-NEA-94-031 JPRS Near East & South Asia 16 June 1994 NEAR EAST ALGERIA National National Employment Agency Statistics Reported 94AF0200B Algiers LIBERTE in French 15-16 Apr 94 p 7 94AF0200B Algiers LIBERTE French CSO [Article: "Jobs: Disparity Between Placements and Job Supply"] [Text] The National Employment Agency (ANEM) says the disparity is explained by employers' need for workers with skills. While 36,537 employment applications were recorded in fourth quarter 1993, only 12,383 jobs were offered and 10,030 placements were made, according to statistics from ANEM. Examination of ANEM's statistics shows that only about one out of three applications was successful and about one out of four job seekers placed. The 19-percent disparity between placements and supply is explained, according to the agency, by employers' need for employees with professional experience and seniority. A breakdown of the statistics on job seekers (36,537), whose numbers were up 17.61 percent from the previous quarter, shows only 16.24 percent were women, while 83.76 percent were men. Nearly half the job seekers (46.32 percent) were youths aged 16 to 25. Close to 5 percent of applicants are university level, 24.10 percent have no education, 48.80 percent have a primary school education, and 21.96 percent have some secondary schooling. ANEM notes a 47.42-percent increase in job applications from persons who have university degrees. Job seekers with some middle-school or high-school education were even more numerous during the period, their numbers increasing respectively 20.8 and 40.1 percent from third quarter 1993. However, 54 percent of applicants have no skills and 40.53 percent are highly skilled workers or foremen, while high-level technicians and managerial personnel accounted for only 5.42 percent of employment applications. Out of the total supply of jobs (12,383), a figure that was 21.5 percent larger than the corresponding third quarter figure, only 43.72 percent were for permanent positions, compared to 56.28 for temporary employment. Buildings and public works and industry were the biggest purveyors of employment, accounting for 41.86 and 33 percent of total supply, respectively. Growth in these two sectors was 7.5 and 17.5 percent, respectively. Agriculture has also seen a tangible increase in positions available (up 97.36 percent), while ANEM reports a 28-percent decline in the transport sector. With regard to placements (10,030, up 17.5 percent), the agency noted that 85.51 percent of jobs went to men, against 14.49 percent that went to women. According to ANEM, the difference is explained by the nature of specific position requirements. Also, 80.68 percent of total placements were with public-sector employers, versus 15.12 percent with domestic private employers, and 4.20 percent with foreign private-sector firms. Of jobs actually filled, 39.07 percent (3,919 jobs) were permanent in nature, while 60.93 percent (6,111 jobs) were temporary. Foreigners Hired During fourth quarter, work authorizations were approved for 1,056 foreigners, a 6.63-percent increase over the previous quarter. Workers from the CIS were the largest group with 209 authorizations, followed by Moroccans with 160 and Frenchmen with 100. Eighty authorizations were approved for Italians, 58 for Tunisians, 36 for Spaniards, and 35 for Americans. The other 378 were divided among a number of nationalities. ANEM indicated that during the same period 417 new work permits were delivered, 481 renewed, and 158 declarations recorded for French and Tunisian workers, who are not subject to work permits (100 for Frenchmen and 58 for Tunisians). Also, 577 breaches of contract were recorded, and 10 work permits refused.
