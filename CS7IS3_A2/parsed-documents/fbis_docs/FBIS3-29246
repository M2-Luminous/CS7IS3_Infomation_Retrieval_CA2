"The issue is still a blank piece of paper and I am not working on the assumption that I should conduct it immediately," the premier said in reply to a coalition lawmaker at the House of Councillors plenary session. Hosokawa said he will focus provisionally on seeking Diet approval of the third pump-primer supplementary budget for fiscal 1993 and revisions of a political reform package that passed the Diet on January 29. Hosokawa made the remarks in response to a question from Kazuo Oikawa, a lawmaker of the Social Democratic Party [of Japan] [SDPJ], the biggest force in his coalition, which responded sharply to his proposal to reshape his six-month-old cabinet. His remarks came at a moment time when some leaders of the ruling coalition traded sharp exchanges over the reshuffle proposal. Speaking at the foreign correspondents club of Japan, SDPJ Secretary General Wataru Kubo urged Hosokawa not to reshuffle his cabinet to fire his spokesman, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura. "If the reshuffle is designed to oust a specific cabinet minister, the administration will lose its solidarity," he warned. Hosokawa and Takemura were once close political allies, but their relationship is now reportedly at odds. Hosokawa said Tuesday that he intends to reshape the cabinet that has been in place since he assumed power last August. He also sounded out Hiroyuki Sonoda, a key figure in Sakigake, on whether he is ready to take over the post. Takemura heads Sakigake, one of the partners in the coalition. He is known to be at odds with Hosokawa over the premier's proposal to impose a new 7-percent indirect levy on goods and services. Takemura also clashed late last year with Shinseito co-leader Ichiro Ozawa and Yuichi Ichikawa, secretary general of Komeito, over the handling of political reform bills. Ozawa reportedly asked Hosokawa to dismiss takemura. Ichikawa told a meeting of Komeito lawmakers, "it is high time for us to seek to ensure that the cabinet can work smoothly by eliminating differences within the cabinet." Democratic Socialist Party Chairman Keigo Ouchi balked at the idea of the reshuffle, but the No.2 man in the party, Takashi Yonezawa, another ally of Ozawa, has remained mum on the issue.
