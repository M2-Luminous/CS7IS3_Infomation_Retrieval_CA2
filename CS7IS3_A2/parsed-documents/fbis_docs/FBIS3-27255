The move emphasised a wide split between the local government of China's largest industrial city and the central authorities in the Chinese capital, according to Shanghai-based China analysts. With support from paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, local authorities even dared to defy directives from their former bosses, the Chinese President and Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin and economic supremo Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji, Shanghai sources told The Hongkong Standard yesterday. Both Mr Jiang and Mr Zhu were Shanghai party chiefs and mayors before they were promoted to Beijing after a 1989 military crackdown on nation-wide pro-democracy movements. The municipal party authorities reached a consensus recently to seize the historic opportunity to continue its economic momentum despite the fact Mr Jiang and Mr Zhu recently warned the locality to sincerely implement Beijing's latest directives on economics. Fearing social instability from increasingly inflationary pressure, Beijing has decided to suspend some sweeping reforms and slow down the growth in a bid to cool down the economic overheatings. Mr Zhu also ordered all reform packages and development plans that might spur inflation temporarily shelved until a more "favourable environment was created." But in a municipal economic conference early this month, the secretary of Shanghai's Communist Party Municipal Committee, Wu Bangguo, assured local officials that the city was to maintain its pace in reform with its "three no's" policy. The list promoted no changes to previous policies and plans; no withdrawal of economic power delegating to lower authorities under economic liberalisation; and no publicising what the city did. Meanwhile, the party authorities have agreed on an ambitious development plan for 1994, revealed yesterday by mayor Huang Ju to the ongoing annual session of the municipal law-making body. Brushing aside problems of inflation and overheating, Mr Huang said Shanghai would continue to maintain high growth rates this year. Describing 1994 as a crucial year for reform in the city, Mr Huang said: "If we want to speed up development we must dare to face challenges." Mr Huang made no mention of Beijing's austere measures for creating credit and 'investment. The mayor called for a growth of 12 percent this year which is much higher than the national average of nine per cent set by Beijing. Mr Huang's speech reflected all the priorities of paramount Chinese Ieader Dcng Xiaoping, who wanted the city to pioneer China's reforms and development in the 1990's and used the city as a platform to campaign for his ideas. However, Mr Huang also warned of the danger of unemployment which, along with inflation, is the biggest worry for Chinese workers. Many Shanghai factories have reduced working hours or are paying staff a minimum wage to stay at home.
