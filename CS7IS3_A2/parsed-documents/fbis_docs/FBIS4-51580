Science, Technology, and Environment Minister Datuk Law Hieng Ding said today the commitment was made at the sixth ASEAN ministerial meeting on the environment under the Bandar Seri Begawan Resolution on Environment and Development. The two-day meeting in Brunei ended yesterday. Describing it as a major breakthrough, he said applying the same environmental standards would ensure efforts to contain water and air pollution were harmonised in the region. ASEAN members have targeted that by the year 2010, the pollutant standards index (PSI) for air quality should be below 100 PSI, while for river water, the PH (acidity) should be between six and 8.5. The other water quality parameters include dissolved oxygen of 2 mg/1 or more and total suspended solids (TSS) of 200 mg/1 or less. Further to this, he said 1995 had been declared ASEAN Environment Year where each member country would highlight specific events to commemorate the occasion. Besides official meetings, ASEAN members would hold informal discussions on the environment from time to time. Malaysia will take the lead by holding the first informal meeting at the end this year. Law said ASEAN members had agreed to strengthen regional cooperation in the monitoring of transboundary movement of toxic wastes. This was in line with the Basel Convention members' agreement on the immediate export ban of toxic waste from industrialised to developing nations "At the meeting, we pledged to actively implement actions as outlined in Agenda 21 and promote th principles contained in the 1992 Rio Declaration on Environment and Development. "Under our ASEAN Strategic Plan of Action on the Environment for 1994 to 1998, we reached a consensus to harmonise policy directions as well as to enhance operational and technical cooperation. "We also agreed to undertake joint action to address common environmental problems," he told reporters after attending the weekly cabinet meeting. Law also said the concerted efforts by ASEAN ministers to integrate environment and economic policies at regional level was testimony that developing countries were sincere and committed in achieving sustainable development. "We need to guard ourselves against the developed countries lest they accuse us of disregarding our environment in our pursuit of development. They may resort to such tactics to impose trade sanctions against us. To push ASEAN in the forefront on environment, he added it had been proposed that the ASEAN secretary general be represented at the Commission on Sustainable Development (an outcome of the 1992 earth summit) meeting in New York at the end of next month.
