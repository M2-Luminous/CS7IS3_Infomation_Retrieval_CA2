Yesterday the managers of 108 leading Russian banks which are shareholders and members of the Moscow Inter-Bank Currency Exchange signed an open letter to the mayor of Moscow, Yuriy Luzhkov. In this appeal the bankers have again pointed out the negative consequences of the duty's introduction. Almost a month has passed since the decision to introduce a duty on foreign currency operations was reached. During this time the criticisms addressed to the Moscow municipal council have become louder and louder. The leadership of the exchange itself spoke out repeatedly with verbal statements which foretold all but the crash of the Exchange. Yuriy Luzhkov also received a diplomatically irate letter from the chairman of the Central Bank Viktor Gerashchenko. The appearance of the bankers' letter to the mayor on the eve of the municipal council's decree entering into force has been the culmination of events. The gist of the letter comes down to four basic points. First: the lion's share of the country's exchange currency turnover goes through the Moscow Inter-Bank Currency Exchange and the introduction of a duty means the imposition of an additional tax on Russian importers and exporters. The former will be forced in this case to shift their additional costs to the consumers and a stimulus to conduct the obligatory sale of foreign currency earnings on other Russian exchanges will appear for the latter. This will appreciably reduce the Exchange's turnover. Second: it is precisely on the Moscow exchange that the Central Bank conducts operations to regulate the exchange rate of the national currency. With a reduction in the operations of the Moscow exchange it can lose the role of the "exchange rate forming" (kursoobrazuyushchiy) center of Russia. Third: the introduction of an additional duty worsens the already far from favorable tax climate in the capital and Moscow can altogether lose the status of the financial center of Russia. And, finally, fourth. The bankers think that the financial problems of Moscow will not be solved by the introduction of additional duties and that the use of more civilized methods, for example the issuance of municipal bonds (similar to the GKO [not further identified]) is far more effective for increasing the revenues of the city's budget. I didn't succeed in getting commentaries on the bank managers' letter from officials of the Moscow municipal council. They alluded to the fact that this document had not yet been officially received. However, it became obvious from the conversation with the bureaucrats that they are troubled not so much by the letter as by the problems of implementing the municipal council's decision. Considering the strong opposition to this decision on the part of the banks and the exchange itself and also that the mechanism for levying this tax has so far not been developed (in particular, even the payers of the duty have not been determined), one can infer that the decision of the capital's authorities will not enter into force in its original version in the near future and, most likely, will be transformed. From the letter of the Russian Banks to the Mayor of Moscow, Luzhkov, Yu. M. In the name of the leading Russian banks which are shareholders and members of the Moscow Inter-Bank Currency Exchange, we would like to express to you our concern in connection with the decision recently adopted by the Moscow municipal Duma to introduce, as of 1 March 1994, a duty on transactions involving the buying and selling of foreign currency completed on the exchanges of the city of Moscow... Being one of six Russian currency exchanges, the Moscow Inter-Bank Currency Exchange has concentrated more than 80 percent of the country's currency exchange turnover. Some $12.6 billion were sold last year at the auctions of the Moscow Inter-Bank Currency Exchange, which constituted approximately a third of Russian export currency earnings. Introduction of the new duty means that most Russian exporters will be subject to the additional tax..., which will stimulate their urge to conduct the obligatory sale... on regional currency exchanges. Importers also will suffer, since their expenditures for acquiring foreign currency on the Moscow exchange market will be significantly increased. It is natural that they will shift these costs to the consumers, having included them in the prices for imported goods... It needs to be noted... that the Central Bank carries out currency interventions in support of the exchange rate of the national Russian currency most actively precisely on the Moscow Inter-Bank Currency Exchange and establishes the official ruble exchange rate... on the basis of the results of its exchange sessions. In the event that the decision adopted by the Duma is implemented... the Central Bank will be compelled to carry out policy regarding the regulation of the exchange rate on another currency exchange. The volumes of operations on the Moscow Inter-Bank Currency Exchange will drastically decline and it... will lose the role of the exchange rate forming center of Russia... With the introduction of the duty the banks' costs with respect to exchange currency operations will double approximately, which will force the leading Russian banks to leave the Moscow market and to begin more active work in the regional centers, primarily in Saint Petersburg... From the curtailing of exchange currency operations in Moscow alone the municipal treasury can lose revenues received in the form of the 35-percent tax on the profit of the Moscow Inter-Bank Currency Exchange, and in the process not receive the anticipated revenues from the duty being introduced. According to its principles the Moscow Inter-Bank Currency Exchange is a non-commercial organization. Last year the bank's shareholders... directed the basic portion of the profit to the acquisition of modern technologies... for the further development of the Russian financial market, mainly the state securities market. At the present time, on the order of 100 billion rubles is received into the state treasury every month from the floating of bond loans. Such an approach is a far more effective method of replenishing the municipal budget as compared to the introduction of a duty on currency operations (the receipts from which will shrink drastically together with the fall in the volume of exchange auctions)... The preparation of the Government of Moscow for the issuance of a municipal bond loan could become the model of a civilized approach to the financing of the municipal budget and the city's commercial banks are ready to assist the Government of Moscow in organizing the issuance and circulation of municipal bonds using the technical base of the Moscow Inter-Bank Currency Exchange. We apply to You with a proposal about a joint search for well-considered and professionally grounded approaches... which can ensure not a reduction but an increase in the role of Moscow as the most important and most dynamically developing financial center of Russia.
