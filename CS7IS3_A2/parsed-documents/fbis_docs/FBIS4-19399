That occasion offered me the opportunity to meet with President Clinton for close to an hour on 14 April. We discussed various issues. We discussed the issue of Bosnia-Herzegovina in detail and assessed the steps that can be taken by NATO. I also had the opportunity to explain in detail the fact that Armenians and Armenia have been occupying Azerbaijan. I pointed out that a similar approach must definitely be adopted in the Caucasus. At the same time, I discussed in detail the measures we have taken to eliminate the bottleneck in which the Turkish economy finds itself. I can say very frankly that the U.S. Administration has given its full support to what we said and to the economic package. The U.S. Administration said that clearly. In a meeting later with the World Bank, details of the economic package were discussed. I was happy to see that the World Bank clearly supports the economic program. This program involves a series of measures that must definitely be implemented to bring prosperity to our people. This program will bring prosperity to our people. It consists of a series of measures that we will implement ourselves, without the support of any financial organization. Nonetheless, we were happy to see the support given to it by the World Bank and later by the IMF. We were happy because they gave their full support. We later met with Mr. Bentsen, secretary of the U.S. Treasury. He expressed similar views and support. I then went from Washington back to New York, where I delivered a speech at the Elie Wiesel Foundation on the issue of human rights. We had the opportunity to stress to the whole world once again Turkey's dedication to human rights and to democracy. This reverberated throughout those circles. Our faith in democracy and in human rights may be interpreted differently at certain international platforms. It is beneficial for us to take every opportunity to show the truth and to stress and explain the Turkish people's dedication to democracy and to the struggle for human rights at different international platforms. We also held a series of contacts with various U.S. financial institutions and banks. I was happy to see the renewed trust in Turkey and the extent of the support to be given its integration into world money markets. In brief, our visit to the United States was positive in all aspects and was auspicious for our country.
