The trouble was sparked off in the early hours of yesterday morning when police moved in to the electronics factory and tried to evict them and a number of reporters by force. Among those seriously injured were at least five workers from the firm and four reporters. As many as 20 other workers were said to have received minor injuries. Although police denied there had been any arrests, reporters said there had been several and that other people had been forced to hand over identity documents. Witnesses told reporters that police had been firing guns amid the rioting and hitting workers with truncheons as the trouble flared. Workers had occupied the offices of the Crown Mustang building for nearly two weeks in protest against low salaries and redundancies. Fifteen workers at the firm and a further 120 at Continental Fueguina were laid off last week. UOM metal workers union representative Oscar Martinez said the repression had been "absolutely terrible" and that police had "chased workers along the streets for at least ten blocks. "One man had his head split open by a stick smashed over his head by police," Martinez said. "Another was shot in the arm while another was kicked while on the ground." A statement, issued by Tierra del Fuego Government Minister Fulvio Baseda, said that the violent eviction order had been ordered by Judge Fernando Machado after workers had refused to stop their strike late Friday evening. Moments later in direct contradiction to the statement, Tierra del Fuego Governor Jose Strabillo, who had said Friday that the strikes would not lead to violence, said that the police action had been wholly justified: "They (the police) were merely carrying out their legal orders." "On arrival (at the factory) they were hit by stones and home-made bombs that were being thrown out of the windows of the factory by the workers," the governor said. Yet Strabillo's deputy, Miguel Angel Castro, told reporters later in the evening that there would be an immediate independent investigation in order to determine whether the police had in any way abused their authority. He also said police had been ordered to move in given that the workers had "illegally invaded what constitutes private property." As a result of the clashes, which workers said had been on the cards ever since the government ordered a detachment of Border Guards to the province last week supposedly to curb any hints of violence, there will be a general strike tomorrow as a further mark of protest. Union leaders also refused to rule out further collective action in the latter parts of next week. Local reporters said the police had also cordoned off the local FM Fuego radio station and fired rifle shots at its offices, forcing the station to close down for some three hours. Hours after the turmoil, witnesses said there was still tension between the public and police as a series of marches were being held through the streets with approximately 800 people participating. The decision to strike was voted for unanimously by members of the local branches of the UOM metal workers union, the ATSA health workers union as well as members of the restaurant and oil workers union. Employees at local-based companies have been demanding wage hikes for two years in order to compensate for living in one of the most expensive provinces in the country. Labour Minister Armando Caro Figueroa and Interior Minister Carlos Ruckauf were originally due to visit the province tomorrow in an attempt to pacify workers and bring the situation back to normal. There was no immediate statement as to whether the plans would still be enforced. Meanwhile Ruckauf said last night that the government was not planning to revert to intervention in an attempt to bring order to the troubled zone. "It's not even a remote possibility," the minister said. "It would only be considered if the local government pleaded for such a step or if the police forces were out of their depth." He added that although the government and security services would continue to monitor the developments in the province closely, they would respect the workers' right to strike. Ruckauf emphasized that the Border Guards stationed nearby were on alert and that the government would not hesitate to dispatch them to the scene of the disturbances if the situation gets out of hand over the next few days.
