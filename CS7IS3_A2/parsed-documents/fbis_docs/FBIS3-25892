Yan Haiwang made an important speech at a provincial meeting on commending advanced collectives and individuals and on judicial work yesterday. He said: Comprehensively implementing the party's basic line and preserving social and political stability are the main tasks in judicial work at present and are also new demands on judicial work in this new situation. Without a stable social and political environment, reform, opening up, and economic development will be impossible. Leaders at all levels must have a good idea of development trends, profoundly, thoroughly, and meticulously perform their work, and make earnest efforts to improve the legal system and supervision. They should formulate local laws and regulations to stimulate the healthy and stable development of the province's market economy. In the meantime, it is necessary to carry out severe crack downs on crime and to concentrate efforts on cracking major cases, curbing criminal gangs, and tracking down fugitives. We must fully display the functions of comprehensive management over social order. Yan Haiwang pointed out: We must profoundly carry out the fight against corruption, resolutely crack down on all crimes in the economic field, and form a leadership contingent which is firm in politics, well versed in professional work, and sound in work style. Provincial leaders present at the meeting were: Lu Kejian, Shen Xiaozeng, Yang Zhenjie, Yang Huaixiao, Hu Huie, and Wang Ping.
