Mr. Etienne Sengegera stated in a communique that the media, "manipulated and/or misinformed by supporters and sponsors of the Rwandan Patriotic Front -- rebels from the Tutsi minority group -- have remained silent over the numerous atrocities that these rebels, who have moved up the ladder working alongside Ugandan President Museveni -- a former underground leader -- have committed as they wage their dirty war in Rwanda." Furthermore, Mr. Sengegera said "President Museveni's proteges lose no time in burying their victims in mass graves. They take care to photograph and film them for their pernicious propaganda, with the aim of deceiving the international community by presenting the Hutus thus massacred as Tutsis who are the victims of a so-called genocide."
