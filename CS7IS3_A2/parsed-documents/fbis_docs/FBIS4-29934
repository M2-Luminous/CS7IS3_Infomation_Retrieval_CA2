The content of the telephone message is as follows: Bringing an end to North-South mistrust and confrontation and opening a new phase in independently and peacefully reunifying the fatherland without depending on outside force through top-level talks is a policy we have consistently adhered to for a long time. The tense situation in the country today makes it all the more urgent for the North and South to hold top-level talks. I think it fortunate that at such a time your side has expressed the position of holding top-level talks this time and, under authorization, notify your side that we welcome your side's proposal for holding a preliminary contact for North-South top-level talks and agree to it. Holding the top-level talks of the two sides will be a historic event that will give our 70 million fellow countrymen the joy of national reconciliation and unity and a new hope for peace in the country and its independent, peaceful reunification. To successfully hold North-South top-level talks, on which attention from home and abroad has been focused, our side will send a three-member delegation led by a vice premier-level official and four accompanying officials to your side's area in Panmunjom at 1000 on 28 June, Tuesday.
