Lambeck: "Ruehe Makes Concessions to the FDP Regarding Military Service"] [Text] Bonn -- Defense Minister Volker Ruehe (Christian Democratic Union) is apparently prepared to accept Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] proposals to make the basic military service more flexible. In the future, it is to take nine to 13 months. This is shown by the answers to a catalogue of questions about his conceptual guidelines, which Ruehe passed on to the FDP for tomorrow's session of the coalition and the government. It mentions a range of 10 to 23 months. Since Ruehe's model grants one month of leave to the conscripts performing basic military service, however, one can start from a net figure of nine months. Ruehe's answer is as follows: "In order to make the young men flexible in planning their professional life in connection with military service, they are to be offered the possibility of serving voluntarily for a longer period than the minimum." Moreover, the defense minister advocates that the alternative national service time of 15 months be left unchanged. The reason is that two months of standby readiness are added to the compact basic military service of 10 months minus one month of leave. The basic military service for the crisis-reaction forces is at least 12 months anyway. According to Ruehe, the peacetime strength of the armed forces is to be 340,000 men. Although the minister concedes an increase to 370,000 men to the FDP at any time, the Bundeswehr's infrastructure, according to Ruehe's information, will be designed for 340,000 men in the future: "The structures of the armed forces will be cut to a peacetime strength of 340,000. The reduction of the volume will also be reflected by a reduction of the organizational elements, so that the objective of cost reduction will be achieved." The minister makes the need for a new debate on the closing or reduction of bases quite plain: "It is clear that the consequences for the deployment will only be ascertained in detail in the course of the planning process, and decisions will be made afterward and only be implemented in the following years. Here, the deployment in all FRG regions will have to be taken into account."
