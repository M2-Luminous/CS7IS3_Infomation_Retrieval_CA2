An Administrative Reform in the Kremlin: All Information Provision Departments Will Be Abolished"] [Text] While observers' attention is centered on the ongoing reorganization of the government and the replacement of "shock monetary" reforms by "non-shock and non-monetary" ones, the gradual reorganization of presidential structures is successfully and inconspicuously coming to an end. According to information in possession of SEGODNYA, a corresponding presidential edict may be signed before the end this week. The latest variant for the organization of these structures to be approved by the edict bears the obvious marks of behind-the-scenes struggle. The new scheme for the presidential structure enshrines the effective exclusion of the power ministries and the Foreign Affairs Ministry from the government and their inclusion into the presidential administration. Furthermore, its most characteristic feature is the emergence of a "dual power" situation within the presidential administration: Viktor Ilyushin, the president's first aide, is equated in his "weight category" with the figure of the presidential administration chief. Consequently, the first aide, who in the new hierarchy is above the Security Council secretary and power ministers, emerges from a formally secondary figure into a full-fledged official. The presidential structures plan originally envisioned that the Analytical Center, the president's business management, the State Legal Directorate, and the Oversight Directorate would pass under the control of his first aide. The administration chief's jurisdiction was to include the remaining "vital" services, such as departments within presidential commissions, departments on matters of citizenship, state awards, pardons, and so forth. The latest version of the plan features a number of minor but -- from the inner-party viewpoint -- extremely important provisions. Separation of powers in the administration leadership has not been delineated so clearly as in the past (which leaves room for apparatus improvisations). Furthermore, the new plan has obviously reflected the results of behind-the-scenes bargaining between the administration and the president's first aide. The new version does not provide for the president's national security adviser -- a relatively independent post currently occupied by Yuriy Baturin. Presidential regional representatives have been moved from the jurisdiction of the administration chief "under the first aide." The leadership of the State Legal Directorate and the Oversight Directorate has been formally removed from the control of the first aide and placed under the president: the question about their jurisdiction has therefore been left open. And finally, the Information Resources Directorate (IRD) has been abolished within the presidential administration while its remains are to be transferred to the Federal Government Communication and Information Agency under the president (FGCIA). After a year and a half in the shadows, Viktor Ilyushin officially legitimates his first role in the president's entourage. This is not only a matter of a clash of personal ambitions by the first aide and the presidential administration chief, who does not have such close contacts with the apparatus, but a tough political struggle under the table. The direction and meaning of this struggle are reflected most conspicuously in the fact that FGCIA (a former government communications committee under the USSR KGB) has successfully "swallowed" the last relatively independent information provision service in the presidential structures -- the Information Resources Directorate. The easy and generally accessible information channels created by IRD allowed the presidential team to establish effective interaction with the regions during the crises in August 1991 and in April and September 1993. This was especially important in the situation when some former KGB generals who came to head the "renewed" federal agencies showed a propensity for "falling sick" on 21 September, "getting lost" immediately after the order arrived on disconnecting communication channels in the White House, and playing a double game with Rutskoy and Khasbulatov till the last moment. FGCIA has taken repeated steps to assume control of the entire "policy in the information provision sphere" in Russia. As of the moment IRD is abolished, FGCIA -- a former specialized subdivision of the secret police designed to ensure confidential communication channels (the "hot line" and so forth) -- officially takes control of information provision, including open information channels of all state structures: the Federal Assembly, the government, and the presidential administration. The secret police information services did not enjoy such powers even in the Soviet period, when they could so easily disconnect the USSR president from running the country. According to some sources, the backstage changes in the presidential circles reflect the general trend: After two years of painstaking work to overcome the undesirable consequences of the August 1991 events, the "underground Sverdlovsk [Yeltsin's home base] Obkom" in the Kremlin, in close contact with the "underground Gazprom" in the White House and other such like structures, is finally restoring both informational-political and organizational control over Russia's top state leadership. Invaluable assistance in this undertaking is coming from the still intact "democratic administrators": Against the background of their get-together in the Kremlin, the "obkomists'" teamwork and cohesion produces a particularly strong impression and leads to especially effective results. According to a source, the best analogue for the incumbent democratic leadership in the presidential administration is the White Rabbit and his administrative team in the entourage of the Queen from Alice in Wonderland. Frenetic activity with zero (if not negative) effect may help forget for a while that what is happening is a mere deck of cards being reshuffled by quite other players. The mechanism for making major decisions by the president is rather peculiar because it envisions the possibility of making last- minute adjustments, from slightly changing the essence of the decisions made to reversing them. Therefore the impending comprehensive informational-political and organizational isolation of the president by his apparatus is rather reminiscent not of Foros-'91, but Gorkiy-'23 [Lenin's last retreat].
