What Next?" rubric: "Emergency Measures Against Bandits"] [Text] The Russian Federation president's edict "On Urgent Measures To Protect the Population Against Banditry and Other Manifestations of Organized Crime" has produced conflicting assessments among both scientists and practical workers of the law enforcement agencies. It is perceived by some as a long-awaited measure which will immediately help to combat various criminal groups, whereas in others it inspires a fear of arbitrary rule by the authorities. To arrive at a correct verdict on the extraordinary measures planned by the president for combatting manifestations of organized crime it is necessary to look at the possible consequences, both positive and negative, of their implementation. The crime situation in Russia has begun to deteriorate sharply in recent months. Showdowns among criminals in the big cities are increasingly resembling military operations. Meanwhile, the prevailing law enforcement practice and the conflicting nature of the norms of the existing criminal and criminal-procedural legislation are not always conducive to exposing criminal organizations. The many months of work by operational subunits often end in the conviction only of those who actually commit a specific offense. The article in our Criminal Code envisaging liability for banditry (Article 77 of the Russian Federation Criminal Code) never really did work, and it is still being applied only in very rare instances. Furthermore, the Russian Federation Supreme Court's rulings on the application of this article have simply made it harder to qualify bandit attacks. That is why the courts are continuing to qualify an act committed by a gang as an act of theft, robbery, extortion, or murder by a group. Nor does the draft law "On the Struggle Against Organized Crime," which is being prepared by a State Duma committee, inspire hope. This draft law does not take into account the existing legal system in Russia or the principles and provisions characteristic of a rule of law state. Is this not reason enough to understand the urgent need for the adoption of emergency legal measures by the Russian president? Everyone who speaks out against the edict should note that it does not replace the existing legislation but merely gives the operational services greater scope for gathering information not about individual crimes but primarily about criminal groups. The only deviation from the rules laid down by procedural law is in regard to those crimes typically committed by gangs or other forms of organized criminal group suspected of committing serious crimes. Prior to the edict the existing law not only did not oblige but did not even encourage the law enforcement agencies to try to expose a criminal organization. The edict, however, directs the operational services precisely toward exposing criminal organizations. For that purpose alone is it permissible, prior to the institution of criminal proceedings, to carry out expert appraisals and hold preliminary investigations into the financial and economic activity and the property and financial status not only of suspected persons but also of those close to them. Such harsh deviations from citizens' democratic rights and freedoms enshrined in the Russian Federation Constitution are dictated by the need to protect Russia's citizens from the orgy of crime. Such actions, incidentally, are characteristic of any democratic state which is compelled to fight organized crime. The edict stipulates the use of the emergency measures powers only when there is sufficient evidence of an individual's involvement in a gang or other organized criminal group which is justifiably suspected of having committed serious crimes and not just any crime. The use of the emergency measures on other grounds must be viewed as an abuse of power or an offense against justice. Mistakes are possible, of course, as is the deliberate abuse of the norms of the edict in a number of cases. But the institution of prosecutor's oversight exists for that purpose. The edict clearly prescribes that all emergency measures must be coordinated with the Prosecutor's Office. Each instance of an operational investigation into an individual's involvement in a gang or other organized criminal group must be recorded and the results of the corresponding work must be entered in the files of the operational investigation in question. The materials contained in such files make it possible to answer the question of whether the implementation of the emergency measures is legal and necessary. Every one whose guilt is not proven in the manner prescribed by law is entitled to receive on demand a report on the nature of the information pertaining to him. It is possible to appeal to the court against a refusal to provide such information. Thus the existing legislation and, in particular, the Law "On Operational Investigation Activity" provides a guarantee against excessive use of power by an "overzealous official." There have been many criticisms of the detention of suspects and accused persons for a period of up to 30 days. For some reason, however, people disregard the fact that someone accused of a serious crime may already be detained in custody for over a year solely on the grounds of the gravity of the offense (Article 96 of the Russian Federation Criminal Code). Under the edict only a suspect's involvement in a gang or other group suspected of committing a serious offense allows that person to be kept in custody for up to 30 days. There is the danger, of course, that these emergency measures -- when applied by nonprofessionals, bogus individuals, or people who like to kick up a fuss about "high-profile cases" -- are a dangerous weapon which could lead to violence on the part of certain law enforcement agencies, which will undermine still further the Russian population's faith in them. Thus it would be advisable to grant such powers only to subunits of the Federal Counterintelligence Service and the Russian Federation MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] Main Directorate for Combatting Organized Crime as the agencies best prepared to track down and wipe out criminal organizations. Public opinion would possibly be reassured by being kept informed about the practical implementation of this edict. There is one more point which merits the public's attention. Having been given further scope for combatting manifestations of organized crime, staffers of the law enforcement agencies must understand that citizens' patience has already been exhausted. If those who have been given the task of combatting criminal organizations cannot make proper use of the emergency powers granted them by the edict it would be better for them to stand down. I believe that we will find people who are equal to this task. So let us assess this work according to its actual results and not according to some mythical dangers.
