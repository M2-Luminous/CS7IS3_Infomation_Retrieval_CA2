The LPDR is no longer needed and will close effective February 11, 1994. The West Los Angeles Regional Library has been the LPDR for the UCLA Research Reactor since December 1980 when it was established for the proposed license renewal. Since that time the LPDR has remained operational maintaining documents on the termination of the UCLA License No. R&hyph;71 through the decommissioning of the facility. On December 28, 1993, the NRC issued an Order releasing the UCLA Research Reactor Facility for unrestricted use. Therefore, effective February 11, 1994, the LPDR will be closed. Dated at Bethesda, Maryland, this 25th day of January, 1994. For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Donnie H. Grimsley, Director, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Office of Administration. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;1869 Filed 1&hyph;27&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7590&hyph;01&hyph;M
