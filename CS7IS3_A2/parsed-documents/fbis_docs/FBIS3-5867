The city's directorate of commerce has presented proposals to the government in Hanoi to issue separate licences for imports and exports rather than the current combined licences so as to encourage exports and cut back on the amount of imported goods, the LAO DONG newspaper reported. Vietnam's cumbersome trade licensing procedures have come under attack from foreign businesses here, who would like to see the thicket of bureaucracy thinned out, but officials have maintained what a Western consultant here called "an informal quota system." Authorities in the southern city also called for low-interest loans for such businesses as rice production to bolster vital export sectors, the labour newspaper said. The measures would help the city meet its target of boosting exports by 29 percent this year to 760 million US dollars while keeping the rise in imports down to five percent, the newspaper said. HCMC is trying to eradicate a 271-million-dollar trade deficit that built up last year, when it failed to meet a target of a 10-percent rise in exports, it said. City officials are urging an increase in the minimum capital of a trading company from 200,000 dollars to one million dollars to eliminate "adventurous" or vulnerable companies, the report said. Other proposals currently being considered by the Ministry of Commerce include a further clampdown on smuggling from Cambodia and China and efforts to boost counter-trade with the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). Tax breaks should be given to companies trading the nations of the former Soviet Union "in order to win a large market with which trade has been shrinking." Before its breakup in 1991, the Soviet Union was Vietnam's largest trading partner and aid donor but in 1993 Russia fell to 11th place on the list of investors here while trade with the CIS has slumped because of a shortage of hard currency in the countries.
