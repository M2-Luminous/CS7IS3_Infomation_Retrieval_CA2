The evidence found links Velandia to the arrest, disappearance, and murder of Nidia Erica Bautista, a woman who was an M-19 member. Several men arrested Nidia on a Bogota street the day her son made his first communion in August 1987. [Begin Janet Bautista, Nidia's sister, recording] The deposition given by former Officer Bernardo Alfonso Garzon, who was then an active member of the 13th Counterintelligence Brigade, is very clear. He said the brigade commander at the time, Velandia, knew of and approved the plan to murder Nidia. [end recording] Based on several testimonies, the guerrilla's body appeared at the Guayabetal Cemetery three years later. The Attorney General's Office is saying today Velandia, who was a colonel and the commanding officer of the Chavez Solano Intelligence Battalion at that time, knew of and authorized those events. [Begin Erick Arellana, Nidia's son, recording] This is the first step we have seen after waiting for so long and suffering so much. I feel it is important, because for so many years nothing was done. [end recording] The investigation has also implicated Sergeant Julio Roberto Ortega in this case. It is charged he played an active role in Nidia Bautista's disappearance. Now, the soldiers will be able to present their defense, which will be evaluated by the Attorney General's Office before giving its final assessment.
