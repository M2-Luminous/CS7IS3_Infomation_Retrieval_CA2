She made the remarks when meeting with Assistant Trade Representative for GATT Affairs Dorothy Dwoskin from the United States, who led a delegation here to attend the eighth round of Sino-U.S. talks on China's resumption of its GATT membership. During the meeting with the U.S. delegation following the end of the two-day talks, Wu said that China has taken a series of major steps in reforming its economic and trade system, adding that China has made active efforts in its talks with the U.S. "We are ready to show flexibility on some issues of concern by signatory parties," she said. However, she added, China sticks to the principle of balance between rights and obligations required of her before being allowed to re-enter GATT. "It is impossible for us to accept excessive demands well above the level of China's economic development," she said. Dwoskin expressed appreciation for the measures China has taken in reforming its economic and trade system, especially in reforming its foreign exchange system. She also reiterated the firm support on the U.S. side for the resumption of China's signatory party status in GATT, pointing out that China should fully observe the obligations as a member of a World Trade Organization (WTO). In the eighth round of the talks, both delegations agreed that negotiations on China's re-entry into GATT is multi-lateral work which demands efforts from all GATT members. They held that this round of negotiations has made full preparation and provided a sound basis for the 16th meeting of the GATT working party on China, which is scheduled to open in Geneva in March, to achieve constructive results. This is the first round of talks between the two countries on the issue after the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of GATT talks. The two delegations exchanged in-depth views on a wide range of specific issues concerning China's re-entry into GATT.
