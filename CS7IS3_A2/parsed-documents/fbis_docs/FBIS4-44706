It facilitates navigation among data and enables accessing according to specialized viewpoints. Filing one's data is fine; knowing how to share them is even better. The CNES [National Center for Space Studies] at Toulouse, together with Aerospatiale Satellites at Cannes, chose object-oriented technologies on which to base the creating of Baghera, their technical-data accessing tool. Baghera was developed by the Espri-Concept company--which markets the software--using 02 Technology's object-oriented database management system. Aerospatiale and CNES have both validated the product on the basis of a project, and are now planning to extend its use. "In the space industry, each project generates masses of data that must be accessible by all the participants (design bureau, project manager, office responsible for manufacturing, etc...)," says Jean-Luc Le Gal, head of engineering tools integration at CNES. A satellite program, for example, will produce 15,000 technical documents, 11,000 models of CAD, 200 images and photos, and even some 100 video sequences describing components-integration methods. Maximizing Simplification of Information Access The role of a tool such as Baghera is consequently that of facilitating the filing and accessing of these data of very different natures. The primary need expressed by the future users of the system was utter simplicity of access to the information. "After a comparative test between a relational database and an object-oriented one, the latter was chosen, because it enables free-ranging navigation within the data," says Andre Labat, CEO of Esprit-Concept. In Baghera, the data are structured in the form of a technical flow chart. The user need only click at the nodes of the flow chart to obtain, step by step, all the plans, documents, images, and video sequences desired. By clicking at a CAD model displayed on the screen (a satellite), the user can select a component and obtain the manufacturing drawings, video of its integration, etc. Adding to the database is simplified, since creating a component in a project means adding an object into the base. The other problem that arose in the design of the CNES's database was the diversity of its potential users. Each user needs to quickly obtain the information specific to his or her specialty. Baghera resolves this problem by making it possible to construct a specific organization of data, around the reference base, for each specialist. This system of "viewpoints" enables the design engineer, the project manager, and the fabrication engineer, for example, to access the data by the means with which each is familiar. Thus, the designer of a propulsion system will first display its schemas. But upon clicking at a piece of equipment, the designer will obtain its manufacturing drawings, lists of components, a video sequence of its assembly, etc. The links created among objects correlate the data modules corresponding to the different viewpoints, and maintain the coherence of the whole. This capacity for adding to the modes of access to information is being used to advantage at CNES and Aerospatiale to gradually bring their different services around to using the database. A Promising Technological Marriage The marriage between object-oriented technologies and DBMS's goes back beyond just yesterday. The first object-oriented DBMS's came into being in 1988, and since then this niche has seen a relatively sizable growth featuring products such as: ObjectStore by Object Design, the market leader, whose French subsidiary was created toward the end of last year; Ontologic's Ontos; Servio's Gemstone; Versant and two French products that have succeeded in asserting themselves in this emerging market; ADB's Matisse; and 02 Technology's 02. To the conventional functions of the relational DBMS, the object-oriented DBMS adds its ease of adaptation and extension, as well as a respectable ability to manage complex and multimedia data. Technical-data processing is well represented in applications such as CAD, technical databases; network management, geographical data systems, etc... But the management environment is becoming increasingly aware of the advantages of object-oriented DBMS's.
