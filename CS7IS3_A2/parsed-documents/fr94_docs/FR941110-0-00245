Section 488.28 is revised to read as follows: §488.28 Providers or suppliers, other than SNFs and NFs, with deficiencies. (a) If a provider or supplier is found to be deficient with respect to one or more of the standards in the conditions of participation or conditions for coverage, it may participate in or be covered under the Health Insurance for the Aged and Disabled Program only if the facility has submitted an acceptable plan of correction for achieving compliance within a reasonable period of time acceptable to the Secretary. (b) The existing deficiencies noted either individually or in combination neither jeopardize the health and safety of patients nor are of such character as to seriously limit the provider's capacity to render adequate care. (c)(1) If it is determined during a survey that a provider or supplier is not in compliance with one or more of the standards, it is granted a reasonable time to achieve compliance. (2) The amount of time depends upon the_ (i) Nature of the deficiency; and (ii) State survey agency's judgment as to the capabilities of the facility to provide adequate and safe care. (d) Ordinarily a provider or supplier is expected to take the steps needed to achieve compliance within 60 days of being notified of the deficiencies but the State survey agency may recommend that additional time be granted by the Secretary in individual situations, if in its judgment, it is not reasonable to expect compliance within 60 days, for example, a facility must obtain the approval of its governing body, or engage in competitive bidding. §488.50 [Removed] 11.
