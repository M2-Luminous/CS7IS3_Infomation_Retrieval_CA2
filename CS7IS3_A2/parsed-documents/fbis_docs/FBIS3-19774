According to the ministry, an in-depth review must be made of the situation which takes into account the various aspects of the question. "We are, in fact, even with the individual limits for the so-called protected markets, in a situation of a single market which allows free circulation among all European countries." "Furthermore" the note continued, "the agreement to limit `yellow' car imports does not take into account the sale of transplants, which account for a significant share of the market held by Japanese makes and represents another element of serious concern for Italy." The effective performance of the new car market, the ministry argued, is "in the end influenced by the competitiveness of prices, which determined, in 1993, only a partial use of the Japanese quota." The statement from the Ministry for Foreign Trade went on to underscore how "it is still not clear whether, as in 1993, the possibility exists to verify and re-examine, in the course of the year, that adjustments which the evolution of the market would dictate."
