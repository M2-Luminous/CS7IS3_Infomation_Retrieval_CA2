In a telephone conversation with Mikola Kurak, secretary of the organizational committee and a reserve officer, Kurak noted that his party should not be confused with the existing Belarusian National Democratic Party. According to Kurak, the main goal of BNP is to unify Belarusians around national ideas, establish and strengthen the Belarusian state, integrate into Europe, conduct privatization while preserving promising state enterprises and kolkhozes, develop national Belarusian business, and open the path for foreign capital investments. The BNP organizational committee has issued an appeal to citizens of Belarus. The main slogan of the appeal is "Belarusians, help yourselves!" In the opinion of the new party's founders, Belarusians should consider themselves the masters of their land. "We must not allow foreigners to oppress us. They are only guests in our common home of Belarus," the appeal stresses. "The BNP believes that neither the communist way nor the current pseudodemocratic one will lead the country out of political disorder and the economic abyss. The BNP supports a third way -- the unification of all genuine Belarusians on a national basis." The new party is to advocate the supremacy of Belarusians in all spheres of the country's life. The founders of BNP believe that the democratic development of our state is a matter of the future. As Mikola Kurak said, the constituent assembly of the BNP will be held in late February or early March. According to Kurak, a number of signatures exceeding the minimum required to register a party with the Ministry of Justice has been collected in the capital alone. Kurak stated that the organizational committee has supporters in Brest, Homel, and Mahilew Oblasts, who have agreed to establish the BNP.
