Zhang pointed out: Patten is absolutely not qualified to comment on China's affairs. When asked by a reporter what he would like to say on Patten's attack that the statement of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office a few days ago lacks legal authority, and his remark that whether the three-tier assemblies will be able to straddle 1997 should be determined by the National People's Congress, Zhang Junsheng said: "What qualification does he have to comment on the affairs of our country? This is an affair of our country. It is surprising that he made such comments!" Zhang Junsheng added: "The Basic Law is the law of the PRC's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [SAR] rather than that of Britain. What qualification does Patten have to interpret our Basic Law?" He said: Originally, in a bid to effect a smoother transition in 1997, the Chinese side accepted the plan on the through train proposed by the British side. However, Patten dished out his constitutional package of "three violations," disrupted the Sino- British talks on the 1994-95 electoral arrangements and, under the condition that no agreement had been reached between China and Britain, unilaterally tabled his constitutional package to the Legislative Council. This has led to the termination of talks, and the issue of through train no longer exists. I have said repeatedly that according to the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the British rule over Hong Kong will completely end on 30 June 1997, so he has no right to meddle in any affair after our restoration of sovereignty in Hong Kong as of 1 July 1997. When asked by a reporter under what circumstances the Sino- British talks can be resumed, Zhang Junsheng answered that it was hard to say since the British side had terminated the talks and unilaterally tabled Patten's constitutional package to the Legislative Council in violation of its commitment. Zhang Junsheng added: "What is to be discussed now? He has left the negotiation table with his briefcase, and the door has been closed. What else can we talk about?" In Zhang's opinion, "whoever started the trouble should end it." Hence, whether the talks can be resumed depends only on whether the British side will now totally withdraw the package that Patten has tabled to the Legislative Council and make contacts again through diplomatic channels. Zhang Junsheng pointed out: "Things are very plain now, just as Director Zhou Nan said the day before yesterday, that for those who have engaged in the `three violations,' the sea of bitterness has no bounds, but there is another sentence following that which reads -- those who will turn back can reach the shore." Zhang Junsheng stressed: We said a long time ago that the Chinese Government would certainly ensure the smooth transfer as well as the prosperity and stability in Hong Kong together with Hong Kong citizens. We have such determination and confidence to effectively perform our work for the transition and recovery of Hong Kong on 1 July 1997. Zhang Junsheng said: The Preliminary Work Committee for the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong SAR is entirely capable of doing the preparatory work for Hong Kong's smooth transition at the initial stage very well. Now that the Basic Law is placed there, we will plan the transition issues of Hong Kong in accordance with the Basic Law. Originally, the Chinese side hoped to have British cooperation, but it refused to cooperate. What should we do? Will we not take back Hong Kong and establish the SAR Government without its cooperation? As to some people's accusation that the statement of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office was not in keeping with the Basic Law, Zhang Junsheng pointed out: "These people simply have no knowledge of the Basic Law, which is the basic law of the PRC's Hong Kong SAR. Both the future Legislative Council or regional organizations will all be organizations of the Hong Kong SAR, whose nature will be diametrically different from that of the current Legislative Council and regional organizations." "The current British Hong Kong Government is one maintaining British colonial rule, which, in terms of the nature of sovereignty, is diametrically different from the future SAR Government -- a local government with a high degree of autonomy and directly under the jurisdiction of the central government of China as a sovereign state," he concluded.
