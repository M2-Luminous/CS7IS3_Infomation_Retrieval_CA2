Good evening, Mr. Prime Minister. [Silajdzic] Yes, hello. [Hochner] Mr. Prime Minister, over the past hours we have heard reports that shooting has broken out in Sarajevo again. Do you fear that the cease-fire, which is not even two months old, may crumble in your capital? [Silajdzic] Yes, for the first time in a month we have had shooting again, 10 to 12 shells came into Sarajevo. Of course, this is something that worries us very much, but we have expected it after the weak, limited UN warning to the Serbs, the aggressors, in Gorazde. In my view, they were encouraged by the half-hearted UN mission in Gorazde, a mission that was also delayed, because for 15 days people were being killed and attacked there, and when the UN and NATO finally intervened, this was too limited really to give them a clear message. [Hochner] What is the situation like in Gorazde today, as far as you know? Is the town in danger of being taken by the Serbs? [Silajdzic] Of course, there is always such a danger. As you know, we do not have any weapons, we do not have any ammunition, and the people in Gorazde.... [sentence incomplete as heard] About 200 people have died since the beginning of the attacks; 720 people have been injured, some of them are in danger of losing their lives, of course. The situation is not good at all. As I said, I think that the Serbs feel encouraged by all that they have been able to achieve with the international community. I do not think that this course of action was productive for the peace process, because the warning was not strong enough. [Hochner] Russia's envoy to Bosnia, Churkin, said this evening that the Serbs have promised him to agree to a cease-fire. Do you know anything about this agreement, and do you believe that such a cease-fire can be achieved in your country through Russian mediation? [Silajdzic] Permit me to say here that we are -- at least I am -- greatly frustrated by this very late Russian initiative, which is coming now toward the end to set a diplomatic sign. Where were they 15 days ago, or seven days ago, or just three days ago, when people were dying like flies and the Serbs were shelling not only civilians but also attacking UN troops? We say that it was a mistake to carry out these air raids. [German sentence as heard] It was said that the Russians were not consulted. I think it was a grave mistake to let them take all these diplomatic steps whenever they want to. I think one should adopt a clear position and those who committed this crime should be punished. We are now practically the hostages of a geopolitical situation, in which one has to consult the Russians regarding all details. People are being killed -- and the attackers should be punished for that. A withdrawal must take place, and as long as such a withdrawal does not take place, we will not hold talks. If they withdraw behind the line from where the attack started, then the peace process may continue. Let me add one thing, they are now holding 58 UNPROFOR observers hostage. They have stopped all the humanitarian convoys. That behavior belongs to the Stone Age. In the end, we will probably have to talk to them, make concessions to them, go to Geneva again or somewhere else, where speeches are made then about how the Serbs became victims because of the UN and NATO troops. I believe that this farce should stop. They are fascist criminals and they must be punished. [Hochner] Mr. Prime Minister, thank you very much for this interview. Good evening to Sarajevo.
