Moreover, a joint working group will be established in order to bring the Crimean legislation in conformity with the Ukrainian constitution and laws. A Crimean delegation member, Chairman of the parliamentary Commission on State Construction Sergey Nikulin told INTERFAX-Ukraine that Crimean and Ukrainian parliamentarians had agreed that Crimean and Ukrainian legislation did not conform with each other on many points. Nikulin said that this resulted in the inability of Crimea to pursue an independent economic policy. He said that the issues on a treaty basis for bilateral relations and dual citizenship had not been discussed during the talks. During the last month Ukrainian-Crimean relations were focused on the treaty basis for relations and on dual citizenship. The Crimean parliament restored this provision when re-establishing the Crimean constitution of 6 May 1992. The Ukrainian parliament disagreed with this and adopted the appropriate decision on 20 May urging the Crimean parliament to go back to the former version of the Constitution. Nikulin stressed that this issue could be re-considered after Ukraine adopted its new constitution. Commenting on the talks, Nikulin said that the Crimean delegation was even surprised with the complete understanding of its position by Kiev. "We want and we are ready to work together," he added. This evening the Ukrainian parliamentary delegation will leave for Kiev.
