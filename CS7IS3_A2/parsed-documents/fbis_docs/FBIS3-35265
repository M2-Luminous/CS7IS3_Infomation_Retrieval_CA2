He added: There are a number of topics to be examined. They require us to unite our efforts. And this is what we discussed with Major al-Khuwaylidi al-Humaydi.

We are hoping that the coming days will witness intensified contacts to examine our affairs with clarity, resolve them, and lay down a joint plan of action to resolve all related matters, he pointed out.
