ACTION: Institution and scheduling of final countervailing duty and antidumping investigations. SUMMARY: The Commission hereby gives notice of the institution of final countervailing duty investigation No. 701&hyph;TA&hyph;355 (Final) under section 705(b) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1671d(b)) (the Act) to determine whether an industry in the United States is materially injured, or is threatened with material injury, or the establishment of an industry in the United States is materially retarded, by reason of imports from Italy of grain-oriented silicon electrical steel. 1 1 The products covered by these investigations are grain-oriented silicon electrical steel, which are flat-rolled alloy steel products containing by weight at least 0.6 percent of silicon, not more than 0.08 percent of carbon, not more than 1.0 percent of aluminum, and no other element in an amount that would give the steel the characteristics of another alloy steel, of a thickness of no more than 0.560 millimeter, in coils of any width, or in straight lengths which are of a width measuring at least 10 times the thickness. The subject products are provided for in subheadings 7225.10.00, 7226.10.10, and 7226.10.50 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States. In the scope section of its preliminary antidumping determinations, the Department of Commerce noted that the HTS numbers identified in the scope of the countervailing duty determination will be conformed with those listed in the antidumping determinations. The Commission further gives notice of the institution of final antidumping investigations Nos. 731&hyph;TA&hyph;659 and 660 (Final) under section 735(b) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1673d(b)) to determine whether an industry in the United States is materially injured, or is threatened with material injury, or the establishment of an industry in the United States is materially retarded, by reason of imports from Italy and Japan of grain-oriented silicon electrical steel.1 For further information concerning the conduct of these investigations, hearing procedures, and rules of general application, consult the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, part 201, subparts A through E (19 CFR part 201), and part 207, subparts A and C (19 CFR part 207).
