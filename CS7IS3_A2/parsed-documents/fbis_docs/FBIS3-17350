The Georgian Defense Ministry told us today that the Abkhazian side opened artillery fire this morning on villages in Kodor Canyon, leading to casualties among the civilian population.

It is the equipment that was withdrawn following the evacuation of Sukhumi. It is not capable of carrying out combat tasks. If something is being done there, it is only self-defense, nothing more. [Correspondent] Eduard Shevardnadze called the beginning of combat operations an attempt to disrupt the political settlement of the Abkhazian conflict.
