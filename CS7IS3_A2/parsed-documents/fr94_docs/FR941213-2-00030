FR941213-2-00030 FR941213-2-00021 Office of Energy Research Energy Research Financial Assistance Program Notice 95&hyph;08: Electron Beam Irradiation of Medical Waste Agency: U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). Action: Notice inviting grant applications. SUMMARY: The Office of Health and Environmental Research (OHER) of the Office of Energy Research (ER), U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), announces its interest in receiving applications for support of the research and development of technology for commercial exploitation of electron beam sterilization of infectious hospital waste in preparation for disposal. It is essential that the research be conducted at a public, urban teaching hospital affiliated with a comprehensive medical school and research center with an active electron beam program and documentable experience in operating a functional machine. In recent years, the practice of handling medical infectious waste by incineration or autoclaving has resulted in public controversies in terms of environmental and public health issues. Irradiation of medical infectious waste by electrons might provide an environmentally safe and publically acceptable method for disposing of this waste. Applications should also address: (a) Monitoring and validating the treatment efficacy; (b) pre-irradiation processing of waste, and (c) economic feasibility of this approach. Before preparing a formal application, potential applicants are encouraged to submit a brief preapplication, in accordance with 10 CFR 600.10(d)(2), which consists of two to three pages of narrative describing research objectives and methods of accomplishment. The preapplications will be reviewed relative to the scope and research needs for the commercial exploitation of electron irradiation technology for medical waste disposal. Preapplications referencing program Notice 95&hyph;08 should be received by January 1, 1995, and sent to Dr. Matesh N. Varma, Office of Health and Environmental Research, ER&hyph;73, U.S. Department of Energy, GTN, Washington, D.C. 20585, telephone: (301)903&hyph;3209. Telephone and telefax numbers are required to be a part of the preapplication. A response to the preapplications discussing potential relevance of a formal application will be communicated by January 15, 1995. DATES: Formal applications submitted in response to this notice must be received by 4:30 p.m., E.S.T., March 8, 1995, to be accepted for a May review and to permit timely consideration for award in Fiscal Year 1995. ADDRESSES: Formal applications referencing Program Notice 95&hyph;08 should be forwarded to: U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Energy Research, Acquisition and Assistance Management Division, ER&hyph;64, (GTN), Washington, D.C. 20585. Attn: Program Notice 95&hyph;08. The following address must be used when submitting applications by U.S. Postal Service Express Mail, any commercial mail delivery service, or when hand-carried by the applicant: U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Energy Research, Acquisition and Assistance Management Division, ER&hyph;64, 19901 Germantown Road, Germantown, MD 20874. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dr. Matesh N. Varma, Office of Health and Environmental Research, ER&hyph;73, U.S. Department of Energy, GTN, Washington, D.C. 20585, telephone: (301)903&hyph;3209. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: DOE is interested in receiving research applications focused on the study of electron irradiation for treatment of medical waste. Additional information can be obtained by contacting Dr. Matesh N. Varma at (301)903&hyph;3209. It is anticipated that approximately $1 million will be available for one award during Fiscal Year 1995, contingent upon availability of funds. Information about development and submission of applications, eligibility, limitations, evaluation and selection processes, and other policies and procedures may be found in the Application Guide for the Office of Energy Research Financial Assistance Program and 10 CFR Part 605.
