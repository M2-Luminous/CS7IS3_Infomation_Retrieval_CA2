The British Audit Office may have indeed concluded that the Pergau Dam would not be an economic proposition and should not be built. But it is for Malaysians to decide. Malaysia has brilliant think tanks, an effective parliamentary opposition, and a highly vocal environmental lobby. The British certainly don't have any special wisdom that has missed all of them. Nor should British papers assume that concessionary loan arrangements in return for purchase of warplanes and contracts for major development projects are unusual. If such linkages are prohibited in Britain, that is for the British Government to answer. It has nothing to do with Malaysia. And there is simply no link between these deals and the BMF [Bumiputera Finance] affair. In fact, it says something about the British press that it has only now discovered that scandal. Carrian [company] collapsed a decade ago. All the BMF offences were committed in colonial Hongkong. Most of the people involved remain in the British colony's jurisdiction. London has seen it fit to grant Lorraine Osman [former BMF official] residence in Britain after he served a short sentence in a plea bargain deal. British newspapers could still demand an accounting, if they are so inclined. Britain could set up a full inquiry into the affair and override colonial inhibitions. Instead, British papers dredge up some old BMF stories and link it tenuously to the Pergau Dam payments. Truth to tell, the British newspapers have their own political agenda: they want to bring down John Major and the Tory government. The editors feel that the Conservatives have been in power too long. Some of them also feel that Major's government has been dishonest in telling them Britain would never deal with terrorists while holding secret negotiations with the Irish Republican Army. Mr. Major's Back-To-Basics policy has also gone seriously awry. It was meant to distract attention away from high unemployment and other economic woes. The Tory right wanted to use it to punish single mothers and others living off social welfare. Unfortunately, the British press decided that Tory politicians should be held to the same moral standards that they prescribe for others. The result was a series of embarrassing disclosures for Mr. Major. The Pergau Dam and the arms deal has become yet another bludgeon against Mr. Major. None of this would have bothered Malaysia except that in the process the British papers began to attack Mahathir Mohamed personally, without a shred of evidence. It was too much. But a shutout of British firms from future government contracts is a very blunt instrument of retaliation indeed. It punishes the wrong people. More importantly, it dilutes the principles of free trade and competition. On his part, Mr. Major should help to limit the damage to British industry. Of course, he has no control over the British press. He should, however, officially disassociate his government from these scurrilous reports. It may only be a simple symbolic act but it might help to break thc impasse.
