Mr. Ople clearly detailed the heated and dramatic exchanges over the national budget in his long article about it in the Bulletin. The hard work of Mr. De Venecia, the Speaker of the House, on the budget debates deserves high praise. And his team of legislators hardly had any sleep during the debates on the budget bill while they were working on their respective assignments. At the top of the list are the two seasoned lawmakers, Rony Zamora and Mr. Raul Daza, of the Liberal Party. Likewise, on the Senate side, a lot can be said about the leadership qualities of Mr. Ed Angara, the President of the Senate. Neither did the senators have any sleep during the past week. Maceda and Ople are the most conscientious of all. Not far behind those two are F. Tatad, Tito Sotto, and Mr. Boy Herrera, who despite all obstacles, did not cease scrutinizing and commenting on the budget. So also with the four female senators, S. Rasul, L. Shahani, Gloria Macapagal and Coseteng, all active in studying, questioning and streamlining the national budget. It seems that there were no lazy legislators in the House and the Senate. Everyone was hard at work. Thus, there will be no resentment during the upcoming long vacation of the legislature. The controversial CDF (Countryside Development Fund) was also included in the budget. The decision-making powers of President Ramos have increased concerning what is dear to him. The President now has the authority to utilize this fund wherever or whenever there is calamity, destruction, or extreme deprivation in society. Apparently the legislature has full confidence in Mr. Ramos and deservedly so. Ramos does not convey the image of a man desirous of acquisitions. And this image must not be ruined even if he prefers to be surrounded by people eager to wheel and deal. Of all the provisions in the budget, the countryside funds are the most important. It is a new concept that can help considerably in improving the economy in the provinces. There are some people who believe that it should be plainly labelled `pork-barrel.' In areas where the fund is wisely spent, the residents are pleased. They view the government as caring and loving. Feeder roads, schoolhouses, Artesian wells...These are some of the things that can be funded by the CDF. Without this (i.e., the CDF), our senators and congressmen are just like mannequins. They will simply have to wait on the good graces of the President or of the Cabinet members. And many of the Cabinet members have one qualification for office: Arrogance. The education budget is barely adequate. It should have been much bigger; however, there are still other priorities. The national budget is huge; hence, Vizons-Chato, Parayno, and whoever becomes the `Pagcor', must expedite tax collection for the country's needs. And those of you who are economically well-off, do pay your taxes for our future's sake.
