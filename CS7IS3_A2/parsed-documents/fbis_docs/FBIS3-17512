Speaking at a government meeting in the village of Metsamor where the station is located, the president expressed the opinion that the reopening of the station would enable Armenia to gain minimal energy independence and to avoid considerable losses from a transportation and energy blockade. Ter-Petrosyan said that "a serious inspection at the international level" is to be carried out at the nuclear station in the near future. He said that this year the financing of work on the station was included in the state budget. At the same time, he "expects foreign aid." In this connection, Ter-Petrosyan pointed to the particular significance of the Armenian-Russian agreement on the nuclear station signed in Moscow last week. "I am sure that its implementation will speed up the reopening of the station," he pointed out. Armenian experts believe that the station can be launched into operation in a year and a half, costing about 70 million dollars. The Armenian station was shut down due to public demand after the December 1988 earthquake in Armenia, although it was not damaged at that time. The Armenian government confirmed the station's status as a special facility. The government managed to find money to pay wages to the personnel of the station according to a special tariff network. From April 1 the average wages at the station will be 2,200 drums or 20 minimal wages in Armenia. In addition, workers will receive 50 drums for nutrition on a daily basis. It was also decided to rename the station from Armenian into Metsamor.
