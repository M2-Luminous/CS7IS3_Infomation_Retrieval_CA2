The letter sent by ARATS to SEF noted: After the talks between the persons in charge of ARATS and the SEF ended in Beijing in February this year, compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Strait affirmed their efforts and optimistically anticipated the fourth routine meeting would yield positive results. However, the fourth routine meeting failed to achieve the anticipated objective. We sincerely feel it is necessary for the persons in charge of ARATS and the SEF to hold talks to facilitate the ironing out of differences at an early date, to strive for the conclusion of three agreements, including the agreement on the "Repatriation of Personnel Who Have Entered Into the Region of the Other Side in Violation of Relevant Regulations and Other Related Issues," to discuss other topics on the agenda as soon as possible, and to expedite ARATS-SEF affairs. According to the "Agreement on ARATS-SEF Contacts and the System for Their Talks," the dates for the biannual talks between the persons in charge of ARATS and the SEF, the quarterly meeting between their deputy secretaries general, and the quarterly department director-level meeting between ARATS and the SEF will be due soon. We suggest that arrangements be made for the above-mentioned talks and meetings to be held at the same time. We would like to have your opinion on the above. Tang Shubei's letter to Jiao Renhe noted: After the persons in charge of ARATS and the SEF ended their talks in Beijing in February this year, agreements should have been reached as quickly as possible on the basis of the high degree of consensus reached during the February Beijing talks, and according to the "Joint News Draft." However, the fourth routine meeting encountered various difficulties and failed to achieve the anticipated objective. Under the circumstances, press circles on both sides of the Taiwan Strait believed it is necessary for the persons in charge of ARATS and the SEF to hold talks. According to the "Agreement on ARATS-SEF Contacts and the System for Their Talks," the dates for meetings between the persons in charge of ARATS and the SEF, and between their deputy secretaries general will be due soon. I am afraid both you and I will have to make efforts again to successfully fulfill our tasks and to continue to promote ARATS-SEF cooperation as well as the achievement of results in cross-strait relations.
