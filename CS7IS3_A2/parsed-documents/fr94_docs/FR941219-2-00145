FR941219-2-00145 FR941219-2-00078 4. Rule 6e&hyph;2(c)(4)(v) defines ``sales load'' charged on any payment as the excess of the payment over certain specified charges and adjustments, including ``a deduction approximately equal to state premium taxes''. Rule 6e&hyph;3(T)(c)(4)(v) defines ``sales load'' charged during a contract period as the excess of any payments made during the period over the sum of certain specified charges and adjustments, including ``a deduction for and approximately equal to state premium taxes.'' 5. Applicants submit that the deduction for federal income tax charges, proposed to be deducted in connection with the Contracts, should be treated as other than sales load, as is a state premium tax charge, for purposes of the 1940 Act. 6. Applicants argue that the requested exemptions from Rules 6e&hyph;2(c)(4) and 6e&hyph;3(c)(4) are necessary in connection with Applicant's reliance on certain provisions of Rules 6e&hyph;2(b)(13) and 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(13), which provide exemptions from Sections 27(a)(1) and 27(h)(1) of the 1940 Act. Issuers and their affiliates may only rely on Rules 6e&hyph;2(b)(13)(i) or 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(13)(i) if they meet the respective Rule's alternative limitations on sales load as defined in Rule 6e&hyph;2(c)(4) or Rule 6e&hyph;3(T)(c)(4). Applicants state that, depending upon the load structure of a particular Contract, these alternative limitations may not be met if the deduction for the increase in an issuer's federal tax burden is included in sales load. Although a deduction for an insurance company's increased federal tax burden does not fall squarely within any of the specified charges or adjustments which are excluded from the definition of ``sales load'' in Rules 6e&hyph;2(c)(4) and 6e&hyph;3(T)(c)(4), Applicants state that they have found no public policy reason for including them in ``sales load.'' 7. The public policy that underlies Rules 6e&hyph;2(b)(13)(i) and 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(13)(i), like that which underlies Sections 27(a)(1) and 27(h)(1) of the 1940 Act, is to prevent excessive sales loads from being charged in connection with the sale of periodic payment plan certificates. Applicants submit that the treatment of a federal income tax charge attributable to premium payments as sales load would not in any way further this legislative purpose because such a deduction has no relation to the payment of sales commissions or other distribution expenses. Applicants state that the Commission has concurred with this conclusion by excluding deductions for state premium taxes from the definition of ``sales load'' in Rules 6e&hyph;2(c)(4) and 6e&hyph;3(T)(c)(4). 8. Applicants assert that the source for the definition of ``sales load'' found in the Rules supports this analysis. Applicants state that the Commission's intent in adopting such provisions was to tailor the general terms of Section 2(a)(35) of the 1940 Act to variable life insurance contracts. Just as the percentage limits of Sections 27(a)(1) and 27(h)(1) depend on the definition of ``sales load'' in Section 2(a)(35) for their efficacy, the percentage limits in Rules 6e&hyph;2(b)(13)(i) and 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(13)(i) depend on Rules 6e&hyph;2(c)(4) and 6e&hyph;3(T)(c)(4), respectively, which do not depart, in principle, from Section 2(a)(35). 9. Section 2(a)(35) excludes deductions from premiums for ``issue taxes'' from the definition of ``sales load'' under the 1940 Act. Applicants submit that this suggests that it is consistent with the policies of the 1940 Act to exclude from the definition of ``sales load'' in Rules 6e&hyph;2 and 6e&hyph;3(T) deductions made to pay an insurance company's costs attributable to its tax obligations. Section 2(a)(35) also excludes administrative expenses or fees that are ``not properly chargeable to sales or promotional activities.'' Applicants argue that this suggests that the only deductions intended to fall within the definition of ``sales load'' are those that are properly chargeable to such activities. Because the proposed deductions will be used to compensate FKLA for its increased federal income tax burden attributable to the receipt of premiums, and are not properly chargeable to sales or promotional activities, this language in Section 2(a)(35) is another indication that not treating such deductions as ``sales load'' is consistent with the policies of the 1940 Act.
