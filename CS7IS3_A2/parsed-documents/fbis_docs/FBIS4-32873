The president has just sent a note to Fernandez saying that the declarations appearing in newspapers saying that he would do his utmost not to dissolve Congress do not reflect what he honestly thinks. Asked about the matter, Senator Evelio Fernandez Arevalo said he was satisfied with the president's explanation: [Begin recording] The note has persuaded me. I think, as I said before, there has been a mistake in the way he expressed himself or in the transcription of his remarks. I could not imagine the president experiencing an internal struggle to prevent the dissolution of Congress. I said earlier that I could not conceive of anyone having a hidden agenda to provoke such a negative thing. The note that the president had the deference to send me, I must admit, puts things in the right perspective. I think we must consider the episode closed. [end recording]
