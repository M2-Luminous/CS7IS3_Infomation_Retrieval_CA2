On 8 June, Chief of Staff Vazha Lordkipanidze told a news conference that the number of apparatus staff will be cut by one-third, with all the subdivisions moving over to a contract system. At present approximately 130 people work in the apparatus. Cadre selection is done in accordance with two main criteria: high professionalism and moral integrity, regardless of affiliation with any political party or public movement. Lordkipanidze denied allegations by a number of parliamentarians that the apparatus' hard currency spending for foreign trips is double that of analogous parliament bills. "In accordance with a memorandum by the Georgian Finance Ministry," he said, "in 1994 the apparatus spent $11,000 for these purposes, while parliament spent $12,600." The Georgian head of state's chief of staff also stated that contrary to some perceptions, the apparatus has never been bloated but corresponded to international standards and proportions. Moreover, Lordkipanidze said the presidential apparatuses in countries the same size as Georgia number on average up to 500 officers.
