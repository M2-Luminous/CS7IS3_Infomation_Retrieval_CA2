"The main issue of the meeting is going to be the safety of humanitarian aid workers in Bosnia under present conditions," said special UN representative Yasushi Akashi. Akashi was meeting with UN High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata and UN peace mediator Thorvald Stoltenberg. Mokrice is about 30 kilometres (18 miles) west of Zagreb. NATO last week issued an ultimatum to Bosnia's warring parties, particularly the Serbs, to move their weapons from around Sarajevo by midnight Sunday or face air strikes.
