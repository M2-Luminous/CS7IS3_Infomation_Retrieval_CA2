China successfully launched the Long March 3-A rocket carrying one satellite on 8 February and will launch another five domestic and foreign satellites with five Long March carrier rockets this year. During the first half of this year, China will use Long March No 3 and Long March No 3-A carrier rockets to launch a domestic meteorological satellite, the "Fengyun No 2," and a new type of domestic telecommunications satellite, the "Dongfanghong No 3." China has already launched two "Fengyun No 1" meteorological satellites. "Fengyun No 2" is the first static orbit meteorological satellite, and it can be used to observe an approximately 100 million square km of the earth surface, with China as the center. Compared with "Dongfanghong No 2," which China previously launched, the "Dongfanghong No 3" telecommunications satellite has a longer life and greater capacity. It has 24 C-wave band transmitters for television, telephone, telegram, and fax transmissions and other telecommunications operations. During the second half of this year, China will launch three foreign satellites. A Long March No 3 carrier rocket will be used to launch the telecommunications satellite "Asia-Pacific No 1," and two Long March No 2 bundled rockets will be used to launch the "Aussat B-3" and the telecommunications satellite "Asia-Pacific No 2."
