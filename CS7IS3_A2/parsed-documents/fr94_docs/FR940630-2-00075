SUMMARY: The Bureau of Land Management completed a Proposed Plan Amendment/EA/FONSI on May 26, 1994. All public land and subsurface oil and gas estate in Cache, Davis, Morgan, Rich, Summit, Wasatch, and Weber Counties have been analyzed.

Category 3_Open to leasing with no surface occupancy, 530 acres. Category 4_Closed to leasing, 0 acres. The proposed amendment to the Randolph and Park City Management Framework Plans (MFPs) would incorporate these revised decisions on management of oil and gas resources.
