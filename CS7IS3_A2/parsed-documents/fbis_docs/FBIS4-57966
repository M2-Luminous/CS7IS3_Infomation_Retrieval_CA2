After meeting for three hours, Deputy Dora Maria Tellez, member of the FSLN National Directorate, publicly announced Ramirez's intention to resign from his post within the FSLN bloc and the deputies' decision to vote down that resignation. "We have not only rejected this resignation, but we have also endorsed his mandate because his work as the chief of our bloc has served the struggle in the interests of both the FSLN and the needy sectors of society," Commander Tellez indicated. According to Deputy William Ramirez, the Sandinist deputies are convinced that to maintain the unity of the bloc and relations within the National Assembly, it is not advisable to accept his resignation. It was reported that all 39 lawmakers concurred in voting in favor of Ramirez. Damaso Vargas, who represents the interests of the Sandinist Workers Federation in the FSLN bloc, confirmed the unanimous backing for Ramirez's mandate. "The statutes do not make the Sandinist bloc a component of the FSLN structure and for that reason the bloc has the opportunity to coordinate its actions and choose its directors. What is vital is to carry out the resolutions of the Sandinist Congress," he noted. "Dr. Ramirez submitted his resignation for obvious political reasons," Dora Maria Tellez added, explaining that the Sandinist Assembly approved the bloc's internal regulations, which establish the mechanism to elect its authorities. Tellez added that the National Directorate does not plan to submit the topic of the leadership of the Sandinist bloc to a debate. "In the meeting held today (yesterday), the Directorate said Directorate members do not necessarily have to be well-liked by everyone," she added. Ramirez, who from the moment he learned of his exclusion from the new Sandinist Directorate announced his willingness to resign, saying he would abide by the decision of his colleagues. "I think what lies ahead in the weeks to come is our legislative work because the Sandinist bloc must continue to be a key part in the complex machinery of national stability," Ramirez stated categorically. Dr. Ramirez declined to comment on the topic of factions because, at this time, he was still speaking as chief of the Sandinist bloc. The public statement by Commander Monica Baltodano on the possible change in the Sandinist bloc's leadership was one of the events that hastened the discussion on this topic among the FSLN lawmakers. In the early morning hours, Dr. Ramirez said he will continue his struggle for the renewal and transformation of the FSLN from the inside "and never from the outside," adding that battles are not won in a single day. "I am already too old to let someone else decide for me whether or not I am a revolutionary, or whether or not my ideology is correct," he noted. "now, there is a certain trend on the part of some FSLN comrades to grant certificates of revolutionary legitimacy and to decide who is a neoliberal and who supports or opposes the masses," the FSLN bloc chief noted.
