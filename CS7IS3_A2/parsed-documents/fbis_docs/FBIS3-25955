[Wu Yi] To deepen the reform of the foreign trade system, it is necessary to uphold a unified policy, liberalize operations, compete on an equal footing, take responsibility for one's own profits and losses, and integrate industry and trade as well as the agency system. The goal in carrying out reform is the establishment of a foreign trade operating mechanism suited to the rules and customs common in international economic activities. The main contents of our next stage of deepening the reform of the foreign trade system are as follows: first, we will further improve the overall administration of foreign trade. The state will mainly make use of such economic means as exchange rates, taxation, and credit to regulate foreign trade activities. Second, we will deepen the reform of foreign trade enterprises and reorganize state-owned foreign trade enterprises in accordance with the system of modern enterprises. We will explore a new path for "large economic and trade operations" characterized by the integration of trade and industry with trade and agriculture, with trade and technology, and with trade and commerce, as well as the integration of foreign trade with foreign capital and foreign economic activities; we will speed up the process of granting the right to handle foreign trade to manufacturing enterprises, science and technology units, and some commercial and materials supply enterprises which are imbued with the necessary conditions to do so. Third, we will establish a sound foreign trade coordinated service mechanism in order to give full play by associations of import-export businesses to providing coordinated services. Fourth, we will maintain a unified foreign trade policy and system, and will increase the degree of transparency in this regard. [Correspondent] China is undertaking a major reform of its foreign exchange system this year. What impact will this have on the development of its foreign trade? [Liu Shaizai] Reform of the foreign exchange system is critical to further deepening the reform of the foreign trade system. It will play a very important role in expanding import-export trade because it will create a favorable environment for all types of export enterprises to compete on an equal footing; will speed up the transformation of the operating mechanisms of foreign trade enterprises; and will more effectively enhance the function of exchange rates in regulating foreign trade. This reform will bring our country's foreign exchange and foreign trade systems closer to the requirements of a socialist market economic structure, will help the establishment of an operation mechanism suited to the rules and customs common in international economic activities, and will play a positive role in restoring our country's status as a contracting party to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. [Correspondent] It has been learned the China Import-Export Credit Bank went into operation on 1 January this year. What is the status of this bank in the new foreign trade structure, and what are its major functions? [Liu Shanzai] The Import-Export Credit Bank is the product of the reform of our country's monetary and foreign trade system. It is a policy-lending monetary institution whose main function is to provide loans to support the export of China's capital goods. With further expansion of its business, the bank will play an important role in the development of China's foreign trade and in linking China's foreign trade with the standards of international trade. [Correspondent] How will China reduce its trade deficit? [Wu Yi] The basic principle of China's foreign trade is to maintain a rough balance between imports and exports. Last year our country suffered a $1.218 billion deficit in foreign trade. To deal with this situation, we intend to achieve a balance by actively expanding exports rather than reducing imports. The purpose of our country's exports is the importation of advanced technology and equipment needed for China's modernization drive as well as the importation of goods which are in short supply in the domestic market. As 80 percent of China's foreign exchange income comes from exports, if we fail to turn around the situation in which deficits are caused by the slow growth of exports, our foreign exchange income is bound to decline, and imports will also be affected. I hope our trade partners will increase imports of Chinese products so as to maintain a coordinated development of bilateral trade. [Correspondent] Will the question of intellectual property rights become an obstacle to the development of Sino-U.S. economic and trade relations? [Wu Yi] China and the United States concluded a memorandum of understanding on 16 January 1992. The Chinese Government has earnestly carried out its promise. This has been acknowledged by the United States. The level of protection of intellectual property rights in China surpasses the average level of protection of intellectual property rights throughout the world. However, as China is a vast country with a huge population, protection of intellectual property rights has been undertaken unevenly in various localities. We will begin with education to enhance people's awareness regarding intellectual property rights, and will propose that intellectual property rights courts be established in some key cities. Whether they are Chinese or foreigners, if they have clear evidence to prove their intellectual property rights have been infringed upon, they may file a law suit with the court. Regrettably, the U.S. Government does not comprehend nor understand the positive method of protecting intellectual property rights which China has adopted, and it is unwise for the U.S. Government to attempt applying pressure. [Correspondent] What is the current state of Sino-British economic and trade relations, and what are their future prospects? [Wu Yi] As a whole, Sino-British economic and trade relations are not bad, and there is great potential for development. However, it is hard to say whether the uncooperative attitude adopted by the British Government regarding Hong Kong will affect bilateral economic and trade relations. This is what China does not want to see, but the responsibility rests entirely with the British. [Correspondent] In order to link up with the world economically, what new laws and regulations will China enact on economic and trade relations with foreign countries? [Wu Yi] With the deepening of the reform of China's foreign economic relations and trade system, and the progress of the negotiations on the restoration of China's status as a contracting party to GATT, China is changing its mode of administering foreign economic relations and trade, switching from a reliance mainly on administrative means to a reliance on legal and economic means. For this purpose, China will enact a number of laws and regulations on foreign economic relations and trade, the most important of which is the "Foreign Trade Law." The draft of this law has been submitted for examination by the State Council to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. China will adopt some methods currently practiced by the world community to protect domestic industries. We are drafting the "Anti-Dumping Regulations," the "Anti-Subsidies Regulations," and the "Regulations on Safeguard Measures." These three regulations are expected to be submitted to State Council for examination in the near future. In addition, we have started drafting other supporting regulations, such as the "Regulations Governing the Examination and Approval of Foreign Trade Enterprises" and the "Regulations Governing Import-Export Chambers of Commerce," both of which are related to the "Foreign Trade Law."
