FBIS4-42138 "drweu104_q_94012" FBIS-WEU-94-104 Daily Report 27 May 1994 TURKEY Denies Involvement in Conflict Denies Involvement in Conflict TA2705183594 Ankara ANATOLIA in Turkish 1610 GMT 27 May 94 TA2705183594 Ankara ANATOLIA Turkish BFN [Text] Ankara (AA) -- Foreign Ministry Spokesman Ferhat Ataman has said that the allegations to the effect that Turkey is a party to the conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia "are legally and logically invalid as well as completely unfounded." Karen Baburyan, the acting speaker of the Armenian parliament [name and title as received] unilaterally declared in Nagorno-Karabakh, told the latest issue of the weekly ROSSIYA published in Russia that "Turkey is directly involved in the conflict, and therefore, as a party to the conflict, must cosign any peace agreement." Replying to a question on the issue by an ANATOLIA correspondent, Ataman pointed out that the UN Security Council and the CSCE resolutions clearly cite the parties to the conflict. Commenting on Baburyan's allegation that "the fact that certain Turks participate in the fighting in Azerbaijani ranks as proof that Turkey is a party to the conflict," Ataman said: "It is impossible to find any proof that any officers or noncommissioned officers of the Turkish Armed Forces -- be they on active duty or retired -- are serving at the front because such a thing never happened. On the other hand, it has been proven that the Armenian Republic is actively involved in the fighting, not only through documents found on prisoners of war but by other findings as well."
