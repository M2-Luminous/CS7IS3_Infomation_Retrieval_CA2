Deputy Commerce Minister Churin Lasanawisit, who is also the chairman of the committee in charge of a crackdown on violators of intellectual property rights, said the shop owners have failed to cooperate with the Department of Internal Trade and Department of Commercial Registration, thereby hindering the investigation. The two departments under the Ministry suffered due to this lack of cooperation since they were unable to get exact information related to IP [intellectual property] rights violation. As a result, the entire investigation process turned into a fiasco. Churin said his committee has ordered the two Departments to begin investigations once again, adding "If this time they hesitate to cooperate, the Commerce Ministry will have to take legal action against them." The police crackdown last month resulted in the arrest of 130 people. That is a 27 pct [percent] drop from the number of similar arrests in January. The Department of Commercial Registration investigated 68 violators of which five faced legal action, and seven were subjected to a 10,000-baht-fine. Similarly, the Revenue Department is currently running tax-related investigations on more than 30 people.
