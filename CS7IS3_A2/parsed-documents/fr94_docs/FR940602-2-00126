The sum of any FESC, service fees, distribution fees, and CDSC will not exceed the maximum sales charge provided for in Article III, section 26 of the Rules of Fair Practice of the National Association of Securities Dealers (``NASD''). 8. Because of the varying levels of rule 12b&hyph;1 fees and other class-level expenses paid by the holders of different classes of shares, the net income attributable to and the dividends payable on each class may differ and, consequently, different classes of shares may have different net asset values. B. The CDSC 1. Applicants also request an exemption that would permit the Funds to impose a CDSC and to waive the CDSC in certain cases. With respect to any class of shares of any Fund that charge a CDSC, the applicable CDSC will be calculated on the lesser of the net asset value at the time of the issuance or redemption of the shares. No CDSC will be imposed on: (a) Shares, or amounts representing shares, purchased through the reinvestment of dividends or capital gains distributions; (b) an amount that represents an increase in the value of the shares due to capital appreciation; or (c) shares held for longer than the applicable CDSC period. Upon any request for redemption of shares that imposes a CDSC, it will be assumed, unless otherwise requested, that shares subject to no CDSC will be redeemed first in the order purchased (however, if a shareholder owns more than one class of shares, then shares not subject to a CDSC with the highest rule 12b&hyph;1 fee will be redeemed in full prior to any redemption of shares not subject to a CDSC with a lower rule 12b&hyph;1 fee), all remaining shares that are subject to a CDSC will be redeemed in the order purchased. 2. Applicants request the ability to waive the CDSC in the following instances: (1) Involuntary redemptions effected pursuant to a Fund's right to liquidate shareholder accounts having an aggregate net asset value of less than the minimum account balance set forth in the Fund's then current prospectus; (b) the death or disability of a Fund shareholder within the meaning of section 72(m)(7) of the Internal Revenue Code; (c) in connection with redemptions of any shares held by tax-qualified retirement plans, excluding individual retirement accounts, simplified employee pension plans, section 403(b) plans and section 457 plans; (d) in connection with purchases of shares funded by the proceeds from the redemption of shares of any unrelated investment company that charges a FESC, provided that there was no CDSC, fee, or other charge imposed in connection with such redemption and if the purchase is made within 60 days following the redemption; (e) in connection with purchases of Fund shares funded by the proceeds from the surrender of a fixed annuity contract within 60 days of the purchase of Fund shares; (f) in connection with purchases of Fund shares by the following categories of investors and transactions; (i) Fortis, Inc., and its subsidiaries and specified persons associated with such companies; (ii) Fund directors and officers and specified persons associated with such directors and officers; (iii) representatives or employees of the Underwriter (including agencies) or of the other broker-dealers having a sales agreement with the Underwriter and specified persons associated with such entities; (iv) pension, profit-sharing and other retirement plans of the persons referenced in clause (i), (ii) and (iii), (v) registered investment companies; (vi) registered investment advisers, trust companies and bank trust departments exercising discretionary authority or using a money management/mutual fund ``wrap'' program; (vii) purchases that are funded by the proceeds from the plans referenced in clause (iv) upon the retirement or employment termination of such persons; (viii) purchases by employees (including their spouses and dependent children) of banks and other financial services firms that provide referral and administrative services pursuant to a sales agreement with the Underwriter or one of its affiliates; (ix) with respect to Asset Allocation Portfolio of Advantage Portfolios only, former officers and directors of Morison Asset Allocation Fund, and officers, directors and employees of Morison Asset Management, Inc. and its affiliates; (x) with respect to Government Total Return Portfolio of Advantage Portfolios only, officers and trustees of the Olympus Funds Trust, officers, directors and employees of Furman Selz Capital Management, and Furman Selz Mager Dietz and Birney, members of the Xerox Employee's Credit Union and members of their immediate family and persons owning shareholder accounts which were in existence and entitled to purchase shares of Olympus U.S. Government Plus Fund at net asset value, without the imposition of a FESC, at the time that such Fund's assets were acquired by Advantage Portfolios; (xi) with respect to Growth Fund, the Fortis U.S. Government Securities Fund series of Income Portfolios and each current series of Advantage Portfolios only, persons owning shareholder accounts of the applicable series of Carnegie-Capiello Trust or Carnegie Government Securities Trust that was acquired by the applicable Fund if, at the time of such acquisition, such shareholder accounts were in existence and entitled to purchase shares of the applicable Carnegie fund at net asset value, without the imposition of a FESC; (xii) with respect to the Fortis U.S. Government Securities Fund series of Income Portfolios and the New York Portfolio series of Tax Free Portfolios only, persons owning shareholder accounts of the applicable series of The Pathfinder Heritage Funds that was acquired by the applicable Fund if, at the time of such acquisition, such shareholder accounts were in existence and entitled to purchase shares of the applicable Pathfinder fund at net asset value, without the imposition of a FESC; and (xiii) with respect to Fiduciary Fund only, persons having a Fiduciary Fund account on April 30, 1986; and (g) for an amount that represents, on an annual (non-cumulative) basis, up to 10% of the amount (at the time of the investment) of the shareholder's purchases. 3. In regard to waiver category (d) above, applicants will take such steps as may be necessary to determine that the shareholder has not paid a deferred sales load, fee or other charge in connection with such redemption, including, without limitation, requiring the shareholder to provide a written representation in the shareholder's application that no deferred sales load, fees or other charge was imposed in connection with such redemption and, in addition, either requiring that shareholder provide the redemption check of such unrelated open-end investment company (or a copy of the check) or a copy of the confirmation statement showing the redemption. 4. Applicants intend to provide a one time credit for any CDSC paid upon redemption, the proceeds of which are reinvested in the same class of shares of a Fund within 60 days of redemption. The Underwriter will provide this credit from its own assets.
