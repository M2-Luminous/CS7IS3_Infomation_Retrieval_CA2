A Patent Office official said: "There is now a possibility that the global move toward the patent system harmonization will slow down." Member nations of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) want to enact a "Treaty for Harmonization of Patent Systems," which will unify patent systems into a first-to-file system. The Japanese Government in the Japan-U.S. framework talks intends to call on the U.S. Government to reconsider its stand. The U.S. Government's patent system is the first-to-invent system, under which those who invent products first are given patent rights, instead of the first-to-file system under which those who apply first get the patent right. During the Bush administration, a U.S. Department of Commerce advisory council recommended changing to the "first-to-file system." Given the circumstance, Patent Office officials complained: "It is regrettable that the recommendation was rejected."
