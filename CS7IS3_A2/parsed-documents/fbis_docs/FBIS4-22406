These actions, which were organized by the leaders of the Bolshevik party, the Dashnaktsutyun Party, and other Armenian terrorist organizations, were aimed at the physical extermination of Azeris, the destruction of monuments of spiritual and material culture of Azerbaijan, and ultimately the Armenization of indigenous Azeri territories. Anti-Azeri pogroms and acts of violence and terror were perpetrated throughout the territory of Azerbaijan between 1917 and 1920. However, they became the most cruel during March 1918 in Baku, Shemakha, Kuba, the villages of Shemakhinskiy, Kubinskiy, and Geokchayskiy Uyezds, Karabakh, and some other regions of Azerbaijan. In these regions the Armenian barbarians brutally wiped out more than 50,000 peaceful Azeris and burned down monuments of Azeri ethnic culture, mosques, and state offices. The March 1918 events were tragically peculiar in that the inhumane ideology of Armenian national-chauvinism blended with the criminal practice of terror and genocide of the Azeris and ethnic cleansing and Armenization of Azeri lands aimed at achieving Armenians' economic and political domination over Azerbaijan. It is also characteristic that virtually all strata of the Armenian population, which rallied on the basis of the pathologically developed idea of hatred for Turkic nations, primarily Azeris, took part in these events. The bloody synthesis of the ideology and practice of Armenian national-chauvinism has been built upon in the current state policy of the Republic of Armenia, which has ethnically "cleansed" its territory and is waging a large-scale war on Azerbaijan; it has occupied about 20 percent of the territory of Azerbaijan and forced more than 1 million Azeris to become refugees. In conjunction with the above, the Republic of Azerbaijan, resolutely denouncing the Armenian policy of secret and open genocide of Azeris pursued throughout the 20th century and condemning the ideology and practice of Armenian national-chauvinism as a crime against the Azeri people, against peace and humanity, calls on the nations and parliaments of the world and leading international organizations to make a qualified assessment of the March 1918 events and to consider the issue of moral and legal responsibility of the ethnically "clean" Republic of Armenia for the policy of war, terror, and genocide pursued with regard to the Azeri people.
