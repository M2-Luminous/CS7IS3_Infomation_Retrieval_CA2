FR940728-2-00013 FR940728-2-00009 A. Calculation of COP We calculated COP based on the sum of the individual respondent's reported cost of materials, fabrication, general expenses, and home market packing. For each company, we derived selling expenses from its respective home market or third country sales listing, as appropriate. We added home market packing expenses derived from the respective sales listing. For Enlin, we relied on the submitted COP. For Ta Chen, we relied on the submitted COP information, except in the following instances where the costs were not appropriately quantified or valued: 1. We recalculated cost of manufacturing (COM) by reducing Ta Chen's submitted conversion costs for packing materials and labor as presented and verified during the cost verification. 2. We recalculated Ta Chen's COM by reducing the reported materials costs for scrap revenues received during the POI as presented and verified during the cost verification. 3. As a result of reducing COM for packing material, packing labor, and material scrap revenue, we recalculated Ta Chen's general and administrative expense using the revised COM figure in the calculation. 4. We reclassified a percentage of Ta Chen's president's salary from general and administrative expenses to indirect selling expenses because a portion of the president's time was devoted solely to sales. For Yih Tai, we relied on the submitted COP information, except in the following instances where the costs were not appropriately quantified or valued: 1. We adjusted the packing labor expense, which was understated in the submission, to reflect the verified amount. 2. We adjusted the allocation basis to include all products for the machine revenue received from the machining subcontractor. B. Test of Home Market/Third Country Sale Prices After calculating COP, we tested whether home market or third country sales of SST pipe fittings were at prices below COP over an extended period of time, in accordance with section 773(b) of the Act. We compared model-specific COP to reported prices that were net of movement charges, and where appropriate, discounts, and rebates. If over 90 percent of a respondent's sales of a given product were at prices above the COP, we did not disregard any below-cost sales because we determined that the respondent's below-cost sales were not made in substantial quantities. If between ten and 90 percent of a respondent's sales of a given product were at prices above the COP, we discarded only the below-cost sales if made over an extended period of time. Where we found that more than 90 percent of respondent's sales of a given product were at prices below the COP, we disregarded all sales for that model and calculated FMV based on constructed value (CV). In order to determine whether below-cost sales were made over an extended period of time, we performed the following analysis on a product-specific basis: (1) if a respondent sold a product in only one month of the POI and there were sales in that month below the COP, or (2) if a respondent sold a product during two months or more of the POI and there were sales below the COP during two or more of those months, then below-cost sales were considered to have been made over an extended period of time. C. Results of COP Test For Ta Chen and Yih Tai, we did not find any sales below cost. For Enlin, we determined that there were sales below cost, and disregarded those sales. Where more than 90 percent of the sales of a particular model were below cost we based FMV for that model on CV. Price-to-Price Comparisons For those products for which we had an adequate number of sales at prices equal to or greater than the COP, we based FMV on home market or third country prices, as appropriate. For Enlin, we calculated FMV according to the methodology described in our preliminary determination, with the following exceptions: 1. We treated duty drawback as it was reported after verifying that Enlin only received duty drawback on its sales to the U.S. and not on its sales to Canada. 2. We disregarded cancelled sales which were included in the sales listing. 3. We revised inland freight, ocean freight and packing case cost to incorporate the average weight of cross pipe fittings as determined during verification because Enlin did not do so as requested by the Department. (See Comment 1.) 4. For those sales with updated payment and/or shipment dates which were not incorporated into the final computer tape submission, we recalculated the imputed credit expenses based on the weighted-average difference between payment and shipment dates for those sales which were both shipped and paid for during the POI. For the associated expenses, we calculated a product specific weighted average. For Ta Chen, we calculated FMV according to the methodology described in our preliminary determination, with the following exceptions: 1. We treated home market freight as a circumstance of sale adjustment in light of the Court of Appeals of the Federal Circuit's (CAFC) decision in Ad Hoc Committee of AZ-NM-TX-FL Producers of Gray Portland Cement v. United States, Slip Op. 93&hyph;1239 (Fed. Cir., January 5, 1994), which held that the Department may no longer deduct home market movement charges from FMV pursuant to its inherent power to fill in gaps in the antidumping statute. We instead adjusted for those expenses under the circumstance-of-sale provision of 19 CFR 353.56 and the exporter's sales price offset provision of 19 CFR 353.56(b)(1) and (2), as appropriate. 2. We made a circumstance of sale adjustment for certain mailing charges brought to the Department's attention prior to verification. For Yih Tai, we calculated FMV according to the methodology described in our preliminary determination, with the following exceptions: 1. We recalculated packing based on revisions to packing labor found at the cost verifications. Price to CV Comparisons For Enlin's products without an adequate number of sales at prices above the COP, we based FMV on CV. We calculated CV based on the sum of the cost of materials, fabrication, general expenses, and U.S. packing cost. In accordance with section 773(e)(1)(B)(i) and (ii) of the Act we: (1) included the higher of the respondent's reported general expenses or the statutory minimum of ten percent of the COM, as appropriate and; (2) for profit, we used the higher of the statutory minimum of eight percent of the sum of COM and general expenses or the actual profit incurred as calculated on a market specific basis. We calculated CV based on the information submitted by Enlin, except in the following instances where the costs were not appropriately quantified or valued:
