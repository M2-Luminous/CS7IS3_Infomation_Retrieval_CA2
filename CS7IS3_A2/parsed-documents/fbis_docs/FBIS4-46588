Analysts, political scientists, journalists, and sometimes simply hacks who like to speak out about anything have been conducting a targeted critical "bombardment." The thrust of the media salvoes is that the situation in the Army is quite appalling, and the reforms are not progressing at all. Why are they not progressing? Unfortunately, it is difficult to obtain an answer to this question even after careful study of the many critical articles relating in one degree or another to this problem. Perhaps some of the plans are not being fulfilled? Is the Blueprint for the Organizational Development of the Armed Forces elaborated by the Defense Ministry not being implemented? Or maybe political scientists' forecasts have not been borne out and some of them are feeling aggrieved? Questions, questions, questions.... And here is another one. Is the situation really so bad in our country with regard to military organizational development? Even a cursory analysis of what has been done over the last two years (the Russian Army is a little over 2 years old) refutes this. As does the end result -- the Russian Armed Forces, despite many extremely painful problems, are combat-capable and on the whole ensure the fulfillment of the tasks confronting them. No, I am not talking about the assessment which the president made in his message to the Federal Assembly at the start of this year, although that is important in itself. I am talking about something else. About the actual combat readiness of units and formations. At the time of writing Russian battalions were performing peacemaking functions in Yugoslavia in accordance with international pledges. Units of the 201st Motorized Rifle Division were taking part in protecting and defending the Tajik-Afghan border, and our subunits were between the warring sides in the Dniester region, South Ossetia, and Abkhazia. There are 16,000 Russian servicemen in "trouble spots." And they are dealing with them. The results of the winter training period attest that other units and formations of the General-Purpose Forces, which are being qualitatively transformed, are also combat-capable. The Mobile Forces which are being created as a new Armed Forces' interbranch operational-strategic formation are giving them a new face. Practical steps have already been taken today. Work to bring up to strength the units and formations that, when necessary, will be transferred from region to region and to provide them with arms and materiel has been started in the Airborne and Ground Forces, the Air Defense Forces, the Air Forces, and the Navy. But what has not been done? Perhaps some important fruitful ideas have not been implemented? A few years ago the General Staff began work on a new table of organization structure for the Armed Forces -- a subject about which a great deal has been and is being said. This is already coming into being. The troops of the North Caucasus and Leningrad Military Districts have already been partly switched to a corps/brigade structure. If there is anything to be said here, it is merely to ask whether we are not being too swift to abandon combined arms army formations and formations of the division type. After all, in certain spheres divisions are simply irreplaceable, as experience shows. They have greater firepower than brigades and can conduct combat operations for several days. In short, what had long been advocated is being put into effect. Other "drastic" reformers reduce all innovative work exclusively to switching the Army to a professional footing. Here too there are real shifts --the contract method of manpower acquisition is now a permanent feature in the Russian Army. As is well known, over 160,000 professionals are now serving as soldiers and sergeants, and another 150,000 contract personnel will be recruited in 1994, including over 14,000 women. We have looked at just a few aspects of military reform, but even they graphically demonstrate that the reforms in the Army, for all the difficulties and contradictions, are nevertheless making clear progress. At any rate the pace of reform in the Army is in no way lagging behind the reforms in society in general. On the contrary, many spheres of military reform are being retarded precisely by the fact that the appropriate economic, political, and legal preconditions have still not been created and that the potential of the state, which is in profound crisis, is unfortunately extremely limited. So why then are there such harsh assessments? Why do some newspapers often paint such a negative picture of the Army? Why are the honor and dignity of Russian officers often nonchalantly sullied? Analysis of many articles devoted to military reform in civilian publications automatically suggests that the reform itself and the problems of the Armed Forces are a matter of indifference to the authors. They are something like auxiliary material for some totally different purposes. For instance, take the following quite common thesis: A civilian should be appointed as soon as possible to the post of defense minister, otherwise there will be no reform. The arguments here consist of allusions to Western experience, and also contentions regarding the need for civilian control over the Armed Forces. There is no question that civilian control is an important problem. But is is far more serious and far broader than simply the question of whether the minister has epaulets or not. Epaulets are rather a formality. In certain conditions a civilian could develop into a dictator, while a general's rank is certainly no obstacle to democratic attitudes and openness to society. Incidentally, that same Western experience provides much confirmation that military men often make very strong democratic politicians.... Clearly, it is more accurate to speak not of civilian but of political control over the Armed Forces. This includes presidential control, parliamentary control, collaboration between Army structures and various social organizations, and much else besides. This whole system has already taken shape in many respects today and is continuing to emerge. And as for epaulets... Well, there probably will come a time when a civilian occupies the post of defense minister in our country, as in the United States or the FRG, although I personally am opposed to this -- Russia has its own traditions. But is this the most urgent question today? For the sake of purely formal changes is it possible to disregard both, so to speak, the mentality of our military, who will scarcely find it easy to accept simply "some guy in a suit coat," and the clear absence of the preconditions for this in the political sphere itself? Have we not already suffered a lot of grief as a result of incompetence? Do we have plenty of readymade, full-fledged civilian candidates for defense minister? Remember how the notorious Galina Starovoytova was suggested quite seriously as minister. Imagine what the situation with regard to our Army and our defenses would be today if that had happened? Political interests are usually what lies behind this. As they do behind other proposals for the drastic reform of the Defense Ministry and the Army in general. For instance, what is the worth of the maxim that a structure, in other words the Army, cannot reform itself, but military reform today has been left in the hands of the military. Excuse me, but what is the point in airing a false premise in the newspapers and then chewing it over? The Army is indeed not reforming itself. Evidence? Certainly. Was it the military department that elaborated and adopted the laws by which people in uniform are guided today? And what about the military doctrine? Many state structures worked on it, beginning with the country's Security Council. Take the Blueprint for the Organizational Development of the Armed Forces. It was approved by the President. Or the recruitment of contract personnel. This has been and is being carried out on the basis of the edicts of the head of state and depends on the funding allocated by the government. Perhaps the military ratify the defense budget? That is not the case. The general military regulations are also the President's prerogative. A big scandal recently erupted in the press about the new uniform -- apparently the military are wearing illegal uniform that has not been approved. An investigation was made. It turns out that the uniform is legal. Furthermore, it had long been planned with the aim of simplifying certain elements, making it cheaper, and making it more modern and attractive. In short, military reform involves active participation by the president, parliament, government, Security Council, other state structures, and even...social organizations. Even the church is taking part in it. Yes, it is true that the leadership of the Armed Forces and military specialists and scientists play a great role in elaborating and implementing all the legal acts, programs, and blueprints. But how could that be otherwise? We cannot involve generals from abroad. Anyhow, what is so bad about the military implementing military reforms? The main thing is that they introduce innovations that benefit the country's defenses and give the Army a modern face, the face of the army of a democratic state. Incidentally, all our Russian reforms in the defense sphere have been associated with the names of military figures. Milyutin's reforms. Rediger's reforms. Frunze's reforms. It transpires that the military are not the point. It is just that every drastic proposal for the drastic reform of the Defense Ministry and the Armed Forces as a whole and every maxim aired in the press, I repeat, often stems from political interests and nothing more. I think even the authors of these and similar "fantasies" are perfectly well aware of the shakiness of their positions and scarcely seriously expect anyone to be guided by their conclusions. They are probably pursuing a different aim: to weaken from time to time the military leadership's position in resolving state questions -- at the time when the military budget is being adopted, for instance. Or at a time when the political situation is deteriorating and there is social tension. If this is so, and I believe that this is precisely the case, then such articles are actually attempts to throw a monkey wrench in the works of the reforms that the "reformers" are ostensibly advocating. Other experts, analysts, and journalists choose a "subtler" angle of attack on the Army -- the real reform of the Armed Forces, regarding it as "fundamentally incorrect," "destructive of the homeland's Army," and so on. The target of the attacks is primarily the Mobile Forces, though only yesterday the process of their creation was loudly welcomed by everyone without exception. Today the tone is different. Already some people have proclaimed: "Mobile Forces? Are they designed to perform gendarme functions?" Others seek simpler grounds for criticism -- our Defense Minister is from the Airborne Forces, so he personally is championing expansion of the Airborne Forces. The criticism is bald, so to speak, and for some reason the authors do not bother with even the most modest analysis. What prompted the Armed Forces leadership to create them? What principle forms their foundation? Detailed answers to just these questions would allow the reader to draw his own conclusions. But no, what is the point of analysis, let alone serious analysis. But the truth is as follows. Russia cannot afford to keep large troop groupings in all the strategic operational salients, and anyhow there is no need for this. What appear to be most dangerous to the state today are local conflicts, rather than large-scale war. But Russia (and it is capable of doing this) if necessary has to place a reliable barrier in the way of aggression from any direction. The principle of mobile defense which forms the basis for the creation of the troop groupings is called upon to play its main role here -- it presupposes the existence of small but quite powerful forces ready for operational use wherever a real threat to the country's security arises. Incidentally, the USSR's military-political leadership, which adhered to the principle of reasonable sufficiency for defense, would have been bound in time to arrive at a similar principle for the structuring of defenses. This is less burdensome for the state, and it is effective so far as defense is concerned. The Mobile Forces also come under attack from a different direction -- it is claimed that they are being established to the detriment of the development of other branches of the Armed Forces, for instance, the Navy. There has been a whole series of articles in the mass media claiming that the present military leadership is virtually deliberately destroying the Navy. Articles of various calibers -- ranging from claims that there is only one nuclear submarine on alert duty in the Russian Navy to articles attempting to encapsulate everything negative relating to our Navy. What is the situation in reality? First a detail. At his 6 May briefing General of the Army Pavel Grachev disclosed some sensational news -- each day 50 Russian submarines and surface ships are on alert duty and combat service at sea. But for some reason the mass media chose not to mention this. Now a few words about the state of affairs in the Navy. The situation today is indeed complex, but this is clearly not because of the creation of the Mobile Forces, it stems from the entire course of military organizational development in our state in recent decades. The main efforts in the Soviet Union were concentrated on building warships, while the development of the infrastructure for their basing, support, and repair lagged behind. By 1992, that is, by the start of the creation of the Russian Armed Forces, about two-thirds of ships were in the final stage of their lifetime and in practice there was no system for basing large surface ships and heavy aircraft-carrying cruisers. Problems of repair and scrapping came to the fore. It takes sizable financial resources to solve them. But the Navy, like the other branches of the Armed Forces, unfortunately only receives a pittance. If anyone is sounding the alarm about the state of affairs in the Navy it is the Defense Ministry leadership and the Navy command. There is some progress. Last year over 100 voyages were carried out. It is planned to achieve this level this year. It should be noted that alert duty and combat service at sea are carried out in accordance with the new system of views regarding the organizational development and use of the Navy -- a system whose elaboration was affected by the substantial change in the geopolitical situation. There is a great deal of speculation today over the reform of the Air Defense Troops. Some analysts have even hastened to declare that this branch of the Armed Forces too is being destroyed by the Defense Ministry leadership, disbanded, and so forth. What is the actual situation? All five existing branches of the Armed Forces, including the Air Defense Troops, are remaining until the year 2000. But it is also true that the theoretical basis for the further development of the branches of the Armed Forces is being improved today, and certain concepts are being verified in the course of large-scale strategic exercises involving troops. The facilities that needed to receive air defense cover are also being reviewed. The Air Defense Troops will be reduced to the optimum level by removing surface-to-air missile systems from secondary defended installations. There are also difficulties in the organizational development of the Russian Air Forces, and this too is giving some of our "supporters" grounds for attacking the Army. But organizational development is under way.... The complex process of the redeployment of units on Russian territory that is now nearing completion is being carried out simultaneously with profound reform. The organizational structure of the Air Force is changing. Two new aviation commands have appeared -- front-line aviation, and also the reserve and cadre training. New aviation groupings have been set up in the northwest, west, and southwest salients. Two air armies have "sprung up" in theaters that were not equipped from the aviation viewpoint. At the same time the total number of aviation formations has decreased from 15 to nine. Overall, the strength of the Air Force has decreased by 20 percent. There is progress in another sphere -- the military technical sphere. Today aviation regiments are being rearmed with more modern equipment, which certainly gladdens everyone who cares about our Army. On the whole the Russian Air Force, in the assessment of the Defense Ministry leadership, for instance, is capable of resolving the tasks that constitute its mission in collaboration with other branches of the Armed Forces. And this assessment is not a mere inference by our high-ranking generals. It is based on the results of the series of major exercises held in 1993-1994 involving the use of aviation units, the in-flight refueling of large numbers of aircraft, the launch of highly accurate aviation missiles, and the control of Air Force forces and systems from airborne control centers. Of course, dozens of unsolved problems in the Air Force could be mentioned. For instance, the flying time of pilots of fighter and ground-attack aircraft remains a bottleneck. There are many reasons for this -- the lack of airfield facilities, the shortage of fuel, and so forth. At the same time, as the experience of exercises shows, Russian pilots are capable of delivering highly accurate strikes, including from cloud cover. I would also like to mention the following point. Some experts are worried and others, as the esteemed reader will have realized, angered by the fact that the branches of the Armed Forces are being reduced. But not all of them feel this way. There are many analysts who immediately say: "The Army is big, but it is not being downsized," "the military do not know the strength of the Armed Forces," "it is time to start cutting the Army," and so on in a similar vein. What can I say about this? As the Defense Ministry leadership has repeatedly stated, a planned reduction in the strength of the Armed Forces is being carried out today -- in 1993 alone it was cut by more than 260,000 men. Sometimes you hear the figure: There are 3 million military in the country. Specialists are aware that this figure relates not only to the Army, but also to other "power" structures. Sometimes military leaders themselves give the Army's strength without explaining whether this is the authorized strength, the roll call strength, or the actual strength. Some commentators see no difference between these. And so you get comments like: "The military do not know the strength of the Armed Forces." Since we are talking about reductions, I will note that not everything is simple here. First of all, sharp reductions are an overly expensive pleasure for the state. Furthermore, this process entails the solution of many other problems, the most acute of them being housing. Over 77,000 servicemen discharged into the reserve do not have a roof over their heads today. It is also necessary to decide how big the reductions should be. The former Supreme Soviet legislatively defined the strength of the Armed Forces as 1.5 million men. At the time parliamentarians explained that they were proceeding from "generally accepted" norms: The armies in the developed countries, they said, are usually no more than 1 percent of the country's population. Foreign experience, it has to be said, should be taken into account. But does this formal percentage take account of Russia's specific features, its geopolitical position, the length of its borders, the density of its population? Calculations by General Staff specialists show that, even with implementation of the principles of mobile defenses, the strength of the Army should be around 2 million men. This strength will make it possible to create troop groupings capable of responding adequately to any increase in the military threat in a particular region by transferring mobile components there. ...Yes, the reforms are proceeding with difficulty, sometimes painfully, but painstaking daily work to improve the Army is continuing. In the immediate future, during 1994 and 1995, it is planned to complete the formation of the Armed Forces and to create the basis for their profound transformation. In particular, it is planned to create the Mobile Forces, to continue the creation of troop (force) groupings and the military infrastructure, and to complete the withdrawal of troops to Russia's territory. The plans also include a further switch to the mixed principle of manpower acquisition for units and formations and the transition from a predominantly army- and division-based forces structure to a corps and brigade structure. Full-scale comprehensive studies will be carried out to substantiate the strength, combat composition, and structure of the Armed Forces for the period after 1995. A remark by General of the Army Grachev that is often quoted is: "We have succeeded in halting the sharp decline in combat readiness and military discipline among the troops. Servicemen's morale makes it possible to resolve the set tasks." It is quoted and presented ironically: What an achievement -- it has proved possible to halt the sharp decline in combat readiness. Yes, this is an achievement, and a great one, as is recognized by everyone who is very familiar with the former and the present state of affairs among the troops and who knows the constant shortage of funds and the masses of other extremely complex problems. Incidentally, today it is time to say to the military leadership: Don't spur on the reforms so sharply, this is all too complex and difficult a job. Look at the Blueprint for the Organizational Development of the Armed Forces (an unclassified document), and you will see, dear reader, the face of our Army by 1995 and the year 2000, a modern face. The main aim is to create qualitatively new Armed Forces according with the demands of the present military-political situation in the world and the real extent of the military danger to Russia. But the implementation of any provision of the blueprint requires not merely efforts on the part of the Armed Forces military leadership and the entire officer corps, but also efforts by the whole state and society. And here straightaway is a line from the blueprint -- "reforming the structure of the Armed Forces." What does reforming the structure of the Armed Forces mean? It is not a matter of shuffling a deck of cards. It is not a matter of drawing a new diagram. It is not a matter of drawing up a new document. It is a terribly complex and difficult job spanning many years and an extremely costly measure. Finally, it is the lives of hundreds of thousands of people in uniform and of those who work in the defense sphere. The first stage -- the elaboration of the blueprint itself -- is not easy in itself, although for some reason certain analysts and critics do not think so and constantly bandy about words like "I believe" and "I see the structure of the Armed Forces as follows." Certainly, everybody is entitled to have and to express their own viewpoint. But anyone who is concerned for their reputation and respectability should, in my view, put a period after the words "I believe." This is not merely superficial, it is very superficial. The options for the structure of the Armed Forces that have been elaborated today by the Defense Ministry's main military scientific centers (I emphasize, not by individuals but by collectives of military professionals such as, for instance, the General Staff Military Academy) are not being implemented straight away but are being verified at various command staff games, exercises, training sessions, and so forth. For any error in this sphere could entail the breakdown of the existing defensive system, the expenditure of trillions of the people's rubles, and disruption to the lives of hundreds of thousands of people in uniform. Of course, if you are not concerned about the country's security, if you are not cost-conscious, and if you portray people in uniform as mere cogs and chess pieces, in theory you can announce very striking changes in the Army every month and report that "considerable heights have been scaled in the course of military reform." But only adventurists could venture to do such things. And why is nobody considering the following question: Is it possible at all to reform the Army, such a complex mechanism, when you have no money in your pocket? Of course not, if you regard the enhancement of the combat readiness and combat capability of units and formations as the main aim of the military reform. So why is it precisely the people who shout loudest about the absence of reforms in the Army who are voting in parliament today against granting the Armed Forces not only any money to carry out those reforms but even against providing, so to speak, a "subsistence income"? All the indications are that mercenary political calculations are the driving force here: "The worse the situation in the Army is, the more unstable society is. And therefore the better chance I have in the question of power." Let us return once again to the question of contract personnel. In itself the number of contract personnel will not increase combat readiness. Why is that? Quality in the human resources and morale on the part of the volunteers are also needed. And these components depend directly on her majesty the economy, on funding, and on the state's potential to allocate it. In 1993 the state earmarked 6 billion rubles for the recruitment of professionals. Just as much is needed this year. But it is not just a matter of money. Do the respected critics of military reforms in the Army know that the most important thing for those who work with contract personnel is to look them in the eye sometimes. Why? The Army (the state) sometimes cannot deliver on its commitments. And the reasons for this are well known. In some regions professionals do not receive their wages for two or three months. Only peanuts are allocated for the leasing of housing. The list of problems could be continued. And so...I am afraid we may lose those who have already joined the combat ranks and who are willingly going to serve in "godforsaken spots" and "trouble spots." Give us the money, officers of the General Staff and the commands of the branches of the Armed Forces say, and we will do the job, we will recruit precisely half the personnel on contract today rather than in the year 2000 as planned. But unfortunately, respected critics and analysts, unfortunately.... At present only 25 percent of servicemen are professionals. What about research and development, modern types of equipment and arms, and the infrastructure.... All this also requires colossal funding, like the entire military reform, assuming, I repeat, that its main aim is deemed to be to increase the Armed Forces' combat readiness rather than destroy them. Certainly analysis of the progress of the military reform must proceed on the broadest scale. Certainly the successful advance of military reform is helped by objective critical articles. But the authors of various opinions (especially those who "reform" absolutely everything as they see fit -- one can only marvel at their flights of fantasy) should also remember the following point -- unfair criticism demoralizes people in uniform who are honestly and selflessly serving the homeland, our Russia, and is a painful blow to military reform. And unscrupulous speculation is doubly harmful.
