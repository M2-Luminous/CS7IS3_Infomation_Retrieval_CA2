They are aimed at improving the financial system in the environment of falling production. Inflation has been declared the number-one enemy. Of course, it is dangerous for the economy. However, it can only be a number-one problem in two circumstances. First, when it is the only problem. When, for instance, the economic organism is already healing and all that is needed is to bring the temperature down. Second, when it represents the main cause of production decline. Obviously, the former is not the case. But neither is the latter. Inflation becomes the main cause of a decline only when devaluation of money is happening so swiftly that money ceases fulfilling the function of an equivalent of goods; when barter develops or other countries' currencies take the place of the national currency. Thank goodness, we have not yet reached this point, although it is still possible. Currently, however, the main cause of the production decline is not inflation, but rather fighting it by the method that the government is using. It tries in every way possible to restrict the money supply, to deprive the fire of inflation of combustible material, but forgetting that this material (money) is the prerequisite for commodity turnover and production. Hence the nonpayments crisis, or a crisis of commodity turnover, which gradually grows into a production decline. Next. We are witnessing a transition from a state monopoly to a monopoly of private individuals and groups. But while the state as a public institution cannot pursue only the goals of financial gain, this is precisely the goal of individual- and group-based monopoly. Hence a sharp decline in income and demand on the part of the majority. Which also begets a nonpayments crisis, turning the latter into a classic crisis of overproduction and distribution. The government nevertheless refuses to restore the income and demand of the majority through indexing. The main factor of the decline, and hence the number-one enemy, in our situation is not inflation--it is that the instruments that are used in fighting this ill are impermissible in a civilized economy. It is assumed that as soon as financial policy is truly tightened and subsidies dropped--in short, production is taken to the so-called "bottom" of solvent demand--inflation will immediately stop, and the long-awaited structural restructuring will begin. These assumptions are far removed from reality, which actually has been confirmed by the practice of radical reforms. The point is that this so-called "bottom" of solvent demand is in itself not stationary, and is moving downward in the process of implementation of reforms. Or we may use this metaphor: as it goes down, the sinking ship of the Russian economy encounters an underwater current that pulls it into a deeper spot. Of course, there is a limit. It will be reached when the surviving enterprises are able to reach an agreement among themselves on prices and salaries, but meanwhile the decline may be catastrophic. The number-one problem now is to restore production and create a foundation of an economic system that will contain in it a mechanism of stabilizing prices. We have to do everything to enable producers to reach an agreement on prices among themselves. We have to stop this very dangerous process of disintegration of large production associations, which form the foundation of the contract system that allows to stabilize prices. Without cardinal changes in the economic mechanism, without solid and long-term agreements among producers, it is impossible to win a victory over inflation, and the "bottom" itself may turn out to be so deep that reaching it will exhaust even that great patience that our long-suffering people have been demonstrating to the entire world for almost two years.
