The request was made by Abdenur during a meeting with Madeleine Albright, the U.S. permanent representative before the United Nations, in Brasilia. Albright exhorted Brazilian President Itamar Franco to support the U.S. position to exert pressure on the DPRK. The United States is seeking diplomatic support to intensify its pressure on the DPRK in order to oblige the latter to abide by a recent UN Security Council resolution and allow the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to inspect its nuclear facilities. Abdenur took advantage of the U.S. diplomat's visit to Brazil to ask the United States for greater involvement in the United Nations so as to establish peace in Angola. There are strong cultural, economic, and historical bonds between Brazil and the African nation. Abdenur and Albright decided that they will keep consulting with each other to continue assessing the tense situation confronting the Korean peninsula due to the DPRK's refusal to agree to the inspection of its nuclear facilities. Albright today met President Franco, with Abdenur, and Army Minister General Zenildo de Lucena. She is to leave Brasilia tomorrow to travel to Argentina. Abdenur and Albright expressed optimism about the electoral process in Mozambique, which will culminate with next September's elections. Nevertheless, the acting foreign minister voiced concern about the hasty reduction of UN peacekeeping forces stationed in Mozambique. Both diplomats also discussed future regulations to enhance the effectiveness of the economic sanctions the United Nations imposes on some countries and to alleviate the harm caused to innocent nations or people.
