The central government directly regulates and controls the enterprise groups with separate plans nationwide, breaking down the preexisting confines resulting from enterprise groups' being owned by the various sectors and localities. 2. The leadership system of enterprise groups in cities with separate plans assumes three forms: first, the state establishes its representative bodies such as boards of directors and management committees which will exercise leadership over the collectives with separate plans; second, enterprises based on the joint stock system may use the system of general manager responsibility under the leadership of the board of directors; and, third, enterprises based on all-people ownership may use the system of general manager responsibility under the leadership of the board of directors. 3. The state will give some financial means to enterprise groups which are covered by the trial operation of the separate plan system. Those enterprises which meet the requirements may create financial companies, and may issue bonds and stocks domestically with the necessary approvals. 4. Enterprise groups covered by the trial operation of the separate plan system are granted some autonomy regarding foreign trade operations. 5. The top executives of enterprise groups covered by the trial operation of the separate plan system have the right to give approvals on matters of production, business operation, and circulation.
