"New professional approaches are essential. That's precisely what guided me in nominating Nadibaidze to the office," Shevardnadze remarked and described the new minister as "an experienced specialist, a good organizer, versed in army matters and weaponry." He emphasized that "without cooperation and friendship with Russia at this stage it is impossible to man a truly national Georgian Army to guarantee the country's independence." This, in his words, is clear from the experience of the last few years. Turning to a scandal in Georgian parliament on 28 April, when the Vice-Speaker Vakhtang Rcheulishvili splashed water out of a glass into the face of the Popular Front's leader Nodar Natadze, Shevardnadze declared that there are forces in parliament today, wishing to rekindle instability in the country. He dismissed these attempts as unnecessary and unfeasible. In conclusion, he called Georgian citizens for unity and concord.
