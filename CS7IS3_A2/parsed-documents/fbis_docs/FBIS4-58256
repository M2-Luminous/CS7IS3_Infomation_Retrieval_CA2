FBIS4-58256 "drnes085_m_94003" FBIS-NES-94-085 Daily Report 2 May 1994 JORDAN Committee To Resist Normalization With Israel Committee To Resist Normalization With Israel JN0105171994 Amman AL-MAJD in Arabic 2 May 94 p 2 JN0105171994 Amman AL-MAJD Arabic BFN [Text] Jordanian political parties and national forces have set up a popular committee to counter agreements of capitulation and normalization with the Zionist enemy. The provisional administrative body of the committee has called a meeting for 1800 on Thursday, 5 May, 1994, to ratify the bylaws and obtain official registration. Following is the text of the committee's bylaws: At this stage, the Arab world, as well as Jordan, is being targeted by a ferocious U.S.- and Zionist-led imperialist offensive to consolidate the foundations of a Middle East order with the necessary mechanisms, as a counterbalance to a pan-Arab, democratic, revivalist strategy, by deepening the dependency of Arab regimes and by the recognition of and normalization with the Zionist enemy. The Gaza-Jericho accord, the Jordanian-Israeli agenda, and the ongoing negotiations between the Zionist enemy and the Arab regimes are only the beginning of a plan to impose the so-called Middle East order. First -- The Objective and Functions: Based on the above, the Jordanian parties are setting up a committee to resist negotiations, hegemonic American-Israeli agreements, and political, economic, and cultural normalization with the Zionist enemy. The committee's work will aim for a dual function: 1. A determined stand against the hegemonic and normalizing effort in Jordan and its attendant results, particulary the call for a confederation grouping the Palestinians, Israel, and Jordan, as well as resistance to attempts to impose U.S.-Israeli economic dominance on Jordan so the country's political future is exposed to threat. 2. Laying bridges and forging coordination with all nationalist and democratic forces in the Arab and Muslim arenas that have rejected the hegemonic and normalizing agreements, above all the Palestinian forces that are taking a negative stand toward the Oslo and Cairo agreements and the Jordanian-Israeli agenda. The aim is to uphold the historic, inalienable rights of the Arabs in Palestine, including the right to self-determination, repatriation, and statehood. Second -- The Means: To advance the goals and functions of the committee, the following activities are to be pursued, not excluding other approaches: 1. The publication of a monthly bulletin specialized in pointing out the dangers of the Zionist presence and exposing those who establish contacts with the Zionist enemy. The bulletin will have a cultural, political, and scientific orientation. 2. Organizing panel discussions, lectures, and rallies to point up the dangers of the Zionist presence and the risks to Jordan and the Arab nation that normaliztion carries. 3. The formation of popular bodies in Jordan to marshal public pressure to forestall any move to scrap or amend legislation barring dealings with the Zionist enemy in the political, economic, and cultural domains, or any other spheres, and to keep the boycott of Israel in place. 4. The formation of subcommittees of economic experts, businessmen, trade unionists, and professionals to combat the economic opening to the Zionist enemy, which is potentially detrimental to Jordan's industrial and agricultural sectors. The subcommittees should also resist dependency on the Zionist economy. 5. The formation of cultural subcommittees to counter and expose cultural normalization with the Zionist enemy in any shape of form and to block all channels to promote cultural penetration of our society, including any amendments to the school curricula to further the cause of cultural normalization with the enemy. 6. Any politician, merchant, intellectual, writer, unionist, or journalist who does business with Israelis must be isolated.
