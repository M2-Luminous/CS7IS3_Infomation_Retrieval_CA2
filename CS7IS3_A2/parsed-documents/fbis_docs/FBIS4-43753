Demirel hosted a dinner in honor of Turkmen President Saparmurad Niyazov at the Cankaya Mansion tonight. In a dinner toast, Demirel remarked that the relations between the two countries progressed significantly, strengthened by cultural and linguistic ties. Pointing out that the beneficial talks held with President Niyazov today gave a brand new impetus to bilateral relations, Demirel said: I have no doubt that Turkish-Turkmen cooperation, the legal foundations of which have largely been concluded as a result of the approximately 40 agreements reached between the two countries, will be further enhanced on the basis of equality, mutual interest, love, and respect. The two countries were forced to live apart and yearned for one another in the course of history, Demirel explained, adding that they are now experiencing the happiness of reunification after a separation of hundreds of years. [Begin Demirel recording] We are following with appreciation the reforms launched under your capable leadership and the distance covered by your country despite all the difficult conditions. We appreciate the constructive approach you have adopted while you build and strengthen your national state and conduct good relations with your neighbors. This approach contributes to peace and stability in your region. We believe in the benefit of developing cooperation among the Central Asian republics, which share the same history, culture, and geography, and which face similar needs and problems. With its serious and balanced foreign policy based on open doors and positive impartiality, Turkmenistan has occupied the position it deserves in the international arena.
