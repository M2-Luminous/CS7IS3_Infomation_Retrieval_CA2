Consultations in Cairo among the Somali factions representing the Salvation Alliance were held at the invitation of Egypt, which currently chairs the OAU. Commenting on that, interim President Ali Mahdi Mohamed, who lived in Cairo in 1960 as a researcher at the Malaria Institute, said: President Mubarak's invitation to us reflected the strong fraternal relations and the historic ties that link our countries. In an exclusive interview with AL-AHRAM, Mahdi said that the Somali people are eager to see peace prevail in their country. This desire was enhanced with the arrival of international forces. Mahdi warned against overoptimism, in view of another development that calls for concern; namely, the withdrawal of a considerable part of the international forces by the end of this month before all factions are disarmed, the establishment of state institutions is completed, the police force is reorganized, and peace is restored. This constitutes a threat because fighting might resume after the forces withdraw, he said. Speaking about the obstacles hindering reconciliation, Mahdi said: Although we reached an agreement in Addis Ababa last March, a small group is working to separate the northern part of Somalia. Mahdi denied that Aidid is in control of a wide area of Somalia. He pointed out that the image of Aidid drawn in the media is not true and distorts the facts. He explained that Somalia has 18 regions, 16 of which are under the control of the 12 factions of the Salvation Alliance, while two regions are controlled by the National Movement in the north. Asked whether there is dialogue between the 12 factions and the National Movement in the north, Mahdi said: There is no official contact between us, but there are personal contacts with figures from the north. We hope the situation will develop in the future into an expanded Somali dialogue, he said. Mahdi was asked about the agreement reached in Cairo between the factions and the prospects for its success in the absence of Aidid, who was invited to the meeting but failed to attend. He said: We are eager to meet with him to solve the problem. We have not ignored him; we will invite him to take part in implementing the agreement. Mahdi believes that several parties are encouraging Aidid to take negative stands and they provide him with what he needs to maintain the present situation. Mahdi, however, refrained to name these parties. On the reason for and significance of Aidid's presence outside Somalia and the acceptance of Aliyow, one of the leaders of the factions allied with Aidid, of Egypt's invitation to attend and participate in the Somali discussions, Mahdi said: Aidid took part in the political consultations that took place in Addis Ababa last March. Ever since then, he has been traveling on tours outside the country. As regards Aliyow, he came here in response to Egypt's invitation. His presence here manifests the differences in viewpoint with Aidid, who is allied with two other factions. The total number of Somali factions is 15. On Aidid's earlier comments that the Somali factions were about to reach agreement had Egypt not intervened, Mahdi said: Egypt invited us all without distinction. What Egypt is doing does not target any specific party and does not give or withhold privileges to any. All the rumors Aidid is spreading against Egypt are not true. As regards differences between the group of 12 that constitute the Salvation Alliance, Mahdi said: I confirm that there are no differences among the 12 factions and that all reports about divisions are not true. We have defined a specific and united policy and a fixed defense, which will grow from whatever conclusions we reach through our democratic discussions. On Aidid's accusation that the United Nations is the reason behind the suffering in Somalia, Mahdi said: It is unfortunate for us to hear accusations, which are not in line with the true interests of our people, leveled against the role of the United Nations. The truth is very different. The United Nations intervened at a time when our people were going through a very bad crises. The average daily number of deaths was about 2,000. Chaos prevailed everywhere. These problems were eliminated, and stability and peace were restored. He added: We should not forget that the role of the United Nations contributed toward constructing administrative institutions in various regions of Somalia. Had the United Nations not intervened, the catastrophe would have been much greater. On the role of the forces remaining in Somalia after the end of the current month, the number of which will be 22,000, Mahdi said: Actually, we are not satisfied with the new duties specified for these forces in accordance with the Security Council resolution. The resolution stipulates that these forces should stay in their barracks, maintain public facilities such as airports and ports, and protect aid convoys, without actually participating in disarmament operations, spreading public security, and contributing toward reconciliation. We deduce from this that the role of international forces in Somalia will shrink.
