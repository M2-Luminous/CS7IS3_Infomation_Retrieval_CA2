Military sources described the move as a "sensible precaution in the light of current circumstances." Work was continuing as normal both on the ground and in the air, officials said. There were no British warplanes in the area at the time U.S. F-16 Fighting Falcons shot down four Bosnian Serb Galeb attack aircraft. The U.S. aircraft, equipped with Sidewinder air-to-air missiles, spotted six Galebs in the air close to Banja Luka in direct contravention of the UN resolution banning all flights over Bosnia. The American pilots ordered the Serb planes to land or be shot down. They ignored the warning and four were destroyed. Britain has six Sea Harrier jump-jets, eight Tornado F-3 fighters and 12 Jaguar strike aircraft flying regular patrols over Bosnia. But the Ministry of Defence in London said none were in the immediate area when the attack took place. A spokesman said: "Operations are continuing today as normal. This was a very good example of NATO action in enforcement of a UN resolution." Allied aircraft on patrols over Bosnia stay above 10,000ft to avoid anti-aircraft artillery. The Bosnian Serb forces possess a variety of anti-aircraft missiles, including heat-seeking systems.
