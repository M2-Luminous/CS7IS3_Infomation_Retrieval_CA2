FR940620-0-00018 FR940620-0-00005 Since the issuance of the proposed rule, Boeing has issued Revision 2 of Service Bulletin 757&hyph;78&hyph;0032, dated May 12, 1994. The service bulletin revision moves general work instruction Step B from Work Package 2 to Step U in Work Package 8. In Revision 1 of the service bulletin, Step B of Work Package 2 specified procedures for removal of the ground to the EICAS for the REV ISLN VAL message; however, the ground should not be removed as part of Work Package 2. Rather, the ground should be removed as part of Work Package 8 in order to avoid loss of the REV ISLN VAL message on EICAS. Revision 2 of the service bulletin correctly describes procedures for removal of the ground as part of Work Package 8. Revision 2 of the service bulletin also describes procedures for installation of an additional bracket on the P36 disconnect bracket and to make a cutout on the P37 disconnect bracket on certain airplanes. The FAA has reviewed and approved this latest revision to the service bulletin and has revised the final rule to reflect it as the appropriate source of service information. The FAA finds that citing this latest revision to the service bulletin will impose no additional burden on any operator. It should be noted that Revision 2 of Boeing Service Bulletin 757&hyph;78&hyph;0032 references Rolls-Royce Service Bulletins RB.211&hyph;78&hyph;9627 and RB.211&hyph;78&hyph;9613 as additional sources of service information for accomplishment of the originally proposed sync-lock installation. However, the Boeing service bulletin does not specify the appropriate revision levels for the Rolls-Royce service bulletins. Therefore, the FAA has added ``NOTE 1'' to paragraph (b) of this AD to specify that the intent of that paragraph is that the appropriate revision levels for the Rolls-Royce service bulletins that are to be used in conjunction with Boeing Service Bulletin 757&hyph;78&hyph;0032 are as follows: Rolls-Royce Service Bulletin RB.211&hyph;78&hyph;9613, dated December 3, 1992, or Revision 1, dated March 5, 1993, or Revision 2, dated October 1, 1993; and Rolls-Royce Service Bulletin RB.211&hyph;78&hyph;9627, dated December 3, 1992. In addition, since the issuance of the proposed rule, Rolls-Royce has issued Service Bulletin RB.211&hyph;78&hyph;9822, dated October 1, 1993. This service bulletin describes procedures for installation of a revised thrust reverser sync-lock. The FAA has determined that accomplishment of the actions described in this service bulletin, in conjunction with Boeing Service Bulletin 757&hyph;78&hyph;0032 [which was cited in paragraph (b) of the proposal as the appropriate source of service information for installation of an additional thrust reverser system locking feature], constitutes an acceptable alternative to the sync-lock installation specified in paragraph (b) of the proposal. In light of this information, paragraph (b) of the final rule has been revised to include paragraph (b)(1), which contains the requirement for installation of an additional thrust reverser system locking feature that was specified in the proposed rule, and paragraph (b)(2), which provides for installation of a revised thrust reverser sync-lock as an acceptable alternative to paragraph (b)(1) of this AD. Accomplishment of the revised installation specified in paragraph (b)(2) requires no additional work hours beyond the 506 work hours specified in the economic impact information, below, for accomplishment of the originally proposed sync-lock installation. Additionally, it should be noted that Rolls-Royce Service Bulletin RB.211&hyph;78&hyph;9822 references Rolls-Royce Service Bulletin RB.211&hyph;78&hyph;9613 as an additional source of service information for airplanes equipped with Rolls-Royce RB211&hyph;535E4/E4B engines. Rolls-Royce Service Bulletin RB.211&hyph;78&hyph;9613 references Rolls-Royce Service Bulletin RB.211&hyph;78&hyph;9627 as an additional source of service information. However, the appropriate revision levels for these service bulletins are not specified in Boeing Service Bulletin 757&hyph;78&hyph;0032 or in any of the Rolls-Royce service bulletins. Therefore, the FAA has added ``NOTE 2'' to paragraph (b) of the final rule to specify that the appropriate revision levels to be used in conjunction with Rolls-Royce Service Bulletin RB.211&hyph;78&hyph;9822 are as follows: Rolls-Royce Service Bulletin RB.211&hyph;78&hyph;9613, Revision 2, dated October 1, 1993; and Rolls-Royce Service Bulletin RB.211&hyph;78&hyph;9627, dated December 3, 1992. After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes previously described. The FAA has determined that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. There are approximately 250 Model 757 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 95 airplanes of U.S. registry will be required to accomplish the restow and integrity tests required by this AD, that it will take approximately 1 work hour per airplane to accomplish those tests, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators to accomplish each operational test is estimated to be $5,225, or $55 per airplane. The FAA estimates that 95 airplanes of U.S. registry will be required to accomplish either modification specified in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this AD. It will take approximately 506 work hours per airplane to accomplish either of those modifications, and the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts will be supplied by the manufacturer at no cost to operators. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators to accomplish the modification is estimated to be $2,643,850, or $27,830 per airplane. The FAA also estimates that 113 airplanes of U.S. registry will be required to accomplish the periodic operational tests of the sync-lock installation required by this AD, that it will take approximately 1 work hour per airplane to accomplish each test, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators to accomplish each operational test is estimated to be $6,215, or $55 per airplane.
