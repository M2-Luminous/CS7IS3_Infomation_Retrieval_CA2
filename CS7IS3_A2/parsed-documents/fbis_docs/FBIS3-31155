On Tuesday [8 February], Zhirinovskiy told Czech Television: "If Vaclav Havel is not pleased by my possible visit (of the Czech Republic), then I'm also not pleased that a playwright can become a president. It's not right." Zhirinovskiy said this after he had confirmed that he had received an invitation to visit the Czech Republic from the Assembly for the Republic-Czechoslovak Republican Party (SPR-RSC). Zhirinovskiy also predicted that in ten years there would be no more Moravia or Sudetenland. "In ten years the entire Czech nation will be cursing Havel, just like the Russian people are cursing Gorbachev," he said. "Vaclav Havel will die and in ten years young Czechs will be cursing him. (Because the Germans) will force them to speak German, they will force them to forget their mother tongue, they will force them to go to German churches and clean the boots of German officers." In his regular Sunday radio speech, Havel said: "Mr. Zhirinovskiy holds a diplomatic passport and he therefore can come to the Czech Republic anyway. Then it will be up to him what he will say here and whether or not our authorities will consider it appropriate to expel him eventually.
