Malhotra, has said that the committee headed by him has recommended privatization of the insurance business only to protect the interests of the insuring public. In an interview to PTI, he asserted that the U.S. threat to retaliate against India if it did not open up its insurance industry did not weigh with the committee. He said that opening up the insurance sector would lead to better service by existing companies and also by the new entrants.
