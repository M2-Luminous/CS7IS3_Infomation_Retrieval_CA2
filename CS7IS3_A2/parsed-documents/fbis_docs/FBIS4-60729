He added: It is known that Somalia was enabled to join the Arab League under special circumstances in order to strengthen the positive factors in Somalia's ties with the Arab nation and to play a constructive role in its cultural progress and unity, rather than a separatist and opportunist role. He also said: This announcement by the secessionist Somalis who are rejected by the Somali people is aimed at harming the Arab nation as a whole and its pan-Arab concepts and trend, as well as Yemen and Yemen's unity. This should make the secessionist Somalis know that the benefits they may take from such a opportunist position are much less than what they can win from sound relations with the Arab nation and its goals.
