The head of state, General Sani Abacha, stated Nigeria's objection to the classification today in Abuja during his maiden press briefing of media executives. State House correspondent Chris Nguw reports that Gen. Abacha described the briefing as an opportunity for forging a productive government-media partnership: [Begin recording] [Nguw] The head of state's briefing centered on six options: government-press relationship [words indistinct] policy, foreign policy, the imminent constitutional conference, drug trafficking, and the Nigerian-Cameroon dispute over the Bakassi Peninsula. One of the highlights of the briefing was his reference to the United States' recent listing of Nigeria as an uncooperative country in the fight against drug trafficking as a political [words indistinct] genuine component of the United States policy on drug control. Gen. Abacha said the United States' pronouncement was a surprise, especially as Nigeria's efforts at combating drug trafficking are well known had been recently applauded by the American Embassy in Nigeria and the United States drug administration. He said his administration would, however, not be deterred in the fight against drug trafficking. [Abacha] [Words indistinct], should be understood by all concerned that this administration is going to continue its fight against drug trafficking and the related crimes [word indistinct] to ensure that the drugs [words indistinct] in our society. We shall intensify our antidrug crusade. Of course, we believe it is right to do so in our national interest and to protect our society from its cancerous effects that we have observed in Western societies. We urge the Western governments to look inwards into their owns societies and (?calm) the excessive appetite of their own [word indistinct] which create the drive for drugs. [applause] Nigeria does not produce any hard drugs. Nigerians are not a drug consuming people. [Nguw] On the political economy, the head of state identified three major sources of conflict, not only in Nigeria, but also in other African countries: the heavy debt burden, the effects of the structural adjustment program and last of them, as he put it the conflict-ridden [word indistinct] democratization process going on on the continent. He said [word indistinct] of the idea of the national conference in Nigeria has been raised on non-partisan interests. (?Referring) to the issue of government and the media, Gen. Abacha assured the media executives that his administration is willing to accommodate criticisms and that free flow of information will be encouraged. However, he appealed to the media not to publish [words indistinct] facts and to remember that discretion is the better part of journalistic prowess. On foreign policy, Gen. Abacha said Africa stands [words indistinct] the centerpiece of policy. Outside the continent, he said Nigeria is reviewing her diplomatic representation in the former Soviet Union to ensure the nation's presence in the (?15) republics that have emerged from the breaking up of the Soviet Union. Some members of the Provisional Ruling Council and ministers were present at the briefing which went into a closed-door session shortly after the head of state's address. [end recording]
