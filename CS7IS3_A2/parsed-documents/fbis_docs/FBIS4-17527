He was commenting on an International Monetary Fund statement that a new "spiral of inflation" was to be expected in Russia. Only the trade and economic integration of the two states has begun at present, in accordance with the recently-signed agreement on monetary union, Shokhin said. The circulation of the rouble on Belarussian territory needs to be approved by the parliament since it requires changes in that country's constitution, and that takes time, he noted. The vice-premier said that the agreement on monetary union was only "partly" signed on April 12. The deal is, he explained, that the agreement's articles which were connected with commercial and economic cooperation were to go in effect immediately after preparation was completed. These concerned, in particular, the removal of customs barriers and the conclusion of a transit agreement. But it was decided that the other, monetary part of the document was to become effective only after its legalization in Belarus, since the creation of a single centre of emission in Russia contradicts the Belarussian Constitution. If the Belarussian legislation is changed in accordance with the documents signed in Moscow, then it will be the Russian State Duma's turn to examine the benefits of monetary union with Belarus. If Belarus is not willing to accept a single emission centre in Russia, then there are no chances that Russia will agree to a one- to-one exchange of Belarussian notes for Russian roubles, Shokhin explained. In that case, Russia will have to follow a different unification scheme, by extending credit to Belarus on the same grounds as it was given to Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan at the end of 1993.
