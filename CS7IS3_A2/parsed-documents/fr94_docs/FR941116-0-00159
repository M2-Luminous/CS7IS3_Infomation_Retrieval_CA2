FR941116-0-00159 FR941116-0-00022 (d) The land must be determined to be eligible as provided in §1413.61; and (e) The land must be devoted to an approved cover or practice in accordance with the provisions of §§1413.63, 1413.64, or 1413.65 as soon as practicable after the substitution. (f) The substitution of acreages cannot be used to nullify a payment reduction as a result of the application of the failure to comply fully with provisions of part 791 of this title. §1413.73 [Reserved] §1413.74 Reduction in ACR. (a) A producer whose payments under the feed grain, rice, upland and ELS cotton, or wheat programs may be reduced because of the application of the provisions with respect to the payment limitation as specified in accordance with part 1497 of this title may request a downward adjustment in the amount of acreage which is otherwise required to be devoted to conservation uses on the farm. The request shall be in writing and shall be filed with the county committee on form CCC&hyph;477A, Request for and Calculation of Reduced Acreage Conservation Reserve Requirement, and by the final reporting date for the crop. If such a producer is sharing in program payments with respect to farms in two or more counties, it shall be the producer's responsibility to furnish information concerning the producer's participation in the other counties to the county committee with which the application for the downward adjustment is filed. (b) Any reduction in ACR acreage required under this section shall be computed by: (1) Estimating the producer's total payments which would be received under the feed grain, rice, upland and ELS cotton, and wheat program on all farms, excluding crops which are enrolled in a program, but with respect to which deficiency payments are not paid, (2) Determining the percentage by which the estimated total payments must be reduced in order to comply with the payment limitation, and (3) Multiplying such percentage by the number of acres in the producer's portion of the ACR acreage which is required for the farm or farms participating in the programs. When both land diversion and ARP's are in effect, the acreage required to be devoted to ACR in accordance with the ARP's shall be reduced to zero before the acreage to be devoted to ACR in accordance with the land diversion acreage is reduced. (c) If the acreage reported on form ASCS&hyph;578 in accordance with part 718 of this title causes the projected deficiency payments to change by more than 5 percent, the CCC&hyph;477A must be revised. If the actual planted acreage of a crop is less than the acreage used to compute the reduced ACR for the crop because the producer was prevented from planting the crop, the required ACR reduction shall not be recalculated. (d) If the producer is participating in the ARP on two or more farms, the producer may elect to have the reduction in ACR acreages under this program, but not under the land diversion programs, divided among the farms in such proportion as the producer may designate. (e) If producers have interests in farms in more than one county, the county committee where the farm is administratively located shall be responsible for determining the required amount of reduced ACR, based on information provided by other county committees on such producers. The headquarters county committee shall notify other county committees of the amount by which the ACR requirement is reduced for each farm and each crop. If producers have interests in more than one State, the county committee shall contact the other county committees directly, or the applicable State committee if the county committee address is unknown. §1413.75 Skip rows. The acreage between rows of the crop planted in an established skip row pattern as defined in part 718 of this title is eligible for designation as either ACR or CU for payment if: (a) The skip is at least the larger of 4 normal rows or 150 inches from plant to plant, and (b) The land meets the requirements for eligible land as set forth in §1413.61, except for the minimum size and width requirements.
