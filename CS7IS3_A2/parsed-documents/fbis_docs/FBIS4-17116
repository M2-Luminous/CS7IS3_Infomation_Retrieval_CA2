Missiles brought out of Belarus under an agreement are being placed on alert duty in Russia. [Mikhail Zotov] In the village of Manan-Muchash, which means -- short end -- in the Mari language, not far from Yoshkar-Ola, a regiment equipped with missiles brought out of Belarus under the trilateral agreement has been placed on alert duty. You can see the missiles behind me. They are the newest strategic missiles, codenamed Topol, SS-25. The military says these strategic mobile missile complexes have no computer program devised to eliminate targets in any country that might be a potential adversary. However, the on-board electronic systems are capable of retargeting the complex within a few seconds. Radar-proof warheads can reach any point in the opposite hemisphere. Despite the fact that the army is troubled by many problems, the missile troops are relatively well-off, and in the words of Major-General Nikolay (Moroz), are capable of maintaining a guaranteed minimum of security and independence for Russia. Meanwhile, the West is keeping an close watch on the Topols in Mari territory. Radar stations have registered the fact that our neighbors' satellites were monitoring the redeployment of the missiles. Space, however, remains the only place from where an outsider can watch Russian strategic missiles being placed on alert duty. On the ground it is only reporters from Ostankino's First Channel who can do it.
