Although the security expert declined to elaborate on the extent of this penetration, he noted that it is semi-comprehensive and is bound to obstruct the terrorists' movements and curb their operations. The security expert added that the penetration has been expanded to cover most of the terrorist organizations, thus enabling the security services to have an overall picture of these organizations' leaders, members, internal, and external affiliations, centers, and sources of arms and funds. The security expert, who preferred to remain anonymous, pointed out that the penetration has also enabled the security forces to carry out successful operations that have led to the fall of several terrorist leaders and to strike at the perpetrators of some operations before they were carried out. The security expert said that this successful development does not mean the end of the terrorists. He cautioned that some absconding members might carry out serious terrorist operations. The security expert made these statements before the incident in al-Sayyidah Zaynab, on 14 February, during which the following three terrorists were killed: Tharwat Hajjaj, Mustafa Mahmud 'Ali Musa, and 'Atif Khalil 'Id. Meanwhile, the Interior Ministry has nearly completed a new procedure that would protect prosecution witnesses in terrorist cases and encourage citizens to give any information dealing with terrorist activities to facilitate arrests. The proposed procedure imposes complete secrecy on persons who give information and intensifies their protection in the event that they become prosecution witnesses. [passage omitted] A security source said that after the assassination of Sayyid Ahmad Yahya, the prosecution witness in the case of the assassination attempt against Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif Sidqi, a state of fear engulfed prosecution witnesses in other terrorist cases. Some of these witnesses wanted to withdraw their statements. Other witnesses even failed to show up before the interrogation authorities. The interior minister then issued instructions to study the entire situation. [passage omitted]
