The deputy premier and minister of home affairs, the Honorable Augustine Mrema, who is visiting Mozambique, denied the allegations at a dinner given for him by his counterpart, the Mozambican interior minister, Colonel Jorge Manuel Antonio. Speaking to Dar es Salaam Radio Tanzania Network by telephone from Maputo, the Honorable Mrema said Mozambique had been led by Mozambicans ever since it attained its independence in 1975. Tanzania therefore had no reason whatsoever to prepare a force to invade the country. The minister said that what the citizens of Mozambique now wanted was peace to rebuild their country, and that Tanzania supported all efforts being made in Mozambique to bring that peace about. The Honorable Mrema also assured Mozambique that Tanzania would continue to condemn any intrigues aimed at bringing about war and disrupting peace in Mozambique.
