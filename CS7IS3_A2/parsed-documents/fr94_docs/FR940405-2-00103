This refunding proposal was approved by HUD on September 8, 1993. Refunding bonds have been priced to an average yield of 5.55%. The tax-exempt refunding bond issue of $10,675,000 at current low-interest rates will save section 8 subsidy. The Treasury also gains long-term tax revenue benefits through replacement of outstanding tax-exempt coupons of 9.25%&hyph;10.125% at the call date in 1993 with tax-exempt bonds yielding 5.55%. The refunding will also substantially reduce the FHA mortgage interest rate at expiration of the HAP contract, from 10.22% to 6.65%, thus reducing FHA mortgage insurance risk. The refunding serves the important public purposes of reducing HUD's section 8 program costs, improving Treasury tax revenues, (helping reduce the budget deficit), and increasing the likelihood that projects will continue to provide housing for lower-income families after subsidies expire, a priority HUD objective. 42.
