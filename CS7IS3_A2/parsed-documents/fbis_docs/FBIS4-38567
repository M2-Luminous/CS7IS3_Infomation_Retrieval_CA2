As a high-ranking official from the Naval Staff told INTERFAX-UKRAINA, this decision was taken because "the Black Sea Fleet Command refuses to resolve the issue of jointly ensuring the safety of navigation, including exchanges in navigation information." Meanwhile, as the spokesman for Ukraine's navy said, the Odessa and Nikolayev hydrographic districts run by Kiev "regularly give information to Ukrainian and Russian civilian ships and to the Black Sea Fleet." "In the meantime, the Black Sea Fleet Command has failed to notify us even of the hydrographic works to be conducted in the Azov Sea in June, though such works must be coordinated officially," said INTERFAX-UKRAINA's interviewee.
