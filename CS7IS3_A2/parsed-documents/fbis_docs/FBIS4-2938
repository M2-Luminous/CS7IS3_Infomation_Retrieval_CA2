He stressed that the current situation is indeed excellent in rural areas and that the peasants have shown a greater initiative in promoting production, especially in growing grain. Party and government leaders at all levels must conscientiously implement the guideline laid down by the central meeting on rural work and work really hard to stabilize grain output and help the peasants increase their income. [passage omitted] Local peasants told Mao Zhiyong: Now that the party central authorities attach importance to agriculture and have offered good policies, the grain price has been rising and thus farming promises good returns. Mao Zhiyong replied happily: Agricultural production is subject to very strict seasonal conditions. It is now time to start spring farming. You should never miss the right time for farming. I hope you will have a deeper understanding of the importance of agricultural production and rural work. In particular, you must pay great attention to grain production--it is necessary to keep the grain sowing area stable. At the same time, it is necessary to keep an eye on key measures for promoting production, with the focus placed on raising per-unit-area yield with a view to increasing the gross output. [passage omitted] Mao Zhiyong noted: During the main grain growing period, we must not only ensure a steady increase in grain output but also make every effort to help the peasants increase their income so that they will become rich sooner. [passage omitted] Mao Zhiyong pointed out: + In order to increase their income and become rich sooner, our peasants should promote a diversified economy, improve management, and expand production scale while developing grain production. [passage omitted] Mao Zhiyong said: As far as the rural work is concerned, we have many tasks to perform but the most basic matter is to work in a down-to-earth manner to intensify grass-roots organizations. To do a good job in this aspect, we must focus our attention on building organizations at the village level with party branches as their core and on developing the economy at the village level, thus ensuring that all duties are undertaken by the right people and sufficient funds are allocated to run the businesses. Mao Zhiyong said: At the moment the situation is excellent in rural areas. However, we still need to remain cool-headed, work in a down-to-earth manner, and further explore bright prospects. We have set out the key tasks and our leaders at all levels certainly need to further improve their work style, go down to the grass-roots level, publicize the policies among the peasants, adopt appropriate measures to help the peasants promote production, and solve the actual problems. [passage omitted] After his stay in Dongguan Township, Mao Zhiyong also paid a visit to Suji Township, which has long been a cotton producing area. There he conducted a survey on this year's cotton production, publicized rural policies among the peasants, and encouraged the peasants to grow more cotton, do a better job, and fulfill this year's cotton output quota.
