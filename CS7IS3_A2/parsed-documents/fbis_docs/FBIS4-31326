The FKgP took fourth place -- 6.74 per cent -- among the six parties that got into Hungary's National Assembly in the May general elections. Asked by MTI, Torgyan said he was elected parliamentary faction leader unanimously. The rules of operation will also have to be discussed and approved at the meeting, he added. Commenting on the Hungarian Socialist Party's [MSZP] special Saturday [4 June] congress nominating party chairman Gyula Horn for premiership, Torgyan said he was not surprised at the decision as he had always considered Horn the most likely candidate for the post. Horn's personal contribution to the MSZP's overwhelming election victory is indisputable, he said. It would have been total negligence of the voters' will if somebody else had been nominated for the prime ministerial post, Torgyan said. For the same reason, the Alliance of Free Democrats is almost certain to say yes to a coalition, he added. The FKgP is preparing to provide a forthright opposition to the next government. "This is the only party that has repeatedly made it clear-cut from the very beginning: It will not cooperate with the Socialists in any way," Torgyan said.
