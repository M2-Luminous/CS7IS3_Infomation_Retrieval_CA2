Russia's interests, in his opinion, are met more by the maximum strongest Serbia in the peaceful solution of all problems linked with the settlement of the conflict in former Yugoslavia. Parliamentary hearings on former Yugoslavia were held in the State Duma today, during which Russian deputies were addressed by Sergey Lavrov, the Russian deputy foreign minister. He confirmed Russia's intention not to support the idea of dealing an air strike at the positions of Bosnian Serbs. "Although the Russian Foreign Ministry is on the correct road now, still the report by the deputy foreign minister on the Yugoslav issue was not quite self-critical," believes Lukin. Russia's Foreign Ministry, in his opinion, made a serious mistake in the past by backing U.N. Security Council sanctions against former Yugoslavia despite objections of the former Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation. The committee chairman criticised an argument by the Liberal- Democratic Party of Russia on the need to withdraw all foreign army contingents from former Yugoslavia. "This may intensify the conflict, since restraining elements will be absent", he noted.
