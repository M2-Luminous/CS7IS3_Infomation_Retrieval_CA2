FBIS4-59108 "drnes091_d_94004" FBIS-NES-94-091 Daily Report 8 May 1994 Libya Islamic People's Command Issues Communique Islamic People's Command Issues Communique LD0805181694 Tripoli JANA in English 1758 GMT 8 May 94 LD0805181694 Tripoli JANA English BFN [Text] Tripoli, Al Maa [May] 8, JAMAHIRIYAH NEWS AGENCY--The emergency meeting of the general secretariat of the International Islamic People's Command, held on 5-7th instant under the banner "Enabling Muslims To Defend Their Holy Places", concluded its proceedings last night in Tripoli. The secretariat issued a communique at the end of the meeting asserting that the meeting was held at the darkest time in the history of Muslims as crusader tyranny and encroachment affected all affairs of Muslims. The secretariat pointed out that this encroachment by Western crusaders on Muslims and their holy shrines went as far as controlling their religious practice and tutelage over their holy places like Mecca and Medina and setting conditions on Muslims in the fulfilment of their religious obligations. The secretariat cited in this respect the ban imposed on the Libyan Arab pilgrims preventing them from travelling to the holy places. The secretariat urged all Muslims, as individuals, groups and governments, to shoulder their responsibility regarding this encroachment and onslaught on Muslim holy shrines and intervention in their worshipping matters. The secretariat stressed the need for Muslims to stand against the resolutions of the so called Security Council which follows a double standard policy and directs one humiliation after another against Muslims. The communique called for issuing clearly the Islamic legal view on the intervention of a non Muslim side in the Muslims' religious affairs and embargo against them and to convey this ruling to all non-governmental and official organisations and institutions in the Muslim world, international organisations and human rights institutions.
