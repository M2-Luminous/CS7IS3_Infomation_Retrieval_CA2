[passage omitted] Meanwhile, the southern leadership is intensifying its diplomatic moves to step up Arab and international political pressure to force Sanaa to observe a cease-fire and enter negotiations to secure a peaceful solution to the situation. Southern Prime Minister Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas and Foreign Minister 'Abdallah al-Asnaj headed for Washington yesterday to hold talks with the U.S. Administration. Al-Asnaj told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT during his stopover in London yesterday that he and al-'Attas will brief the U.S. Administration on the latest developments and the total damage, rocket shelling, and heavy artillery bombardment to which Aden and Lahij are being subjected. He said they will urge the UN Security Council to take further practical deterrent measures to prevent further disasters. He stressed that they will meet with the UN secretary general to discuss Brahimi's report and to reemphasize Aden's commitment to implementing the stipulations of the Security Council resolution without any reservations. [passage omitted] In Aden, military reports have revealed that 5,000 "Jihad" organization elements, among them foreigners belonging to the so-called "Afghan Arabs" organization, have arrived in the (northern) Red Sea port of al-Hudaydah. The reports stressed that these elements have been moved to the frontlines of the northern forces besieging Aden.
