Profit Sharing When real property is conveyed as described in paragraph 5. of this summary, DoD shall generally share in the division of future profits should the property be subsequently sold or leased. The division of profits shall be based on net profits and the share shall generally favor the local redevelopment authority. There shall be a 15-year time limit on the share of the profits. The government's portion of the receipts from the profit shall not exceed the estimated fair market value of the property at the time of conveyance to the local redevelopment authority. 7. Leasing of Real Property Leasing of real property early in the reuse process is an effective way to quickly attract new jobs to replace those that have been lost by the base closing. In the past, the requirement to lease at fair market value discouraged the creation of new jobs. The new leasing process, at less than fair market value, will provide new incentives for redevelopment authorities and businesses alike to spur job creation and speed economic redevelopment. Inasmuch as the Department cannot convey contaminated property until clean-up measures are in place, leasing is often the only means to allow suitable economic reuse to occur on substantial portions of closing bases. 8. Personal Property Personal property located on closing bases is often very useful to the redevelopment of the real property. This section of the interim final rule outlines procedures to allow transfer of personal property with the real property in many cases. It provides for completing an inventory soon after the base is approved for closure and consultation with local officials. This consultation may include a walkthrough of the base to familiarize local officials with potentially available property. The community can then identify the personal property it wishes to retain in its redevelopment plan. The Department of Defense will keep a great deal of the personal property at the base while the redevelopment plan is being put together. Only valid exemptions will be made to this freeze, usually involving specific military requirements or property which the base does not own. Emissions trading procedures will be issued separately and are not covered by the interim final rule. 9. Minimum Level of Maintenance and Repair To Support Non-Military Purposes Facilities and equipment located on closing bases are often important to the eventual reuse. This section of the interim rule below provides procedures to protect their condition while the redevelopment plan is being put together. The level of maintenance will be determined in consultation with the redevelopment authority. DoD Directive 4165.aa 1 (32 CFR Part 90) establishes basic policies to carry out the President's plan and the Base Closure Community Assistance Act. DoD Instruction 4165.bb 2 (32 CFR Part 91) provides procedural guidance for implementation. In addition to property disposal, the document addresses fast-track environmental cleanup and increased economic development planning support for communities. It provides for on-site transition coordinators, responsible directly to the Secretary of Defense, at major closing bases in order to minimize red tape and keep environmental cleanup and base disposal activities on a fast track. 1 Draft document. When signed, this document will be available from the National Technical Information Service, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161. 2 See footnote 1.
