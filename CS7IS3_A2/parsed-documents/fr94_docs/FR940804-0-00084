ACTION: Joint final rule. SUMMARY: Section 107(b) of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) requires that the Department of Justice (the Department), the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (the Commission or the EEOC), and the Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs issue regulations setting forth procedures to coordinate the processing of complaints that fall within the overlapping jurisdiction of title I of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, to ensure that such complaints are dealt with in a manner that avoids duplication of effort and prevents the imposition of inconsistent or conflicting standards. Pursuant to this mandate, the Department of Justice and the EEOC are publishing a joint final rule implementing section 107(b) as it pertains to title I of the ADA and section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. In addition, this regulation describes the existing procedures for processing: Employment complaints that fall within the overlapping jurisdiction of title II of the ADA and either title I or section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, or both; and employment complaints that arise solely under title I or section 504. A joint final rule developed by the EEOC and the Department of Labor implementing section 107(b) as it pertains to title I and section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act has been published separately in the Federal Register of January 24, 1992. EFFECTIVE DATE: August 4, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Merrily A. Friedlander, Acting Chief, Coordination and Review Section, Civil Rights Division, U.S. Department of Justice, P.O.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Title I of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. 12111&hyph;12117, prohibits discrimination against qualified individuals with disabilities in all aspects of employment. Title I of the ADA became effective on July 26, 1992, with respect to employers with 25 or more employees. 42 U.S.C. 12111(5)(A). On July 26, 1994, this coverage will be extended to employers with 15 or more employees. Id. The EEOC is authorized to investigate and attempt to resolve charges of employment discrimination under title I. Subtitle A of title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. 12131&hyph;12134, prohibits discrimination against qualified individuals with disabilities on the basis of disability by State and local governmental entities in their services, programs, and activities, including employment. As of January 26, 1992, the effective date of title II, all State and local governmental entities, regardless of the number of persons they employ, were prohibited from discriminating on the basis of disability in employment. The Department of Justice has issued a regulation implementing title II, which provides that eight designated Federal agencies shall investigate and attempt to resolve complaints of discrimination under title II. Complaints that arise solely under title II are investigated by the designated agency most closely related to the functions exercised by the governmental component against which the complaint is lodged. See 28 CFR part 35 (56 FR 35694, July 26, 1991). Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, 29 U.S.C. 794, prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability (formerly, ``handicap'') in programs and activities receiving Federal financial assistance or conducted by any Executive agency. The nondiscrimination requirements of section 504 are applicable to employment in Federally-assisted programs. Each Federal agency that extends Federal financial assistance is responsible for compliance with section 504 in the programs it funds. More than twenty-five Federal agencies have issued regulations implementing section 504 for their Federally-assisted programs. These agencies are referred to in this rule as section 504 agencies.
