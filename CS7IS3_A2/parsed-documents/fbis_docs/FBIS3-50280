Above all, we think that their relevance also depends on their sponsors' obligation not to stray from the bounds defined in them in the future. A General Point of View (Introduction) The members of the local self-administrations, town and village mayors, and parliamentary deputies--the elected representatives of Hungarians in Slovakia--publish the following point of view from their assembly in Komarno on 8 January 1994: Following the political changes after November 1989, Hungarians in Slovakia manifested their support for political pluralism, parliamentary democracy, and the execution of the principle of self-administration in two parliamentary elections and in the elections to local representative bodies. The Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement-Egyutteles coalition currently has 14 deputies in the National Council of the Slovak Republic. These movements highlighted as a priority task in their election programs improving the legal status of Hungarians in Slovakia. There are 5,000 Hungarian deputies and roughly 400 Hungarian mayors in town and community self-administrations. According to the 1991 census, more than 600,000 inhabitants with Hungarian as their mother tongue live in Slovakia--that is, 11.5 percent of the total population. Members of the Hungarian community make up the majority in 437 towns and villages and account for 10-50 percent of the population in another 85 towns and villages. These 522 towns and villages are located in a continuous--compact--territory along the southern border of the Slovak Republic. Almost 98 percent of the Hungarians in Slovakia live on this territory and account for almost 70 percent of the population here. Apart from this, there is a sizable number--1,000-20,000--of Hungarians in another four cities. The sociological surveys that have been carried out regularly since October 1990 indicate that a high percentage of the Hungarian population in the Slovak Republic supports parliamentary democracy. Compared with the rest of the population, xenophobia and anti-Semitism are less characteristic among the Hungarians, and they also display the greatest tolerance toward other people. The attitude of Hungarians toward Slovaks is positive, and the sociological surveys show that the Slovaks who live among them feel the same. The participants in the assembly want in the future to enhance the community of Hungarians in Slovakia, and also the territories where Hungarians and Slovaks live together, on these foundations. The participants in the assembly realize that the basis for social peace, development, and human affluence is a peaceful relationship, regulated by law, between members of different nationalities. This is a prerequisite for ensuring that structural changes in policy and the economy take place as quickly as possible in Central Europe and that the countries of this region can integrate themselves into the European Union. Following the collapse of the communist system, the citizens and governments of the former communist states, as well as the whole of Europe, face new tasks: creating a new system for security and stability in Europe that would make it possible to forestall local and regional conflicts and also creating the basic prerequisites for expanding European integration toward the former communist countries. The Central European region is, among other things, characterized by biased attitudes and pent-up tension that could result in tragic conflicts. We will do all we can to ensure that such a conflict does not break out in the Carpathian basin. However, it is necessary to point out that it is also essential to deal with the ethnic problems here. In Slovakia, which gained its independence in 1993, this means that it is necessary to establish relations between Slovaks and Hungarians on new foundations. In the interest of this, it is necessary to create a new system for relations between Slovaks and Hungarians and to adopt new laws. The measures adopted by the government so far have contributed to worsening mutual relations. The new system of relations should strengthen the basic pillars of democracy: the system of self-administrations, a law-governed state, and a constitutional-legal status for the ethnic communities. The participants in the assembly therefore express their point of view on three fundamental issues. The Constitutional and Legal Status of Hungarians The participants in the assembly assert that the Hungarian population in Slovakia, despite some repression and pressure under the totalitarian regime and after World War II and other attempts to ethnically homogenize the population, has maintained its ability to express again its political subjectivity, to organize its community, and to preserve the original settlement structure on the territories where it has lived for thousands of years as an autochthonous community and, in most cases, has also formed the majority of the local population. Proceeding from this, the Hungarian population in Slovakia defines itself as a national community resolved to struggle to ensure that, apart from the individual rights that should pertain to everyone, its community rights are recognized and that its status as a community is enshrined in the Constitution. At the same time, they proceed from the UN resolution according to which the right of individuals and collectives to preserve their own identity is one of the basic human rights. Their conviction that political and cultural self-identification and self-determination within the framework of the state is a basic right of the Hungarian national community is inherent in this. The participants in the assembly proclaim the following: For the development of the ethnic Hungarian community in Slovakia, it is essential that: --In places where Hungarians account for at least 10 percent of the population, they can use their mother tongue, orally and in writing, in contacts with state bodies or, as the case may be, in public administration and have a right to the designation of public areas and to public information in Hungarian. --In places where Hungarians make up the majority of the population, Hungarian is the official language alongside Slovak. --The Slovak Republic signs and ratifies the European Charter on Regional or Minority Languages. --The representation of Hungarians in state bodies and public institutions corresponds to their number. --The Hungarian community receives a fair allocation from the state budget or, alternatively, from the budget for self-administrations in accordance with its size. The participants in the assembly proclaim that Hungarians in Slovakia, proceeding from the principle of civic equality: --Want to establish the Slovak Republic along with the Slovak people as an equal community. --Want, in accordance with the draft constitutional law prepared by deputies from the Hungarian coalition, to express their political subjectivity via their own representative bodies that will evolve from democratic elections. --Demand, in the interest of maintaining their own identity, the recognition of a special legal status for the territory where a considerable number of Hungarians live. The participants in the assembly express their conviction that one of the fundamental elements of equality is thorough adherence to the principle of mutuality. This means that, in regions, towns, or communities in which members of one nationality or inhabitants with the same mother tongue are in the minority, they have a legally guaranteed right to an education in their mother tongue, a right to use their mother tongue, and the right to acquire and disseminate information in their mother tongue. As far as these rights are concerned, the given community should have the right of agreement in relation to the regional self-administration and the state administration. This means that it should not be possible to make a decision on these issues without the agreement of this community. The participants in the assembly proclaim that implementing these principles within the Slovak Republic, an equivalent status for the Hungarian national community and the Slovak nation with respect to its state-forming capacity and the application of rights serves to bolster the statehood and territorial integrity of the Slovak Republic and to create a democratic law-governed state. The Jurisdiction of the Self-Administrations The participants in the assembly realize that one of the basic pillars of a law-governed state is a system of self-administrations equipped with broad powers; this is a framework in which citizens have an opportunity to democratically express their will and to oversee the implementation of their interests and respect for human rights and freedoms. The participants in the assembly state that the rights of the self-administrations in the Slovak Republic are inadequate. The development of the self-administrations comes up against obstacles, their rights are deliberately curtailed, central power is being increased to the detriment of the self-administrations, and the bodies of the state administration are being given superiority over them. The chapter in the Slovak Constitution on territorial self-administrations (Articles 64-71) contains only general statements. These principles may thus manifest themselves in a completely distorted manner both in laws and in practice. The participants in the assembly consider it essential that the powers of the self-administrations be unequivocally defined by law--that is, that a territorial system be created within whose framework a self-administration's bodies will run their affairs by utilizing the predominant part of the taxes according to the values produced on the given territory and will guarantee the democratic self-regulation and self-administration of the local population. In the interest of this: 1. The Slovak Republic should sign as soon as possible the agreement on affiliation to the European Charter on Local Self- Administrations. The basic ideas behind it are as follows: increasing democracy, decentralizing power, subsidiarity, and the sworn and public acceptance of undertakings by the contracting parties. 2. The declaration on affiliation to the European Charter on Local Self-Administrations should contain at least 20 points from Article 12, among which should feature the following--to us--important points: --Article 2, enshrining the rights of the local self-administrations in the Constitution and laws. --Article 3, Paragraph 1, dealing with the overwhelming majority of public issues at a local level. --Article 4, Paragraph 3, the body that is territorially closest to the citizen should be responsible for dealing with public matters. --Article 4, Paragraph 4, complete and exclusive authority for the local bodies. --Article 5, the unchangeability of the self-administration's borders without the agreement of the population. --Article 8, Paragraph 1, supervision of the activity of self-administrations should be regulated by law. --Article 9, Paragraph 2, the appropriate financial cover for their activity in harmony with their powers. --Article 10, Paragraph 1, the right of the self-administrations to form associations. --Article 10, Paragraph 2, the right of the self-administrations to join international associations. --Article 11, protection of the free execution of rights should be guaranteed by the courts. 3. In the interest of legal certitude, the following should be itemized in the Constitution: the system of self-administrations, their jurisdiction and authority, or, alternatively, their unalterability by means of other legal norms. 4. The following should be expressed in the Constitution in detail: the system of self-administrations, their jurisdiction and authority. 5. Before the implementation of the new system for the country's territorial-administrative division, it is necessary to create, in accordance with Chapter 2, Article 64 of the Slovak Republic Constitution, larger territorial units, on the basis of a voluntary association of self-administrations, that will come under the jurisdiction of the future territorial self-administrations. At the same time, it is necessary to respect Council of Europe recommendation No. 1201. 6. In harmony with Chapter 3, Article 4 of the European Charter on Local Self-Administrations, it is necessary to constitutionally outline the complete and exclusive powers of the self-administrations. Thus, it is necessary to guarantee that these powers cannot be curbed by regulations from central or regional bodies. 7. In the interest of decentralizing power, rationalizing the state administration, and increasing responsibility beneficial to the public by transferring power from state administration bodies to the self-administrations, it is necessary to bring administration closer to the citizen and to expand the constitutional authority of the self-administrations, especially in the spheres of education, culture, health care, public safety, and the environment. 8. It is also necessary to coordinate the material, economic, and financial conditions necessary for the self-administrations' functioning with the powers and responsibility of the self-administrations. All of the property and real estate located in the community should be ceded to the local self-administration in cases where the owner is not known. From the point of view of establishing a democratic legal order, legal certitude, and a law-governed state, we consider it expedient--respectively, executable and necessary in the interest of stability--for the National Council to adopt laws on the self-administrations with a three-fifths majority. In the case of the self-administrations of the (ethnic) minorities, they should be guaranteed the right to veto the execution of rulings that are disadvantageous to them, since so-called numerical democracy, by its very essence, cannot guarantee the widespread execution of the interests of those in the minority. The Administrative Reorganization of Slovakia The assembly participants take the following as their point of departure: --The state forms the framework for the realization and protection of fundamental human rights and freedoms. --The territorial and administrative arrangement in the country should be based on an integral system of the execution of public administration, and the most important elements of the arrangement are the following: a decentralized state administration, economy of the administration, and service to the principal interests of the citizens. The assembly participants believe that the present system of public administration in the Slovak Republic conforms to neither the European requirements nor the requirements of the local population because it is uneconomical and heavy-handed, with an overgrown bureaucracy; the decisionmaking process is very complicated; and its powers are not clearly defined. The distribution of power among the bodies of the state administration and the local self-governing administrations is not rational. The system of territorially integrated state administration authorities with definite powers conflicts with local interests. The government has been planning a reorganization of the public administration system since 1990. Attempts at decentralization were initially made within the framework of this plan. Today, however, the centralization tendencies, which serve the interests of the central power, are again gaining in prominence. The assembly participants declare the following: 1. The proposal made by the government does not suit most local self-governing administrations in Slovakia. For the Hungarian community, this plan is unacceptable, in addition to the general objections, because the region inhabited by the Hungarian community would be divided into five administrative sections, and that would result in a complete marginality of the Hungarians, which in turn would render a solution to the actual problems impossible. This would facilitate organized assimilation. 2. When constituting administrative regions and bodies of state administration in the country, it is necessary to build on the principle of legal security guarantees and a two-tier system of public administration. 3. The new public administration structure must be formed, while respecting the principle that public affairs should be managed by a body that is territorially closest to the citizens. In present-day Slovakia, this means that, in addition to the self-governing administrations, the first tier of the state administration should be constituted on the territory of the already existing (or similar) domains of the state administration. The first tier of the state administration should receive all such administrative powers as needed to deal with all official business in the given region, including the transfer of powers from the present authorities with specific powers. Concurrently, it is necessary to close down the present district offices of the state administration. 4. When creating the second tier of the administrative regions and bodies of the state administration, it is necessary to build on the principle that they are to be constituted within the framework of the territorial units that arose by a voluntary integration of the (local) self-governing administrations. 5. The reorganization of the territorial arrangement and the state administration should respect the fundamental interests of the Hungarian national community: --That its region of habitation is not divided among several constitutional units, in which the Hungarian community would become a marginal minority, without any chance of promoting its interests, and would not have the opportunity to participate in dealing with matters that concern it. --Such a constitutional arrangement is acceptable for the Hungarian national community, as long as it does not assume the position of a minority (in terms of strength) in the territories on which many of its members live. --That Article 11 of Recommendation No. 1201 by the Parliamentary Assembly of the European Council be observed in the territorial and administrative reorganization, according to which: In the areas where the members of ethnic minorities live in significant numbers, they have the right to special a legal status or to local or autonomous bodies of public administration, which correspond to the historical and local specific features of the given community and are in harmony with the legislation of the given state. The legitimacy of these demands is confirmed by the following data: According to the 1991 census, the cities and villages populated by members of the Hungarian national community in Slovakia can be put into three categories: a) Majority regions: cities and villages in which Hungarians form at least 50 percent of the population. There are 432 cities and villages with 437,727 inhabitants of Hungarian nationality in this category. b) Minority regions: cities and villages in which the share of Hungarians is over 10 percent but less than 50 percent. There are 90 cities and villages (the Hungarians live in a relative majority in five of them) in this category, with 83,125 inhabitants of Hungarian nationality . c) Regions in which Hungarians live dispersed: cities and villages in which the share of Hungarians does not reach 10 percent but their absolute number exceeds 100 people. There are 28 cities and villages (the number of Hungarians is 39,519) in this category, while, in four cities (Bratislava, Kosice, Nitra, Velky Krtis), 1,000-20,000 Hungarians live. The assembly participants propose the following: 1. The second-tier public administration should conform to the territorial entities that emerge from the voluntary association of the cities and villages of categories a) and b) (majority and minority regions). We believe that there are two feasible solutions: a) To form one homogeneous territorial administrative entity--region: from the territory below Bratislava as far as Kosice, and then, after a short interruption, southern Zemplin and the area between Uh and Latorica (Medzibodrozie). There are 511 cities and villages in this area with a population of 824,946, of which 507,073 are Hungarians (61.46 percent). b) To form three administrative entities--regions: from Bratislava to Sahy: population of 526,620, of which 331,704 are inhabitants of Hungarian nationality (66.11 percent), 250 cities and villages--southern Zemplin and the area between Uh and Latorica: population of 58,985, of which 45,576 are inhabitants of Hungarian nationality (77.27 percent), 53 cities and villages. The Hungarian linguistic island below Nitra should form a special territory (first tier administrative region) formed of 18 communities with the Hungarian population 12,895 (51 percent of the total) strong. 2. At the offices within the framework of the first- and second-tier administrative units with special powers, formed according to the aforementioned principle, the law should guarantee the possibility of dealing with official matters in both languages orally or in writing. 3. From the vantage point of the authority and powers, the system of institutions in the framework of the territorial and administrative entities should be compatible throughout Slovakia. The territories inhabited by Hungarians or by members of other national minorities, however, should form an exception and have special legal status. The assembly participants consider it necessary that the aforementioned principles and views be implemented in the territorial and administrative reorganization of the country. It would contribute to the reinforcement of the inner stability and social peace. The Possibilities for the Economic Development of the Self-Administrative Regions The structural changes in the economy and the transition to a market economy have highlighted the economic differences between the individual regions. During the past four years, some regions have found themselves in a severe economic crisis and have major problems with unemployment. The area of South Slovakia inhabited by Hungarians is also among these regions. The unemployment level here far exceeds the nationwide average and, what is more, districts with a Hungarian population are among the areas with the highest level of unemployment. According to the official figures, the level of unemployment in Slovakia on 31 October 1993 was 13.8 percent. However, on the same date, the unemployment level in the Dunajska Streda District was 20.1 percent. It was 19.2 percent in Galanta; 21.0 percent in the Komarno District; 20.8 percent in Kosice-Environs; 15.5 percent in the Levice District; 19.0 percent in the Lucenec District; 17.5 percent in the Nove Zamky District; 23.7 percent in the Rimavska Sobota District; 21.3 percent in the Roznava District; 19.0 percent in the Trebisov District; and 19.8 percent in the Velky Krtis District. One of the main reasons for the economic problems in territories with a Hungarian population is the one-track branch-by-branch structure [jednostranna odvetvova struktura]. The economy of this territory is determined by agriculture and by the services linked to it, to a degree, by the food industry; all of these are considered to be crisis branches. The one-track branch-by-branch structure of the economy in these territories is the result of Czech economic policy during the First Republic. In addition to this, in the 1950's--at the beginning of Slovakia's industrialization--only rarely were industrial enterprises founded on these territories and, from the ecological point of view, the new plants mostly had an negative impact. Plants such as, for example, the Duslo chemical plant in Sala, the paper plant in Sturovo, the nuclear power plant in Mochovce, the hydroelectricity plant in Gabcikovo, or the heating plant in Vojany. Responsibility for the economic stagnation or, rather, the economic decline on these territories is borne by the Czechoslovak state and the Slovak political leadership. To rectify these mistakes, it is necessary for these regions to become regions with an independent administration. In this way, their population will finally have an opportunity to control the economic development of their own region in accordance with their own economic policy, and, at the same time, they will also be responsible for it. Autonomy for the self-administrative regions is relative; it may exist within broad limits: from a formal self-administration to a factual self-administration, which means the possibility of independent decisionmaking in important issues affecting life within the given region. Of course, the aim is to achieve factual autonomy--that is, self-administrations in the broadest sense of the word, self-administrations in which there are great opportunities to develop the economy, politics, culture, education, and ecology on the territory of the given region. It is necessary to emphasize: If, on the territories with a predominantly Hungarian population, we demand the creation of regions with their own self-administration, this does not mean that we would want to isolate ourselves from the Slovak economy. What we intend by the better utilization of what we have and the comparative advantages of the individual regions is to strengthen the national economy of the whole of Slovakia. From the economic point of view, the creation of these regions is important because it makes it possible: --To draft and implement regional programs and concepts for economic development that accept and utilize the comparative advantages of the individual regions and lead to the elimination of the current one-track branch-by-branch structure. --To attract foreign capital and organize foreign development programs. --To sign agreements on regional cooperation with regions in the country and outside it. --To introduce regional and local taxes as a backup for that apportionment of state taxes it is possible to utilize for regional development. --To utilize financial sources (funds) provided from the state budget for the development of the given region. It is particularly necessary to mention the institutional possibilities for regional economic development. These are: --Regional chambers of trade and industry. --Regional specialist associations. --Regional banks and insurance companies. --Regional institutions for economic development (offices, agencies). Regional economic development can only be successful if we understand that this is a long-term process and we approach it accordingly, if we implement it with commitment, if the organizers are personally interested in it, if it is based on discovering and using the internal potential and comparative advantages of the regions, and if the development strategy is adapted systematically to potential and needs. An organic element of the political and economic changes at the moment is the redivision of Slovakia into administrative and self-administrative units. In the new territorial division, it is unnecessary to proceed in accordance with the principle of divide et impera, but it is necessary to create viable units so that the whole--the country--is also enhanced. This aim may be achieved by creating regions while taking into consideration historical traditions, natural regional units, and economic potential so that the energy of sound local patriotism, the cohesive strength of the inhabitants of the given region, and their endeavor for self-realization, their instinct to establish their right to existence, and their desire to achieve success are all utilized.
