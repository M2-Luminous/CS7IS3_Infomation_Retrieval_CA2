Zieleniec said this shift was the result of the diplomatic attempts of the Czech Republic and other countries. The political dimension, above all, of the project is now very noticeable. It is emphasized that its aim is to extend the community of nations holding the same values, which is specified in the project in some detail. "This enables a European security system to be built on values which we share, on the protection of our way of life. This is the most essential part of the alliance," he said. He also pointed out that the project stressed the individual approach of each country in the space allowed, which was logical as it led to differentiation and not to the formation of further groupings. From the interviews which he had had with Foreign Ministers Olechowski, Moravcik and Jeszenszky, it seemed that this awareness was beginning to predominate among the states of central Europe. This meant that awareness of individual countries' responsibility was becoming fundamental, as was responsibility for political and economic stability within each country. Under today's conditions, this was the most important security consideration. Zieleniec said. This had been helped by yesterday's meeting of foreign ministers with American Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who saw things almost identically. Asked if during the discussions any criticism of the Czech Republic's individual approach to NATO had been voiced, especially by Poland, Zieleniec said he believed the Polish position was the result of a certain nervousness and also of differences between individual Polish politicians. Zieleniec quoted the Polish Foreign Minister as saying after today's meeting that both parties now shared the same opinion.
