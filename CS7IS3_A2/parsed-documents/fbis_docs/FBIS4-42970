Kasoulidhis said it is important to note that Butrus-Ghali describes occupied Cyprus as one of the most highly militarized areas in the world in terms of the ratio between numbers of troops and civilian population. He added that a positive point is that the UN secretary general explicitly rejected Turkish claims that our side creates tension along the confrontation zone.
