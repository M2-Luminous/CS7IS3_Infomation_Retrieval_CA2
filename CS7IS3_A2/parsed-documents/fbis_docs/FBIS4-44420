The excerpts of the communique reads as follows: The work concerning labor is aimed at cultivating and developing the labor market, further reforming the labor, wage and social security systems, improving all types of reform measures in a comprehensive way and attaining new achievements. However, the 1993 situation was grim in ensuring safe production. The number of labor disputes increased greatly, and the rate of unemployment also rose. All this merits our attention. I. Labor Employment China's labor force totalled 820 million in 1993, and those with employment amounted to 605.9 million, up 11.58 million over 1992, of whom the number of wage-earners totalled 276.95 million accounting for 45.7 percent of the total number of employees. Among the wage earners, 150.4 million worked in cities and townships; 3.1 million worked in the private sector; and 123.45 worked in rural enterprises. Among the urban workers, 110.94 million worked in state-run units, an increase of 2.05 million; 36.03 million worked in urban collectively owned units, a decrease of 180,000; and 3.43 million worked in other economic sectors, up 610,000 as compared with the end of 1992. In 1993, there were 11.47 million people seeking jobs in urban areas throughout the country, and 7.05 million of them found employment. At the end of 1993, 4.2 million of them were still unemployed with a rate of unemployment of 2.6 percent. Among those who found jobs, 3.1 million worked in state-run units, 2.02 million in urban collectively run economic units, and 980,000 in various units in other economic sectors. The number of self-employed laborers totalled 950,000. Enterprises in the service trades which hire many laborers flourished while consolidating themselves. There are 200,000 such enterprises which hired 9.15 million laborers. Their total output value reached 160 billion yuan. They delivered taxes and profits of 12 billion yuan to the state treasury, and gave jobs to 1.196 million jobless and surplus laborers. At the end of 1993, 18,000 employment agencies were set up in 28 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities under the direct administration of the central government, of which 15,000 were set up by labor departments. The labor system reform with labor contracts signed by all the workers for the firm establishment of labor relations had developed in an overall manner from the experimental stage. At the end of 1993, the number of workers in state and collectively run enterprises in the country who had participated in the labor system reform had reached 55 million, of whom 31 percent of the total number of enterprise workers or 35 million were under the labor contract system. The labor system reform was promoted in an overall manner in 200 cities and counties throughout China. The reform of the labor contract system was basically completed in Jilin Province and in Shenzhen, Zhuzhou, Yancheng, Anyang and other cities. While promoting the labor system reform, various localities always attached importance to allocating jobs to surplus personnel laid off by enterprises. In 1993, 1.25 million surplus workers found jobs. II. Wage Distribution Workers' wages were further raised. In 1993, the total amount of wages earned by urban workers throughout the country reached 477 billion yuan, up 21.1 percent over 1992. An average worker earned 3,236 yuan year, up 19.4 percent over 1992. The actual rate of growth was 2.8 percent if the factor of inflation was taken into consideration. An average worker in a state-run unit earned 3,441 yuan a year, up 19.6 percent over 1992. With the enterprises changing the way they operated and the system of wage distribution constantly under reform, 18,000 enterprises and 14 million workers had carried out experiments in implementing the job-skill wage system at the end of 1993. As for the macro-control over the labor force and wages, a flexible wage system was adopted in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities under the direct administration of the central government and cities with provincial-level economic decision-making authority in the country by the end of 1993. In addition, the Ministry of Labor also sent a flexible wage control plan to 11 districts to exercise flexible control over some ministries and commissions and corporations. As a result, the state had further strengthened its control over the total amount of wages to workers. The actual growth rate of the total amount of workers' wages rose 4.3 percent in 1993, which was lower than the 13.4 percent rate of growth of the GNP. The actual average worker's wage rose 2.8 percent, lower than the 10.9 percent growth rate of the social labor productivity. This conformed with the principle of the "two lower's." III. Social Security In 1993, the nation received 46.1 billion yuan of social insurance funds (funds raised by various sectors themselves not included), and paid off 41.9 billion yuan to beneficiaries with a carry-over balance of 28.8 billion yuan (including special state bonds purchased) of which the state received 44 billion yuan basic old-age pension funds and paid off 40.8 billion yuan to old-age pensioners with a carry-over balance of 24.5 billion yuan. At the end of 1993, 618 cities and counties in the country carried out reform in providing basic old-age pensions to 25 million workers who worked for state-run enterprises. The amount of mutual assistance funds for retirees further increased. At the end of 1993, 13 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities under the direct administration of the central government had helped raise pension funds. In addition to the state-owned enterprises which had already been raising their own pension funds in various cities and counties throughout the country, 1,927 cities and counties had developed the program for urban mutual assistance retirement funds, an increase of 168 over 1992. In the whole country, 590,000 enterprises and 73.36 million workers had participated in the program to collect mutual assistance retirement funds. Meanwhile, 3,100 enterprises had participated in the supplementary program for old-age pension insurance, involving 500,000 people. Over 6,000 enterprises participated in the old-age pension insurance program in the form of individual savings with 700,000 participants. Some 1,000 cities and counties paid pensions through banks or social insurance organizations. In China, 11 million people in 500 cities and counties in 19 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities under the direct administration of the central government participated in the industrial injury insurance reform, an increase of 140 cities and counties than in 1992. Some 260,000 workers in 221 cities and counties made contributions to mutual assistance funds to defray medical expenses for workers' major illnesses; and 280,000 retirees in 134 cities and counties also made contributions to mutual assistance funds for their own medical care. Coverage of unemployment insurance was further expanded, and the system gradually improved. By the end of 1993, 79.24 million workers in 532,000 enterprises participated in the unemployment insurance program. In 1993, unemployment insurance funds of 1.63 billion yuan were collected, and 930 million yuan were paid for unemployment, medical expenses during the period of unemployment, job training and the participation in the self-relief through production program. The labor departments in various localities provided unemployment relief funds for 1.03 million people who lost their jobs, playing a positive role in stabilizing the society. New progress was made in reforming the childbirth insurance system. By the end of 1993, the system of childbirth insurance for woman workers was instituted in 268 cities and counties, marking an increase of 170 over 1992 and covering 5.5 million workers. IV. Safe Production The situation in safe production was grim in 1993. The number of accidents and injuries increased on a large scale. This merits our attention. In 1993, 19,798 workers died of industrial injuries in various enterprises throughout the country, up 18.5 percent over 1992. There were 616 incidents leaving three or more people dead in each case and causing 3,819 deaths in total. The number of incidents and deaths in 1993 was 6.2 percent and 3.8 percent respectively higher than that in 1992. During the incidents in which workers died of industrial injuries, there were 9,112 mining incidents, leaving 10,883 workers dead. As compared with 1992, the number of incidents and deaths rose by 48 percent and 12.4 percent respectively. The number of highway incidents remained high in 1993. There were 242,343 traffic accidents leaving 63,508 people dead and 142,251 people injured and causing direct economic losses of 1 billion yuan. There were 38,094 fire hazards in the country during 1993, leaving 2,467 people dead, an increase of 27.4 percent over 1992. The fire hazards caused economic losses of 1.12 billion yuan (damages caused by forest fire not included), up 62.3 percent over 1992. There were 3,175 train accidents in 1993, causing economic losses of 46.781 million yuan, a drop of 9.2 percent over 1992.

In 1993, enterprises in the shipping industry under the administration of the Ministry of Communications, freighters of the local transportation departments and the freighters and ferry boats in rural areas had 2,008 general accidents, marking a drop of 18.4 percent and leaving 557 people dead, about the same level as in 1992. Thirty seven ships sank, a drop of 2.3 percent, and the accidents caused economic losses of 147 million yuan, an increase of 13.2 percent over 1992. In 1993, China's civil aviation industry reported three incidents of the first grade and two incidents of the second grade in transport flights. It reported two incidents of the first grade and two incidents of the second grade in general flights. Development of Vocational Skills In 1993, the number of schools for the training of technicians increased to 4,477, up 85 over 1992. The schools had a total of 664,000 students (57,000 students in rural areas) with 171,700 boarding students and 335,000 faculty members. There were 2,525 job training centers in the country, an increase of 106 over 1992. New progress was made in training armymen to do civilian work. In 1993, 276,000 armymen were trained to do civilian work, an increase of 40.8 percent or 80,000 over 1992. During 1993, the nation hired 340,000 technicians and senior technicians. Arbitration of Labor Disputes and Labor Supervision With the continuous reform of the labor system, the system in handling labor disputes is getting better and better. In 1993, the labor dispute arbitration committees at all levels handled 12,358 cases involving labor disputes, up 51.6 percent over 1992. These cases involved 34,794 workers, an increase of 99.8 percent. They also handled 684 cases involving collective labor disputes, an increase of 24.8 percent over 1992. These cases involved 19,468 workers, up 113.9 percent over 1992. The work for labor supervision was further improved. Labor supervisory organs were set up in 16 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities under the direct administration of the central government and in some regions. A system wherein the masses might report cases involving illegal labor employment activities was established. Extensive checkups were carried out on all forms of labor employment. Social Labor Productivity China's GNP totalled 3.138 trillion yuan in 1993, up 13.4 percent over 1992. The social labor productivity in 1993 calculated on the basis of the GNP rose by 10.9 percent over 1992. Note: The labor force resource was calculated in accordance with the new specification. It referred to those who were 16 year-old and older people (excluding those who were unable to work and the convicts in prison).
