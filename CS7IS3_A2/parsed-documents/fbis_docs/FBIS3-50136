Blendi Fevziu opened the news conference and read a press communique from the party presidency. The communique stated that the murder of Gjovalin Cekini on 14 January marked the tragic culmination of the state's campaign to obstruct by any means the party's political activity. Gjovalin Cekini was a participant in the first anticommunist demonstrations in Albania. The murder of this AD activist was political, the communique continued, describing the murder and citing evidence relating to it. One of the culprits in the murder, Selami Cela, emerged from a Mercedes without license plates a few minutes before the end of the Shkoder meeting and spoke to a person who was in the car of Ali Kazazi, the Shkoder Democratic Party [PD] chairman. A second person involved in the murder was one of the many PD provocateurs in the hall where the AD's meeting took place. Gjovalin Cekini was one of the leading activists of the AD during the meeting, helping to defuse the tensions caused by the PD provocateurs. Selami Cela was foremost among the provocateurs facing the people who emerged from the meeting and shouted "Long live Sali Berisha: There is only the PD in Shkoder." Gjovalin Cekini and his brother Pal tried to prevent Selami Cela from using his weapon. The communique went on to state that this murder marked an extreme escalation of the war on the AD and was motivated by the fact that some state officials and members of the ruling party have embarked on the road of crime to fulfill and protect their political and economic interests. For this purpose, they are organizing themselves with the help of Mafia-style structures and activities involving high level officials of the Albanian state, members of the National Intelligence Service, local government officials, professional criminals, traffickers in oil and weapons, violators of the UN embargo against the former Yugoslavia, and members of the Privatization Board or those who have profited or expect to profit illegally from the board. All these control and have taken hostage Shkoder's political and economic life, joined in a criminal association. As for the statement of the Ministry of Public Order broadcast on Albanian Television yesterday, the communique declared that this statement associated itself with the crime and made political judgments that are in flagrant contravention of the status of a depoliticized television station. This statement differed from that issued earlier by stressing the word "citizen" instead of the word "murderer" used before. The communique called on the PD, the government, and the president to identify and condemn the culprits fairly and fast, and to identify, isolate, and condemn the mafia-style criminal elements, so that crime and violence may not become a characteristic of the first opposition party in Albania, which rose up against crime and violence. In conclusion, the communique stated that the AD appeals to the governments of European countries and the United States, the Council of Europe, the CSCE, and the Helsinki Community, asking them to use their authority to intervene to ensure that the tragic murder in Shkoder should not become a precedent for a state of violence and terror. Messrs. Neritan Ceka and Arben Imami then replied to the questions of the journalists present. The questions mainly concerned the recent incident in Shkoder, but there were also others off the subject, to which the speakers did not reply. Asked by KOHA JONE about the recent incident's similarity to the events of 2 April [1991] in Shkoder, Neritan Ceka replied that these two events bore a similarity. This shows the similarity between the regimes, he said, evident in the statement of the Public Order Ministry and its collaboration with the procurator. He went on to say that there are further similarities, because both events made use of armed irregulars [bashibozuko] because the politicians threw stones and then covered their tracks, and because the Public Order Ministry officials and those of the Procurator's Office have learned nothing from the fate of their colleagues of 2 April. There are similarities, because both events have their origins in hatred, with the difference that in the first case this hatred was ideological and in the second economic. Both cases involve a collaboration between the politics and crime. Only a dictatorship can be built on the basis of a mafia and of crime. If the Albanians live with this kind of collaboration for two years, there will then be no elections. One question was what will the AD's strategy be if the Public Order Ministry persists in the same standpoint. Ceka replied that we only have one strategy, which is democracy. Answering a question from RlLlNDJA DEMOKRATlKE's journalist, who said that this event could not favor the PD, Mr. Imami replied that he was not sure to whose favor it went, but it is the third occasion in Shkoder on which there has been an attempt to sow terror. The first was the incident with the Socialists; the second involved Azem Hajdari and the New Political Initiative, and the third was this case involving ourselves, which ended with a tragic murder. He stressed that it was the same group attempting to sow terror. In every district, we have encountered PD members who have turned on us with such methods. Imami went on to mention an incident in Durres, in which a person's two trucks had been held by the customs, and the PD's people had asked this person to go to the AD's meeting and shout against the AD, so that his trucks would be released. You, Mr. Paloka, Imami continued, contributed your piece in yesterday's article in which you said that one of the murderers was in the meeting hall. I can add that they later met together in the cafe of the main hotel. Asked if the incident was connected with the embargo, Imami said that the AD was not the first to denounce the embargo, and we are not talking about 30-40 liters, about about a pipe linking the two banks of the Buna and a truck with a big "Marshallah" plate that plies round Shkoder. We accuse people who are vested with power, perhaps with connections to the very summit of power, of breaking the embargo. In connection with the pro-Serb declaration cited by the Public Order Ministry statement, Imami stated that this was an utter lie. The AD went to Shkoder to start the political new year on 14 January, the anniversary of the first anticommunist demonstration in Albania, a large number of whose participants are now AD members. Gjovalin Cekini was one of the participants in this demonstration, and one of the missionaries of the Catholic church and of religious belief. We went to Shkoder in order to put forward our ideas and our program. We were asked, "Why did you go to Belgrade?" We explained our platform and standpoint on this matter, our standpoint on Kosova, etc. As for the statement that we have neither killed Serbs, nor have they killed us, this is simply a lie perpetrated by the police authorities. Imami underlined that RILINDJA of 16 January on page 11 states that the AD is putting its political views on the market, and he continued, "The fact is that the Serbs and the Albanians have killed and murdered each other, but have not wiped each other out; thus it is normal to start a dialogue." In other words, our statement in Shkoder was quite the opposite to what was alleged by RILINDJA DEMOKRATlKE and the Public Order Ministry statement. I also possess a recorded cassette of this, Imami concluded in reply to this question. Neritan Ceka, asked if the AD discerned anybody responsible for this incident, replied that this question should be put to Sali Berisha, president of the Republic, who had warned the socialists in connection with the earlier incident in Shkoder with the words "What did the Socialists want in Shkoder?" The president would have done well to have asked "What do the Motionists [mocioniste, parliamentary group that founded the AD] want in Shkoder?" before this putsch in Shkoder was organized. Among the many replies given by Messrs. Ceka and Imami, we would single out the answer concerning the meeting of the AD deputies with the general director of the republic's police and the leading police officers of Shkoder, who told the deputies that they were "concerned about extinguishing religious conflict in Shkoder," a strange statement to emerge from a news conference given by AD leaders. The AD leaders said that the motive behind the Public Order Ministry's statements was to confuse the public. We would also single out Imami's statement that he had told the spokesman of this ministry to look for and find former Sigurimi collaborators from the head of state downwards. In connection with the AD's demands for cooperation with the PD, Ceka said among other things: Return the money of Arsidi and Zhulali to the Albanian State Bank; denounce the Islamic pact and Albania's adherence to it; and seriously fight against corruption and political crime. In reply to a somewhat obscure question from an ATA journalist, Ceka replied, "We are merely pleased that ATA takes an interest in the AD. So much nonsense is talked about it...." In conclusion, the chairman of the news conference gave the floor to Neritan Ceka, who said, "I will tell you something. The AD is not made up of men who are frightened." Let me say, and let people realize clearly, that "Albania cannot become Palermo, and there is no turning back." That is all I have to say. We emphasize that the news conference aroused great interest and passed without incident, in order to scotch rumors circulating yesterday about alleged incidents during the news conference. At the news conference, an AD member, a participant in the Shkoder meeting and one of the organizers of the first anticommunist demonstration, published in the conference hall the names of Gjovalin Cekini's murderers, including that of Selami Cela, who has often been mentioned recently in Shkoder, as well as in Public Order Ministry statements.
