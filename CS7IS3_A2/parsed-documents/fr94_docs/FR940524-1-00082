FR940524-1-00082 FR940524-1-00010 §84.201 Head harnesses; minimum requirements. (a) (1) Facepieces for chemical cartridge respirators other than single-use vinyl chloride shall be equipped with adjustable and replaceable head harnesses designed and constructed to provide adequate tension during use and an even distribution of pressure over the entire area in contact with the face. (2) Facepieces for single-use vinyl chloride respirators shall be equipped with adjustable head harnesses designed and constructed to provide adequate tension during use and an even distribution of pressure over the entire area in contact with the face. (b) Mouthpieces shall be equipped where applicable, with an adjustable and replaceable harness designed and constructed to hold the mouthpiece in place. §84.202 Air velocity and noise levels; hoods and helmets; minimum requirements. Noise levels generated by the respirator will be measured inside the hood or helmet at maximum airflow obtainable and shall not exceed 80 dBA. §84.203 Breathing resistance test; minimum requirements. (a) Resistance to airflow will be measured in the facepiece, mouthpiece, hood, or helmet of a chemical cartridge respirator mounted on a test fixture with air flowing at a continuous rate of 85 liters per minute, both before and after each test conducted in accordance with §§84.206 through 84.207. (b) The maximum allowable resistance requirements for chemical cartridge respirators are as follows: Maximum Resistance [Millimeter water column height] 1Type of chemical-cartridge respirator 1Inhalation 2Initial 2Final1 1Exhalation Other than single-use vinyl chloride respirators: For gases, vapors, or gases and vapors 40 45 20 For gases, vapors, or gases and vapors, and particulates 50 70 20 Single-use respirator with valves: For vinyl chloride 20 25 20 For vinyl chloride and particulates 30 45 20 Single-use respirator without valves: For vinyl chloride 15 20 (2) For vinyl chloride and particulates 25 40 (2) 1Measured at end of service life specified in Table 11 of this subpart. 2Same as inhalation. §84.204 Exhalation valve leakage test; minimum requirements. (a) Dry exhalation valves and valve seats will be subjected to a suction of 25 mm. water-column height while in a normal operating position. (b) Leakage between the valve and valve seat shall not exceed 30 milliliters per minute. §84.205 Facepiece test; minimum requirements. (a) The complete chemical cartridge respirator will be fitted to the faces of persons having varying facial shapes and sizes. (b) Where the applicant specifies a facepiece size or sizes for the respirator together with the approximate measurement of faces they are designed to fit, the Institute will provide test subjects to suit such facial measurements. (c) Any chemical cartridge respirator part which must be removed to perform the facepiece or mouthpiece fit test shall be replaceable without special tools and without disturbing facepiece or mouthpiece fit. (d) The facepiece or mouthpiece fit test using the positive or negative pressure recommended by the applicant and described in his instructions will be used before each test. (e) (1) Each wearer will enter a chamber containing 100 p.p.m. isoamyl acetate vapor for half-mask facepieces, and 1,000 p.p.m. for full facepieces, mouthpieces, hoods, and helmets. (2) The facepiece or mouthpiece may be adjusted, if necessary, in the test chamber before starting the test. (3) Each wearer will remain in the chamber for 8 minutes while performing the following activities: (i) Two minutes, nodding and turning head; (ii) Two minutes, calisthenic arm movements;
