Although this round of talks might also end without reaching agreement Chiao said at the airport, "The increase in mutual trust is a positive development." Chiao's meeting with Tang, vice chairman and secretary-general of the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), was arranged based on an accord reached during the talks between SEF Chairman Ku Chen-fu and ARATS Chairman Wang Daohan last April in Singapore. The accord calls for quarterly meetings between SEF and ARATS officials of the deputy secretary-general or department director level. The Chiao-Tang talks will take place Tuesday and Wednesday afternoons and Friday morning at the Diaoyutai State Guest House. They will focus on reviewing the results of the three cross- strait technical talks held last year in the hope that more progress can be made during future discussions. The two heads of the intermediary organizations will also look into the operations of both SEF and ARATS as well as review the implementation of the agreements signed during the "Ku-Wang" talks. Issues related to a second "Ku-Wang" meeting will also be considered during the talks, according to one of Chiao's aides. Chiao was traveling in the company of SEF Deputy Secretaries-General Shih Chi-ping and Hsu Huei-yu. SEF Chief Secretary Wu Shu, who arrived in Beijing three days ago, held a meeting Saturday with ARATS Deputy Secretary-General Zhao Zhengyu, to prepare for the forthcoming talks.
