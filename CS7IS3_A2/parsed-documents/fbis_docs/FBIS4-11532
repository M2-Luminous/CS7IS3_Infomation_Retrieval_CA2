Lacayo praised the agreement, describing it as another government achievement in its fourth year in office. [Lacayo] "We are celebrating this fourth year of Violeta Chamorro's democratic government with this agreement, an agreement that opens the door to a Nicaragua with a national Army for the first time in its history, and closes the door on any attempt to seize power via weapons. Thus, we are celebrating the existence of a new Nicaragua." Lacayo said the Military Code, which consists of 93 articles, is the result of a consensus between President Chamorro and the top military command on how and on which date the new Army commander in chief will be appointed. Lacayo mentioned the government's achievements: [Lacayo] "Nicaragua is a territory free of armed political groups today." He added the government has kept its promises as no other government has ever done in the country's history: [Lacayo] "No one can doubt we have forever left behind the death of Nicaraguan brothers in the battlefields, the harsh press censorship, the jail terms for dissension, and the subsequent crooked deals that prompted the collapse of an economy that was in a regressive and mortal state." Army Chief Humberto Ortega also spoke at the event. He insisted on referring to the past until he finally expressed his opinion about the Military Code: [Ortega] "The law must serve to strengthen the process to professionalize the Army. It must not be the kind of law some people want: a law to dismantle the Army." Ortega reiterated the Army does respect the state branches: [Ortega] "The Army has never interfered in politics or in a single decision made by this government, a decisionmaking power it won in the elections."
