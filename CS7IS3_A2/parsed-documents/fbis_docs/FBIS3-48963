Forty-four of the 46 selected cities decided to take part in the program. In line with the intention of its authors, the program is supposed to meet two goals: First, which is generally believed to be of paramount importance, is to make the managing of local affairs more efficient. The second goal is a test before introducing self-government powiats [small administrative units]. The change lies in the following: the city -- that is, the council elected in general elections and the mayor appointed by it -- will deal with some of the affairs that have so far been in the domain of the government administration (of ministries, voivodes, regional offices). It will receive a special subsidy from the state budget. The subsidy, as Finance Deputy Minister Wojciech Misiag said in the Sejm, will not be bigger (self-governments hope that it will not be smaller either) than the subsidy that would be given to the administration. This operation is supposed to yield three kinds of benefits: -- make management more uniform, by concentrating the powers, which have so far been scattered, in the hands of self-government authorities; -- submit the activities of yet other establishments under social control. This control is exercised by the council, which every four years is evaluated by the city's inhabitants in elections. Control over centrally steered civil servants is far less efficient; -- ensure better spending of public money. There are many examples which show that local authorities spend their money more thriftily and wisely; they can also pursue a much more flexible budget policy than centralized structures. The Pilotage Program Has an Eventful History On 29 December 1992, Michal Kulesza, the government's representative for public administration reform, forwarded a letter to the mayors of selected cities; he asked them whether they would be interested in taking part in such an undertaking. At the very beginning it was established that cities would be free to make this decision independently. Forty-six cities were selected; each of them has more than 100,000 inhabitants (except Warsaw, due to a complex system of self-government); there are also several smaller towns which are part of urban complexes. As many as 50 percent of Poland's inhabitants live in the selected cities; their budgets constitute 40 percent of all self-governments' finances. In February 1993, the Sejm adopted the budget law. Article 35 empowered the government to issue an order concerning the pilotage program. In July, Prime Minister Hanna Suchocka met with the mayors and chairmen of municipal councils of the cities participating in the program. She stated that "one cannot change Poland without changing its cities." "We are ready to make the effort. We have been waiting for this for three years. We really want the program to be successful," answered Wojciech Szczesny Kaczmarek, president of the Union of Polish Towns and Cities and mayor of Poznan. Soon afterward, on 13 July... The Council of Ministers Adopted a "Pilotage" Order In line with it, cities were supposed to take over the following: -- administrative powers, such as those concerning ground policy, construction, road traffic (such as registration of vehicles, issuing or withholding drivers' licenses); -- such establishments as secondary schools, culture establishments, health service institutions, houses of social care, as well as managing national and voivodship roads, except highways and expressways; -- administrative police forces, such as protection from fire. Among other things, approximately 30 cultural establishments of "all-national importance," as well as specialized health service institutions of voivodship or national importance were supposed to remain under state administration. Along with new duties, cities were supposed to take over indispensable buildings for free and receive money from the state budget. This was supposed to be a purposeful subsidy [a subsidy for a particular purpose], but gminas [small administrative units] were supposed to be free to move the money from one area to another. Self-governments were supposed to be free from the debts incurred by various establishments before the middle of 1993. The deadline for signing agreements by mayors and voivodes was set for 30 October. Just a few days before this day, when 28 cities had already concluded their agreements, Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak sent a fax ordering a stop to this operation. The decision was explained by the "intention of obtaining exact information concerning the course of the pilotage program to date and carrying out a legal and substantive analysis of it." Cities and national self-governmental organizations soon protested violently against the stopping of the program. Soon afterward the government made a decision: the agreements must not be signed until 30 November; after that, cities will be allowed to do it until 20 December. The Scope of the Pilotage Was Restricted This also concerned the cities that had signed their agreements earlier; it encountered accusations of breaking the rule that the law is not retroactive. Chorzow and Grudziadz withdrew, being deterred by the "disloyalty of the partner." They have not given up new powers; they will take them over from voivodes on the basis of individual agreements. The number of the culture establishments that will not be transferred to self-governments has risen five times -- to 150 and comprised such institutions as voivodship public libraries and houses of culture. It was the result of protests by culture employees and artists, including the Union of Polish Stage Artists and "Solidarity." Although even Deputy Minister Michal Jagiello recalled that self-governments pay for culture (even though they would not have to) more money than the state budget via voivodes and that establishments taken care of by the ministry are not doing better than those financed by self-governments, Minister Kazimierz Dejmek managed to force the decision on limiting the pilotage. Not all cities will take over secondary schools, first of all for financial reasons. For a long time it was not clear what would happen to school debt. The government's decision that the state budget will be responsible for those debts which should have been paid off by 30 November, was made on 23 December at night. There are other problems as well. Only on 29 December, at the meeting of the team steering the pilotage program, did representatives of self- governments manage to obtain the most recent information on the sums to be allocated for the maintenance of various schools. It turned out that they differ from those presented earlier by school superintendents. In the atmosphere of uncertainty, some cities (such as Bialystok, Koszalin, Lublin, Poznan, Slupsk) decided to give up the idea of taking over secondary schools. For the time being in the budget bill... There Is No Trace of Pilotage It is still not clear what sums the state budget will earmark for cities. The Finance Ministry has committed itself to calculating everything as soon as it obtains full information on what the various cities will take over. Then an appendix will be drawn up which will be forwarded to the Sejm as a governmental amendment. What needs to be explained is the matter of debts of the establishments taken over by cities. It is known that the budget will deal with the debts of secondary schools that should have been paid off by 30 November 1993, and the debts of other establishments -- by 30 June 1993. At the meeting of the team steering the pilotage it was decided that the finance minister would propose to the Council of Ministers that health service institutions and culture establishments be treated the same way as secondary schools. Self-government activists recall that the debts have been incurred by budget sphere establishments; they believe that the government can do one of two things: keep the establishments that are working inefficiently as well as their debts, or keep only their debts. Self-government activists are not satisfied with the way money is supposed to be transferred. Originally it was assumed that all the money would pass through the voivodes' budgets. Now it is planned that the money will be given by voivodes and the various ministers; however, only voivodes will see to it that the money comes in time and is sufficient in amount. Cities believe that this does not guarantee them financial security. Despite reservations, the self-governments of most towns have not withdrawn from the program (even though some of them add that after a few months they may consider such a possibility). They are prepared to add from several to a few hundred billion zlotys to new establishments. "We risk our posts, but we must take anything we can from the hands of irresponsible people," says Bytom's Janusz Paczocha, "enfant terrible" [preceding two words in French] among city mayors. Gdynia Mayor Franciszka Cegielska adds: "We may get into trouble as authorities, but this is what the inhabitants want us to do." Self-government activists are disappointed that the prime minister has not even once made a political declaration that he would like the pilotage program to be successful.
