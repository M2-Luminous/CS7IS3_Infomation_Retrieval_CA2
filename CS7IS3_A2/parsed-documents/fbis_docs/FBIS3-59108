This will be the final episode in a strange defense action which, when all is said and done, will have had the effect of confirming suspicions. The former deputy prime minister repeated yesterday, in every possible way, his innocence and his desire to defend himself. We have already heard this from him many times, at least where the method of allocating the Agusta contract is concerned. Now, however, attention has been focused on a specific point -- the commissions that are supposed to have been paid to the Socialist Party [PS] (or should we say the Socialist Parties, the national and Liege groups?) that the ex-minister claims he never saw, thus contradicting the members of his own "family." Now all we can hope for is that the rules applied will enable Guy Coeme to explain his case once and for all, on every point, and then leave Justice to finish what it started. Nothing would be worse than if this dossier were to be "buried," stifled in the procedural maze or the tangle of party politics. The dangers of this affair have been underlined, with its possible link with the murder of a minister of state. It could still undermine the government or strengthen the rejection of politics by the public as it stands today. The triggering of a governmental crisis moreover would make it possible to check "in vivo" the depth of this feeling, fed by the outpourings from the PS. These are real dangers. However, there is something even more important which will prove only too well the crucial nature of current events. The real risk for the political sphere will be if it fails to learn the lessons, the many lessons, to be drawn from the current situation. A number of officials, including Coeme, are aiming their criticisms today toward the media which, if we are to believe them, is collectively responsible for deviations, false disclosures, and errors. We do not deny that certain elements have been responsible for damaging exaggerations. However, without playing the role of judge and jury, we would ask those assigned the mission of government not to draw from the Agusta affair the sole conclusion that the press should be regulated. Now there are many other things that need to be considered by all those who, in the PS and elsewhere, are truly convinced of the need to reconcile morality with public life.
