[Calderon] Arena [Nationalist Republican Alliance] has had a coherent proposal for a long time, even during the difficult period when communist and Marxist ideas were popular in Latin America. Our party has always presented a clear proposal, since its birth. It has made an economic proposal in defense of individual rights, the market economy, private property, and, particularly, the state of law. Now we see that opposition candidates are planning to present a similar program, although they lack the credibility necessary to do so. However, we have noticed a change in their language, and that has changed the campaign: it has made it more pragmatic, it is using a similar language, by which all can picture the social problems. What I see is a greater awareness among all sectors regarding the country's social problems. I believe it is the product of the war experience per se. The fact that all Salvadorans have a clearer vision of the social problems has made possible that all programs better target social welfare. [LA PRENSA GRAFICA] What does your campaign's concept of Arena being the new socially aware right mean? [Calderon] What we mean is that Arena represents the right with social consciousness, a right that faces social problems with courage. It is not socialist, corporate, or Marxist ideas, but ideas founded on a true Christian humanism that make up the contemporary world, and turn man into a being of solidarity. The philosophy of the new right is that profound. There cannot be true economic development if we do not involve social welfare, human progress. Here is the success of the new right in the world: it is opening possibilities, leaving behind populist and socialist ideas and positions that gave leaders a demagogic vocabulary, and that led Latin America to poverty in the past decades. This new right is causing countries to reemerge with new positions, sustained economic growth, and facing social problems, reducing poverty levels, and boosting economic indicators. [LA PRENSA GRAFICA] And now that you have been touring the country and getting in touch with the national situation, how would you summarize the social offers your government is proposing? [Borgo] We are very satisfied with the expressions of civic awareness and education Salvadorans have given. Past experience shows us that people strongly believe in democracy. These opportunities and discussions with the people promote high participation. We believe that Salvadorans are receptive regarding compliance with the law and the state of law. People respond favorably when they hear us talk about the need to stop violence, respect the laws and life. Regarding our program, the economic aspect has been the best publicized. Regarding the social aspect, we have received very positive feedback when people hear that we want to work in education, health, and the environment, among other areas. Education is the tool needed so that people can aspire for opportunities to grow. We have absolute trust in education because it constitutes the key to the country's progress. We plan to broaden such programs as Educo and Sabe, which began during President Cristiani's term. The loss experienced in the area of education during the war period was enormous: almost 700 schools were closed and over 150,000 children could not attend. We are determined 100 percent to make education and physical reconstruction our main concern. [LA PRENSA GRAFICA] What proposals are necessary to achieve a type of economic and social welfare in which people can actively participate? [Borgo] We see the need to increase foreign currency in the country. Family remittances are a fragile source of funds that might decrease, and even if current levels are maintained, we can expect to see a decrease in international aid. We are trying to promote the export of nontraditional products, and we want to broaden our prospects for tourism. If we might draw something positive from a negative experience, it would be that the 10-year war put us on the world map. In turn, we might be able to take advantage of this, because we have many tourist attractions, the foremost of which is our people. Salvadorans are pleasant and willing to help. We can be very successful at promoting tourism. Another major initiative will be to get Salvadorans abroad to invest here. We are trying to create a program with investment tools that can be joined by people who receive family allowances. These two ideas are important. We have been working on these projects for a long time. When the director of the World Tourism Organization visited, we were able to get all of the political parties to commit themselves to developing the tourism industry. So far, we have outlined four pillars of this development program. [LA PRENSA GRAFICA] Recently, the Salvadoran Foundation for Economic and Social Development [Fusades] presented an economic program that was reportedly open to all political parties. Is there any similarity between this program and your plan? [Borgo] What Fusades presented is a summary of a political strategy. It was explained that a number of studies comprised the basis of that summary. This package must be analyzed thoroughly, but we do agree that it necessarily concurs with the party's economic and social philosophy. Nevertheless, we believe it is very useful. [LA PRENSA GRAFICA] What do you think, Dr. Calderon? [Calderon] I believe it is a true contribution to El Salvador and that it fully corresponds with our party. We have somewhat of a similar philosophy with the people from Fusades. We must also recall that President Cristiani's program received significant input from Fusades. In a second government, there will also be continuity, because ours is not simply a five-year program. The country is being rescued; Arena's program is not over, but just beginning. Our program is designed to achieve peace, progress, freedom, democracy, justice, and better living conditions for the country. Now that we are heading toward an economic recovery, peace has helped guide the country toward reconstruction. We still have a long way to go before we reach the desired levels. We have always said that our program is not limited to five years; there is no way that it could be. This is why we hope people will reelect us on 20 March -- to enable us to continue with our program. [LA PRENSA GRAFICA] President Cristiani's government will go down in history as the government that achieved peace. Where will you lead your government if you win the elections? [Calderon] I would like my government to be a government of reconstruction, not only a physical reconstruction, but also moral, cultural, and civic reconstruction. People should experience a renewal. We believe we can strengthen the peace that has been achieved, bolster the democratic process, and fulfill the great goal of rebuilding the country structurally and morally.
