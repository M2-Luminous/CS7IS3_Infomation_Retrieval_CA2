FR941206-0-00108 FR941206-0-00015 Remaining Matters 26. There is an inconsistency between the language of the First Reconstruction Order and that of ยง73.3555(a)(1)(ii) as published, as to the benchmark for permissible audience share. In order to remove any ambiguity on this point, the Commission states that it intended the language of the rule to be controlling. Thus, only audience shares that exceed 25 percent are to be considered prima facie inconsistent with the public interest. 27. Further, the Commission clarifies that while it is appropriate to exclude non-operational stations from calculation of the number of stations in the market where it cannot be presumed that they will add to the competition and diversity in a market, such as analysis is not appropriate when the non-operational station is a part of the transaction under scrutiny, because the applicant has control over and can generally be presumed to intend to put the station on the air. Thus, if the non-operational station is one of the proposed commonly owned stations involved in the transaction, the principal community contour of the non-operational station will not be disregarded in calculating how many stations are counted as in the market or in determining the geographic area for which audience share is calculated. 28. The Commission also notes that current rules permit an AM licensee to own an existing AM station in the 535&hyph;1605 kHz band and apply for a construction permit for an AM station in the expanded band, 1605 kHz&hyph;1705 kHz, without regard to otherwise prohibited principal community contour overlap. Moreover, the national ownership restrictions are not applied when an entity with an attributable interest in an AM station in the existing band applies for an AM station in the expanded band. Note 10 to ยง73.3555 specifies a five-year period during which joint ownership of existing band and expanded band AM authorizations will be acceptable; at the expiration of this five-year period, the licensee must elect to operate either the expanded band station or to operate the station on its former frequency in the existing band. 29. The Commission clarifies that if, during the five-year transition period, the licensee has not yet elected whether to move to the expanded band or retain its existing facility, the expanded band station will be disregarded for purposes of the local and national ownership rules. Thus, the principal community contour of the existing band station will be considered for purposes of determining the relevant market and for purposes of determining the number of stations in the market. Moreover, if it is necessary to determine whether the combination complies with the audience share cap, the Commission will consider only the audience share attributable in the relevant market to the existing band station.
