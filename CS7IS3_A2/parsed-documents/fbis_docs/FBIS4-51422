First of all, domestic investment, particularly in the manufacturing sector, remains sluggish. Vice Economic Affairs Minister Li Shu-jeou said the number of newly established factories declined in the first quarter of this year and their aggregate paid-in capital also dropped as compared with the year-earlier. Machinery imports, an effective measure of investment activities, registered a 6 percent decrease during the January-March period. Li said difficulties in land acquisition remain the greatest obstacle to private investment here. According to a recent survey by the US-based McKinsey consulting firm, Taiwan's industrial land prices are the second highest in Asia, behind only Hong Kong. Li added labor shortages, inadequate government incentives and a growing "anti-commerce complex" have also discouraged manufacturers from making new investments at home. He cited a recent proposal by a township chief to levy "community development taxes" on the construction sector and the forced closure of the Makro Shopping Center in the Kaohsiung Industrial Zone as examples of the so-called "anti-commerce complex." Wang Chao-ming, a minister without portfolio, said he is worried about possible power shortages because of the long delay in construction of Taiwan's fourth nuclear power plant and growing labor-management conflicts over work hours and insurance issues. "If these problems cannot be resolved properly, our industrial production and overall economic growth will be adversely affected," Wang noted. Kuo Wan-jung, also a minister without portfolio, said Taiwan's foreign trade has become even more unbalanced, with its reliance on the Mainland Chinese market increasing. Taiwan's foreign trade surplus declined by nearly 70 percent in the first four months of this year compared to 1993. Worse yet, its trade deficit with Japan reached US$4.56 billion between January and April. Taiwan also incurred a US$760 million trade deficit with Europe, while its trade surplus with the United States shrank to US$893.9 million. Taiwan managed to register a US$5.62 billion surplus in its trade with Hong Kong, a major conduit for indirect Taiwan-Mainland China trade, during the four-month period. "All these figures point to changes in Taiwan's trade picture, with its exports to advanced countries, such as the US, Japan and European nations, declining while its reliance on the mainland market is rising," noted Kuo. She also called attention to potential inflationary pressure, saying the nearly 2 percent depreciation of the new Taiwan dollar in recent months and rising oil and raw material prices in the international market may destabilize local commodity prices which would hinder economic growth. However, Chairman Hsiao Wan-chang of the Council for Economic Planning and Development said he remains optimistic about Taiwan's economic prospects. "Our economy is undergoing a structural change, with technology-intensive industry playing an increasingly important role," Hsiao noted. Industrial production rose 6.2 percent in the January-April period and heavy industry output grew an even more impressive 8 percent from the year-earlier level, he added.
