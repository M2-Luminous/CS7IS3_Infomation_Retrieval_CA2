The bomb was planted in a Vespa scooter parked near the office of the Deputy Commissioner, South. Eyewitnesses said the police activity and presence of the mobile control room of the fire brigade in the court prior to the explosion showed that the administration had information about planting of the bomb. "I was in the court stamp office around 12:15 pm when I heard a big explosion and felt as if the building was going to cave in and my ears kept buzzing for a few minutes", Nastz Rizwan, Advocate, told THE NEWS. He said after few seconds several other explosions of mild intensity were heard compelling him to remain in the office. By the time three fire brigades reached the scene, most of the motorcycles had already been gutted. The splinters of the bomb as well as pieces of Vespa broke the window panes and went high to the top of a multi-storey building across the road. "SDM airport, Iqbal Scomro, had arrived minutes before the explosion and was talking to chauffeur of the chief secretary when the explosion took place and we were hit by heavy objects", said guard of the SDM, Haider Abhas, at the Civil Hospital. Ameer Abdullah, a policeman who was also injured, said he was going to the court after when the device exploded and an object hit at his right shoulder, "I fell unconscious and know nothing what happened later,", he said. Another injured Bahauddin, an aged Baloch, was hit by an heavy object while sitting behind the stamp office. He was sitting about half a furlong from the parking lot. His condition was stated to be unstable. Other injured were identified as (Mumtazur) Rehman, an army personnel, Nasir Khan, Abdul Rehman, Taufeeq Moin, Mohammad Aslam, Mohammad Musaddiq and Abdul Rehman who were treated and discharged from the Civil Hospital. The Incharge of the Bomb Disposal Service, Moinuddin, said: "It was 400 grams of Russian made TNT explosive covered with steel splinters and attached with a console timer of approximately 30-minute." The timer was also Russian-made, but the current detonator could be home-made which was attached with a 9-volt battery, he added. When asked DSP [Deputy Inspector of Police] Eidgah, Chaudhri Mohammad Ashraf, said: "The incident seems to be connected with the recent incident of Larkana." SDM Arambagh, Raeesuddin Piracha, who was also holding the charge of Eidgah Sub-Division, said hands of AZO [Al-Zulfiqar Organization) and RAW [Research and Analysis Wing] could not be ruled out. The DIG [Deputy Inspector General] Karachi, Rahood Khan Brohi, however, said: "We cannot say anything as the matter was yet to be investigated. Special teams have been formed under the supervision of the area DSP [Deputy Superintendent of Police] which will be assisted by the CIA. [Crime Investigation Agency]" He denied any arrest in this connection so far and said hopefully the investigators would reach a conclusion after the microscopic examination of the splinters and pieces of the Vespa.
