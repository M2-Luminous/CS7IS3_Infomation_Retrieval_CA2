FR941130-0-00050 FR941130-0-00004 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 25 [Docket No. NM&hyph;53; Special Conditions No. 25&hyph;ANM&hyph;45A] Special Conditions: Jetstream Aircraft Limited Model 4100 Series Airplanes, Main Cabin Aisle Arrangement AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Amended special conditions. SUMMARY: These amended special conditions are issued to Jetstream Aircraft Limited for the Jetstream Model 4100 series airplanes. This airplane has a novel or unusual design feature associated with the main cabin aisle arrangement. Special Conditions No. 25&hyph;ANM&hyph;45 were issued on July 9, 1991 (to British Aerospace Public Limited Company (BAe)), addressing this unusual arrangement, and included a limitation on passenger capacity. The applicant has requested that Special Conditions No. 25&hyph;ANM&hyph;45 be amended to increase the passenger capacity limit from 29 to 30 passengers. Since Special Conditions No. 25&hyph;ANM&hyph;45 were issued, the applicant has changed the company name and revised the model number of the airplane. These amended special conditions reflect those changes. Since the applicable airworthiness regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for this particular design feature, these amended special conditions contain the additional safety standards which the Administrator finds necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established by the airworthiness standards for transport category airplanes. EFFECTIVE DATE: November 30, 1994. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On May 24, 1989, BAe (currently Jetstream Aircraft Ltd.) applied for a type certificate for the BAe Model 4100 (currently Jetstream Model 4101) airplane in the transport airplane category. The Model 4100 was to be a derivative of the Model 3100, which is a small airplane and is certificated under the provisions of part 23. Like the Model 3100, the Model 4100 was a low wing, twin engine turbo-prop design. The fuselage was stretched, however, to seat 29 passengers in a three-abreast arrangement. Since the Model 4100 airplane had the same fuselage cross section as the Model 3100, it did not have a traditional main cabin aisle arrangement. Section 25.815 specifies the minimum aisle width dimensions for transport category airplanes based on the passenger seating capacity. For airplanes with 20 or more passenger seats, a minimum 15-inch width at heights 25 inches or less above the main aisle floor and a minimum 20-inch width at heights greater than 25 inches above the floor must be maintained. Aisle width is measured at any point along the aisle, normal to the centerline of the aisle. The main aisle envisioned by the regulations would run in a straight line from one end of the passenger cabin to the other and would satisfy these width criteria. Long-standing FAA policy has permitted slight deviation from a straight line where there is a transition from one cabin section to another, or where there are interior features which dictate that the aisle move laterally. For example, from tourist class to first class there may be a change from five-abreast seating to four-abreast seating which moves the aisle centerline laterally. This has been accepted provided the required widths are maintained at all heights normal to the path that an individual would take. This type of offset normally occurs at one or two points in a main cabin aisle. In addition, there is no offset permitted in the aisle vertically; that is, the required 15-inch dimension must lie completely below the projected 20-inch dimension at all points along the aisle. The Jetstream main cabin aisle arrangement utilizes an offset at each seat row. The left and right seat assemblies are offset from one another longitudinally such that the seatbacks are not opposite each other across the aisle. This arrangement permits a 20-inch measurement between seatbacks (at an angle to the airplane centerline) and the required 15-inch dimension is maintained within the projected 20-inch dimension vertically. Thus the ``required aisle'' is not a straight line from one end of the cabin to the other, but a series of alternating angular segments from seatback to seatback. Nonetheless, there is a straight path along the cabin length, and the aisle floor does not deviate from side to side at all. The projected aisle width along this straight path reaches 20 inches at a height of 43 inches above the floor, which is the typical seatback height for transport airplanes. Another feature of the design includes the use of overwing exits which are offset longitudinally, corresponding to the seat positions on the left and right of the airplane. In order to provide design standards for the novel and unusual aisle configuration in BAe Model 4100 airplanes the FAA issued Special Conditions No. 25&hyph;ANM&hyph;45 on July 9, 1991. The criteria used to develop Special Conditions No. 25&hyph;ANM&hyph;45 utilized existing regulations, and made certain favorable design features in the Model 4100 mandatory. Special Conditions No. 25&hyph;ANM&hyph;45 are summarized as follows: a. There are no more than 29 passenger seats with no more than ten seat rows on either side of the aisle; b. The interior arrangement includes one pair of Type II and one pair of Type III passenger emergency exits; c. In addition to the requirements of ยง25.815, the projected aisle width is at least 20 inches measured at a height of 43 inches above the aisle floor; d. The Type III exits and adjacent seat rows are offset longitudinally such that persons approaching an exit from one end of the cabin may use the exit without interfering with those approaching the other exit from the other end of the cabin; e. The location and part number of each passenger seat must be defined by a drawing approved by the FAA or foreign civil airworthiness authority. The seat arrangement may not be reconfigured without FAA approval; and f. An evacuation demonstration must be conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of the aisle arrangement. The content of Special Conditions No. 25&hyph;ANM&hyph;45 is based, in part, on the maximum passenger capacity proposed by BAe. The specific limitation of 29 passenger seats was the maximum capacity requested by BAe, but the FAA considered that the fact that this capacity was well below the maximum that could be allowed for the installed exit combination was a significant factor in acceptance of the aisle arrangement. Subsequent to the issuance of Special Conditions No. 25&hyph;ANM&hyph;45 and prior to issuance of the Type Certificate for that project, British Aerospace Public Limited Company changed its name to Jetstream Aircraft Limited. Also, the specific model of the 4100 series in question was identified as the Jetstream Model 4101. Type Certificate A41NM was issued to Jetstream Aircraft Limited on April 9, 1993, for the Jetstream Model 4101 airplane. It is now anticipated that additional models of the 4100 series may be added to this Type Certificate in the future. In addition to the Model 4101, Special Conditions No. 25&hyph;ANM&hyph;45 would be applicable to any other Jetstream Model 4100 series airplanes that incorporate the same novel or unusual aisle configuration.
