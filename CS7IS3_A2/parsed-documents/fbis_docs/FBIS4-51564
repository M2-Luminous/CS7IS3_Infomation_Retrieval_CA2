It was the 22nd straight month for sales at major retailers to decline from year-earlier levels, the ministry said in a preliminary report. MITI said the poor performance in the reporting month reflected continued price-consciousness among consumers. A spell of bad weather in the latter half of March also adversely affected retail sales, MITI said. Sales at 420 department stores fell 4.2 percent to 940 billion yen, marking the 25th straight month of year-to-year declines, it said. Sales at 2,056 supermarket chains dipped 1.5 percent from a year earlier to 819.6 billion yen, for the 20th straight month of falls. March sales of clothing at department stores decreased 5.3 percent from a year before while clothing sales at supermarket chains fell 6.4 percent. Total clothing sales for the reporting month dropped 5.6 percent for the 20th month running of year-to-year declines. Sales of spring clothing were sluggish due to unusually cool weather in the month, while sales of business suits continued to fare poorly, MITI said. Sales of food and beverages edged up 0.4 percent overall, with a 0.2 percent pickup at department stores and a 0.5 percent gain at supermarket chains. Food and beverage sales grew for the third month in a row on brisk demand for products for daily use. Sales of small items of furniture picked up but high-priced furniture performed poorly. General household equipment sales were slack. Sales of household electrical appliances grew 8.1 percent at supermarket chains but fell 6.5 percent at department stores.
