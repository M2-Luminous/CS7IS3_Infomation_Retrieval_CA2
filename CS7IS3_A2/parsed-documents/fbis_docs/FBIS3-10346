He emphasized that the world faces new challenges and threats to its stability and security following the era of political-ideological confrontation. Speaking at the inauguration of the 10th Mexican-Canadian Ministerial Commission meeting here, Tello asserted that cooperation among countries must be increased, justice among nations augmented, and international institutions strengthened. The Mexican foreign secretary said that Mexico and Canada have significant points of agreement that have allowed more solid and profound bilateral relations. Tello asserted that as the world has become more independent, nations are intermingling more, new economic spaces are being created, and competition for markets and positions in the global economy is increasing. For this reason, scientific and technological developments force firms and governments to propose efficient solutions that acknowledge the needs of growing competitiveness. He emphasized that NAFTA has increased and broadened Mexican- Canadian interaction and has caused bilateral relations to become significantly closer and more familiar. The foreign secretary said the agenda of the 10th meeting, which ends this afternoon, shows the richness of the countries' relations as it includes issues related to commerce, finance, agriculture, transportation, mining, forestry, fisheries, and labors. Regarding politics, the dialogue goes beyond the bilateral field and includes aspects related to the operations and goals of institutions such as the United Nations, the OAS, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation mechanism. Canadian Foreign Minister Andres Ouellet pointed out the importance of the countries' bilateral relations based on mutual respect and agreement on goals to bring peace and respect to every country. He added that NAFTA has prompted great international interest as well as curiosity in European and Asian countries, but "for us, it is a new relationship that we must intensify, mature, and fully experience." He mentioned the possibility of Latin American countries such as Chile joining the commercial agreement and added that countries in the hemisphere should seek wider membership. The Canadian minister explained that the meeting will include issues related to the export of Canadian equipment and minerals and tele-exploration [teledeteccion] technology, as well as access to the market of Mexican firms such as Mexican Petroleum and the Federal Electricity Company. Ouellet said NAFTA increases Mexico's and Canada's prospects for sustained economic growth and said that both governments will respect the other's priorities regarding labor and environmental issues. The delegates to the 10th Ministerial Commission meeting will study bilateral relations and cooperation mechanisms in various sectors of common interest.
