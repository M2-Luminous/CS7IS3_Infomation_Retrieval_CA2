Let us listen to a report by our special envoy Gary Belizaire, live from the parliament. [Belizaire] Lieutenant Gen. Raoul Cedras is expected this afternoon in the Senate of the Republic. The Justice, Interior, and Defense Commissions of the Senate have invited the Army commander in chief to provide explanations today of events such as those that occurred (?in the south) two weeks ago. If we are to believe what Senator Ebrane Cadet said, Gen. Cedras will be required to address the Senate about the upsurge of violence in the country. This invitation to Gen. Cedras proves that the parliament is working, added Sen. Cadet who did not explain whether this convening is part of the surprise he said would occur within 24 hours. Meanwhile, the 18 January parliamentarians and the dissidents of the Alliance [for Parliamentary Cohesion] are awaiting Gen. Cedras' arrival. The general will most likely attend the session because everything has already been arranged for the holding of this session. The electricity company of Haiti has provided power, whereas the area is usually deprived of electricity at this hour. Let us point out that the senators of the constitutionalist bloc are not present because they have not yet acknowledged the second office of the Senate of the Republic. Gary Belizaire for Tropic FM at the Senate of the Republic.
