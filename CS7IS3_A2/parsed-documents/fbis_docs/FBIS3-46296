Speaking at the 1994 work conference of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, he called on Chinese scientists to "take hold of the opportunity to speed up development." According to Zhou, the academy will not only develop into one of the most advanced research centers in China but also become an important base for China's high-tech industry and for training qualified scientists and technicians. Zhou said the CAS will spare no efforts to promote the application of research achievements in industrial production this year. In 1994, the CAS will focus its efforts on the research and development in such energy development as the burning, crystallization and conversion of coal and in the amelioration of red soil in hilly areas in southern China, comprehensive development and utilization of rare-earth resources and research and application of information technology. The CAS will put into service its Shanghai Life Sciences Center and Beijing modern geoscience center this year and build some other science centres in the near future. Without fixed staff, these science centers will operate under the guidance of the most prominent scientists with high attainments and with researchers, mostly with doctorate or post-doctorate degrees, to be appointed for a fixed period. The CAS will train more post-graduates and post-doctorates, Zhou said. It will also convert all its high-tech enterprises into joint stock companies. Chinese President Jiang Zemin sent a letter of congratulation to the work conference, urging the CAS to make breakthroughs in the frontier projects that will promote a new industrial revolution by making most of its advantages.
