He saw it as a "document of national consensus" and said that it "complements" the unity agreement signed on 22 May 1990. But al-Bid, who was answering a written question sent to him by AL-HAYAH about the reasons for the delay in signing the document, pointed out that his party links signing the document to "real and sufficient guarantees for the implementation of its provisions." In what seemed like a warning, he stressed that "history will not turn back," a clear indication that the YSP refuses to return to the situation which prevailed before he chose seclusion in Aden since 19 August. Following is the text of al-Bid's statement explaining the reasons which have delayed the signing of the agreement: "First of all I wish to emphasize that the YSP considers the Pledge and Accord Document approved by the National Dialogue Committee to be a document representing the common vision of all the vital forces interested in protecting unity, consolidating the democratic experiment, and building a modern state in Yemen. "Having been endorsed by the parties to the dialogue and received widespread popular support, it is now a document of national consensus in the sense that it has become the document of all the good people in Yemen who, without doubt, are the vast majority of the population. No views, positions, or agreements on issues pertaining to the Yemeni homeland and people have received such vast support as has this important agreement which, we in the YSP believe, complements the unity agreement signed on 22 May 1990. "That document (the agreement) was signed by two Yemeni national parties, namely the YSP and the General People's Congress, but the Pledge and Accord Document was endorsed by all the parties operating in the Yemeni national arena, and it in effect reaffirms protection of the unity agreed on 22 May 1990 and emphasizes the importance of building the unity state, which was not built during the transitional period and should be built now, with its roots reaching all the depth and width of the homeland and its edifice rising into the skies. That is why the YSP, proceeding from its national unionist outlook and its real interest in unity and democracy, reaffirms the need for signing this important national document which has been called the Pledge and Accord Document. "Second, while emphasizing the importance of this document, seeing it as a document which heralds a new era, putting an end to the era and vestiges of secession and partition, the YSP is interested in this document finding its way to serious, speedy, practical implementation so that all aspects of life may stabilize. Therefore, and in light of its assessment of its past experience, it underscores -- and it has every right to do so -- the need for real and sufficient guarantees for the implementation of that document. The YSP now reasserts this point which it has been emphasizing since the beginning of the crisis and since the presentation of the known 18 points. When these 18 points were submitted, we underlined the importance of linking the acceptance of these points to commencement of their implementation and the provision of sufficient guarantees for that, including the party's proposal at the time that the dialogue be widened to include all influential forces in the Yemeni homeland, which later were represented in the National Dialogue Committee. "That is why we continue to reaffirm what we had stressed along with all the forces really and genuinely interested in resolving the current crisis and eliminating all the obstacles threatening unity and democracy and their continuation. "Third, in light of what we have just explained, we should proceed to sign the document with the presence of guarantees for its implementation. Anyone who rejects that in fact stands against the will of the people. The YSP will always uphold the will of the people, the good people of Yemen who are the vast majority of our fine people, or rather the entire struggling Yemeni people. "Fourth, on the question of who is impeding the signing of the document, it is the party placing obstacles in the way of the provision of guarantees for the implementation of the Pledge and Accord Document which, as I said, has been unanimously approved by all the people. Those are in fact exposing their true intentions of rejecting the agreement and insisting on putting their personal narrow interests before the interests of the people. What is important is that history will not turn back." Meanwhile, Salim Salih Muhammad, Presidential Council member and YSP assistant secretary general, has stated that "the YSP welcomes the conclusions reached by the Dialogue Committee of the Political Forces during its meeting in Sanaa the day before yesterday." He declared that the "party totally accepts the committee's decision naming the Jordanian capital Amman as the venue for the final signing of the Pledge and Accord Document." [passage omitted]
