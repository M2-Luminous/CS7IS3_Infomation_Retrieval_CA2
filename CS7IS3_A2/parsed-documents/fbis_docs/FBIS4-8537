Milan Martic said the R.S.K. accepted talks with Croatia on economic relations, but on an equal footing. After talking with U.S. Zagreb Ambassador Peter Galbraith Monday [11 April], he assessed that the plan for economic cooperation of the international community, that is, the conference on former Yugoslavia and Croatia offered contained [as received] a number of elements with which the R.S.K. agreed and with which it could agree. At the beginning of the talk with Galbraith, Martic issued a strong protest to the U.S. Government and U.S. President Bill Clinton because of, as he put it, "unprecedented bombing of Serb positions" around Gorazde in southeastern Bosnia. This act of force did not contribute to peace and must not be repeated, said Martic, recalling the mutual commitments of the R.S.K. and the Srpska republic (R.S.) on joint defense. Galbraith told newsmen NATO action around Gorazde was justified and that the U.S. has responded to commitments to the allies in NATO, the international community and the U.N. The U.S. NATO planes bombed Sunday and Monday (April 10 and 11) positions of the Srpska army near Gorazde, a Moslem enclave and U.N.-declared safe area, which should have been demilitarized last spring. Galbraith stated satisfaction with the talk on Monday and stressed he expected complicated talks between the representatives of the R.S.K. and Croatia and believed in its success if both sides, as he said, showed flexibility. The R.S.K.-Croatia accord on cessation of hostilities, signed on March 30 at the Russian Embassy in Zagreb, was being implemented successfully. [passage omitted]
