The "market" figures gained during 1,000 personal interviews at the end of February show a 44-percent majority for membership -- this is 5 percent more than in January and the highest value in three years. For the first time in a long period, there is the clearest majority among the supporters of the Austrian People's Party [OeVP], but also among the Social Democratic Party of Austria and the Freedom Party of Austria [FPOe] voters in favor of the European Union dominate. Being in favor of membership is in correlation with income and level of education. However, according to "market" figures, opposition has also increased slightly (from 34 to 37 percent); the group of undecided people, on the other hand, has shrunk. The quick telephone polls by OGM and Integral, which cannot really be compared with the above-mentioned poll in terms of method, showed majorities between 42 and 56 percent. At the moment, a majority seems to be certain, because parallel to the Sunday question [how would you vote if the referendum were held next Sunday?], the "market" poll also asked whether the Austrians currently see more advantages or disadvantages (for months, the group of optimists has had the upper hand). In addition, the assessment that the referendum will have a positive result dominates with 33 percent compared to 27 percent. However, the referendum campaign is not yet over. The determining factor will be which group manages to use the most convincing arguments. Therefore, DER STANDARD had some arguments on membership tested in the M36 poll. By far the strongest argument was taken from a brochure, published by the OeVP's Political Academy: A total of 44 percent identify themselves with the statement "An effective environmental policy must comprise all of Europe" -- even among opponents of membership, 39 percent agree with this argument. Second and third place are already occupied by critical statements from the Greens' brochure on Europe: "The transit avalanche is on its way -- Austria will be steamrolled by the European Union" appeals to four out of 10 Austrians (and one out of three EU advocates); one out of three Austrians believe that the European Union could become a "single market for criminals." One out of three are convinced by the "decline of prices to the European level" that is promised by the Austrian Government's information on Europe; this argument is particularly attractive to women. Right at the bottom of the list: The slogan of the Greens that EU membership means "open borders for junk food" -- this is not believed either by EU opponents or by EU advocates.
