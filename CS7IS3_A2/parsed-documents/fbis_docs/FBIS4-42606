The first negotiation round, which was completed before the turn of the year, led to a clear yes effect in the opinion polls. This time, however, the opinion seems to be wait and see. According to the most recent poll, carried out by Skop and published in DAGENS INDUSTRI, the no side has even been somewhat strengthened. To the straight question of how a person would vote there are in April 55 percent who say no to membership, as against 45 percent yes. To be sure, that is a clear improvement over to the situation in the fall, when the yes side was below 40 percent, but a drop of 3 percentage points since February for yes. But Skop also has another question that provides more room for the interviewed to indicate his uncertainty. To the question of whether we should enter the EU there were in April 34 percent who replied "yes, absolutely" or "yes, perhaps," while 32 percent replied "no, probably not" or "no, absolutely not." The remaining 35 percent were therefore genuinely undecided. This, the largest group, has grown since the negotiations were concluded, and it is primarily among these that many today say they would vote no. So even if the no side seems to continue to stand stronger than the yes side, many persons who apparently had envisioned voting no have become more receptive to influence. [passage omitted]
