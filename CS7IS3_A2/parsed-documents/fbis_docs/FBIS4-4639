Minister Han said this at a news conference he gave to ROK correspondents at the National Press Club in Washington after holding talks with U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry. He also said: "We attach more significance to the measures -- which may be taken by the UN Security Council -- than to dialogue." He added: "The government has no plan for now to propose a diplomatic initiative to Pyongyang." The following are questions posed and the answers: [Question] What has happened to the ROK-U.S. coordination of views on the Team Spirit exercise? [Han Sung-chu] North Korea has not fulfilled its agreement with the United States. This has created circumstances under which we can cancel our plan to withhold the exercise. However, a final decision will be announced after consultations between the ROK and the United States which will be held when U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry visits the ROK. [Question] The signing of the contract to purchase Patriot missiles is reportedly imminent. Can you comment? [Han] That is absolutely not true. We did not buy those Patriot missiles to be deployed in the ROK: The United States deploys them because the U.S. Forces in the ROK need them. [Question] What do you think of Secretary Perry's strong remarks toward North Korea? [Han] He said portions of his full remarks were reported after being exaggerated. He also said he stressed a need to maintain a deterrent or defensive capability depending on the future situation. [Question] Did President Kim Yong-sam not give you the mission of having a resolution passed at the UN Security Council? [Han] UN Security Council discussions are multilateral. Therefore, no country can have its hope fulfilled 100 percent. Our country had tried to have a resolution passed at the UN Security Council. However, one must not overlook the fact that the recently passed statement of the Security Council president contains more substantial details. [Question] Do you have any hidden card for resolving the North Korean nuclear issue? [Han] The North Korean nuclear issue is complex and has no special remedy. Therefore, I would like to highly assess the Security Council president's statement because the statement has made it possible to start discussions on the nuclear issue again. [Question] Is the troop reinforcement, which Secretary Perry has referred to, an irrevocable, final decision? [Han] I do not think so. [Question] How will our diplomacy be carried out for a few weeks from now? [Han] First of all, I think, China will make efforts to make North Korea correctly realize the message contained in the president's statement, and the contact between the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and North Korea will possibly resume. I believe that if nuclear inspections are completed in this course, the possibility of resolving the North Korean nuclear issue will arise. [Question] When do you think North Korea will receive further inspections? [Han] We think there is a deadline in actuality even though one was not mentioned in the statement. The fact that the IAEA believes that inspections must resume in six weeks is a good point for consideration.
