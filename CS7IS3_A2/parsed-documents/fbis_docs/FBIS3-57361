Is That Not a Lot?"] [Text] On 21 January before leaving for the electoral districts, State Duma deputies demonstrated what seemed to me to be two important qualities which they have acquired in two weeks in parliament: the ability to wage a factional struggle and an unexpected capacity for compromise. ...There were two apparently separate questions to be resolved: the approval of the composition of the Geopolicy Committee and the vote on the inclusion of deputy Andrey Makarov in another committee -- the Committee on Legislation. Both questions were put to the ballot the day before. Then there was a proposal to vote on both questions as a package: We scratch your back, you scratch ours. I would venture to suggest that this spectacle was not without a certain drama. Suffice it to say that the words "motion carried" were heard only after...the fourth vote. The breakthrough was achieved in the following manner. Initially Ivan Rybkin, chairman of the chamber who was conducting the session, admonished the deputies, and not for the first time: This attempt to bamboozle one another will get nowhere. He was followed by Vladimir Volfovich who said: If you do not approve the Geopolicy Committee, what compromise will its nonexistent members be able to make? Subsequent events disproved the well known saying that might makes right. Thanks to some maneuvering the factions were able to elaborate a package of proposals on cadre questions and furthermore, according to Deputy Viktor Zorkaltsev, deputy chairman of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation Central Executive Committee, they will be able to agree on specific draft laws. This idea was graphically illustrated by a second episode at the session. This was a discussion of a State Duma statement on events in Yugoslavia. When the session rejected the proposal by Yevgeniy Ambartsumov, member of the International Relations Committee, to postpone it until consultations are held with representatives of the Foreign Ministry, the question raised then was what version of the statement should be adopted: The one proposed by the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, and the Agrarian Party of Russia or the version offered by Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the International Relations Committee? Here again the democrats demonstrated an exceptional tactical flexibility. Initially they adopted Lukin's proposal with a paragraph from from the alternative draft on lifting the economic blockade against Yugoslavia. But then they prevented the inclusion in the statement of a paragraph proposed by a representative of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia demanding the withdrawal of the UN forces from Yugoslav territory. I asked Gennadiy Burbulis, a "Russia's Choice" deputy, whether the interfactional squabbling will not be a hindrance to legislative activity and he stated with the utmost clarity: There is every reason for separating the political struggle, which is inevitable in the State Duma, from the pragmatic activity of a parliament consisting of professionals. There is one final event in the State Duma's life which has done very little to establish an image for it that is different from that of the former Supreme Soviet. The majority lacked the strength to resist some tempting privileges. They should not complain from the rostrum about the lack of objectivity of the press which latched onto Deputy A. Volkov's rejected amendments. Yes, they rejected a remuneration of $3,000 and a personal car equipped with a radio. However, at the suggestion of S. Baburin, who remembers past privileges, they returned to the automobile question and awarded themselves a car each but without a radio. Meanwhile, at the same session objections were raised to the expansion of State Duma structures. Nevertheless, in addition to the State Duma secretariat, which includes the apparatuses of the committees, the offices of the chairman and deputy chairmen, the State Duma conference, and so forth, the apparatuses of the factions and groups of deputies not belonging to the Secretariat will also provide backup for the deputies' work. Furthermore, each deputy can provide himself with a whole staff of assistants -- up to five people. And all this is at the taxpayer's expense....
