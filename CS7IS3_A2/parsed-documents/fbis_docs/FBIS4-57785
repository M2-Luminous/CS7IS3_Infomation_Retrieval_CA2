In a letter sent to Balaguer around midnight yesterday and distributed to the media today, Pena Gomez urged Balaguer "to adopt timely measures, in view of the delicate situation, to ensure a normal solution of the electoral crisis." According to government sources, the letter was read to Balaguer early today and stated that "should the current conflict not be resolved in due time, it will inflict serious economic, political, and moral damage on the Dominican Republic." Pena Gomez faced Balaguer, an 87-year-old seeking reelection to a seventh term, in the 16 August [month as received] general elections, which produced a serious crisis. Pena Gomez contested the elections hours after the voting concluded and claimed that a "scandalous fraud" had taken place through various forms of information manipulation that prevented "200,000 citizens from voting because they were reportedly replaced by a similar number of official party followers." In his letter, Pena Gomez told Balaguer that "we are convinced that you will, in view of this delicate situation, adopt timely measures to ensure a normal solution of the current electoral crisis." Pena Gomez also denounced the refusal of most magistrates of the Central Electoral Board (JCE) to give the PRD the voter list sent to the electoral boards. This list was reportedly distorted at the JCE computer center. As of today, the JCE has not yet proclaimed a winner in the elections, but Balaguer is leading Pena Gomez by 1.01 percent with 98 percent of the votes counted. Pena Gomez told the media that he will reject a vote recount that the JCE will begin tomorrow if the voter list is not produced. The JCE refused to produce the votes list that the opposition is demanding. According to the PRD, this list reflects the fraud committed by Balaguer's followers.
