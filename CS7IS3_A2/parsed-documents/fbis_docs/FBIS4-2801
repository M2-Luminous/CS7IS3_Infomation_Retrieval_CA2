It not only made promises on wide-ranging market accession, but amplified and improved a series of multilateral norms guiding world trade." A top priority task now facing us is to conscientiously implement the agreements reached during the Uruguay round. China is willing to make its own contributions. Reviewing the Uruguay round of talks, he emphatically pointed out: The vast number of developing countries "took a comprehensive part in the talks, played a positive role, made important contributions, and adopted extensive measures for trade liberalization to expand international trade." The Chinese Government hopes that, under the new world trade system, the developing countries "will have more adequate and equal opportunities for participation, and their interests will be practically reflected on the basis of special and preferential treatment." Touching on the issue of China's "reentry into GATT," Gu Yongjiang pointed out: China has conducted talks on its "reentry into GATT" for eight years. Meanwhile, to meet GATT's requirements and effectively fulfill its obligations, "China has continuously reformed its economic and trade systems, achieved success acknowledged worldwide, and provided rapidly increasing opportunities for foreign products and services to enter into its market." Concerning the World Trade Organization [WTO] to be established soon, Gu Yongjiang pointed out: "The establishment of the WTO signals the progress of multilateral world trade to a new phase of development." He further pointed out: "The body should be a world trade organization worthy of its name; it should have more representatives from all over the world than GATT has." He continued: "Only by attracting countries and regions with different economic characteristics and different levels of economic development to participate in the body" can the WTO guarantee the "effective operation" of its established multilateral trade system and "maintain its long-term growth and vitality." Finally, the head of the Chinese delegation emphatically pointed out: China has clearly and definitely requested becoming a founding member of the WTO. China's "reentry into GATT" and its becoming a member of the WTO "will be conducive to the establishment of a more open foreign trade system in China." He said: "With an economy that is enjoying vigorous development, an open market boasting a population of 1.2 billion, and being ranked 11th in world trade, China as a founding member of the WTO will undoubtedly enhance the universality and importance of the organization; and undoubtedly make important contributions to the prosperity of the world economy and growth of world trade." More than 40 delegation leaders took the floor at the conference yesterday afternoon and this morning. They all affirmed the results of the Uruguay round of talks, and hoped to further solve the problems existing in world trade and to improve the international trade system.
