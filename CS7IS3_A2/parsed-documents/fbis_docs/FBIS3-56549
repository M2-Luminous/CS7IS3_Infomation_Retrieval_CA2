Will it help resolve the issue of disarmament in general, both in Europe and on CIS territory? Is this primarily a new step or not? Third, to what extent will it help Ukraine's economy? [Kravchuk] The document is a continuation of the Ukrainian Supreme Council resolutions. If you recall, the reservations that it put forth were about compensation for tactical and strategic nuclear weapons, their technical maintenance, financial and technical aid, and security guarantees. These, approximately, were the main reservations of the Supreme Council. When you read that document, and it will be published, you will find that all of those demands were met. In other words, we can positively state that the executive branch has not been acting contrary to the Supreme Council resolutions but acting toward fulfilling the reservations put forth by the Supreme Council. I would like to emphasize this fact so that no one thinks, as some try to imply, that the president and the parliament were following their own separate courses. We did satisfy the reservations. I said in the past -- and I am confirming it now -- that we must join the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. This is my deep conviction, because everyone has already joined it -- Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and 131 countries. This is a normal step for Ukraine. This is why I hope that when we inform our parliament about our actions since December... [pauses] a very difficult time for Ukraine, which had to withstand pressure from all over the world. Not everyone understood our steps, not everyone understood our actions and there were grounds for this. This, I think, is a matter of principle. Now about your question as to who this document will serve. Both the talks with the U.S. President in Kiev and the trilateral talks have confirmed one irrefutable truth -- problems can be resolved only on the path of compromises and agreements. No reservations, no guarantees expressed in documents or agreements or declarations or anything else will be realized if one or another state follows the policy of confrontation instead of compromise. If, for instance, Ukraine... [pauses] now they say that Ukraine has been brought to its knees. This is absurd. First, Ukraine has come out of the situation with credit. We will be compensated and given assistance; we will be respected politically and in other ways. If we had opposed the adopted course and stood in the way of nuclear disarmament -- and it was anticipated -- if Ukraine had failed to fulfill its obligations, it would have blocked the further development of nuclear disarmament. It would have blocked it. START II depends on the resolution of the START I issue. I hope that there will be START III as well, and the final goal will be achieved in the total dismantling of nuclear weapons on our planet. Thus, Ukraine, having resolved this issue, unblocked nuclear disarmament for the whole world, for all of humanity. By taking this step Ukraine testified to the fact that there are no separate paths for Ukraine -- it follows the path of civilization and all human interest. This is the main issue for all the European and world community. By taking this step we have raised Ukraine's political prestige and image, we have confirmed that Ukraine's policies are predictable. Finally, there is one more point. Whatever they might say, there is an arrangement of forces in the world, an arrangement along political lines. And today, great powers are standing as the cornerstones of these forces and lines, including the United States of America. Relations among states develop depending on the influence made by these great powers. Whether one likes it or not, that's the way it is. Ambitions are out of place here. This is not a policy but just the basic way of thinking. If we -- contrary to the world's civilized development -- failed to accept compromises...[pauses] it does not mean that we have been humiliated; we have compromised, but the other party has also made compromises. Thus, we established normal relations. Let us imagine that Ukraine opposes the good will of other states, the good will of the world-wide development of nuclear disarmament, and the interests of the world states. However, not just their interests, but the common interests of mankind -- nuclear disarmament. This is important, because we can take into account the interests of the state. However, it will not coincide with the interests of mankind. What will be the international opinion of Ukraine? We, three presidents, of the United States, Ukraine, and Russia -- have reached an agreement and solved the issue in a civilized manner, in line with the reservations and the interests of the people of Ukraine. There are also economic perspectives opening for us; this was mentioned by President Clinton in Kiev. In other words, Ukraine is seen as a state that took those brakes off, enabling cooperation with the United States, with international financial organizations, and with Russia. Our acting prime minister, Yukhym Leonidovych Zvyahilskyy, and Defense Minister Radetskyy met today with their Russian counterparts and resolved a wide range of specific issues. Because, this [as heard] is the main barrier. Why is it the main barrier? Take for example, the military and technical side of the whole matter. We have nuclear weapons that we inherited, but we do not produce. Everyone, who understands at least something about this is aware that we are not capable of servicing them, providing maintenance. We just cannot keep them as a heavy burden on our shoulders. We cannot maintain them with due responsibility for our future and the future of our neighbors and all mankind. This has been proven by specialists and by everyone. Those who do not understand this are the ones who do not want to. Who is servicing nuclear weapons today? Russia. Well, when the president of Russia says: If you want to have nuclear weapons, why should we service them? He is right, is he not? This is a military and technical aspect. Further, look at the aspect of the use of nuclear weapons. Everybody knows it, and our minister said this, that some time in 1999 the service life of the nuclear weapons would expire. Excuse me, I am telling the entire nation that no reservations, no resolutions or edicts will prevent [as heard] the president, the defense minister, or the government when the service life of these horrible weapons expires. We are obliged to remove them because they are more dreadful than all the Chernobyl-type accidents taken together. And those people who accuse the executive authority today -- they either do not understand this or take advantage so as to confirm their particular policy, their particular course. There is yet another aspect. Take, for example, most superficial things. They say that recoding is possible, that something can be done to retain the nuclear arsenal as a deterrent. First, when it comes to the issue of recoding, it cannot be an abstract code. A question arises: Who is to be given the new code? Well, you ask those extreme forces -- they will tell you who -- I do not want to repeat the words. But the one who is to be given the new code -- will he wait until we finish recoding? What if someone would like it to be done, suddenly? Second, nuclear weapons require a nuclear industry. Without it these are not nuclear weapons. If all this is summed up...[pauses] and also it is necessary to have testing grounds to carry out tests. We do not have these. There is a whole complex of problems facing Ukraine. The situation can be assessed as follows: We have nuclear weapons. You do not touch us because if you come and do something suddenly, they can explode spontaneously, therefore you risk dying, together with us. In other words, this is an inhuman act. We have a dangerous thing in our hands which may explode. If it explodes and an opponent dies, it is his business, he himself makes his way to such an end. But he wants millions of people to die, our neighbors included. Who can put up with this? Who can regard this as normal? I cannot stop wondering if this is a political game, if this is an election game -- one can understand this somehow. But it is necessary to sit down at a table, place facts here and facts there. If these are facts they are facts. But if these are mere words and appeals, and deception of the people who experienced the Chernobyl catastrophe -- who knows what it is -- if these are attempts to put our people in jeopardy, presenting the people of the young state -- which is just in the making -- as a monster to the whole world, so that they would not recognize it in Europe and the world. This is not serious. This is why I think that this is our political, economic, humanistic victory. This is our victory. Not mine, not Ukraine's but our common victory. The victory of Ukraine, Russia, the United States of America, the victory of the entire world. If we all maintain friendship and normal relations with Russia and the United States and others, we will have our guarantees. But to oppose this, and exhibiting our high ambitions and proceeding from postulates having nothing to do with the understanding of the situation may be dangerous. I am happy with one matter: Those particularly vocal about this are a minority and they demonstrate their total ignorance, and second, presenting themselves as patriots they, as a matter of fact, do not help Ukraine with their actions, to put it mildly. [Reporter, HOLOS UKRAYINY newspaper] Leonid Makarovych, I have a question. The answer to it concerns many people: Will our state's national security be consolidated after today's signing [of the trilateral agreement]? If so, what changes for the better can be expected? [Kravchuk] It will be consolidated in the following aspect: We have already experienced a completely different attitude toward Ukraine--from Russia, for example. You have seen a different attitude toward us by the United States during the U.S. President's visit. I also have reports that NATO countries have come to understand Ukraine after receiving the bit of information which we still have to think over today. This way, the international environment and our neighbors have accepted Ukraine as a state that does not want evil but wants to live in friendship, partnership, and cooperation with other countries. This is the first point. Second, you understand that it is an illusion to say that the weapons we have owned were a deterrent. I have already told you about this deterrence; this is just a danger of deterrence rather than the deterrent. Because we are unable to produce, operate, restore, or service them--because we have nothing: neither industry nor testing grounds--what kind of deterrence can we talk about? This is an illusion of deterrence, but it was hammered into people's heads. The weapons have not been a guarantee of security, but a source of threat--and not only to Ukraine. This way, having won support from certain people and states, including powerful states, we have obtained security. Security does not mean signed documents. You know how many pacts have already been signed in history, how many other documents have been signed. However, they have been insufficient because a state policy has been against what has been signed. We want our policy to be implemented in real terms, in line with our civilized and anticipated concept, which has been approved. I am convinced that we have obtained security and opened the path to economic cooperation. We have also achieved a state's image. We have acted in line with our Supreme Council, and I am convinced that the majority of the people of Ukraine want this. [Reporter] At the recent news conference with Moldovan President Snegur you said something like this: The danger coming from the revanchist forces in Russia has increased. If such factors in the policy of our neighbor dominate, how do you think the signed agreement can be fulfilled and what mechanism of ensuring our national security do you see as the head of state? [Kravchuk] Well, first, I said this a little differently. I said I felt anxiety. [passage indistinct] However, the words danger and anxiety have subtle differences in connotation. Danger means that this is somewhere here... [pauses] As far as anxiety is concerned, it is known to me, and every person must feel it when complicated processes are under way. However, I will repeat that this is not a state policy but a political trend. Political trends have occurred in history, you know about that. Let us take the last 300 years, and we will find different trends in all spheres of social life: spiritual and political spheres, and this is a normal democratic phenomenon. However, such a tendency must not become a state policy. To prevent this, we must cooperate first of all with Russia. There are 205 million of us in Russia and Ukraine. Difficult processes are under way in our country too. One should not attribute them only to Russia. They are everywhere. Revanchists, nationalists, national patriots reveal themselves everywhere; they are coming out, because such is the time now. Let us prevent them from standing in the way of progressive development. This is a democratic way. However, to prevent this from becoming a state policy is our responsibility and our common concern. When we say that we have signed an agreement by three presidents today, this speaks volumes. Normal cooperation begins from this point: politically, economically, and spiritually. Those forces that today are in opposition will remain there. Opposition must exist, and there is nothing scary about this. However, one must not allow aggressiveness, and antipeople, antihumanitarian moods, hidden under patriotism, to dominate in society. We must not allow this. That is to say, I feel anxiety but I also have hope, because 14 January is a new page of understanding our problems, and a page comprised of new steps. I believe that these steps are aimed against what makes all of us apprehensive. [Reporter] At a brief news conference today the President of the United States of America noted that by signing the documents Ukraine has acquired...[pauses] has become more influential, has acquired more significance among countries of the world, and that many states will now cooperate with Ukraine. Moreover, Kostikov, press secretary of Russian President Boris Yeltsin, informed journalists that Great Britain is supposedly giving us security guarantees already. Is this true? [Kravchuk] Great Britain has given us security guarantees previously, but they were not formalized [ne oformleni]. You remember when I visited Great Britain: In the treaty I signed with the prime minister of Great Britain, it was noted that Great Britain--I do not remember the exact formula [word indistinct] -- grants Ukraine guarantees from the point of view of national security. However, this was an abstract formula. Now, the interpretation in the documents we signed is that both Great Britain and France I hope, and others will join in with this. But I want to repeat: Life is life. There are our hopes, opinions, our philosophical understanding of life in this world and society, but there are also practical actions. If we act practically and in an understandable way, we will in the end understand ourselves. I see that we take many steps that are difficult to explain. I will frankly say that December was possibly the most difficult time in our life for Ukraine, because the issue was real, not ephemeral or illusionary. The issue was the real international isolation of Ukraine, and this meant... I do not even want to use these words. But, for example, under a slogan of ultrapatriotism, all this is forgotten and people are deceived that Ukraine can survive in isolation or confrontation, or by conducting a policy aimed against states [word indistinct] and the interests of mankind. This is the truth, and everyone knows it. Excuse me, not everyone. Those who want to know -- know this. Those who do not want to know, or those who know but think differently, will never understand anyone. Due to that, this is what I believe. [Reporter] Mr. President, you used the words abstract formula to describe the agreement (?and so on). However, the statement saying that we have gained friends such as the United States and Russia also sounds abstract. Will you specify how those agreements you signed in Moscow guarantee Ukraine's security. [Kravchuk] First, let us put it this way. It is precisely noted that Russia and Ukraine [as heard] respect territorial integrity, the inviolability of borders, sovereignty, and independence of Ukraine. They respect and support Ukraine's independence, and this was stated by President Clinton. He always begins his speeches with the statement that Ukraine's independence is an important element of U.S. foreign policy. This is the first point. The second one is: If we join the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, those guarantees will acquire a more specific, I would say precise, nature, since today we are an undefined state. We have inherited nuclear weapons. We can neither use nor handle them, and I have talked about this, but we have not joined the treaty. What do we really want? Do we want to proliferate them or sell them? What do we want? The treaty has been joined by 131 countries. We must join the treaty. Then, the guarantees will acquire real meaning. Because they might ask us: Why do you want guarantees if you are a nuclear state? You can attack someone, not be attacked. This is an illusion, a nonsense that has developed in political... [pauses] I would say that this is political dualism, of which everyone is sick and tired. Only one who never wants to see anything does not see this. This is the point. Therefore, it is noted there. Additionally, an entire chapter was devoted to the economic situation, which gives Ukraine a real opportunity to join Europe's economic structure, including with Russia--(?no, not including)--but in the east with Russia, and with other states. An economic space is opening up, an international financial space. We are received as a state that fulfills its obligations, which were announced, by the way, during its independence. I would say that it is not prestigious for a state to jump from one point to another, even more so, in such a delicate and global sphere as nuclear (?weapons). [UNIAN correspondent] Do you think Ukraine, the United States, and Russia put a different value, I mean material value, on the nuclear weapons, which again will bring up the issue of disarmament? [Kravchuk] I do not think so. The United States, Ukraine, and Russia will conduct a joint examination. In addition, we already have international estimates on this. This is in no way a new thing. Let us say, each kilogram of uranium, its quality, there are evaluations, then, subtract the cost for enrichment of uranium, and it will be all taken into account. Given the mutual desire, I see no problems here. We said the following: We fulfill our obligations and you fulfill your obligations. If one party stops fulfilling its obligations, then the other party automatically stops fulfilling its part. I said this plainly. According to the agreement, we, for example, withdraw strategic nuclear weapons, 200 warheads, then we automatically receive compensation and the compensation for the tactical nuclear weapons. If someone somewhere begins to manipulate, we will publish a relevant statement that we are being deceived, let us speak plainly. However, I hope that under the current consensus of three presidents -- and what we achieved -- three presidents have signed this agreement -- when I spoke with the U.S. leadership they said: Mr. President, we put our honor at stake; we put the authority of a great world power at stake. For us, it was the most important thing -- exactly what we were pressing for. Not because we do not trust Russia. Complex processes are going on in Russia, both political and economic ones, just like here. So we should reckon with the possibilities of collisions and problems. But this is the state today that can be a guarantor, both for us and Russia. We have entered this system of thinking, this system of creating, this system of understanding, which [word indistinct] for the benefit of Ukraine. [Correspondent] What is the term for the withdrawal of nuclear weapons and what is the compensation for the strategic and tactical nuclear weapons? In addition, are our debts for oil and gas to be canceled? [Kravchuk] There are two constituents of this issue. The question of tactical nuclear weapons will soon be examined by experts from the United States, Russia, and Ukraine; they will evaluate the price, taking into account the (?weight) of what was transferred by us in 1991-92, and afterward we will determine the forms of compensation. Our debts will be taken into account, too. Compensation for strategic nuclear weapons has been determined long ago. The nuclear weapons will be withdrawn, say, these 200 warheads, their weight taken into account, and Ukraine will receive heat-generating elements for nuclear power plants. That is, we agreed as follows: We estimate that we will be secured... [pauses] for four or five years, will we not? [Kravchuk asks some of his aides] Thus, we will have free uranium for our power plants over a period of seven years. You should understand how important our power engineering is for us... [pauses] All this will be determined on the basis of the strict evaluations which will take into account our experience, as well as world experience. The term of the withdrawal will be adjusted depending on our capabilities. I have informed you that in 1999 the service life of all our warheads will come to an end. Is that so? [one of Kravchuk's aides replies "Yes"] [18 second passage indistinct] (?I would not have signed it) if the Supreme Council, say, (?does not now) ratify it [words indistinct]. I do not know. The service life of warheads [words indistinct] is coming up in March. And I know that the unforeseen could occur (?here) -- for Ukraine and for the world. (?So am I) going to look at this document? If I do not [word indistinct] it today, then I will be told tomorrow -- you work it out yourself. What sort of a state will we be in then? And who will understand us? What sort of civilized state and country, which (?like a savage) [words indistinct]. It is a terrible thing that our country brandishes its weapons and has no idea what to do with them. I am terrified to listen to some of our politicians who know nothing about politics, who do not want to know anything and do not want to take heed of anyone, and are driven only by their ambitions. Let me now read you a verse written by one of the members of the Ukrainian delegation wishing our country all the best. I will not name the author (?until afterwards). [Words indistinct] has written this verse. I want to speak about that [word indistinct], that spiritual, about that climate, which existed here when people could see that they had done something good for the state, for Ukraine. They did not give in, nor (?bend down), nor get down on their knees. When all were equal [words indistinct] it is obvious when someone is telling the truth and when [words indistinct] [Kravchuk reads the verse] It is good. [words indistinct]. Normal people understand what has happened now. A page has been turned. A page of new thinking has been turned, a new attitude toward Ukraine. And if we act consistently, this page will be filled with [word indistinct] words. The main thing is that Ukraine has not [as heard] started on the road of the great desire of mankind -- to get rid of nuclear weapons. (?It was wanted all the time) that it becomes a brake and enters history just in this way. And those politicians, who are now shouting something different, let them listen to those people. I wish you all the best.
