In his words, the "situation around the Chernobyl power plant has been excessively politicized and some are trying to use it for pressure on Ukraine." Speaking of the recent demands for immediate halt of the power plant, Parashin said specialists "have done much from 1986 through now to increase the plant's safety and improve all the parameters of its operation. We have a clear plan of further measures to the effect and they are been consistently taken." "Professionals are working at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, and all the capacities are normally operated. I am confident that the current state of the plant is much better than that of many facilities of other branches," said the plant director. The work of plant power units is under constant control over the state inspection for supervision over nuclear safety and other state bodies, he stressed. In case of any doubts, international experts, including those from the International Atomic Energy Agency, are invited. The situation at the "shelter" facility (the sarcophagus above the fourth power unit) is also under reliable control, and it provokes no serious concern over safety. The plant director referred to the conclusions of the IAEA commission outlined in the commission's draft report on results of its work at the plant in March 1994: "The Chernobyl nuclear power plant has held all the arrangements scheduled for power units with RBMK reactors after the Chernobyl accident. The safety level at the first and third power units is equal to that of corresponding power units at the Leningrad, Kursk and Smolensk nuclear power plants. "Despite the fact many highly-professional plant staffers have quitted, there are adequate resources for full staffing of the plant's six shifts to operate two power units. General impression of the control board personnel is `professionalism'." Unfortunately, said the director, "these essential provisions of the report were not included in the IAEA press release circulated so widely in mass media bodies."
