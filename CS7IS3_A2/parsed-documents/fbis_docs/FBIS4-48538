Mandela signed the proclamation in Umtata on Tuesday night which gives a further period of temporary immunity from prosecution for politically motivated "crimes". The proclamation was published in a Government Gazette Extraordinary the same night after the Minister of Justice requested the President to extend the terms from yesterday until May 17 1995. Returned exiles who re-entered South Africa and whose names appeared in three government notices published in May 1993 and February and March 1994 will be covered in the proclamation. The previous indemnity period, authorised by former State President FW de Klerk, expired on Tuesday. Its objective was to allow exiles who admitted to "political crimes" committed before October 8 1990 to return to South Africa to engage in constitutional negotiations. First promulgated in 1990, the Act became the Further Indemnity Act after it was amended in 1992. However, the new dispensation will not cover those who have committed criminal acts, whether political or not, since May 1993.
