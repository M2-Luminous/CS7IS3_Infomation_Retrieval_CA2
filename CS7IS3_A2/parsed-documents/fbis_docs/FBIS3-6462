The proposal, which also includes the country's agreement to treat ATM machines operated by foreign bank branches on equal terns with local banks, has been passed on to Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary. "Secretary Bentsen welcomes our proposal," Tharin said yesterday. He is leading a delegation of Thai officials to the meeting of finance ministers of 17 member countries of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec), which will start the official meeting on Saturday. The US government has been pushing for financial liberalization and market access under the new Gatt round. The new Gatt round due to be signed in the middle of April, hinges on the US demand that financial market access should be tied to the Gatt signing. The US is understood to be angry with other countries' refusal to meet financial market access demands on the ground that the Americans have the most liberalized market in the world. It is not clear yet what the US would do if the financial liberalization is not resolved by the middle of next month. Tharin said Thailand will be doing more than other Asean countries in opening up the financial market. He said five licencees of Bangkok International Banking Facilities (BIBF) will be upgraded to full branches by 1997. Thailand also told Bentsen that it is separating finance and securities companies which would allow foreign financial institutions to hold a 49 per cent stake in a securities company and up to 25 per cent in a finance company. Currently, foreigners can only hold up to 25 per cent of a finance and securities company. But Thai authorities have yet to define the ATM status of foreign banks; whether one machine will be counted as a branch or allowed to be classified in general terms under the national ATM pool system. "I don't mind either one or the other," Tharin said. Meanwhile, the US is threatening to pass a law to withdraw the most favoured nation status from countries which do not yield to its market access demand. But such action would contradict Gatt rules. At the same time, Tharin said Asean will have to hasten the implementation of Asean Free Trade Area (Afta)'s tariff cut programme from 15 years to 10-12 years. This is because the Gatt refuses to extend the 15-year tax cut process. The offer was part of a package proposal improved on the old version submitted to Gatt last December.
