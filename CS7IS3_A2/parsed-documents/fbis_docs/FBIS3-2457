On behalf of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, I extend felicitations to Chinese women of all nationalities, women compatriots in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao, and overseas Chinese women; as well as warm welcome to guests from various countries present here today. Chinese women constitute a great force for China's reforms and opening up and modernization. Since China adopted economic reforms and opened up to the outside world, there have been great changes in Chinese womens outlook, with remarkable progress in the quality of the women. Filled with ardor and sincerity, they have actively taken part in economic development; and have made important contributions in political, cultural, and social sectors, as well as in safeguarding family happiness. Chinese women enjoy a high status in society and they really hold up "half the sky" in building socialism with Chinese characteristics. At present, China, guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, enjoys economic growth, political stability, national unity, and social progress. In international relations, the Chinese Government has steadfastly implemented an independent foreign policy of peace; and has made positive contributions to developing good neighborly relations with peripheral countries, strengthening friendship with various nations in the world, and promoting world peace and development. China's international prestige has been enhanced, and China has friends everywhere in the world. In 1995, the United Nations will hold the Fourth World Womens Congress in Beijing. The congress is an important meeting to study womens issues of the world. It is a great honor for China to have the opportunity to prepare for and host the congress. The Chinese Government, Chinese people, and Chinese women will go all out to prepare for the congress, and will ensure its success. Only some 500 days are left until the Fourth World Womens Congress is convened. We should step up preparations and strengthen leadership over the preparatory work. All departments should work concertedly to provide favorable social milieus and first-rate service for the convocation of the congress. We should further attach importance to work related to women at home, guaranteeing their status, protecting their lawful rights and interests, and promoting their development and progress to ensure the realization of various goals set in the "Nairobi Strategy" before the end of this century. The broad masses of women should make further contributions to society while the community should do more concrete work for women. The mobilization and participation of the whole society will be a reliable guarantee for China's successful hosting of the Fourth World Womens Congress. Seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting development, and maintaining stability are the overall interests of the work for the whole country and of the work related to women this year. Womens federations at all levels should get a clear understanding of the overall interests, strive to do well in all fields of endeavor, and encourage women at large to dedicate themselves to the great cause of modernization. Once the strength of Chinese women is fully harnessed, they will play an immeasurable role in promoting social progress and prosperity. We earnestly hope that Chinese women will, on the basis of striving to improve their ideological, moral, cultural, science and technology, and physical qualities, make still greater contributions to promoting the building of material and spiritual civilization, realizing the motherland's peaceful reunification, and safeguarding world peace. Comrades, friends! China is at an important development period. It is the common will of all Chinese people, including Chinese women, to turn China into a prosperous, democratic, civilized modern socialist country. We believe that China's future is bright and the world future is broad. Let us, under the leadership of the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core, unite and work with one heart and one mind in striving from even greater victories in the cause of socialist modernization!
