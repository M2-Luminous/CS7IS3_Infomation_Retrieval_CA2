ACTION: Notice of Informal Hearing. SUMMARY: On November 18, 1993 EPA's Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics published a proposed rule to amend the requirements that govern the reclassification of certain PCB and PCB-Contaminated Transformers to a lower regulatory status as a PCB-Contaminated ( ; 50 to < 500 ppm PCBs) or a Non-PCB ( < 50 ppm PCBs) Transformer. In that notice, EPA said it would hold an informal hearing if requested. EPA received a request for a hearing on the proposed rule from the Electric Apparatus Service Association (EASA). Therefore, EPA will hold a half-day informal, public hearing. DATES: The hearing will take place on March 9, 1994 from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. Reply comments should be received on or before March 23, 1994. Written requests to participate in the hearing must be received on or before February 16, 1994. ADDRESSES: The hearing will be held at EPA Headquarters, 401 M St., SW., Washington DC, in conference room number 17 in the Washington Information Center (WIC). Three copies of the request to participate in the informal hearing, identified with the docket number OPPTS&hyph;66015A must be submitted to: OPPT Document Control Officer, Attn: TSCA Docket Receipts (7407), Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics, Rm. G&hyph;99, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. See SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION for the type of information that must be included in the request and who may participate. Requests for a waiver to participate in the informal hearing by those organizations that did not file main comments must be sent to EPA Headquarters Hearing Clerk, Mail Code 1900, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460.

An organization that has not filed main comments on the rulemaking will not be allowed to participate in the hearing, unless a waiver of this requirement is granted by the Record and Hearing Clerk (see ADDRESSES above) or the organization is appearing at the request of EPA or under subpoena (40 CFR 750.6(a)). A panel of EPA employees shall preside at the hearing, and one panel member will chair the proceedings.

After the close of the hearing, any participant in the hearing may submit a written request for cross-examination. The request shall be received by EPA no later than 1 week after a full transcript of the hearing becomes available (to determine when the transcript is available, interested persons may contact the Environmental Assistance Division (see FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT above)).
