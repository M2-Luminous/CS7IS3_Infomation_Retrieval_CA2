Some went so far as to say that the Lebanese Government intends to close down the Iraqi Embassy and deport the Iraqi diplomats. Pending the political results of the assassination, we review the security information connected with the murder. Al-Suhayl was killed in his house the day before yesterday. The investigation judge in Beirut issued arrest warrants against Khalid Khalaf, the commercial counsellor, and Muhammad Kazim, the cultural counsellor. Another arrest warrant was also issued against a third individual who reportedly participated in carrying out the murder and subsequently took refuge in the embassy. After learning of the the involvement of two Iraqi diplomats in the operation, the security forces laid an invisible siege around the embassy and arrested Khalaf and Kazim and found weapons, pistols, and silencers in their possession. 'Awad Fakhri, the Iraqi charge d'affaires in Lebanon, who was summoned to the Foreign Ministry, said: The foreign minister informed me of the incident. We support the Lebanese authorities and we respect the Lebanese judiciary. Fakhri denied that he had known that the dead man was an Iraqi national. Talib al-Suhayl was one of the chiefs of the Iraqi shiite tribe of Tamim. He left Iraq after the 1958 revolution and sought refuge in Jordan and then in Saudi Arabia. This explains why he carries Jordanian and Saudi passports. His name was mentioned in a number of papers a few weeks ago as having been involved in an attempt to assassinate President Saddam Husayn. The Foreign Ministry is considering ways to deal with this issue from the diplomatic viewpoint because the arrested diplomats enjoy diplomatic immunity. It has been learned that, as a precautionary measure, the Lebanese Embassy's charge d'affaires in Baghdad has been summoned to Beirut and has already left the Iraqi capital.
