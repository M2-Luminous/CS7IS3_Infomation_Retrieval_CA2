FBIS4-6777 "dreas079_c_94006" FBIS-EAS-94-079 Daily Report 22 Apr 1994 North Korea U.S. Conducts `Aerial Mobile Deployment' Exercise U.S. Conducts `Aerial Mobile Deployment' Exercise SK2304040194 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 1200 GMT 22 Apr 94 SK2304040194 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 1200 GMT 22 Apr 94 Korean BFN [Text] According to military sources, the U.S. imperialists conducted aerial mobile deployment exercises on 21 April by flying various aircraft, including fighter-bomber planes loaded with nuclear weapons, to South Korea from its overseas bases. On 21 April, some 10 fighter-bomber planes, pursuit-assault planes, and vertical take-off and landing attack planes loaded with nuclear weapons took off from Okinawa and Yokosuka bases in Japan for deployment to the U.S. Air Force bases occupying South Korea. The frantic war exercise was aimed at evaluating a speedy deployment to the Korean peninsula and actual fighting deployment capabilities. On the other hand, on 20 April, KC-135 refueling planes flew from overseas bases over the sea off Kunsan, South Korea, and were frenzied with war fever by refueling tens of fighter-bomber planes and pursuit-assault planes, which were running wild in night aerial war exercises, from 1900 [1000 GMT] to 2200 [1300 GMT]. On 21 April, the South Korean puppets frantically exercised gun firing and helicopter sorties right in front of our nose near the DMZ. That day, 105-mm large-caliber artillery groups, which occupied firing positions in Naedae-ri, Chorwon County, Kangwon Province, and Magori, Yonchon County, Kyonggi Province in South Korea, fired tens of bomb shells near the DMZ. The puppet Army's armed gangsters, which occupied combat positions in Yongsan-ri, Paju County, Kyonggi Province, and Kangsan-ri and Yangjae-ri, Chorwon County in the South Korean Kangwon Province, wielded a horrible war frenzy by randomly shooting some 1,000 shots of large-caliber machine guns. In addition, on the same day, the puppet Army's armed helicopters and transport helicopters ran wild in exercising ground support and air transport in the skies over areas adjacent to Pochon, Yonchon, and Chorwon of the South Korean Kangwon Province. The fire game commotion of the U.S. imperialists and South Korean puppets is further aggravating the war risk on the Korean peninsula.
