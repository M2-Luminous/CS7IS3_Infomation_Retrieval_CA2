The trip also gave him the opportunity to make contact with Palestinian personalities and look at ways to increase aid in these fields to the populations of Gaza and Jericho. Cooperation between the two countries was reviewed on 23 November, in Jerusalem, at the second meeting of the Franco-Israeli High Scientific Council, with Mr. Fillon and Mrs. Shulamit Aloni, the Israeli research minister, in attendance. Created in 1987, this body previously had met only once, in 1989. "We want to participate in the building of peace in the Middle East," Mr. Fillon said at a press conference following the meeting. "We must take political progress into account and thus to consider cooperation in different modalities. There is every reason now to put obstacles of the past behind us. We are ready to participate in development of the (occupied) territories, in projects desired by the Palestinians. In our view, scientific and technical cooperation is indeed the foundation of peace and development." It can "efface differences in economic levels, reduce tension, and thus facilitate peace." French and Israeli representatives agreed at the meeting to launch two new high-priority programs, in immunology and in basic research on composite materials; each project will be allotted a half-million dollars per year for a two-year period. Allocation of such large sums "demonstrates the commitment of our two governments to continue with the science and technology cooperation" which began many years ago and will now, according to Mr. Fillon, be "redoubled again." Both sides noted the "exemplary character and high quality" of Franco-Israeli cooperation. The two new programs will be launched in the next few months. They were proposed by the scientists themselves because of their innovative character, the excellent scientific potential of the two countries in these domains, and lastly because, as the French minister put it, collaborative efforts by researchers from the two scientific communities in these fields "are very likely to yield positive results." Also discussed was the possibility of broadening the already good bilateral cooperation on health problems to include other Mediterranean basin countries. An initial meeting on the subject may be held next year. On 24 November Mr. Fillon traveled to the Palestinian University of Bir-Zeit (about twenty kilometers from Jerusalem), which was closed by Israeli authorities from 1988 to 1992 because of the "Intifada" ("war of stones"). The visit of the French minister for higher education and research coincided, by chance, with the holding of Bir-Zeit's first student council elections. The president of that large university group, Mr. Hanna Nassir--a member of the Palestinian High Council, he was allowed to return to Bir-Zeit only last April--said he was delighted to have Mr. Fillon visit the campus "at such a decisive moment" for the "national development" of the Palestinian people. "We know we can count on France, which has taught the world the true meaning of the word liberty," to furnish aid to the eight Palestinian universities, which have a combined enrollment of 20,000 students and a budget in the neighborhood of US$26 million. "France has always supported your right to control your own destiny," said Fillon. "We will continue to support that goal. I am here to tell you that the French Government is ready to cooperate with your universities, so that the system you have already begun building, under difficult circumstances, will be able to take on new dimensions." "We are ready to support the Bir-Zeit juridical [education] center, the creation of a master's program in public administration, the training of administrative support personnel, the establishment of an autonomous Palestinian degree course--with instruction in the French language, of course--the expansion of education in technical fields, and to cooperate in research programs that correspond to your needs." And to engage in academic exchange programs. "As I see it," the minister added, "scientific and technological cooperation is a decisive factor for the establishment of a durable peace throughout the region." During his visit to Israel, Mr. Fillon also held talks with Education Minister Amnon Rubinstein and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres. 30-Year Cooperation Franco-Israeli cooperation in science, technology, higher education, and cultural affairs dates back more than 30 years. Launched in 1959 by a governmental cooperation accord, it has been in existence ever since, albeit subject to the vicissitudes of politics and the complexities entailed by the risk of knowledge transfer to a country that has very high scientific potential. Israel treats research as a "national priority" and in fact devotes to it three percent of gross domestic product [GDP], compared to 2.4 percent for France. Scientific and technological cooperation is effected both through the Franco-Israeli Association for Scientific and Technological Research (AFIRST) and under the rubric of direct accords between French research bodies (CNRS [National Scientific Research Center], INSERM [National Institute of Health and Medical Research], INRA [National Institute of Agronomic Research], INRIA [National Institute for Research on Data Processing and Automation], the Pasteur Institute) and their Israeli counterparts (Weizmann Institute, Technion, Volcani Institute, etc.) or Israel's National Council for Research and Development (CNRD). The commitment to strengthen cooperation was underlined by both sides during President Mitterrand's official visit to Israel in November 1992 and Mr. Yitzhak Rabin's visit to Paris last June. Since then, concurrently with the High Scientific Council, a High Council on Research and Industry was established; still under discussion is the proposed creation of a $250 million Binational Fund to finance basic research projects and the creation of industrial partnerships. Frenchmen and Israelis are cooperating in such varied fields as life sciences, mathematics, composite materials, immunology, virology, biology, botanical biotechnologies, research on arid and desert zones, and hydrobiology. Despite the existence of 29 inter-university accords, exchange students are few--only 223 Israelis, 50 percent of them in the humanities, are studying in France--because of the drawing power of American universities. Despite the existence of a French-speaking community of about 500,000 persons, the French language is clearly on the decline in Israel, both because it enjoys no official status in the education system (whereas English and Arabic are mandatory), and because since 1962 Hebrew has been among the 14 living languages in which applicants may take the French university entrance examination.
