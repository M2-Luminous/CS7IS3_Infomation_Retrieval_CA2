Each day that passes curiously resembles the one before it. We all know that faced with the wall of misunderstanding erected before him by the two political forces on the scene -- each of which stuck steadfastly to its guns regarding the appointment of the interim prime minister -- Monsignor Monsengwo-Pasinya, HCR-PT speaker, submitted for consideration by yesterday's plenary session a proposal based on the appointment of a head of government by a political group other than that of the president of the Republic. This head of government will set up a truly national unity team that will have to inspire the confidence of the HCR-PT before it is formally enacted into office by an executive instrument. Today's plenary session therefore centered on this proposal by the HCR-PT speaker but there too, [Oscar] Kambamba Kasongo, it was, unfortunately, a fiasco. Good evening, Oscar. [Kasongo] Good evening. You are perfectly right. It was yet another fruitless plenary session today at the HCR-PT, where the two forces in the arena -- two forces, surely, because there is bipolarity -- were unable to agree. The main thrust of this disagreement which has lasted the past four days may be summed up by two notions, namely, the source of legitimacy of power and the method of appointing the interim prime minister. For the Sacred Union -- i.e., the Sacred Union of the Radical Opposition and Allies [USORAS] -- there is no alternative forum to the Sovereign National Conference [CNS] because everyone took part in that conference and participated in electing Prime Minister Tshisekedi, and also because the two parties present contributed to the drafting of the deed setting forth the constitutional arrangements for the transition period. The Political Forces of the Conclave [FPC] find their legitimacy in the new forum offered by the HCR-PT, the only institution that should appoint the prime minister and to which the latter and his team will be fully answerable. The head of government must therefore be elected by that institution because the office of prime minister is vacant at the moment. He must also be elected from among several aspirants. In short, therefore, these are the stakes on the floor at the People's Palace. This evening, Counselor Kamanda wa Kamanda, on behalf of USORAS, rejected the proposal put forward yesterday by the [HCR-PT] executive organ and categorically ruled out that put forward this very evening by Counselor Mutomoba Kafansenda on behalf of his political group. This new FPC proposal may be summed up as follows: The prime minister should be elected by the HCR-PT by a simple majority vote from among candidates put up by political camps other than that of the head of state. You perfectly understand the issue: The proposal was rejected because it contains the notion of election by the HCR-PT, instead of by consensus. The Rally of Forces for Democratic Change, commonly known as the Allies, also attempted to end the deadlock by making a proposal, which was equally turned down because it contains the idea of election by the HCR-PT. In short, two points in the various formulas proposed receive the approval of the two political groups. These are: The prime minister is the head of government. That is accepted by everyone. Also, he must be installed in office by the head of state. That point is also accepted. So the disagreement centers mainly on whether the election of the prime minister should be done by the CNS or even by the HCR-PT. Opinions here depend on whether one belongs to the USORAS or to the FPC. This is where the four-day old deadlock -- for that is what it is -- really lies. The executives, with the assistance of the parliamentary group, has undertaken to handle the dispute which will be examined on 16 March from 1000 local time. It may be recalled that what we refer to here as parliamentary group is simply a group that will comprise the various representatives of the forces on the scene.
