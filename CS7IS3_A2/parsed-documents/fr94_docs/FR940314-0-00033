SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Introduction In a notice published in the Federal Register of August 6, 1990 (55 FR 31897), FDA announced that a color additive petition (CAP 0C0224) had been filed by Concept, Inc., 11311 Concept Blvd., Largo, FL 34643. The petition proposed that the color additive regulations in §74.3602 D&C Violet No. 2 (21 CFR 74.3602) be amended to provide for the safe use of D&C Violet No. 2 as a color additive in poly( e -caprolactone) absorbable sutures for general surgery. Since the publication of the filing notice, Concept, Inc., has changed its name to Linvatec Corp. The petition was filed under section 706 (currently section 721) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 376) (currently 21 U.S.C. 379e). II. Regulatory History The regulatory history of D&C Violet No. 2 is summarized in a final rule published in the Federal Register of May 7, 1990 (55 FR 18865). In the May 1990, final rule FDA permanently listed D&C Violet No. 2 for use in coloring polymethylmethacrylate intraocular lens haptics (§74.3602) in response to a color additive petition (CAP 9C0216). In that final rule, FDA also transferred the listings for the use of the color additive in sutures from §74.1602 (21 CFR 74.1602) under Subpart B_Drugs to §74.3602 under Subpart D_Medical Devices. Since the publication of the May 7, 1990, final rule, §74.3602 has been amended to provide for the safe use of D&C Violet No. 2 as a color additive in poliglecaprone 25 ( e -caprolactone/glycolide copolymer) absorbable sutures. III. Applicability of the Act With the passage of the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 (Pub. L. 94&hyph;295), Congress mandated the listing of color additives for use in medical devices when the color additive in the device comes into direct contact with the body for a significant period of time (21 U.S.C. 379e(a)). D&C Violet No. 2 is added to the poly( e -caprolactone) absorbable sutures in such a way that at least some of the color additive will come into contact with the body when the sutures are in place. In addition, the sutures are intended to be absorbed by the body, and during the absorption, the color additive will be deposited in body tissue. Thus, the color additive will be in direct contact with the body for a significant period of time. Consequently, the use of the color additive currently before the agency is subject to the statutory listing requirement. IV. The Color Additive D&C Violet No. 2 is principally 1-hydroxy-4-[(4-methylphenyl)amino]-9,10-anthracenedione (CAS Reg. No. 81&hyph;48&hyph;1). It is manufactured by either condensation of quinizarin with p -toluidine or by condensation of 1-hydroxy-halogenoanthroquinone with p -toluidine. Because no chemical reaction consumes all the starting materials and yields only the desired product, both the resulting reaction mixture and commercial product will contain residual amounts of the starting materials, including p -toluidine. This fact is significant because Weisburger et al. have demonstrated that p -toluidine is a carcinogen in mice (Ref. 1). Residual amounts of reactants, such as p -toluidine and other manufacturing aids, are commonly found among the impurities of many color additives. The presence of such impurities is not unique to color additives. Numerous minor impurities are present in all chemical products, even in highly purified reagent-grade chemicals. V. Determination of Safety Under section 721(b)(4) of the act (21 U.S.C. 379e(b)(4)), the so-called ``general safety clause'' for color additives, a color additive cannot be listed for a particular use unless a fair evaluation of the data and information available to FDA establish that the color additive is safe for that use. FDA's color additive regulations (21 CFR 70.3(i)) define ``safe'' as ``a reasonable certainty in the minds of competent scientists that the substance is not harmful under the intended conditions of use.'' The anticancer or Delaney clause of the Color Additive Amendments (section 721(b)(5)(B) of the act) provides that a noningested color additive shall be deemed unsafe and shall not be listed if, after tests that are appropriate for evaluating the safety of the additive for such use, it is found to induce cancer in man or animal. Importantly, however, the Delaney clause applies to the additive itself and not to constituents of the additive. That is, where an additive itself has not been shown to cause cancer, but contains a carcinogenic impurity, the additive is properly evaluated under the general safety clause using risk assessment procedures to determine whether there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result from the proposed use of the additive, Scott v. FDA , 728 F.2d 322 (6th Cir. 1984). VI. Safety of the Petitioned Use of the Additive FDA estimates that the upper limit of lifetime exposure to D&C Violet No. 2 from its use in coloring poly( e -caprolactone) absorbable sutures is 3.7 milligrams (mg) per person (0.15 micrograms (μg) per person per day). The agency calculated this upper limit of lifetime exposure based on several factors. First, the color additive will be used at a level of 0.1 percent by weight of the poly( e -caprolactone) absorbable sutures. Second, the agency made four assumptions: (1) Five meters is the maximum total length of suture likely to be used in a single surgical operation, and 10 meters of suture would be used in multiple operations over a person's lifetime; (2) a lifespan of 70 years follows initial suture implantation; (3) a size 2 suture is used for general surgery; and (4) 100 percent of the color additive migrates from the suture into the body. Because these are conservative assumptions, the lifetime exposure to D&C Violet No. 2 from its use in coloring poly( e -caprolactone) absorbable sutures is likely to be far less than 3.7 mg per person (0.15 μg per person per day). FDA does not ordinarily consider chronic toxicological testing to be necessary to determine the safety of an additive whose use will result in such low exposure levels (Ref. 2), and the agency has not required such testing in this case. Although the agency does not normally require such testing, chronic studies supporting current listings for the use of D&C Violet No. 2 are available in the agency's files, and FDA's safety evaluation of the proposed use of the color additive in absorbable sutures included a consideration of these studies. Two-year carcinogenicity studies of dyed sutures implanted in rats and a lifetime skin-painting study in mice showed no indication of carcinogenicity. Additionally, teratology studies of sutures implanted in rats and rabbits exhibited no evidence of teratogenic effects. In its evaluation of the safety of the proposed use of the subject additive, FDA has also considered other safety data submitted previously to support current listings for the use of D&C Violet No. 2. These toxicity studies of D&C Violet No. 2 included acute oral toxicity studies in rats and dogs, acute toxicity studies of dyed sutures and suture components in rats and mice, an evaluation of the tissue response to dyed sutures implanted intramuscularly in rats, a biological evaluation of dyed sutures implanted in rabbit's eyes, a study of the tissue reaction to the color additive injected into rabbit muscle, in vitro cytotoxicity studies, a pyrogenicity study of sutures, 7-month toxicity studies of implanted sutures in rats and dogs, a 119-day evaluation of dyed sutures implanted intramuscularly in rats, and six mutagenicity studies, including one Salmonella /reverse mutation test (Ames test) using extracts of dyed sutures, one study of chromosomal aberrations using dyed suture in Chinese hamster ovary cells, one study of in vitro transformation using dyed suture in Balb/c-3T3 cells, two mouse lymphoma forward mutation assays using dyed suture, and one mouse lymphoma toxicity assay of dyed suture. In addition, FDA evaluated the toxicity studies that the petitioner provided to support the proposed use of D&C Violet No. 2 in poly( e -caprolactone) absorbable sutures for general surgery. These studies included a hemolysis test by direct contact, a direct contact cytotoxicity test on mouse fibroblast cells using extracts of dyed sutures, a systemic toxicity test in mice using extracts of dyed sutures, a guinea pig sensitization maximization test using extracts of dyed sutures, a test of intracutaneous toxicity in rabbits using extracts of dyed sutures, implantation tests (7, 32, and 89 days, and 6 and 9 months) in rabbits, a Salmonella /mammalian mutagenicity test using extracts of dyed sutures, 52- and 32-week implantation tests in rats, and 60- and 62-day evaluations of absorbable suture following abdominal wound closure in rabbits. There were no significant adverse effects from D&C Violet No. 2 in any of the studies evaluated by the agency. Therefore, the agency has concluded that these studies in conjunction with previously submitted studies establish the safety of the proposed use of D&C Violet No. 2 as a color additive in poly( e -caprolactone) absorbable sutures. FDA has evaluated the safety of this additive under the general safety clause, considering all available data. The agency has also used risk assessment procedures to estimate the upper-bound limit of risk presented by p -toluidine, a carcinogenic chemical that may be present as an impurity in the additive. The risk evaluation of p -toluidine has two aspects: (1) Assessment of the exposure to the impurity from the proposed use of the additive and (2) extrapolation of the risk observed in the animal bioassays to the conditions of probable exposure to humans. A. p-Toluidine Using risk assessment procedures, FDA estimates that the maximum total lifetime exposure to p -toluidine that will result from the use of poly( e -caprolactone) absorbable sutures colored with D&C Violet No. 2 that complies with the applicable specifications is 0.3 nanograms (ng) per person per day. The agency used data reported by the National Cancer Institute, which demonstrated that p -toluidine was carcinogenic for male and female Charles River CD-1 (HaM/ICR derived) mice, causing an increased incidence of hepatomas (liver tumors) (Ref. 1), to estimate the upper-bound limit of lifetime human risk from exposure to this chemical stemming from the proposed use of D&C Violet No. 2 as a color additive in poly( e -caprolactone) absorbable sutures (Ref. 3). Based on a potential exposure of 0.3 ng per person per day, the upper-bound limit of individual lifetime risk from the potential exposure to p -toluidine from the proposed use of D&C Violet No. 2 as a color additive in poly( e -caprolactone) absorbable sutures is 2x10 -11 , or 2 in 100 billion (Ref. 3). Because of the numerous conservatisms in the exposure estimate, actual lifetime-averaged individual exposure to p -toluidine is expected to be substantially less than the worst-case estimated daily exposure. Therefore, the actual risk would be less than 2x10 -11 . Thus, the agency concludes that there is a reasonable certainty of no harm from exposure to p -toluidine that might result from the proposed use of D&C Violet No. 2 for coloring poly( e -caprolactone) absorbable sutures. B. Specifications D&C Violet No. 2 is currently produced as a certifiable color additive for use in externally applied drugs and cosmetics, in sutures, and in contact lenses in accordance with 21 CFR part 80. Based upon the low level of exposure to p -toluidine that results under the current specifications for D&C Violet No. 2 in §74.1602, the agency concludes that the specifications listed in §74.1602 are adequate to ensure the safe use of this color additive and to control the amount of p -toluidine that may exist as an impurity in the color additive when used in poly( e -caprolactone) absorbable sutures. VII. Conclusions Based upon the available toxicity data and the other relevant considerations discussed above, FDA concludes that there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result from the petitioned use of D&C Violet No. 2 for coloring poly( e -caprolactone) absorbable sutures when it is used at a level not to exceed 0.1 percent by weight of the suture material. The agency also concludes on the basis of available data that the color additive will perform its intended coloring effect in poly( e -caprolactone) absorbable sutures and, thus, is suitable for this use. The agency, therefore, is amending §74.3602 of the color additive regulations to provide for use of the color additive at a maximum level of 0.1 percent by weight in poly( e -caprolactone) absorbable sutures. VIII.
