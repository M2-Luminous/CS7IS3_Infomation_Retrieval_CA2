Li Chu-ming, chairman of Hong Kong Alliance, described it as an excellent change to accommodate the new developments in the overall situation. Writing the political program of the new party is an opportunity that will allow incorporating some of Meeting Point's ideas on China. When the Hong Kong Alliance was founded in 1990, it resented being mixed up by outsiders with the "Chih Lian Hui," and it therefore described itself in contradistinction as a local political organization based on Hong Kong, closely interested in every policy of the Chinese Government that concerns Hong Kong, but "without any intention of involving itself in the politics of Chinese territory outside of Hong Kong." In observance of this principle, the Hong Kong Alliance has all along declined to involve itself in China's internal affairs, and it has, indeed for this reason, been criticized by outsiders that it lacked a China policy and lacked discernment in matters Chinese. On the other hand, Meeting Point had decided already at the time of its founding in 1983 on a set of "New Three People's Principles," i.e. on a "return to democracy" standpoint. In its political program it clearly outlined as the role of the people of Hong Kong "to contribute to the development of China," and it supported in a variety of forms and through solid contacts the progressive forces inside and outside the system. As to its China policy, it emphasized in even stronger terms adoption of a "critical relationship." In the 10 prominent paragraphs of the manifesto on the organization of the new party, there is one paragraph that asserts that the people of Hong Kong are a part of the Chinese people "with the right and responsibility to participate in and deliberate on national affairs." This reflects a quite different attitude on the China question than that of the Hong Kong Alliance. Yesterday, Li Chu-ming expressed to this reporter that writing the political program of the new party will provide an opportunity to further elucidate and concretely stipulate the attitude toward China. He pointed out that the closer we get to 1979, the more reason there is for the people of Hong Kong to concern themselves with the affairs of China, and it is also clearly written in the constitution of the PRC that the Chinese people have the right and duty to do just that. He said, in the past the attitude of the Hong Kong Alliance had been that the people of Hong Kong should not concern themselves with policies and measures that had only to do with China's internal affairs, and that they should not comment on such. However, from now on there will be a change in that they should make their position clear on particular events whenever necessary. He believes "it is a good thing to clarify policy `toward China.'" The two parties appointed 16 delegates to form a combined preparatory committee to implement the merger and may later set up another team with the particular responsibility to write the political program of the new party. Li Chu-ming indicated that the Hong Kong Alliance will of course incorporate some points of the Meeting Point's political program. He said: "Wherever the Hong Kong Alliance lacks competent people and specialized knowledge, things from Meeting Point will be taken over." On the question of policy toward the Chinese Government, he declared: "We shall certainly approve of everything good, and everything that is not, we shall oppose." The Hong Kong Alliance has shifted from avoiding involvement in internal affairs to actively facing problems of that nature, and is displaying precisely the attitude of a "critical relationship" that Meeting Point had advocated all along. Meeting Point's political program contained its standpoint on six eminent problems in China-Hong Kong relations, namely: the state's nationality principle, consideration of legal principles, the 4 June incident, the role of the people of Hong Kong, participation in national affairs, and the "critical relationship." As far as the Hong Kong Alliance is concerned, it did not display concrete principles, but merely emphasized the principle of "promoting mutual relations between China and Hong Kong outside of the political area." What changes there will be in the political program of the new party will certainly deserve our close attention.
