The decision was taken at a meeting in Kiev between delegations from the two parliaments. Viktor Mezhak, deputy chairman of the Crimean Supreme Council reported that representatives from the Ukrainian parliament were expected to arrive in Simferopol on Friday [27 May]. It was recognized that it would be more sensible to hold the dialogue in Crimea, since such contradictory information is being received about the situation here. We think that the mutual understanding found in Kiev will be strengthened, he said. According to Mezhak, the Crimean delegation considered it particularly important to set out its point of view as clearly and as specifically as possible: There is no question of redrawing Ukraine's borders. Political integration within the framework of the CIS sets a good example, the deputy chairman of the Crimean Supreme Council stressed, Crimea cannot survive without Ukraine but relations must be built on equal terms.
