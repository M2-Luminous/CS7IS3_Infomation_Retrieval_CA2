The organisation, Human Rights Watch/Asia, scorned Clinton's assessment that China had complied with several conditions on human rights that he linked to renewal of most-favoured-nation status, which gives Chinese goods lucrative customs access to the US market. "Far from improving, the overall human rights situation has significantly worsened in the year since (Clinton's) executive order (on MFN conditions) was issued," the group said in a statement issued here. The decision was "one more capitulation on human rights," the statement said. "President Clinton has effectively removed all pressure on China to improve its human rights practices," said Sidney Jones, Human Rights Watch/Asia's executive director. "Clinton has left his administration looking vacillating and hypocritical, while the Chinese leadership, by contrast, has emerged as hard-nosed, uncompromising and victorious. We're deeply disappointed by this decision." Human Rights Watch/Asia -- formerly known as Asia Watch -- enjoys a strong reputation as an independent monitor of human rights in China. Earlier this month, it released a report documenting what it said were the cases of several hundred protesters, seized in the crackdown of the 1989 pro-democracy movement, who remain behind bars. The statement issued Friday said the leading dissidents, workers and religious activists would now be more vulnerable to persecution and arrest, given that Chinese leaders "understand that a crackdown would not bring about a disruption of trade." "Dozens of dissidents had their trials or sentences postponed while the Chinese government awaited Washington's decision," it said. "Now they can happen with little fear of persecution."
