Although Chiapas State heads the government's list for social investment, new plans to fight poverty, despair, and historical backwardness in this state will be announced today; for that purpose, Social Development Secretary Rojas Gutierrez arrived in Tuxtla Gutierrez today. Accompanied by federal and state officials, he immediately convened a roundtable, which will involve new government institutions. Meeting participants recognized the problems caused by existing backwardness in Chiapas State that basically affect the Indians. They noted, however, that for the past five years the government has considered Chiapas a priority for social investments, which have been increased by more than 1,000 percent during that period. New economic and technical assistance to satisfy the needs of this neglected state will be defined during this meeting. Chiapas Governor Elmar Zetzer again urged Chiapas residents this morning not to heed rumors. He reaffirmed that the Mexican Army will certainly have the situation totally under control soon.
