In his view, Russia forced Shevardnadze to change his Western orientation. According to Chanturia, there is a big difference between Eduard Shevardnadze as he was at the time of the expulsion of Zviad Gamsakhurdia and now as head of state. The head of state is conducting non-Georgian policies today. If anyone should fear the return of Gamsakhurdia, it is his family. However, the return of the ex-president would have been preferable to the partial destruction of his supporters and to Samegrelo's [Mingrelia] abandonment as a zone under virtual Russian occupation as, in these conditions, everything would have been given its proper name. In our case, Western countries gave a very negative assessment of the use of Russian troops against Zviad Gamsakhurdia's supporters in western Georgia. As a result of this decision, Shevardnadze has permanently distanced himself from the West. Giorgi Chanturia believes that Interior Minister Igor Giorgadze has been sent to Georgia by the Russian special services in order to neutralize the head of state himself. In the view of the NDP leader, the NDP is the only real force in Georgia today that supports Georgian statehood. Chanturia did not participate in the 11 October elections as he did not consider it was necessary at that time to become head of state. However, he now fears that, in spite of his reluctance, he will have to participate in the elections that are expected to be held in the spring. In the event of his victory, Giorgi Chanturia has promised us that he will establish order in one month but he does not know how to deal with the economy. So, the National-Democrats have finally distanced themselves from the former [Soviet] foreign minister whom they brought to Georgia. It is interesting to know who will follow their example next year.
