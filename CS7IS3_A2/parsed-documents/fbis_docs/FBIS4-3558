However, a lot of problems remain to be tackled and call for the joint efforts of all parties concerned, Mubarak said. China welcomes the progress of the talks, Jiang said. History has shown that conflicts between different countries can only be solved through peaceful negotiations. Yet, the Middle East issue is very complicated and it is only too natural to encounter some difficulties and obstacles in the process, he said. "We hope all the parties concerned continue their flexible and practical attitude, overcome obstacles and make strenuous efforts to make the talks a complete success at an early date," Jiang said. China will continue to do its part in pushing forward the peace process and in the realization of a complete peace in the region, he said. China highly values the role Egypt plays in the Middle East, he said, adding that it appreciates Egypt's efforts in maintaining the interests of the Arab people and the just rights of the Palestine people, and in propelling the peace process forward. On the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula, Jiang said that China maintains that the issue be settled properly through consultations and negotiations between the four parties concerned. "We don't favor imposing pressure or sanctions on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea," he said. "We believe that imposing pressure or sanctions can only make things more complicated." Egypt holds identical views on this matter, Mubarak told Jiang. The two leaders also exchanged views on Somalia and South Africa, and briefed each other on their respective countries' situations. Mubarak invited Jiang to visit Egypt. Jiang accepted the invitation.
