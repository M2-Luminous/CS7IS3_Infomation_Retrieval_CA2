Takemura called in vice ministers in charge of trade, agriculture and construction to the prime minister's official residence and made the request, government officials said. It is unprecedented that the chief cabinet spokesman gave such instructions directly to top bureaucrats of the government ministries and agencies, the officials added. In a related development, the second round of talks between ministers concerned with external economic affairs will be held on Thursday rather than Wednesday as originally scheduled, government sources said. The ministers will discuss measures to further open Japanese markets to foreign products as part of the nation's voluntary efforts to reduce its huge trade surplus.
