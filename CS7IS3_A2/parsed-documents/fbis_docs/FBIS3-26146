Suiting the needs of establishing a socialist market economic structure and quickening the pace of national defense and military legislation. According to the Central Military Commission's legislation plan during the Eighth Five-Year Plan period, which is signed by Chairman Jiang Zemin, and accepted by Vice Chairmen Liu Huaqing and Zhang Zhen after the conclusion of the First Session of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC], Qin Jiwei, vice chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, and Chi Haotian, minister of national defense, convened and presided over a symposium on national defense legislation, which was participated in by the newly elected members of the NPC Standing Committee and its special committees from the armed forces, as well as leading cadres from relevant units of the three general departments of the Central Military Commission. The symposium analyzed and studied the situation in military legislation and proposed to accelerate the work of national defense and military legislation. Having been approved by the State Council and the Central Military Commission, a national defense law drafting committee was set up, and the curtain was finally raised on drafting the "Law on National Defense"--a basic law which will play a leading role in the building of national defense and the armed forces. As required by the abovesaid plan, nine military and military administrative laws and regulations including "Regulations on Soldiers in Active Service," "Regulations on Management of Wireless Facilities," "Regulations on Garrisons on Duty," "Regulations on Management of Logistic Grass-roots Units," and "Stipulations on Filing of Military and Military Administrative Rules and Regulations" have been formulated, revised, or promulgated in recent years. The general departments, armed services and branches, major military regions, and the Commission of Science, Technology, and Industry for National Defense have also promulgated more than 600 military and military administrative rules and regulations, which have provided the legal basis for the Army's drive for modernization, and have exercised a positive role in defending the state's military interests, safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of the Army and military personnel, maintaining a high degree of stability, centralization, and unity in the Army, and enhancing the fighting capacity of the troops. Vigorously intensifying the enforcement, supervision, and examination of the military law and facilitating the implementation of the principle of administering the Army according to laws. Leading cadres and organs at all levels have repeatedly enhanced the consciousness of administering the Army in accordance with laws, standardized army building in a comprehensive way strictly according to relevant regulations, repeatedly elevated the level of making policy decisions, exercising management, conducting training, and leading the troops in accordance with laws, and established a good training, working, and living order and a sound order of combat readiness. Following the examination of enforcing the "Law on Protecting Military Facilities" and the "Regulations on the Management of Army's Real Estate," an overhaul of enforcing the "Regulations on Military Training" has been organized within the entire Army, by which the conditions of enforcing training regulations have been examined in the military regions of Shenyang, Beijing, Lanzhou, Nanjing, and Chengdu, and the districts subordinate to them. As a result, the Army's awareness in studying, applying, and strictly enforcing laws has been noticeably heightened, training according to laws and plans has become a conscious action of organizations at all levels which are responsible for the Army's military training, the central position of military training has been solidified and enhanced, training order has been incrementally regularized, training time and content have been ensured, and training quality has been elevated year after year, thus profoundly changing the moral features of the Army. Closely combining theory with the practice in the military legal system to boost the development of the science of military law. The Research Institute of Military Law under the China Law Society took on the key research subject during the Eighth Five-Year Plan--research on the building of military legal system. It has completed the overall design and entered the substantive stage of tackling the problem. With the approval of the State Press and Publication Administration, "China Military Law"--the country's only comprehensive periodical on the military legal system at the central level--has started publication and been openly put on sale throughout the country. Afterward, scores of special works on the military law and voluminous reference books including Chinese Science of Military Law, Chinese Military Encyclopedia, Separate Book on Military Law, and World Famous Statute Book, Volume on Military Law came off press one after another, and several hundred theses on military law with guiding theoretical and practical value were also published, which have filled the gap of China's theoretical research on military law. Centering around the pressing issue of national defense and military legislation, the Research Institute of Military Law enlisted a large number of specialists, academics, and practical workers to take part in the academic research activities. Penetratingly carrying out the principle of administering the Army according to laws as guided by Deng Xiaoping's thinking on military legal system. The building of the military legal system is a major element of the troops becoming revolutionized, modernized, and regularized, and is also a legal guarantee for achieving the general objective of army building. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thinking on military legal system boasts extremely rich content which covers the structure of army formation, military training, higher military education, cadres' work, logistic building, defense science and technology, and so on. Conscientiously studying Deng Xiaoping's thinking on the military legal system is of tremendous practical and guiding significance to implementing the Central Military Commission's principle of administering the Army according to law and doing a good job of the building of military legal system. Expediting the process of national defense and military legislation. In the new year, the defense and military legislation, with the "Law on National Defense" as a dragon head, will make a giant stride. Important laws are urgently needed in adapting military to socialist market economic development through stepping up the formulation of the law on defense mobilization, the law on defense education, the law on defense science, technology, and production, the regulations on officers of reserve service, the law of treatment of military personnel, and so on; and in suiting the requirements of the army building to become revolutionized, modernized, and regularized through stepping up the formulation and revision of a number of important military laws and regulations, including those on headquarters, political work, logistic work, formation and management, managing soldiers, production and operation management, and so on, with a view to deliberately instituting and perfecting the military legal system and safeguarding the country's military interests as well as the legitimate rights and interests of the Army and servicemen. Intensifying the implementation of the military law and the supervision of law enforcement. It is necessary to intensify the administrative awareness of leading cadres and organs at all levels, enhance their level of law enforcement, promote the implementation of military laws and regulations, and really form a situation in which the entire Army, from top to bottom, act according to laws, enforce laws strictly, and investigate into cases in violation of laws resolutely. It is also necessary to carry out supervision and examination of enforcing military laws and regulations in a planned way on the key points in light of the tasks, fully exploit the role of functional departments, and incrementally establish a benign cycle of law enforcement and supervisory mechanisms.
