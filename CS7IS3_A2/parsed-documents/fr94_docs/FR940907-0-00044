ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This final rule amends the Federal Travel Regulation (FTR) to incorporate standards for Federal agency compliance with the Hotel and Motel Fire Safety Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;391, Sept. 25, 1990). These provisions are intended to enhance the safety of Federal employees traveling on official business. EFFECTIVE DATE: This final rule is effective October 1, 1994, and applies for travel (including travel incident to a change of official station) performed on or after October 1, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert A. Clauson, Transportation Management Division (FBX), Washington, DC 20406, telephone 703&hyph;305&hyph;5745. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Hotel and Motel Fire Safety Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;391, Sept. 25, 1990), hereinafter referred to as ``the Act'', among other things, amended title 5, United States Code, by adding new §§ 5707(d) and 5707a to save lives and protect property by promoting fire and life safety in hotels, motels, and all places of public accommodation affecting commerce. Hotel and Motel Fire Safety Guidelines The Act sets standards for fire prevention and control in places of public accommodation affecting commerce. These requirements include installation of hard-wired, single station smoke detectors in each guest room of each place of public accommodation, and an automatic sprinkler system in each place of public accommodation that is more than three stories. The Act further requires each State to submit to the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) a list of places of public accommodation in the State that comply with the Act's fire safety standards. From the State lists, FEMA must compile and publish in the Federal Register a national master list and distribute it to each Federal agency. The Act requires FEMA to periodically update the master list based on information provided by the States, and to distribute the updated list to each agency. Federal Travel Program Compliance The Act requires the General Services Administration (GSA) to modify certain of its travel programs to adhere to established fire safety guidelines. This includes listing in the Federal Travel Directory only those lodging establishments that comply with the Act's fire safety standards, specifying which access and safety devices each establishment provides for the hearing impaired or visually or physically handicapped, and surveying only accommodations that meet the Act's fire safety standards when conducting surveys of lodging costs for the purpose of establishing locality per diem rates. Agency Compliance The Act also requires each agency to ensure that it achieves an adequate ``approved accommodations percentage'', as specified in the Act and reflected in the regulation, for Fiscal Year 1995 and each fiscal year thereafter (an approved accommodation is a hotel, motel, or other place of public accommodation affecting commerce that meets the Act's fire safety standards). The actual approved accommodations percentage is computed by dividing the number of nights spent throughout the United States, including its territories and possessions, in approved accommodations by the total number of nights spent throughout the United States, including its territories and possessions, in all places of public accommodation affecting commerce. GSA has determined that this rule is not a significant regulatory action for the purposes of Executive Order 12866 of Sept. 30, 1993. This final rule is not required to be published in the Federal Register for notice and comment. Therefore, the Regulatory Flexibility Act does not apply. List of Subjects in 41 CFR Parts 301&hyph;1, 301&hyph;7, 301&hyph;8, 301&hyph;11, 301&hyph;16, and 301&hyph;17 Government employees, Travel, Travel allowances, Travel and transportation expenses For the reasons set out in the preamble, 41 CFR parts 301&hyph;1, 301&hyph;7, 301&hyph;8, 301&hyph;11, and 301&hyph;16 are amended and 41 CFR part 301&hyph;17 is added as follows: PART 301&hyph;1_APPLICABILITY AND GENERAL RULES 1. The authority citation for part 301&hyph;1 continues to read as follows: Authority: 5 U.S.C. 5701&hyph;5709; 31 U.S.C. 1353; 40 U.S.C. 486(c); E.O. 11609, 36 FR 13747, 3 CFR, 1971&hyph;1975 Comp., p. 586. Subpart A_Authority, Applicability, and General Rules 2. Section 301&hyph;1.3 is amended by revising paragraphs (a) and (c)(1) to read as follows: §301&hyph;1.3 General rules. (a) Employee's obligation _(1) Prudent person rule. An employee traveling on official business is expected to exercise the same care in incurring expenses that a prudent person would exercise if traveling on personal business. Excess costs, circuitous routes, delays, or luxury accommodations and services unnecessary or unjustified in the performance of official business are not acceptable under this standard. Employees will be responsible for excess costs and any additional expenses incurred for personal preference or convenience. (2) Approved (firesafe) accommodation. It is the policy of the Government, as reflected in the Hotel and Motel Fire Safety Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;391, Sept. 25, 1990), referred to as ``the Act'' in this paragraph, to save lives and protect property by promoting fire safety in hotels, motels, and all places of public accommodation affecting commerce. In furtherance of the Act's goals, employees are strongly encouraged to stay in an approved accommodation when commercial lodging is required. Such action will serve to benefit all travelers by influencing the management of places of public accommodation affecting commerce to comply with the Act's fire safety requirements and maintain approved accommodation status. An approved accommodation provides certain fire detection and safety devices that reduce the likelihood of injury to, and protect the lives of, travelers. * * * * * (c) Definitions _(1) Agency. Except as otherwise provided in §301&hyph;17.2(a) of this chapter, ``agency'' for purposes of this chapter means an executive agency as defined in 5 U.S.C. 105; a military department; an office, agency, or other establishment in the legislative branch; and the government of the District of Columbia; but does not include a Government-controlled corporation, a Member of Congress, or an office or committee of either House of Congress or of the two Houses. * * * * * Subpart B_Official Government Business Travel 3. Section 301&hyph;1.101 is amended by adding paragraph (b)(4) to read as follows: §301&hyph;1.101 Authorization of travel. * * * * * (b) * * * (4) It is the policy of the Government, as reflected in the Hotel and Motel Fire Safety Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;391, Sept. 25, 1990), to save lives and protect property by promoting fire safety in hotels, motels, and all places of public accommodation affecting commerce. In furtherance of these goals, each agency, as defined in §301&hyph;17.2(a) of this chapter, when authorizing travel shall take appropriate measures to influence employees who will procure commercial lodging when performing official travel to stay at a firesafe approved accommodation as defined in §301&hyph;17.2(c) of this chapter. Further, each agency shall establish procedures to ensure that its approved accommodations percentage is in compliance with the provisions of part 301&hyph;17 of this chapter. Additionally, each agency shall be prepared, as required in §301&hyph;17.4(b) of this chapter, to furnish the General Accounting Office with information necessary for the conduct of an audit of agency compliance with the approved accommodations percentage requirement. * * * * * Subpart C_Pre-employment Interview Travel 4. Section 301&hyph;1.202 is amended by revising the section heading and by adding paragraphs (a)(5) and (b)(6) to read as follows: §301&hyph;1.202 Responsibilities for pre-employment interview travel. (a) * * * (5) Fire safety responsibilities. Agencies should encourage an interviewee for his/her safety to stay in an approved accommodation while performing interview travel, and shall provide the interviewee with a list of approved accommodations in the interview area. Section 5707(d) of title 5, United States Code requires that the approved accommodations percentage, as defined in §301&hyph;17.2(d) of this chapter, be computed based solely on official travel by employees. An agency, therefore, shall not collect approved accommodations data from an interviewee. (b) * * * (6) Fire safety responsibilities. It is the policy of the Government, as reflected in the Hotel and Motel Fire Safety Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;391, Sept. 25, 1990), referred to as ``the Act'' in this paragraph, to save lives and protect property by promoting fire safety in hotels, motels, and all places of public accommodation affecting commerce. In furtherance of the Act's goals, an interviewee traveling to a pre-employment interview is strongly encouraged to stay at an approved accommodation as defined in §301&hyph;17.2(c) of this chapter when commercial lodging is required. An approved accommodation provides certain fire detection and safety devices that reduce the likelihood of injury to, and protect the lives of, travelers. Section 5707(d) of title 5, United States Code, requires that the approved accommodations percentage, as defined in §301&hyph;17.2(d) of this chapter, be computed based solely on official travel by employees. An interviewee, therefore, is exempt from the requirement in §§301&hyph;7.2(a)(4) and 301&hyph;8.5(a)(4) of this chapter to account for approved accommodations data. 5. Section 301&hyph;1.205 is amended by adding paragraph (e) to read as follows: §301&hyph;1.205 Claims for reimbursement. * * * * * (e) Approved accommodations data.
