[Fromow] "When soldiers succeeded in liberating Ocosingo Square they found a number of corpses covered with blood, but they had been killed some time earlier. Two of them do appear to have been shot in the head with a small caliber firearm. It is not the type of firearm the Army uses. Others had wounds caused by rifles. The Army does not use those either. In sum, we are investigating that." He said action will be taken if soldiers are found responsible. [Fromow] "We will proceed immediately against anyone, no matter who it is, if he belongs to the Army. I can tell you this is an act of violence against people, nothing less than homicide." The judge advocate general stated that his office handles the complaints filed by the National Human Rights Committee [CNDH]. [Fromow] "In Chiapas' case, this office has received 25 complaints. I am already responding with full information to the CNDH so it can have the elements and judge whether or not the rights of a citizen were violated or the law was broken." During an interview with Television Azteca, Gen. Fromow talked about the attitude of some servicemen and their involvement with the complaints that have been filed. [Fromow] "Generally these cases involve the arrests of certain people by soldiers. That is not far from the truth. They were arrested, but they were immediately handed over to regular or federal authorities with medical certificates attesting to their physical well-being." The Army carried out no bombings in the Chiapas conflict, the judge advocate general stated. [Fromow] "One cannot even imagine that the Army bombed towns. First, not a single bomb was used, because it was not necessary. We are not going to get to that point either. The Army has strafed those individuals who conducted attacks." In sum, he said, we are seeking peace, because servicemen have suffered in the conflict. The Army has sustained casualties, and soldiers are risking their lives. [Fromow] "More than anything else, the Army wants peace and tranquillity. It wants peace the most, because soldiers know the consequences of these incidents; they know they are losing or risking their lives."
