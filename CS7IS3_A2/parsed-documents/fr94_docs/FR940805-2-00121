FR940805-2-00121 FR940805-2-00061 Issuer Delisting; Application To Withdraw From Listing and Registration; (Computer Data Systems, Inc., Common Stock, $0.01 Par Value) File No. 1&hyph;6002 August 1, 1994. Computer Data Systems, Inc. (``Company'') has filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission''), pursuant to Section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act``) and Rule 12d2&hyph;2(d) promulgated thereunder, to withdraw the above specified security from listing and registration on the Boston Stock Exchange, Inc. (``BSE''). The reasons alleged in the application for withdrawing this security from listing and registration include the following: According to the Company, its Common Stock is listed on the BSE. According to the Company, nearly all of the trading volume of the Company's Common Stock is now transacted through NASDAQ/NMS and the Company does not believe that the limited benefit it would obtain through continuation of its listing on the BSE would justify the cost and expense involved. Any interested person may, on or before August 22, 1994 submit by letter to the Secretary of the Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549, facts bearing upon whether the application has been made in accordance with the rules of the exchanges and what terms, if any, should be imposed by the Commission for the protection of investors. The Commission, based on the information submitted to it, will issue an order granting the application after the date mentioned above, unless the Commission determines to order a hearing on the matter. For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary.
