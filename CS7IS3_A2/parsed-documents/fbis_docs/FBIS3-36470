Luik met Finnish Prime Minister Esko Aho, with whom he discussed Estonian-Finnish economic relations and Finnish President Mauno Koivisto. Luik had a longer meeting with his Finnish counterpart Heikki Haavisto. Under discussion were bilateral and international relations, agreements, juridical and economic issues. Minister Luik also explained the background of joining the Partnership for Peace programme. Luik gave a press conference in Helsinki, on Friday, where he said that besides signing the Partnership for Peace programme he also met Foreign Relations Commissioner of the European Union Hans van der Broek in Brussels, with whom he reached an agreement that concluding free trade agreement between Estonia and European Union should be on the agenda this summer. Commenting on the Partnership for Peace Programme Luik said that the direct importance of the agreement lied in the fact that "NATO was not indifferent towards Estonia". Estonia needs help in development of defence forces, juridical questions and formation of the Baltic peacekeeping battalion and in these areas NATO is ready to support Estonia, he added. Luik said that Estonia will apply for full membership of NATO when "time was rife" for it. The three Baltic states will cooperate on the issue, and will apply for the membership together, Luik said. Luik arrived back to Estonia Friday evening.
