FR941021-0-00167 FR941021-0-00022 107. We also proposed in the Notice to require that the ESMU notify MSS licensees in the 1610.6&hyph;1613.8 MHz band of radio astronomy observations. 129 This requirement was proposed to ensure that MSS operations terminate as soon as possible after an MSS user transceiver enters a RAS protection zone where observations are being made. CORF suggests that it could meet this requirement by providing MSS operators with schedules of RAS observations. 130 TRW disagrees, stating that CORF should be required to provide notification ``of periods of actual radio astronomy observations rather than a general schedule.'' 131 We agree with TRW that it would not be overly burdensome for the ESMU to notify the small number of licensed in-band Big LEO operators of periods of actual RAS observations. This will help ensure that no interference is caused to RAS observations in the event that a schedule is changed. 129 See proposed §25.213(a)(1)(v). 130 CORF Comments at 4&hyph;5. 131 TRW Reply Comments at 72. 108. In a related matter, Motorola notes that the Committee suggested that RAS observations not be scheduled during peak MSS/RDSS traffic periods to the extent possible. 132 CORF does not object to this proposal. 133 RAS observations are usually carried out in remote areas and are not continuous. Even during peak MSS traffic periods, the majority of MSS traffic should not occur in RAS observation areas. We do not therefore believe that adherence to this provision will be burdensome to RAS. Consequently, we include this provision in our rules in §25.213(a)(4). 132 Motorola Comments at 55, n. 41. 133 Specifically, CORF supports insertion of the following text in the rules: ``The RAS shall avoid scheduling radio astronomy observations during peak MSS/RDSS traffic periods to the greatest extent practicable.'' See CORF Reply at 2. 109. Finally, TRW requests that we agree to solicit public comment before we require MSS systems to protect additional RAS sites beyond the sixteen sites specified in the rules. 134 In bands shared by two or more services on a co-primary basis, new facilities in either service must be coordinated among affected operators. As provided for in proposed rule §25.213(1)(a)(viii), which we adopt, we will solicit comment with respect to protection from additional RAS sites. 134 Proposed §25.213(a)(1)(vii). b. Out-of-band interference to RAS from primary MSS uplinks at 1.6 GHz. 110. In the Notice, we also recognized that MSS uplink operations in the 1613.8&hyph;1626.5 MHz portion of the band could cause unacceptable out-of-band interference into RAS operations at 1610.6&hyph;1613.8 MHz. We also noted the Committee's suggestion to establish fixed protection zones similar to, but smaller than, those recommended for in-band emissions, although we did not propose a rule in this regard. 135 135 Notice, note 2, supra, at para. 51. 111. CORF suggested several alternatives to our proposals: 136 136 See CORF Comments at 3&hyph;4. (1) To require that the power flux density (pfd) level reaching RAS sites from a mobile user terminal operating anywhere in the 1610&hyph;1626.5 MHz band not exceed the pfd from a mobile user terminal operating within the RAS 1610.6&hyph;1613.8 MHz band segment at the edge of the protection zone applicable for that site, or (2) To prohibit mobile terminal operations within the 1613.8&hyph;1615.8 MHz band during RAS observations within protection zones of 100 km or 30 km around RAS sites depending upon the type of observatory involved. 137 137 Radio astronomy observatories use two types of antennas. Observatories with a very long baseline array (VLBA) use interconnected radio telescopes that are dispersed in widely separated locations. Due to the geographic separation of the telescopes, the chance of correlated interference from any single mobile earth terminal is small. Consequently, VLBA sites are not as susceptible to interference as are observatories using a single radio telescope. Eleven of the 16 radio astronomy sites in the U.S. are VLBA sites and they require relatively smaller protection zones than non-VLBA sites. 112. The MSS parties generally oppose restrictions on out-of-band emissions for the purpose of protecting RAS. For example, Constellation argues that MSS out-of-band levels should not be unilaterally defined by the radio astronomy community without any regard to the impact those levels would have on other services. 138 TRW states that it could agree to CORF's suggestions if a compliant mobile user terminal were not required to undertake further coordination with the RAS. TRW notes, however, that CORF's out-of-band protection proposals would relegate MSS to co-primary or even lower status in frequency bands that are not allocated to the RAS.'' 139 Only LQP generally agrees with CORF's suggestion. According to LQP, there is sufficient 1.6 GHz band spectrum to switch MSS users near RAS sites from potentially interfering channels to channels separated from RAS observations. 140 138 Constellation Comments at 47. 139 TRW Reply at 71. 140 LQP Reply Comments at 57, Reply Tech Appendix at 2.1. 113. We have considered the impact of this proposal on Big LEO licensees and conclude they would not be unduly burdened by protecting RAS observations from out-of-band MSS emissions. It appears that less than one percent of the MSS consumer use would be affected by CORF's alternative proposals for protecting RAS from out-of-band MSS emissions. 141 Further, those affected would not be denied communications. They would simply be assigned to another uplink channel by the MSS network control center. We do not believe that the CORF proposals relegate the MSS to co-primary or even lower status. The RAS is seeking protection in bands only in the 1610.6&hyph;1613.8 MHz band, which is allocated to the RAS. Therefore we adopt CORF's proposals to protect RAS, during observations, from out-of-band emissions caused by Big LEO systems. If Big LEO operators cannot meet the power density levels necessary to protect RAS from harmful interference, we will require that Big LEO operations be terminated within the protection zones specified in §25.213(a)(1)(iii). 141 CORF Reply Comments at 8.
