The consultation papers were released after pressure from the Chinese side, for the draft ordinance on the new airport has a great bearing not only on the building of the new airport, but also on its future management, as well as the financial commitments of Hong Kong residents and the interests of the Special Administrative Region [SAR]. It has been stipulated in the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Memorandum on Hong Kong's New Airport that all major issues straddling 1997 should be subjected to consultations and discussions with both the Chinese and British sides and should not be determined unilaterally by the British side. Therefore, after the release of the draft, the British side has a responsibility, through appropriate channels, to explain to the Chinese side the contents of the draft, the background information on detailed arrangements, and the exact definition of ordinances, heed the concrete opinions of the Chinese side, and make amendments to the draft. The Chinese side has always been worried about whether or not the British side had the sincerity to implement the "Memorandum of Understanding on the Building of Hong Kong's New Airport and Related Issues." It is stated clearly in the second paragraph of the memorandum: "The airport project should pay attention to cost efficiency, and should not become a financial burden to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China after 30 June 1997." However, the British side has put forward financial arrangements on the construction costs of the airport, claiming that "a ceiling should not be set on the cost"; as a result, the SAR government will be left with "callable equity" of over HK$5 billion [Hong Kong dollars]. This is why an agreement has not been reached on the financial arrangement for such a long period of time. In the draft white paper on the airport, is there a supervision mechanism which aims to ensure that money will not be wasted during construction of the airport, that no one can throw away public money like water, and that the franchise will not be given to British conglomerates at very low rates and conditions? Doubts remains on this issue, because the relevant draft has failed to strictly reflect the stipulations of the airport memorandum, and also fails to stipulate that all contracts and agreements signed by the Airport Authority should be submitted to the Airport Affairs Committee of the Sino-British Liaison Group for discussion and examination, or to the relevant departments of the Hong Kong Government for approval and evaluation. As a result, what the Airport Authority needs to do is to simply show their accounts to the Hong Kong Government once a year. Under such circumstances, no administrative departments will know exactly the actual operation of the Airport Authority. Such a practice is similar to that of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, where overspending was not supervised by relevant departments of the Hong Kong Government and Hong Kong Government auditors had no right to check on demand the accounts of the new Airport Authority and can only "check accounts on issues entailing special concern" upon authorization from the Hong Kong Governor. In other words, neither the public nor the Hong Kong Government can take immediate preventive or restrictive action, and all they can do is cry over spilt milk. The operation of the airport as a whole should reflect the idea of Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong. Priority should be given to Chinese when the chief and principal executives need to be recruited. Overseas recruitment will only be considered when the talents required cannot be found among Chinese. In the past, however, the Provisional Airport Authority appointed Richard Allen as chief executive officer. Without any sense of responsibility or attachment to Hong Kong, this man overmanned the airport authority, spent money extravagantly, and included entertainment and holiday spending in his inspection expenditures. What is more ridiculous is that he regarded the Provisional Airport Authority as his independent kingdom and appointed people through favoritism, he invited many of his old friends to take well-paid positions and shared the lucre with them, and he only recruited staff from overseas and rejected participation by locals. By the time it became aware of the problem and was forced to end the chaotic and disordered situation in the Airport Authority caused by Richard Allen, the Government had no alternative but to compensate Richard Allen with HK$5 million because his contract was terminated his contract with the Government. In addition, the white paper also failed to put forward the necessary supervisory procedures on personnel recruitment and corporatized personnel management; as a result, the president and executive director will be entrusted with excessive powers to handle personnel arrangements. The general public believe that the principal manager of the new airport should be a local. Yueh Kung-nan, the present director of Hong Kong's Civil Aviation Department, is also a Hong Kong local, and the Hong Kong people are truly satisfied with the current management standards at Kai Tak Airport under his leadership. So why is the draft white paper reluctant to draw such a stipulation that the principal post at the new airport must be filled by a Hong Kong resident? If the British side leaves the SAR government with a new airport authority which was set up before 1997 and used to be run by people like Richard Allen, the SAR government will find itself facing many operational difficulties when it discovers numerous problems in this management organ at a later date and has to ask the chief executive of the SAR to dismiss and replace the organ's staff. It is stated in the airport memorandum: "The British Hong Kong Government can exercise leadership over the Airport Authority and shoulder responsibility for major policy fields before 30 June 1997. The British Hong Kong Government will be willing to give consideration to the opinions of the Chinese side when drafting the ordinance of the authority," "the British Hong Kong Government is willing to appoint Hong Kong-based officials from the Bank of China Group as formal members of the board of directors of the Airport Authority," and "the British Hong Kong Government will notify the Chinese side of its proposed appointment of members to the Airport Authority and the consultative committee and is willing to heed any opinions of Chinese side before a final decision on the appointments are made." At present, many clauses in the draft white paper are imperfect and vaguely defined. Now that the Preliminary Working Committee consists of both Hong Kong people and Chinese officials in charge of Hong Kong affairs, we hope that the British side can provide the Preliminary Working Committee with explanations (for instance, is the Airport Authority defined in the memorandum a synonym of the New Airport Corporation) so that the Hong Kong people and the Chinese side can acquire a better understanding of the draft white paper and can thus offer more pertinent opinions. However, Hamish Macleod and Anson Chan Fang On-sang yesterday flatly rejected a request from the members of the Preliminary Working Committee concerning such an explanation. This shows that the British side is refusing to cooperate with the Chinese side on the building of Hong Kong's new airport and, at the same time, is declining to provide Hong Kong people with reasonable explanations and data. Their sincerity about soliciting opinions is open to question.
