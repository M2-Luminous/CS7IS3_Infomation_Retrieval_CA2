Having delivered a report at the sixth congress of the USPP, he set out on the road again. It was an overseas trip, but only for five days. However, he managed to do a lot during this trip. The list of U.S. high officials, with whom Kuchma met, is rather impressive. I would like to decipher this list by not only listing names, but also reporting on opinions, assessments, and proposals. Naturally, my first question was about this trip. [Kuchma] I was invited to the United States by the International Fund for Democracy and Development, of which Nixon was honorary chairman until his death. My first talks were with P. Rosenblat, acting chairman of the Fund. Next, I met with U.S. Vice President A. Gore; E. Leica, U.S. presidential assistant for national security; and N. Burns, U.S. presidential special assistant for Eurasian affairs. Moreover, there were meetings with Deputy Secretary of Defense E. Carter and Deputy Secretary of Finance L. Summers. There were also meetings with the presidents of international funds -- M. Camdessus of the IMF and Z. Brzezinski of the Soros Foundation. The following must be taken into consideration. The secretary of finance was quite frank: If financial assistance continues to be pumped into accounts in foreign banks or sticks to hands of dodgers, no further aid to Ukraine will be planned. In his turn, Camdessus stated that he come to Ukraine to help with our reforms without delay if a strong executive power is launched along with a realistic program for overcoming economic crisis. [Pavlenko] Apart from assistance, can we see any U.S. readiness to participate in Ukrainian economy on the basis of, say, new investments? [Kuchma] There were such proposals. Here is an example. The president of the Onasisas [name as transliterated] Company, owner E. Kulukundis, is ready to invest large sums in the development of our freight fleet. However, a barrier in the way toward the implementation of this project is the lack of legislation guaranteeing investments and a clear system of mutual obligations. The contact with Ukrainian immigrants was also satisfying -- the immigrants believe that the relations with Ukraine should be multilateral, in particular, on economic basis as well. [Pavlenko] Have you discussed the well-known missile problems? [Kuchma] This was the main topic of my conversation with U.S. Deputy Defense Secretary Carter. My opinion about this is clear: Ukraine alone is not able to deal with the entire complex of missile problems. Dismantling main parts is only the tip of the iceberg. In order to carry out the entire project, even according to modest estimates by U.S. experts, Ukraine needs no less than $3 billion, whereas only a tenth of this sum was allotted. Of course, Ukraine does not have such funds. Nor do we have the technology for using liquid and solid rocket fuel. I think that even U.S. assistance will not suffice here. We will apparently be forced to involve the entire world community. Otherwise, we will not avoid another large-scale environmental disaster. It is necessary to apportion the allotted funds taking into account not only the consultations by U.S. experts, but also the needs of Ukrainian enterprises. [Pavlenko] Prevailing opinion holds that there are no people in Ukraine who are capable of working out and implementing an effective program for leading the economy out of the total collapse of production. Do you share this opinion? [Kuchma] The extraordinary fourth congress of the USPP was convened due to no more than the acute aggravation of the social and economical situation in Ukraine. During the first quarter, industrial production decreased by one-third, while in machine building, light industry, and metallurgy -- by 40-45 percent. Hundreds of enterprises were halted; over half of the total number work for only two-three days a week. Construction, transportation, and communication are in breaking down. Marketability of the agricultural sector --its grain complex -- is under threat. Reduction of investments in all spheres of production is fraught with tragic consequences. The same can be said about the disintegration of science, education, medicine, and culture. A general indicator of the total disintegration can be seen in the crisis of payments and paralysis of financial system. Exports are dwindling, hard currency incoming is decreasing, whereas domestic and foreign debts of the state have arisen to an astronomical sum. The living standard of the majority is well below the poverty line, while the wage guaranteed by the state in the amount of 60,000 karbovanetses, equivalent to slightly over $1, is simply cynical mockery. Logic dictates that the government, beginning 1 January, should have increased the minimum wage and pensions by at least three or four times. At the same time, corruption, embezzlement of public funds, violence, bribery, and robbery have become mass plagues. Central and local state authorities only pretend that they are fighting this common evil. I am sure that the main reason for this tragedy is the inability of current ruling structures to work out and implement a realistic policy in social and economic sphere. Instead of clear objectives and mechanisms for their achievement, we have slogans about market economy, reforms, privatization, farming, and destatization. In reality, robbing the country and transferring its wealth abroad by various operators continues. Official actions are not systematic or adequate to the needs of today's situation in the economy and community in general. Everywhere there are a flood of command administration methods in management and a swelling management apparatus with a low level of professionalism. Moreover, the central authorities are trying to evade responsibility by loading it on the shoulders of regions and producers. Possibly, I am too harsh, but you know -- it boils not only within me alone... [Pavlenko] However, you did not mention ways out of the crisis... [Kuchma] During the last six months alone, the USPP, the Ukrainian Union of Independent Entrepreneurs, and other organizations, national as well as regional, which represent various forms of ownership, repeatedly proposed to the president and Cabinet of Ministers packets of measures regarding this question. There were among others: changes in hard currency regulations, taxation, and external economic relations as well as the determination of the priority of these relations; issues of utilizing working capital, repaying mutual indebtedness, restoring ties with CIS countries on a qualitatively new basis; revision of the scope of ministries and departments with the purpose of broadening the prerogatives of enterprises; introduction of state contracts; and many other measures. However, there was only silence. And they do not even try to take some measures by themselves... [Pavlenko] By the way, how are your relations with the present Cabinet of Ministers and its head? [Kuchma] I will answer by citing a passage from the resolution of the USPP sixth congress: "To declare that the activities of the government and its Acting Prime Minister Zvyahilskyy caused extremely negative consequences, deepened chaos and economic ruin, and aggravated tension in the community, what can bring unforeseen consequences..." [Pavlenko] While prime minister, you made a threatening statement that was addressed to those structures mired in corruption. [Kuchma] In my time as prime minister, the Cabinet of Ministers prepared materials for 1,500 cases, which were later submitted to the General Prosecutor's Office. However, they have not been instigated. Just as it was with the Black Sea Steamship Company managers -- our commission worked out and prepared a document and submitted it to the former Supreme Council, but the Steamship Company manager was a people's deputy. And for what? The document got stuck somewhere in the corridors of the former legislative power. [Pavlenko] How do you see the present geopolitical and internal situation of Ukraine from the perspective of the cochairman of the Interregional Bloc of Reforms [MBR]? What are the tasks of the Bloc? [Kuchma] The MBR unites pragmatic people that are apparently distant from politics. Yet even they have understood that unless a political course for Ukraine is formulated today, that is, unless new and, above all, cardinal resolutions are adopted, it will be impossible to implement any economic reforms or programs. In essence, Ukraine's economy has become hostage to politics. What we see is geopolitical bankruptcy with national romanticism as the pivot of the entire political course. The lack of pragmatism in the approaches to geopolitics, an erroneous estimate of geopolitical scenarios, and a bolshevist desire to raze everything and start anew, have led to a situation in which Ukraine has become virtually an international castaway. In our internal policy, for all practical purposes, we have anarchy; we see an incompatibility of interests of ruling central bureaucracy and regions. The creation of an equalitarian system for every region without taking into account their characteristics and contribution to the national economy objectively provokes the development of separatist tendencies aimed at the disintegration of Ukraine. I also think it inadmissible if the June elections fail or be rescheduled -- due to strategic reasons, first of all. World practice shows that overcoming a crisis is possible only by having a rigid and consolidated executive power headed by the president who possesses the highest level of legitimacy. The president should be a pragmatic man who is supported by the majority and who is capable of opposing any influence from various groups and lobbies. [Pavlenko] Your presidential candidacy is supported by the USPP. Do you think that your chances are higher than those of your rivals? [Kuchma] All rivals are worthy opponents; every one of them is good in his own way. Therefore, I do not overestimate my own chances. [Pavlenko] Is it prudent to hold presidential elections simultaneously with local ones? [Kuchma] I am against the simultaneous elections. If this happens, then we will elect absolutely independent presidents for 48,000 settlements, 560 rayons, and 24 oblasts. Ukraine, as a state, will cease to be. If hamlets become sovereign, then how will the president govern the state? Unfortunately, it is too late to change the situation -- the elections must be held. [Pavlenko] As a journalist, I have been working in Kharkiv Rayon for a long time. I can say that the people there treat you ambiguously. You impressed the working collectives when you were prime minister. However, managers' corps does not support you fully. Here is one of the objections: You call for friendship and cooperation with Russia, but you do not back it with concrete steps. This is not a general opinion, but it exists... [Kuchma] Let my colleagues, the managers, strain their memory and remember that it was in Kharkiv that I signed a package of documents on customs cooperation at the meeting of representatives of 10 oblasts on the borders of Russia and Ukraine in June 1993. And who signed the declaration on the creation of economic union? And who proposed to lease the Black Sea Fleet and to pay the earned money for energy resources in order to get a respite for structural rebuilding? I will say also this. Today, Ukraine alone is not able to stabilize its economy, regulate finances, and invigorate investments even partially. I have said it many times and I repeat: Nobody can survive on his own. Neither Russia nor Kazakhstan nor Belarus. This has already been realized by the Balts, too. Only people in Ukraine seem to be incapable of realizing this in any way. We propose the creation of a mechanism of mutual assistance and mutual support with all the CIS countries and, in the first place, with Russia; we propose to attain common geopolitical and economic interests with our joint efforts. I emphasize: This step is expected by all the CIS countries. Nikolay Ogarev, Hertsen's friend, said once: "What We Need is Self-Assurance and Vigor, While Despair Leads to Idleness." These are the very qualities -- self-assurance and vigor -- which we need so badly now! Away with despair! [Pavlenko] Would you say a few words about yourself? Your biography is not widely known, because until recently you have not belonged to the people who were much discussed. [Kuchma] I was born in the village Chaykyno, Novgorod-Siverskiy Rayon, Chernigov Oblast in 1928. I am Ukrainian. My father died defending Leningrad, my mother worked on a collective farm all her life and died several years ago. My elder brother was a drift miner who died at the age of 56 of silicosis, a professional disease. My sister who also worked in a mine, died at the age of 48. I conclude my report on the meeting with Leonid Kuchma, a candidate for the high post of Ukrainian presidency, with a few brief notes from my notebook. After graduation from Dnipropetrovsk University, Kuchma worked for 32 years at the world's largest rocket complex (the Pivdenne design office and the Pivdennyy Mashzavod production amalgamation), moving through all the production stages -- from a designer to the general director of the Pivdenmash production company. By the way, in the spring of 1966, at the age of 28, he became the youngest technical supervisor of tests at the Baykonyr launching site in the whole history of rocket production of the former USSR. His was lucky -- he worked with such legendary creators of space technology as Yangel, Glushko, Utkin, Pilyugin, and Sergeyev. Kuchma is a Lenin prize winner for the creation of space technology. He is married. His wife, Lyudmila Mykolayivna, an engineer, retired after 30 years of work at the Pivdenne design office. His daughter Olena, an economist, is 24 years old. His grandson, Roman, is three years old. His daughter and son-in-law live and work in Simferopol. Kuchma is very fond of ballads and likes to sing accompanying himself on the guitar. These are only general features. A full portrait will be painted by the election campaign, by life itself.
