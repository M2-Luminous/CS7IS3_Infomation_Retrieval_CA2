Those arrested were caught red-handed with a stack of proclamations. The ITAR-TASS correspondent was told this today by the Ministry of Internal Affairs press center, which declined to give more information in view of the interests of the investigation. Two days ago in Dushanbe and adjacent areas unidentified people distributed proclamations signed by Rizvon Alimardon, one of the leaders of the irreconcileable opposition in exile, who calls himself commander of the Joint Armed Forces of the Islamic Revival Movement of Tajikistan, calling on compatriots to wage a general armed struggle against the "pro-Communist government." According to the authors of the leaflets, the pro-Communist forces are mainly to blame for the civil war that has been unleashed in Tajikistan, and on coming to power they "brought the people to complete destitution." According to the proclamation, the "Red Plague" in Tajikistan should be destroyed.
