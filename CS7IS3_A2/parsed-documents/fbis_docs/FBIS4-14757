The Zhirinovskiy party declared its intention "to render assistance to the peoples of Yugoslavia, and first of all to the Serbian people". The LDPR group in the State Duma was instructed to work towards the lifting of economic sanctions against the Yugoslav republics. Another resolution contains criticism of the "inconsistent, passive approach of the Russian ruling circles to Iraq". The party's deputies in the parliament were told to "raise the question about lifting sanctions against Iraq and secure changes in the policy pursued by the Russian diplomacy, including in the United Nations". The congress adopted a resolution in support of a single monetary system of Russia and Byelorussia [Belarus]. The LDPR thinks that "the cost Russia may have to pay is incomparably smaller than the strategic benefits from a financial and economic alliance with Byelorussia".
