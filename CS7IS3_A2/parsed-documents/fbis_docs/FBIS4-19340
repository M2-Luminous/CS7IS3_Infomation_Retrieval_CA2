They wanted him to supply information about the Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK], "although he is not a member of that party," the Association's spokesman Klaus Mueller told FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU. The Dresden Alliance 90/Greens quoted from a letter Cetin's lawyers Christian Fischer and Gert Merzky have sent to the Chemnitz court: "We have information that he was also physically tortured and that he has visible traces of that torture." Cetin was deported on 6 April, together with his wife and five children, after his application for asylum was rejected on 17 March. Mueller called the fact that the family was deported before the period for filing protest expired on 17 April a "violation of the principle of due course of law." [passage omitted]
