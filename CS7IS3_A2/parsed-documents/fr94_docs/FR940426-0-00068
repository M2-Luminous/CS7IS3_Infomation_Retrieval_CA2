Checklist 85, Burning of Hazardous Waste in Boilers and Industrial Furnaces, (2/21/91, 56 FR 7134), was submitted in the authorization application with RCRA Cluster I. EPA is withholding a decision to authorize Georgia for the Burning of Hazardous Waste in Boilers and Industrial Furnaces Rule as well as the technical corrections in Checklists 94, 96, and 98, until the State's capability has been assessed. C. Decision I conclude that Georgia's application for these program revisions meets all of the statutory and regulatory requirements established by RCRA. Accordingly, Georgia is granted final authorization to operate its hazardous waste program as revised, except where otherwise noted.
