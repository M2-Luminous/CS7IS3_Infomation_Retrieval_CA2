Five different but ultimately interrelated events that occurred in this period have exacerbated and, at the same time, clarified the profound political crisis in Nicaragua: the Esteli massacre; the dual Quilali-Managua kidnapping; the presidential announcement of the removal of General Humberto Ortega Saavedra from the Army leadership; the transport workers' strike; and the dispute between the National Assembly, through the Sandinist bench, and Comandante Daniel Ortega Saavedra, secretary general of the FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front]. The direct consequences of each of these events are undeniable and obvious: the Army's loss of prestige; the consolidation of UNO [National Opposition Union] as a valid participant in resolving the political crisis; the new dispute between the executive and the EPS [Sandinist People's Army]; the evidence that the government's economic problem is limited to controlling inflation and reducing the fiscal deficit; and the great importance to the public of the Sandinist leadership's internal crisis. On the margins of all this, the overall consequences of the intensification of the crisis possess a terminal seriousness; they necessarily imply a qualitative change. To start with, for the first time since she became president--over three years ago--the president is generally perceived as directly responsible for three of the five events listed above; this means that also for the first time the people identify her as in charge of the government. In other words, the intensification of the crisis has apparently obliterated the president's image as chief of state, changing it from that of a naive but manipulated governor, outside the loop of administrative blunders and widespread official corruption, to that of a person who shares responsibility for this mismanagement. This change in image has many political implications. In the first place, the political establishment will direct its batteries against her, more and more ignoring Antonio Lacayo; the same thing is going to happen--or perhaps is already happening--in the government-Washington relationship. Secondly, in these conditions, the only option the president has is a national accord to complete her government with the seal of its only moderately successful policy: reconciliation and peace. If she is not able to do this, she will be forced to seek alliances with forces on the far right, to the detriment of the precarious political stability achieved so far, and also to the detriment--in the third place--of her alliance with the Sandinist leadership. [passage omitted] The Crisis in the Sandinist Top Leadership Moreover, the impact of this intensification of the crisis on the Sandinist leadership has also been brutal, so much so that it can be said that the Sandinist leadership has been the hardest hit of all. In this regard, the first thing this analysis reveals is that the Sandinist Front's national leadership has been forced to recognize as full participants not only UNO--which in the past it ignored--but also several of the small groups that make it up, some of them as leadership groups. Consequently, the Sandinist leadership has not been able to elude--much less neutralize--the UNO tactic of creating several fronts for fighting the Sandinist Front, no matter whether some of these fronts are presented as quasi-allied and others as open enemies. In negotiating with the government, the Sandinist Front has been weakened. The greatest expression of this weakness is the complexity that the mechanics of the national dialogue has taken on: interminable bilateral discussions prior to a constantly more remote general dialogue among all the parties. This weakening of the Sandinist Front, though, is not the result of a sudden strengthening of UNO or the government; it is the result of the internal crisis of Sandinism itself that has reached its highest level, first in the public confrontation with the president on the occasion of the announcement, also public, that she made at the anniversary celebration of the EPS, and later in the open clash between the secretary general of the Sandinist Front and the head of the Sandinist bench in the National Assembly (parliament). The first demonstrated Sandinism's lack of real weight in its relations with the government, so painstakingly and at such great cost worked out by the national leadership, using the argument--denied by reality--of preserving to the utmost the gains of the revolution; and the second is the new balance of power inside the Sandinist leadership, which also stems from its own weakness. Comandante Daniel Ortega has in essence lost the activist support of the FNT [National Workers Front], as it has virtually ceased to exist as a consequence of privatization and more specifically of the newly created APT [Workers' Ownership Sector]; that is, as a consequence of the party leader-worker/businessman dispute; nor has Dr. [Sergio] Ramirez managed to develop partisan support through the centrist trend that has faded away. The High Price of the Head of Rene Vivas In addition, if the Sandinist leadership had placed any hopes on the Army, it is clear that those expectations are about to become or have already become another chimera: with its own internal crisis, the Army cannot now realistically help the Sandinist Front. Nor can anything be said about the police. It is as if the police did not even exist, so great was the price of the head of Comandante Rene Vivas, a concession made more in the context of the Sandinist Front's internal struggles than as a strategic decision. The concession of the police to these imperial demands, as some well-known members with a long history in the party had pointed out earlier, anticipated the new situation of the EPS, but those who are deaf and blind refuse to hear and to see. As a result, the Sandinist leadership will no longer be able to ignore the demands of the party's grass roots for the accord that without any doubt will have to be reached in the first Extraordinary Congress: that no member of the national leadership may run as a presidential candidate in the 1996 general elections, and that the party must immediately begin to promote a number of other party members for that purpose. This gives new importance to the Extraordinary Congress and a new reason for the Sandinist grassroots to fight for a precise statement of their objectives. The national leadership apparently got itself into trouble without any hope of escape when it gave up the Sandinist Front's political program, which has never lost its force, in a vain search for an alternative to neoliberalism. In addition to being the best alternative, that political program is the best weapon to combat the neoliberal project; so much so that a great price was paid to convince the world that the Sandinist political program was strategic and not tactical in nature. FSLN Leadership Weak, Grass Roots Huge Of course, in terms of leadership the Sandinist Front is a very weakened party, but at its grass-roots level it remains a huge, strong, combative...and disorganized party. It is weakened because of the daily struggle for survival amid unemployment and discrimination--even of the Sandinist brothers themselves--because of the organic dispersion brought about by the real split in the leadership and because of the lack of clear objectives and of a consistent organic structure. So, once again bringing together the party's grass roots is a problem of consequence between partisan objectives and political action, between principles and discourse, between theory and practice. That is why it is useless to talk about organic reorganization without attacking the in-depth problem, the problem of the party's true nature. That is something that only the Extraordinary Congress can resolve, so long as it acts in accordance with the demands of the grass roots; this is another argument in favor of the Sandinist Front's First Extraordinary Congress. Government More Isolated Than Ever The government is obviously not in very good shape. On the contrary, it is now more isolated than ever, with the entire national political spectrum arrayed against it, and it has only a promise of aid, with strings attached, from Washington. The government is so isolated that the national consensus is that it should end its term whenever it can. The advantage of this is that it requires a greater consensus concerning a minimum national accord enabling all the participants to prepare for the 1996 general elections in a climate of reasonable political stability. The struggle, then, is taking place around the national dialogue, where political stability is more a means than an end, a means for the great electoral contest of 1996. The disadvantage is that this struggle may once again alter the national political physiognomy, both because of the balance of power that may result from the national dialogue and because of the definitive frustration arising from this dialogue that could reach the groups on the far right. Although in terms of numbers these groups are minuscule, they have a great reproductive capacity through the media, including the Sandinist media. In reality, during the past six months, Nicaragua has become another country.
