Kolodziejczyk, who arrived for a two-day visit to the Czech Republic today, said that not only the rapid integration of the Czech Republic and Poland into NATO was at stake, but also the admission of other countries because security is indivisible and Europe will be secure only when the islands of insecurity are eliminated. If most media write that the Polish voice has sounded louder in the talks about admission, this is caused by the fact that Poland feels threatened on its eastern border, Kolodziejczyk said. In the states east of Poland there is an unstable situation, he added. Poland was not imposing any conditions for the adoption of the American Partnership For Peace, although there were certain pressures, for the initiative to include criteria for admission into NATO, Kolodziejczyk said. Both the Polish government and the president are currently assessing the partnership as positive, Kolodziejczyk stated. The Czech and Polish armies will conduct a total of 54 exchange and other joint projects, Kolodziejczyk announced. In 1991 the two countries' defense ministries concluded a bilateral agreement on the main aims of cooperation in the military sphere. We have confirmed that although the original agreement was concluded under the former Czechoslovak federation, both countries consider it valid, Baudys said. At the same time, the two ministers have agreed that it was necessary to conclude a new agreement on mutual cooperation which would involve some points from the partnership for peace, Baudys announced. The agreement would include possible cooperation in supplying and manufacturing spare parts for military equipment, in the arms industry, in particular the aviation industry, and training and joint exercises to which the two countries want to invite NATO representatives, Baudys said. Kolodziejczyk was received by Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec and Chairman of parliament Milan Uhde.
