The first memorandum pertains to political consultations, while the second provides for the initiation of talks leading up to the signature of a free trade agreement between both nations. The memoranda were signed during a ceremony at the Economy Ministry attended by Czech Ambassador Ianko Peki, Vice Foreign Minister Fernando Petrella, Energy Secretary Carlos Bastos, Horacio Liendo, the legal, technical, and administrative coordination secretary, and Transport Secretary Edmundo Soria. In the absence of Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella, Cavallo remarked that the political and economic transformation of the former socialist state has been "very successful." He envisaged that this would open up greater possibilities for cooperation between the two countries. He pointed out that upon Klaus' own initiative, both countries will start negotiations on the liberalization of bilateral trade and the possibility of channeling trade through Mercosur [Common Market of the South] and the bloc made up of the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, and Poland, which have already signed a free trade agreement. Negotiations are also under way between the Argentine and Czech Governments to reach an agreement on the elimination of visa requirements, investment guarantees, and doing away with double taxation.
