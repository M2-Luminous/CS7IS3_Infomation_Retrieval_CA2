FR940930-1-00003 FR940930-1-00002 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;113&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives; Fokker Model F28 Mark 0100 Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Fokker Model F28 Mark 0100 series airplanes. This proposal would require modification of the fixed engine cowling at the forward and aft crane beam attachment; and an inspection of the forward and aft crane beam to detect surface damage, and repair, if necessary. This proposal is prompted by several reports of rear cabin noise (engine rumble) during flight and while taxiing, which may have been caused by the interference between the forward and aft crane beams and the fasteners in the fixed engine cowling. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent chafing due to normal engine vibration, which could result in structural damage to the engine mount and possible separation of the engine from the airplane. DATES: Comments must be received by November 10, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;113&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.
