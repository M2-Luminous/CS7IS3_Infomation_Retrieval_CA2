In view of the impending Diet deliberations on the fiscal year 1994 draft budget, LDP President Yohei Kono asserted: "It is not the right time to be reshuffling the cabinet. Is it not necessary instead to do something for the people who are having problems in their everyday lives?" However, the LDP questions Prime Minister Hosokawa's leadership, because the prime minister abandoned his plan due to opposition within the ruling coalition alliance, despite his initial determination. Sadatoshi Ozato, chairman of the LDP Diet Affairs Committee, said: "This indicates the Prime Minister's Office, which is the heart of the government, is not functioning at all." Regarding Hosokawa's carrying out his administrative duties in the future, a senior LDP official said: "The ruling coalition alliance has completely split in two, and there is an internal rift in the Prime Minister's Office as Prime Minister Hosokawa and Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura remain at odds. As such circumstances have surfaced, the prime minister has lost his prestige to a considerable degree." The LDP predicts the prime minister will now face many more difficulties than in the past. For example, LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori said: "Since so much confusion has been generated, there are bound to be some consequences." In the series of developments over the cabinet reshuffle issue, however, there also are moves within the LDP in response to the split in the ruling coalition alliance. Such moves have emerged mainly among junior party members. For example, it has been revealed that Prime Minister Hosokawa and Michio Watanabe, former LDP vice president and foreign minister, held a secret meeting. Since such moves could very well trigger a further split in the LDP, party President Kono and other party executives plan to pull the party together more firmly by hammering out an offensive strategy against the Hosokawa administration in Diet deliberations on the fiscal year 1994 draft budget and on other occasions. Meanwhile Kazuo Shii, secretary general of the Japan Communist Party, criticized the ruling coalition parties, saying: "The ruling coalition parties are engaged in an ugly power struggle, merely in speculation over a political realignment and election strategies in which the public is ignored. Neither those who want to reshuffle the cabinet nor those who are opposed to it have any good reasons."
