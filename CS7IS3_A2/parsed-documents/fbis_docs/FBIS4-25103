According to data released by the council, the technology development capability of Taiwan industries is only one-13th that of Japanese industries. On the scale, which sets America's technology development capability at 100, Taiwan industries score just 4.14 points, slightly higher than South Korea's 3.66 points, but lagging far behind Japan's 55.22 and Germany's 21.37 points, the council said. Council officials attributed the strong competitiveness of Japan's small and medium-sized industrial enterprises to the full governmental support and financial assistance they receive. Subsidies provided by the central or local government for research and development projects of Japanese small and medium-sized industrial enterprises are generally about 50 percent of each project, and sometimes more than 65 percent. Public banks in Japan also offer special low-interest loans for small and medium-sized enterprises' R&D projects. In addition, 7 percent of their annual R&D budgets are tax deductible, the officials noted, adding that cooperation between public research and academic units and the private sector is another major factor that helps boost the technological performance of Japanese industries, the officials said.
