FR940317-0-00012 FR940317-0-00005 7 CFR Part 989 [FV94&hyph;989&hyph;1IFR] Raisins Produced From Grapes Grown in California; Final Free and Reserve Percentages for the 1993&hyph;94 Crop Year for Natural (Sun-Dried) Seedless Raisins AGENCY: Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. ACTION: Interim final rule with request for comments. SUMMARY: This interim final rule invites comments on the establishment of final free and reserve percentages for 1993 crop Natural (sun-dried) Seedless raisins. The percentages are 74 percent free and 26 percent reserve. These percentages are intended to stabilize supplies and prices and to help counter the destabilizing effects of the burdensome oversupply situation facing the raisin industry. This rule was unanimously recommended by the Raisin Administrative Committee (Committee), the body which locally administers the marketing order. DATES: This interim final rule becomes effective March 17, 1994, and applies to all Natural (sun-dried) Seedless raisins acquired from the beginning of the 1993&hyph;94 crop year. Comments which are received by April 18, 1994 will be considered prior to any finalization of this interim final rule. ADDRESSES: Interested persons are invited to submit written comments concerning this action. Comments must be sent in triplicate to the Docket Clerk, Fruit and Vegetable Division, AMS, USDA, Room 2525&hyph;S, P.O. Box 96456, Washington, DC 20090&hyph;6456, or faxed to (202) 720&hyph;5698.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This interim final rule is issued under marketing agreement and Order No. 989 (7 CFR part 989), both as amended, regulating the handling of raisins produced from grapes grown in California, hereinafter referred to as the ``order.'' The order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), hereinafter referred to as the ``Act.'' The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. This interim final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the marketing order provisions now in effect, final free and reserve percentages may be established for raisins acquired by handlers during the crop year. This rule establishes final free and reserve percentages for Natural (sun-dried) Seedless raisins for the 1993&hyph;94 crop year, beginning August 1, 1993, through July 31, 1994. This interim final rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and requesting a modification of the order or to be exempt therefrom. Such handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After the hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his/her principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling.
