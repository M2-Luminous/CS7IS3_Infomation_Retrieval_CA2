A spokesman for the police committee, Lieutenant Phakiso Molise, called a press conference this afternoon at the Central Police Station in Maseru where he explained that the police had decided to return to work in the best interest of the Basotho nation. The police had accepted the terms of agreement on allowances which have been increased by certain percentages. This also applied to members of the prisons service. As far as salary increases were concerned, agreement was reached on sliding upwards all grades up to the position of major. Meanwhile, the strike ended with the police effecting their first arrest since the strike started three weeks ago, when they arrested a man who masqueraded as a policeman. The man who was arrested this afternoon masqueraded as a policeman, wearing police uniform and yet he knew that he was not a policeman. He in fact works for a security firm in Maseru. He is expected to appear in the Maseru magistrate's court shortly, charged with impersonating the police.
