As has already been reported, an International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] inspection team started inspections of us on 1 March, according to an agreement reached in DPRK-U.S. contacts in New York, and our country's organizations concerned are cooperating in the inspection team's activities. Our position is to sincerely implement agreements regarding the IAEA inspections to guarantee the continuity of nuclear safeguards. Despite this fact, the puppet vice foreign minister said that the agency's inspections of us are unsatisfactory. His remarks are indeed extremely absurd and preposterous. The puppet vice foreign minister also said that the South-North dialogue is not going smoothly. If we have to say something about this, we can say that the South is entirely responsible for this. In the fifth working-level contact for an exchange of special envoys of the North and South, the South side, instead of expressing a clear attitude toward our side's principled demand before discussing practical problems, made preposterous sophistries that our demand creates obstacles and that it is unnecessary, thus creating obstacles to the discussions of problems. The South side even deliberately raised an issue that has no relation to the discussions of the practical procedure and blemished the atmosphere of the talks, assuming an extremely provocative attitude. The puppets are now saying that the North-South dialogue is not going smoothly, after they themselves created deliberate obstacles to working-level contacts. This is no more than avoiding their responsibility. Never should it go unnoticed that the puppets keep insisting that progress in North-South dialogue is a precondition for the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks. As we have already elucidated, in the agreement reached at the DPRK-U.S. contact in New York, it only mentions the resumption of working-level contact for the exchange of special envoys of the North and South as one of the steps of simultaneous action [tongsi haengdong chochi]. There is no indication about the realization of the exchange of special envoys. The two sides of the DPRK and U.S. did not agree to the steps of simultaneous action with something as a precondition. The reason that the puppets are continuously babbling about some a precondition is ultimately to create an artificial barrier to put the brakes on the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks. This is nothing but a nasty scheme. This is being vividly proven by the fact that the so-called puppet vice foreign minister confessed that consultations are being continuously carried out with allies, including the United States, on the issue of referring the North Korean nuclear issue to the UN Security Council. Under the pretext of dialogue, the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique is pursuing behind the scenes the anti-Republic maneuver of isolation and suffocation under the international cooperative system [kukche kongjo cheje]. This will ultimately only lead to the road of pressing for destruction.
