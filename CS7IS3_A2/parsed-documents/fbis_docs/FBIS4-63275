Vagnorius [former prime minister], the Government of the Republic of Lithuania states that this draft law is just another attempt of the Homeland Union to push through an unconstitutional law. The enactment of its provisions would set Lithuanian people against one another, fool, and impoverish them even more, while the effects of all this would be blamed on the president and the Government of the Republic of Lithuania. The current Lithuanian Government does not avoid fair and harsh criticism. At the same time, it does not specifically engage in the analysis and criticism of shortcomings of former governments. Given such slander and reckless appeals, however, the government must say to the countrymen what sort of draft law this is, and what goals the Homeland Union leadership is pursuing. The draft law links in a populist manner and deliberately confuses three problems: Compensation of devalued deposits, privatization of state property, and long-term property indexation. Undoubtedly, the key problem is the compensation of deposits, which inhabitants had in Savings Bank accounts before 26 February 1991. At that time, the Lithuanian population had almost 2.8 million accounts at the Savings Bank, that is, this problem is pressing to nearly everyone, particularly to older people. The total of deposits was 7.1 billion rubles [R]. However, only R0.4 billion were kept in the Lithuanian Savings Bank accounts, and the remaining R6.7 billion -- in the USSR Savings Bank. In fact, G. Vagnorius' government did not do anything to make Russia return those deposits, and it chose the easiest way for deceiving people by urging depositors to leave their money intact in savings banks. Incidentally, procuring cattle from inhabitants and having no real resources, G. Vagnorius' government also urged inhabitants to leave their money in savings banks. It promised to change those deposits according to a more favorable exchange rate when introducing the national currency. The program of G. Vagnorius' government, which the Supreme Council of the Republic of Lithuania approved on 13 June 1991 (the resolution was signed by current Homeland Union Chairman V. Landsbergis), included a pledge to protect the inhabitants' deposits in savings banks against inflation -- "by adding the interest and, thus, increasing it in accordance with the officially approved inflation rate (in percent) over a period of interest review." Incidentally, it is this incorrect economic policy of G. Vagnorius' government that brought the largest wave on inflation to our country with its rate exceeding 50 percent in certain months. Therefore, it is understandable why former Lithuanian officials, V. Landsbergis and G. Vagnorius, who were fully responsible for restricting the payment of deposits to inhabitants and for their complete devaluation, have now chosen such an immoral political method, and they dare and continue to try to amass a political fortune from this problem. Misleading the country's population, the Conservatives are urging it in a populist move to adopt by way of referendum their proposed draft law, because otherwise illegal privatization will not be prevented, and inhabitants will lose the savings that are backed by assets subject to privatization, while the economy and living standards will continue to decline. G. Vagnorius stresses in particular that if "we prevent the distribution of state property without privatization, it will be possible to exchange the 1991 ruble for more litas rather than just one." At first glance, this is a very attractive appeal. It is very difficult for people to realize why the current government is categorically speaking out against the adoption of such a draft law. First, inhabitants lost their savings long ago, while the proposal to index them and other similar payments more than a 100 times is not based on any real possibilities. Compensation of savings and the restoration of the Lithuanian Savings Bank assets according to the proposed 100-fold indexation alone would require about 8 billion litai [Lt]. One can expect most Lithuanian people, particularly of retirement age, who were already deceived by G. Vagnorius' government, to come for their indexed deposits all at the same time. However, the draft law does not envision the manner in which banks can unrestrictedly pay indexed deposits until the assets transferred to them are sold, and the sale of these assets will become complicated due to their small value. Nor does the law envision who will cover losses for banks if the property is sold at a price lower than its indexed nominal value. It will not be easy to privatize the remaining state property because the objects that enjoyed the greatest demand (and had the lowest prices) were sold at the beginning of privatization, when G. Vagnorius' government was in power. If the rules for indexing and paying deposits proposed in the draft law were applied, the money supply in circulation would increase almost eight-fold and would exceed Lt9 billion, while the current money supply is a bare Lt1.040 million. The absence of an adequate amount of goods and services on the market would immediately cause hyperinflation (unrestrained price rise) which would gradually lead to the inevitable impoverishment of all inhabitants, including depositors. This would have a particularly painful effect on a large part of the population which does not keep its savings in banks, as well as on employees of budget offices, because there would be no chance of increasing their wages in accordance with the inflation rate. Hyperinflation would destroy the Lithuanian economy and would fully devalue the national currency. The same conclusion was drawn by the World Bank experts after studying the draft law. Second, while reiterating to the Lithuanian population about the possible indexation of deposits by using finances received from the sale of state property, G. Vagnorius should understand that it is his government that is primarily responsible for distributing almost the entire state assets for investment coupons for half price. Under this law, two-thirds of the property subject to privatization could be sold for investment coupons, that is, Lt712 million (two-thirds out of Lt1.068 billion), while the actual sum was Lt1.313 billion, that is, more than there was property for privatization. Although people were allowed to use investment coupons to buy apartments and land, or to privatize the property of agrarian enterprises (Lt343 million in investment coupons were used for this purpose), the amount of investment coupons issued for the privatization of state assets under the law on the primary privatization of state property exceeded the sum assigned by law as being Lt257.7 million. Therefore, the possibilities of commercial privatization are highly restricted in our country. Certainly, the policy of utilization of investment coupons is typical of all post- communist countries. However, sums of investment coupons or other forms of state property payments considerably differ in various states. For example, they account for 25 and 20 percent of the entire state assets in the Czech Republic and Slovenia, respectively. Meanwhile, in our country, investment coupons account for 82 percent of state property. Privatization in Estonia and Latvia is exclusively commercial -- only for money. Such a mode of state property privatization did not grant any possibilities to accumulate larger finances that could be utilized to compensate devalued deposits. However, it is already impossible to return to the former stage and change the privatization of state property, or to nationalize the long-term property that is privatized, because this would mean nothing else but a new nationalization. The sacred principle of property inviolability, contained in the Lithuanian Constitution, would be violated. This would discredit our government not only inside the country but also on the international scene, because private property is preserved and protected throughout the world. Third, the deceitful and reckless statement that "in early 1993, the majority of the Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party [LDDP] in the Seimas [parliament], as well as the government, made some inadmissible amendments to privatization laws and resolutions, which allegedly legalize the appropriation of state assets and the property of true stockholders for "its own people".... The denationalization of industrial enterprises is even simpler. Since last spring, a "group of friends" [reference to managers linked with the LDDP] has mostly "transferred them" to stock companies without any privatization, or without paying either in litas or investment coupons." Under Article 31 of the law on state-run enterprises adopted back in 1990 (G. Vagnorius actively participated in its drafting), and under G. Vagnorius' government resolution No. 51 "On the Increase of Capital Stock at State-Run and State Stock Enterprises With Their Own Resources," issued on 27 January 1992, enterprises were granted the right to enlarge their capital stock with residue profits, by issuing free or partially paid stocks in line with the law. This was the key method for restoring devalued working capital of enterprises due to hyperinflation, and for accumulating resources necessary for investments. An increase of the stock capital in line with the law on state-run enterprises changes only the ratio of state and stock capital, while the total sum of state capital remains undiminished. Therefore, the change in the status of an enterprise prevents the privatization of its state property, because in this case the state acquires the stockholders' rights defined in Article 14 of the law on stock companies of the Republic of Lithuania. Such a process cannot be called privatization or the appropriation of state property. A commentary to the draft law often mentions a "group of friends." However, these are not representatives of the government or the Mafia, but collectives of enterprises that became lawful stockholders. These are people who, under the provisions of the law on state-run enterprises, allocated residue profits for the enlargement of the stock capital, who did not "eat up" residue profits in the form of bonuses or other payments, and who did not put any additional pressure on the consumer market. So, what is their guilt, and why do the Conservatives propose to take away their amassed property? Resolution No. 456 "On Privatization Rules for State-Run and State Stock Enterprises, Non-Residential Facilities or Buildings Leased From State Offices and Organizations With Private Capital Investments," issued by G. Vagnorius' government on 12 June 1992, authorized the transfer of leased non-residential facilities to private capital enterprises as a state property contribution. The value of those facilities was assessed by the experts' commission, while the Central Privatization Commission was allowed to raise it to market prices. Between 1992 and 1993, lawfully leased facilities or buildings were transferred to 77 private capital enterprises. The residue value of these facilities is Lt38,400. The experts' commission assessed them at Lt3.5 million, while the Central Privatization Commission increased their value to Lt6.2 million. Nine commercial banks received leased facilities as a state property contribution with the residue value of Lt78,700, and the Central Privatization Commission enlarged the latter to Lt10 million. Since this resolution ran counter to the law on primary privatization of state property, the current government amended it by resolution No. 178 on 16 May 1994. This repeatedly demonstrates that in pursuing selfish goals, the Homeland Union leadership can bring the most absurd charges against the Seimas majority and the current government. Fourth, the Conservatives' proposal to index the long-term property of enterprises, including that of agrarian entities, offices, and organizations, in accordance with its structure as of 1 May 1992, and with the overall rate of devaluation, is totally unacceptable. With the privatization process under way, the structure of capital has essentially changed, and one cannot return to what is nonexistent. Government resolution No. 206 of 28 March 1994 established the ratio of property indexation considering the date this property was acquired, and the fact that the volume of production in industry and other sectors of the economy have declined by about 50 percent in comparison with 1991. Therefore, the effectiveness of long-term property has also dropped by half, and it would be incorrect to estimate it according to the full rate of devaluation, which the Statistics Department is doing. A large part of the country's long- term property comprises outdated equipment and technologies, which had to be worn out. However, former government resolutions continuously reduced the depreciation of the principal means of production. During the first indexation, the depreciation of long- term property was reduced twice, while during the second indexation -- four times. This way, the true value of capital goods became distorted. Therefore, government resolution No. 206 of 28 March 1994 envisions the indexation of the primary and residual value in accordance with different ratios, by restoring relevant depreciation. The surplus of the reviewed property is ascribed as the state and stock capital registered before 1 April 1994. The indexation of long-term property is mandatory for state-run and state stock enterprises, while private companies are only urged to accomplish this. Stockholders themselves must demand from their managers the indexation of their long-term property. Following the indexation of long-term property and capital of enterprises, stockholders' capital is also indexed, that is, the nominal value or the existing number of stocks is increased. Therefore, stockholders will not incur any losses. Thus, it is totally incomprehensible on what grounds G. Vagnorius calls the resolution of the current government on the indexation of long-term property "just another deliberate deception of people" and impertinent arbitrary rule; why, in his opinion, the value of the restored property "does not go to its owners, that is, the true stockholders or the state; and why is this property transferred in an unconstitutional manner to a "group of friends," who has recently acquired stock unlawfully or who has appropriated assets in some other way." Is it not an attempt to discredit the current government at any cost and to mislead the Lithuanian population? Fifth, having done nothing or not having fulfilled their promises to protect the inhabitant's deposits against inflation, the Conservatives are now proposing in their draft law (Paragraph 6 of Article 4) that the government assign $6 million from the Lithuanian hard currency reserve to fully compensate the deposits that were kept in the Lithuanian branch of the USSR Foreign Economic Relations Bank. This is a tempting proposal. However, we would like to ask G. Vagnorius on this occasion why his government, which intended to compensate inhabitants' devalued savings, wasted rather than preserved $5 million before the introduction of the litas by buying some totally unnecessary medical equipment from the Canadian company "Asmar." G. Vagnorius' government did not do anything to regain from the USSR Foreign Economic Relations Bank the deposits of physical and juridical persons estimated at $148.9 million, with $95 million among them accumulated for the reconstruction of the Klaipeda state oil enterprise, even though there were possibilities for this. Large finances were also wasted to acquire arms and supply the national defense system and the government security service. The Seimas Commission for Investigating Economic Crimes has established that G. Vagnorius' government distributed several tens of millions of U.S. dollars without Supreme Council approval. Meanwhile, this money could be amassed to compensate the devalued investments. The current government, in cooperation with the Seimas, is looking for ways to compensate inhabitants' lost savings. In its 15 December 1993 resolution No. 1-338, the Seimas approved the rules of indexing inhabitants' savings accumulated before 26 February 1991, and established that beginning in 1995, compensations for inhabitants' deposits will be estimated and paid in accordance with the amount of finances saved in the Income Restoration and Compensation Fund. The Seimas approved the statute of this fund on 26 April 1994 by its resolution No. I-444. This fund is formed with budget reserves, as well as with money earned from the privatization of state property and the sale of state stocks on the securities market, and with dividends received for the state capital in stock companies, and other resources. Under the current rules, by 1 May of this year, the government has paid more than Lt108 million in compensations, and it plans to pay another Lt100 million in early 1995. Government resolution No. 176 issued on 16 March 1994 defined the rules of partial compensation for the deposits which inhabitants kept at the Lithuanian branch of the USSR Foreign Economic Relations Bank (a similar decision was also adopted in 1993). The Finance Ministry received $1.2 million from the Government reserve fund to pay compensations to former depositors of the aforementioned bank. As of 1 May, there were $845,000 paid out of this fund. After the total assigned sum is paid out, 1,081 persons (out of the total of 2,107 depositors at the given bank) would receive full compensation for the appropriated money. In addition, the return of appropriated deposits is the issue of heated debate in negotiations with Russia. Sixth, the Conservatives want the draft law to act retroactively and recognize as unlawful the actions of enterprises in increasing the stock capital with residual profits and by other legal measures contained in laws and resolutions drafted and adopted during the times of G. Vagnorius' government. This draft law has quite a number of inconsistencies and contradictions with the current law of the Republic of Lithuania. It is also full of inaccuracies and provisions regulating such relations that cannot be the subject matter of this law. Moreover, under Part 3 of Article 69 of the Lithuanian Constitution, this draft law could be presented as constitutional only if it is included in the list of constitutional laws, drafted by the Lithuanian Seimas. Following the universally accepted principle of the division of powers, the lawfulness of some government actions should be considered by the Constitutional Court rather than by way of referendum. By submitting this draft law, the Homeland Union is seeking not to restore justice but to set Lithuanian people against one another even more, to paralyze the economic and social policy conducted by the current government, to cause chaos in the country's economy, to impoverish the people, and to discredit the Lithuanian Government through this. Realizing the meaningless and absurd nature of this move, the Government of the Republic of Lithuania appeals to all Lithuanian people not to yield to the temptation of Homeland Union's populist proposals, and not to vote for this draft law. We can improve our lives through patient daily work rather than through referendums. [Signed] The Government of the Republic of Lithuania [Dated] 10 May 1994
