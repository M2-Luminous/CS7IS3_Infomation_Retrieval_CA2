The government cannot recall its troops because the move will be similar to the measures of the United Nations which we criticise, he said when asked to comment on the latest situation in Bosnia. The government is aware of the dangers faced by our soldiers but we cannot allow the Bosnians to be killed just like that by the Serbs, he told a news conference after presenting excellence service awards to Home Ministry staff at the Prime Minister's Department, here. The prime minister said the government was concerned over the Malaysian soldiers because they were not equipped with adequate weapons as their duty was only peacekeeping. He also said that if the Malaysian soldiers were entrapped, he feared that the other UN soldiers might not go to their assistance as was the case when the Bosnians needed help. Dr Mahathir said that even so, the government would not withdraw the 1,500 Malaysian soldiers, most of them from the 23rd Battalion Royal Malay Regiment stationed in several Bosnian towns including Sarajevo, because the government did not only speak of justice but also practised it. Earlier, he criticised the [words indistinct] and the Security Council for not doing anything to help the Muslims in Goradze. He said that they were actually not interested to help and purposely allow the Serbs to kill the Bosnians and occupy the town. When the Serbs advanced, they did not put a stop to it and now they are merely saving the UN troops and leaving the Muslims without any help, he said.
