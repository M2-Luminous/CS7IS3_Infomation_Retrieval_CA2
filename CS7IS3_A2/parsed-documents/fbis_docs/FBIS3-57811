We are also proud to be counted among this enviable group of countries. Since then, the Nordic welfare state model has faced difficulties and many have felt tempted to ridicule Myrdal's words. I think that Myrdal is right. The international status of Finland has during the last decades become very stable and positive. In this sense there has been no change and there is no change in view. The Russian elections less than a month ago caused debate in Finland. Russia is still traversing a critical period, but there is no cause to draw hasty conclusions. The national referendum in Russia approved the new Constitution. That is an important step in creating a new political system in Russia. International observers did not have much to say about how the elections were run. The result of the elections reflects the uncertainty and the discontent experienced by Russians. However, no alternative has been shown in the direction of the reforms, although the speed of the reforms might change. The foreign and security policy in Russia is led by the president with the help of a democratically elected parliament. Our starting point is that there are good preconditions for established cooperation between Finland and Russia. Finland's negotiations in the European Union are at their final stage. Most issues in the negotiations have already been concluded. In a ministerial meeting just before Christmas, decisions which largely correspond with our aims were made in many important questions, like the new members taking part in foreign and security policy cooperation. In the next few weeks there will be a compact and demanding stage of negotiations on the questions which remain open, mainly in agriculture. It would be desirable that satisfactory solutions could be found quickly. According to my view, our preconditions to reach a good negotiations result will not improve if the solutions were to be delayed until after the elections of the European Parliament, until the end of the year or even further. It is important to reach such a result which, according to the promises of the government, can be submitted to a national referendum. In all situations we must ourselves take care of matters and advantages concerning us, our economy, and our security. It is not certain that anybody else will do that for us. [as heard] The debate on our future economic views has increased. In the last decade we have become used to thinking that progress is sure and justified, setbacks are considered to be temporary and unnecessary. Lately there have been comments which take a serious view on the alternative that we could not or we should not continuously aim to increase our consumption level. We are increasingly taking part in international cooperation and we are greatly dependent on what happens in the world. Matters which can be reliably predicted take place and unpredictable matters take place. The growth in the world's population continues in a speedy way, birth control is ineffective, and all countries that are able to aim to increase the standard of living of their population, improving the peoples' state of health, and increasing the average age. The increase in the number of human beings and their increasing needs to consume create pressure for natural resources and threaten the balance of nature. [passage omitted] Poverty is absolute but it is also relative. There is an increasing gulf between consumption in the industrial countries and in the developing countries. A few recently industrialized countries here and there have managed to jump over this gulf, mainly in Southeast Asia. The example and the actions of the industrialized countries are putting the balance of nature to a severe test, mainly in those developing countries where there are unused natural resources. Finland is one of those countries which have restricted natural resources and where the increase in the level of consumption because of that is based on exploiting resources from elsewhere. This phenomenon has been especially strong in the last few years when we have taken increasing debts from abroad at a speed not seen before. This sort of indebtedness has been possible only because we have been able to assure the rest of the world of our willingness and ability to fairly quickly stop our increasing indebtedness and start repaying our debts. Taking care of the debts and taking part in supporting nations which are in a much worse position than us will lead to the situation whereby there will not be any room to increase the level of consumption for a long time. In my view, in order to pay the bill we need more production, not less. However, less of that produced can be used by ourselves, not more. The external value of the Finnish mark has now been under the influence of market forces and they have kept it incredibly low. The low external value of the Finnish mark, according to my calculations, has at least so far led to increased unemployment, not decreased. Our export industry now has an exceptionally good ability to compete with prices. If our export sector were more extensive and if our exports were more largely based on a selection of products where, from an international point of view, we are not a considerable producer, we would have extensive markets to utilize without any danger of large conflicts, because we have access to markets which some countries do not have. We have no reason to sneer at anybody on the basis of our exceptionally good price competitiveness. We should be able to increase our exports but without big investments. What ability we have to invest should not in any case be used in areas which produce little, like the infrastructure projects which are currently unnecessary. A better balance between the services we sell abroad and those we buy abroad is created mainly because our ability to buy services has weakened faster than our ability to sell them. A lot has been invested lately in Finland in services, both in the material sense and in the mental sense. The supply and demand of services are endless, the question increasingly is who is prepared to pay for them and how they can be financed. We have become used to talk about a structural change, which sometimes has been considered necessary; sometimes there has been a willingness to restrain it. What is meant within the structural change has not been defined. According to my view, what is meant with regard to structural change is that an ever decreasing part of the workforce should be in primary production and that the workforce should not increase, even in goods manufacturing, but that at an increasing level people should carry serve one another and receive compensation which corresponds to their education. It would have been good if the permanent preconditions for structural changes in society had been better assessed -- apparently the time has arrived for assessment. [passage omitted]
