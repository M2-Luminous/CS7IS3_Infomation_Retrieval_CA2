[Hajjaj] Any fighting in Somalia is unfortunate because it will necessarily affect Somali security, on which the international community has spent a lot of effort and money. Any aggression against organizations operating in Somalia, particularly UN troops, should be condemned strongly. The whole world is watching Somalia as the deadline for the withdrawal of international troops nears. Any fighting or any injury among the UN or other international relief agency workers will trigger a bad reaction. The international community will be dissuaded from granting relief aid to the Somali people, who have suffered enough as a result of the infighting. [Abu-al-Majd] Observers believe that the recent fighting might have been the prologue for large-scale fighting, since the Somali factions are now stockpiling weapons to prepare for the withdrawal of most Western troops by 31 March. Do you agree with this view? [Hajjaj] Yes. Many signs indicate that some Somali factions are currently mobilizing and arming their troops to engage in further fighting and bring further destruction to the Somali people. This is what international observers fear, the OAU included. As I said before, the international community has spent a lot of money and effort in Somalia. If the Somali factions continue to fight among themselves and if the subsequent displacement of hundreds of thousands of people and the destruction of the infrastructure continue, the international community will not pay the issue the same attention it is giving it now. The leaders of the Somali factions should realize this is a serious matter, and the reasonable Somali people must prevent such massacres. [Abu-al-Majd] What role will the OAU play in the coming stage to prevent such infighting? [Hajjaj] The OAU maintains contacts with the Somali factions. It welcomes any contact from these factions to establish peace and stability in Somalia. We urge the African states that have troops operating in Somalia not to withdraw these troops, because African states have committed themselves to help the Somali people. We do not want African states to withdraw their troops like other non-African states. Moreover, the Somali factions must stop the fruitless infighting. No faction will be left to take charge of the ruling process if it thinks that more fighting will allow it to strengthen its position. Certainly, other factions will emerge to resist it. Accord must prevail among all Somali factions. [Abu-al-Majd] With the approach of the date of the Western troop withdrawal from Somalia, are you coordinating with the United Nations so that Western troops can be replaced by African or Islamic troops? [Hajjaj] There are contacts between the OAU and the United Nations. This coordination can be enhanced. As you know, the OAU ministerial council emphasized in its latest meeting that there should be constant coordination between the OAU and the United Nations. Our goals are the same even though our resources are not. The joint goal is to establish peace and stability so that the long-overdue reconstruction process can be launched. The longer this process is delayed, the less attention the international community pays to the Somali issue. There are other world problems that command world attention, like the former Soviet republics, the former Yugoslavia, and others. [passage omitted]
