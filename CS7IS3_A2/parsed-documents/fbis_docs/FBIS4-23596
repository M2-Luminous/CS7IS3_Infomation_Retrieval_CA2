Answering questions at the World Economic Forum conference in Cape Town, he said in terms of privatisation, people with capital were advantaged -- that is, "not blacks, only whites". The "democratic government" would therefore be deprived of resources. "This (privatisation) is not seen here in the same way as in Switzerland," Mr Mandela added to laughter. The privatisation of such assets as airports and harbours "cannot be in the interests of the masses of the people". Asked whether he was prepared to give a glimpse into the June 22 budget, Mr Mandela said to more laughter that he did not want to "take you into confidence" but that he was sure the minister of finance, Mr Derek Keys -- who was present at the conference -- "will be pleased to answer".
