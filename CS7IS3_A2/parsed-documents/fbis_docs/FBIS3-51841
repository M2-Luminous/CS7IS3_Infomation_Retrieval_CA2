The 62-year-old politician told CANA as he prepared to present his party's slate of 15 parliamentary candidates Wednesday night: "No last-minute strategy of an alliance of convenience by the opposition parties can prevent us from securing a third consecutive mandate from the people of St. Vincent and the Grenadines". The NDP's 15 candidates will be introduced during a rally at Victoria Park that officially launches the NDP's election campaign. The newly-created opposition alliance of the St. Vincent Labour Party (SVLP) and the smaller Movement for National (MNU) [as received] will present its candidates on February 3, on the eve of nomination day, February 4. The alliance, announced on Monday, will be led by former opposition leader and leader of the SVLP, Vincent Beache. The 62-year-old Beache, a former long-standing trade and industry minister of previous Labour Party governments, brushed aside Mitchell's prediction of a third term, saying: "Mitchell's contrived confidence is based more on emotionalism and hope than pragmatism and the realities of politics in this country today." Informed political observers, however, say that while the opposition alliance could "certainly weaken" the governing party in the election, the NDP would take at least 10 of the 15 parliamentary seats. Reacting to the calculation, Beache, opposition leader from 1984 to 1989, said: "We will surprise the cynics, and Mitchell in particular." He declined to say how many of the nine constituencies he thought the SVLP-MNU alliance would capture. He was optimistic about MNU leader, Ralph Gonsalves, a lawyer and political scientist, winning the North-Central Windward constituency seat, held by NDP's Johnathan Peters, until recently minister of trade. Peters' resignation, "for personal reasons," takes effect from month-end. In the 1989 general election, Beache and Gonsalves lost to Peters in the fight for the North-Central Windward seat. For the February 21 poll, Beache will be contesting, for the first time, the South Windward constituency seat held by ex-Health Minister Burton Williams, who resigned earlier this month as a minister in the office of the prime minister, accusing Mitchell of "being too arrogant and contemptutuous of the people of St. Vincent and the Grenadines." Mitchell has dismissed specualation about "serious rifts" in his party forcing him to call the election. "The opposition parties are grasping at straws," he said, "in seeking to make a lot of politics of the going, for different and personal reasons, of both Burton and Peters. It is not a problem for the NDP or me." The prime minister said his party "will win on performance, our record of economic and social achievements, the quality of goverance, our concept of public accountability and, of course, the confusion among the opposition parties that now have their so-called 'unity' with three leaders." Beache, referring to the "three leaders" comment, said the prime minister was "smarting from the unexpected electoral alliance. It is not a question of three leaders," he added, "but one leader of the alliance for the election, with the understanding should we win, as we expect to, I will be chosen to head a new government as prime minister while the SVLP and MNU will move to merge into a single party." Unlike the leader of the SVLP, lawyer Stanley John, and MNU's leader, Gonsalves, Beache is the most experienced political figure of the alliance. He lost his own traditional North Central Windward constituency in 1989 when Mitchell's NDP captured all 15 constituencies. With a then 71-percent voter turn-out, the NDP's unprecedented victory that included the four constituencies labour had won in 1984, was achieved with some 66 percent of the valid popular votes. Labour, though failing to win a single seat, secured approximately 30 percent of the votes. In contrast to Mitchell's rallying calls for a third term, based on constant economic growth rate ranging from more than three to seven percent over the past two terms, the opposition alliance is charging "deteriorating standards of living under a government with lopsided development priorities and arrogant leadership." The government and the opposition alliance are wide apart on the level of unemployment and the state of social services, particularly in health. Prime Minister Mitchell, whose government has consistently been given the "green light" on fiscal management by both the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, has placed the jobless rate at approximately 20 percent. But Beache said unemployment was "now at least 40 and possibly 45 per cent." He said the government diverted too much development funding to the Grenadines, Mitchell's constituency. This, he claimed, was done "at the expense of St. Vincent where the hospital is without drugs and where the government remains insensitive to the alarming incidence of drugs-related crimes and rising cost of living." Mitchell said his governments had succeeded in keeping inflation at between 2.1 and 3.1 percent, improved the "general social and physical infrastructure, and created development projects in the Grenadines to bring this country more in line with the realities of international competitiveness in the vital tourism sector."
