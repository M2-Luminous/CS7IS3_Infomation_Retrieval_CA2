The official welcoming ceremony was held at Cotroceni Palace this morning. Presidents Berisha and Iliescu then held a tete-a-tete, and at 1000 both delegations held official talks. Taking the floor, Romanian President Ion Iliescu thanked President Berisha for the visit to Romania and considered it an important step for the further development of political relations and economic cooperation. He made explained the economic situation in Romania and the reforms undertaken on the road to a market economy. He pointed out that alongside the historic ties that exist between our both countries it is high time to strengthen the economic and political cooperation that is mutually advantageous to countries that have just emerged from fierce dictatorships. President Berisha briefed President Iliescu on the course of reforms in Albania. He stressed that despite the unfavorable geopolitical situation, the results of reform are positive. Regarding the situation in the Balkans, he stressed once again that the main question in the Balkans is the Albanian question. Albania does not support a change of borders through violence, but demands democratic space for Albanians and freedoms and rights pertaining to them from the Helsinki Charter. As long as Albanians demand the implementation of CSCE principles, the international community and the region should be seriously engaged in solving their problems. The idea that Kosova is Serbia's problem is a half-baked idea and seeks to provoke conflict, President Berisha stressed. All Balkan peoples have their own national problems, but no one wants to resolve them through war, as Serbia does. If Serbia does not give up the idea of Greater Serbia, Belgrade will involve the whole region in a war. The division of Kosova or Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] is equal to conflict. Milosevic's refusal to conduct a dialogue with the legitimate representatives of 2 million Kosova Albanians is absurd. We support dialogue in the presence of a third party. It is within this framework that we assess the efforts by British Minister Hogg during his last visit to Belgrade and Kosova. I am convinced, President Berisha continued, that an acceptable solution can be found. However, since the situation is equivalent to a time bomb, this runs the risk of turning into a conflict that includes not only Albanians. President Berisha then held a warm meeting with representatives of the Cultural Union of Albanians in Romania at the Albanian Embassy. In a meeting with reporters, President Berisha stressed that to continue the dialogue to resolve problems and improve relations with Greece, we intend to propose another meeting of the foreign ministers of both countries in Tirana. We see the Zurich meeting as positive, because both ministers expressed their clear willingness to improve the relations. We hope that this willingness and predisposition will be further strengthened and that they will yield fruit.
