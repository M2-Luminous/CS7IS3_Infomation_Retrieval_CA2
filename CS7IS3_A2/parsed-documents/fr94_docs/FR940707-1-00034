FR940707-1-00034 FR940707-1-00011 (1) The extent to which a facility or service offered by a housing provider to residents is not customarily offered to residents of comparable housing (other than housing for older persons) in the relevant geographic area. (2) The extent to which a facility or service can accommodate the older population of the housing facility. The capacity of each facility or service specifically designed to meet the physical or social needs of older persons depends upon, but is not limited to, such factors as: (i) The size of the facility or scope of the service offered; (ii) The length of time during which the facility is made available or the service is offered; (iii) The frequency with which the facility is made available or the service is offered; and (iv) Whether the facility or service is offered only at one location or there are a number of locations at which the facility is made available or at which the service is offered. (3) The extent to which the facility or service is of benefit to older persons, given the climate and physical setting of the housing facility. (4) The extent to which a facility or service is actually used by older persons who are residents. (5) The extent to which the facility or service is provided by the housing provider rather than by others. (6) Whether a facility or service is not one that is required to be provided by a law related to housing for the elderly or housing for older persons. §100.310 Impracticability. (a) The provisions regarding familial status in this part shall not apply to housing intended and operated for occupancy by at least one person 55 years of age or older per unit, provided that the person or entity affirmatively demonstrates through credible and objective evidence that the housing satisfies the requirements of §§100.305, 100.306, 100.315 and 100.316 or §§100.310, 100.315 and 100.316. Housing satisfies the requirements of this section §100.310 if it is not practicable to provide significant facilities and services designed to meet the physical or social needs of older persons and the housing facility is necessary to provide important housing opportunities for older persons. (b) In order to satisfy the requirements of §100.310 the owner or manager must affirmatively demonstrate through credible and objective evidence that the provision of significant facilities and services designed to meet the physical or social needs of older persons would result in depriving older persons in the relevant geographic area of needed and desired housing. The following factors, among others, are relevant in meeting the requirements of §100.310. (1) Whether the owner or manager of the housing facility has endeavored to provide significant facilities and services designed to meet the physical or social needs of older persons either by the owner or by some other entity. Demonstrating that such services and facilities are expensive to provide is not alone sufficient to demonstrate that the provision of such services is not practicable. (2) The amount of rent charged, if the dwellings are rented, or the price of the dwellings, if they are offered for sale. (3) The income range of the residents of the housing facility. (4) The demand for housing for older persons in the relevant geographic area. (5) The range of housing choices for older persons within the relevant geographic area. (6) The availability of other similarly priced housing for older persons in the relevant geographic area. If similarly priced housing for older persons with significant facilities and services is reasonably available in the relevant geographic area then the housing facility does not meet the requirements of §100.310 . (7) The vacancy rate of the housing facility. §100.315 80 percent occupancy. (a) The provisions regarding familial status in this part shall not apply to housing intended and operated for occupancy by at least one person 55 years of age or older per unit, provided that the person or entity affirmatively demonstrates through credible and objective evidence that housing satisfies the requirements of §§100.305, 100.306, 100.315 and 100.316 or 100.310, 100.315 and 100.316. Housing satisfies the requirements of §100.315 if at least 80 percent of the units in the housing facility are occupied by at least one person 55 years of age or older per unit except that a newly constructed housing facility for first occupancy after March 12, 1989 need not comply with §100.315 until 25 percent of the units in the facility are occupied. (b) Housing satisfies the requirements of this section even though: (1) On September 13, 1988, under 80 percent of the occupied units in the housing facility are occupied by at least one person 55 years of age or older per unit, provided that at least 80 percent of the units that are occupied by new occupants after September 13, 1988 are occupied by at least one person 55 years of age or older. (2) There are unoccupied units, provided that at least 80 percent of such units are reserved for occupancy by at least one person 55 years of age or over.
