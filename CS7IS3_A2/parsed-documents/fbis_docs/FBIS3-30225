He said that mutual cooperation of Central European countries would help to speed up the inevitable economic changes and their incorporation into the well-tried European structures. Replying to a question about whether in his opinion the Visegrad Group could exist without the Czech Republic, President Kovac said that, in the talks he had in Prague, there was no indication that the Czech Republic was not interested in mutual cooperation. President Kovac therefore does not think it appropriate to consider other alternatives to the Visegrad Group.
