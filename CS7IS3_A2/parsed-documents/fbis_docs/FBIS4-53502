FBIS4-53502 "dreas097_d_94007" FBIS-EAS-94-097 Daily Report 19 May 1994 South Korea Government To Offer Training to DPRK Loggers Government To Offer Training to DPRK Loggers SK1905092394 Seoul YONHAP in English 0822 GMT 19 May 94 SK1905092394 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, May 19 (YONHAP) -- The government plans to give the five North Korean loggers who arrived Wednesday the opportunity to attend public vocational training centers here according to their goals, aptitude and ability, a senior government official said Thursday. The loggers, the first allowed to resettle here through consultations between South Korea and the Commonwealth of Independent States, will receive social adaption education first for one or two months before entering vocational training institutes. The government, however, is studying whether to place them in existing classes at the centers or educate them separately, according to the official. The five North Koreans, who escaped from Pyongyang-run logging camps in Siberia, arrived here Wednesday afternoon via a third country. It is the first time that the Seoul government has allowed North Korean loggers to resettle here through lawful means. In preparation for the increase in those wanting to come here after escaping from the Siberian logging camps or North Korean territory, the government is studying formation of a "special training team" to deal exclusively with North Koreans. But if they want to receive higher education, the government will examine how to enable them to enter colleges or universities, the official said. The government has tentatively decided to help the North Koreans find jobs after they finish vocational training, and will give them 10 million won (about 12,407 U.S. dollars) each in support for their resettlement.
