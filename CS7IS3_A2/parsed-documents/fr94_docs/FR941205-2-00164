FR941205-2-00164 FR941205-2-00074 Discussion : The Secretary does not agree that the needs and issues of the individuals are different if the population of American Indians is low in the State. Services still must be culturally appropriate for the individuals. The purpose of the training is to develop the skills of rehabilitation counselors and other staff who work in State rehabilitation agencies on how to work effectively with American Indians. The priority mandates that the project address the use of appropriate rehabilitation methods, cultural differences, and development of mutual understanding and trust between the service provider and recipient of services through the development of culturally sensitive rehabilitation training materials. The Secretary does not agree that replication will be difficult since the size of the population within the State is not considered to be a factor in using appropriate rehabilitation methods that respect the cultural differences. The Secretary does agree, however, that the training should be made available to all States where there is a significant population of American Indians since the State is required to provide vocational rehabilitation services to American Indians who are individuals with disabilities residing in the State to the same extent as the State provides those services to other significant segments of the population of individuals with disabilities residing in the State (section 101(a)(20) of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended). Changes: The priority has been changed to target States with significant rather than high American Indian populations. Comments: One commenter indicated opposition to the priority because of its focus on one specific population, stating that such a focus would encourage division among the underserved and unserved. Discussion: The Secretary does not agree that focusing this priority on a population that is one of the most underserved and unserved groups of individuals with disabilities would encourage division among unserved and underserved groups. The Secretary believes that the cultural differences of American Indians requires special emphasis to improve services. Changes: None. Comments: One commenter expressed concern over the train-the-trainer approach required by this priority and recommended that the best approach to understanding the rehabilitation issues and ensuring sensitivity to cultural needs is to use American Indians to help State agency personnel improve skills necessary for the provision of services. The commenter believes that focusing on the development of local relationships and the use of available materials would serve State agencies better and that a collaborative training approach would be more appropriate. Discussion: The inclusion of American Indians in the development of all aspects of the training and in the development of training materials under this priority is mandatory. Additionally, nothing in this priority or in the train-the-trainer approach would preclude the use of already available materials. The Secretary further notes that training in the development of local relationships can be included in the training materials that address appropriate rehabilitation methods in providing vocational rehabilitation services to American Indians with disabilities. Changes: None. Training of Interpreters for Individuals Who Are Deaf and Individuals Who Are Deaf-Blind General Comments Comments: Two commenters recommended that a significant effort and commitment be made to the training of oral interpreters and that training become a funding priority. It was suggested that applicants for grants be asked to document how they will interest people in oral interpreting training and to include information on the contents of the curriculum. Discussion: The regulations in 34 CFR 396.1 describe the Training of Interpreters for Individuals Who Are Deaf and Individuals Who Are Deaf-Blind program as a program that trains a sufficient number of skilled interpreters to meet the communication needs of individuals who are deaf and individuals who are deaf-blind by training manual, tactile, oral, and cued speech interpreters. The curriculum developed by the National Technical Institute for the Deaf for the training of oral interpreters is included in the training program conducted by the two federally funded national interpreter training projects and is also being used by the 10 regional interpreter training projects. In addition, within the curriculum of each of the affiliate institutions, preservice training programs provide an introduction to oral interpreting and other interpreting methodologies.
