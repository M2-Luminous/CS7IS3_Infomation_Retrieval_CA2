According to the document, the republic's Ministry for Foreign Economic Relations is given the right to conduct auctions at the International Kazakhstan Agro-Industrial Exchange for the sale of permits to participate in the implementation of intergovernmental agreements for grain export shipments during the current year: 3,000 tonnes to Uzbekistan, 500 tonnes each to Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, and Iran, 360 tonnes to Tajikistan, 150 tonnes to Moldova, and 50 tonnes to Turkmenistan. Permitted to participate in the auctions are economic entities that have presented contracts for grain shipments from the 1993 crop net surplus as of 1 September 1994, and as of 1 November 1994, from the current year's crop under the condition of priority fulfillment of contracts for grain sales to meet state needs. All contracts must undergo preliminary expert review by the Ministry for Foreign Economic Relations. Grains exported in accordance with intergovernmental agreements are not subject to customs duty. Grain exports through barter arrangement are permissible. Anatoliy Savelov, deputy chief of the Department for Economic Policy of the republic Cabinet of Ministers, provided the following comments on the decree: "In 1994, in contrast to previous years, a new, unified procedure was established for selling grain to entities outside Kazakhstan. Grain sales of the 1993 and 1994 crops will be effected in three directions: mandatory grain sales to meet state needs, grain shipments in accordance with intergovernmental agreements, and sales of other net surpluses of grain. "Mandatory grain deliveries to meet state needs are effected in accordance with the Decree of the Kazakhstan Republic Cabinet of Ministers on Purchases and Shipments of Agricultural Output for State Needs in 1994. According to the decree, the total volume of mandatory grain deliveries to the state is 7 million tonnes. This volume is divided among the 17 republic oblasts. In this regard, it is stipulated that the directors of ministries, associations, joint-stock companies, and other republic organizations entrusted with functions as state clients, as well as the heads of oblast and rayon administrations, are responsible for the placement and fulfillment of orders for grain purchases and deliveries for state needs in the full amount and of suitable quality. "Grain producers who have completed their mandatory deliveries may dispose of the remaining grain as they see fit, including exporting it. "Rural producers have two ways of doing this. "The first is to sell the grain through Kazakhstan's fulfillment of intergovernmental agreements. Here the Ministry for Foreign Economic Relations conducts auctions at the Kazakhstan Agro-Industrial Exchange in the sale of permits for the right to effect export shipments of grain in accordance with intergovernmental agreements. Obtaining a license in this manner affords the following benefits: exemption from customs duty of the entire volume of grain to be shipped, and first-priority issue of serviceable, covered freight cars for grain shipment. "The second method consists of nonauction sale for export to any country of grain net surpluses for either the currency of this country or through barter arrangement, at the grain producer's discretion. "In this event, the grain producer, or other economic intermediary selected by the producer to sell its grain surpluses, purchases export permits that are sold by oblast organs of the Ministry for Foreign Economic Relations at regional commodities exchanges. "An economic entity is obliged to present a contract for the grain shipment, including a shipment through barter arrangement, to the oblast organ of the Ministry for Foreign Economic Relations for its expert review. It must than obtain a license and register the contract in question at the regional commodities exchange. "In all cases except mandatory deliveries for state needs, grain sales must be effected prior to 1 September 1994 for sales from the remainder of last year's crop, and after 1 November for sales from the 1994 crop. "The mandatory expert review of contracts is established with the aim of preventing grain shipments at dumping prices."
