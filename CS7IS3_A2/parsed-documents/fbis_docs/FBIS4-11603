On the contrary, the situation is getting worse, in an environment of uncertainty, in the clashes in the main cities and on the roads of the country. The government has not implemented a state of siege, but it is at an intermediate point, as putting troops on the streets already illustrates the concern and inability of the police to take complete control of the situation. I would not say there is internal commotion, but the situation is reaching worrisome levels. The experience suffered by our colleague Cathia Rodriguez, which you saw at the beginning of this newscast, was risky for her personal safety because of the actions of common criminals, thugs, who tried to lynch the policemen who were working in an office in La Paz. This event shows that the situation is beginning to get out of hand. I don't want to be an alarmist, but this is worrisome. I believe there is little flexibility from the government over negotiations that could provide some option, some solution. The Bolivian Labor Federation says it will not negotiate under current conditions. The pressures are increasing, and the government is beginning to face reality. It is up against the wall, although paradoxically it holds the power. It opposes the state of siege, but this could be a way out. But if the overall situation is one of uncertainty and permanent confrontation, the government will not achieve its goals. Deputy Ferrufino clearly said: We are worried because of our impossibility of resolving the problems. It is time for the government to realize that the discovery of a solution is in its hands, and this depends on a minimum of flexibility, which we believe it lacks.
