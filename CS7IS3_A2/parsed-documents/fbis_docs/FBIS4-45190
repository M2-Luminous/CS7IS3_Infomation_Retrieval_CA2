Therefore, the Attorney General's Office (PGR) is investigating the activities of at least three companies. This announcement was made today by the director of the National Association of Manufacturers (Canacintra), Miguel Angel Calderon Rodriguez. He indicated that the department has located money from the drug traffic in commercial firms, but not in the manufacturing sector. He cautioned that companies proven to have connections with that illicit activity will have their membership in Canacintra canceled immediately. The state attorney, Francisco Molina Ruiz, declared that drug trafficking rings have infiltrated several areas of society, including the business-owning sector. He noted that, two weeks ago, the U.S. agency fighting drugs (DEA) in El Paso, Texas, seized five tons of cocaine and arrested eight presumed drug traffickers, including the owner of the Jomar chain of stationery stores, Joel Omar Chavez Quezada. Nevertheless, the attorney claimed not to know the names of the firms presumably implicated in laundering money representing the proceeds from dealing in that alkaloid. [passage omitted]
