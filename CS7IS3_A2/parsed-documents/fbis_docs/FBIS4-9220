According to Mr. Daskalov, the document specifies the main directions for bilateral cooperation, but the important thing is that these are refracted through the prism of our common aims to integrate us in the European and Euro- Atlantic structures. Prior to this, Acting Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev talked for almost two hours with Netherlands Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers and Foreign Minister Peter Kooijmans. During the meeting they discussed the difficulties of the transition and the possibilities for stimulating our bilateral relations, especially in the sphere of investments and cooperation in providing financial credits. Through its representatives, the Netherlands assured us that in the near future it will ratify the interim trade agreement between Bulgaria and the European Union. The guests expressed the Netherlands' readiness to invest in our transportation projects, including the new Danube bridge.
