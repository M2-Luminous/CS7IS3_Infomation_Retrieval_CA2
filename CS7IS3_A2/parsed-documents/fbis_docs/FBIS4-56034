The budget was designed on the assumption that interest rates on the National Bank of Poland's [NBP] refinancing credit will be 28 percent on the average. "We know already at this point that it is not going to be the case," Piotr Dziewulski, director of the Finance Ministry's department of public debt, told journalists yesterday. A higher refinancing rate means that the cost of servicing the debt (meaning repayment of interest rates on bonds and discounts on Treasury bonds) will increase the budget. On the other hand, the Budget Law clearly limits the cost of servicing the debt -- it cannot exceed 73.8 trillion zlotys. So if budget revenue does not rise fast enough to be able to finance the higher costs of servicing the debt, then the budget deficit will have to be lower than was assumed up to now. Otherwise, the cost of servicing the debt would have to go over the 73.8 trillion-zloty mark, but that would require an earlier amendment of the Budget Law. According to Director Dziewulski, instead of the 83 trillion zlotys planned in the Budget Law, the actual deficit may be between 70 and 75 trillion zlotys. "I think that the average interest rate on NBP's refinancing credit will be 33 percent in 1994. I am assuming optimistically that NBP will conduct another reduction at the end of the year," Director Dziewulski added. As of 18 May, 37.5 percent of the maximum allowed amount of the debt (73.8 trillion zlotys) was devoted from the budget for servicing the debt, whereas by the same date, budget revenue constituted 33.3 percent of the planned amounts for the entire year (for budget expenditures, the figure was 31.6 percent).
