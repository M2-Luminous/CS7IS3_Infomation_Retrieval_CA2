Opposition Seems To Have Launched Big Offensive"] [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] To all appearances, a new sharp spiral in the escalation of tensions in Tajikistan is in the cards. According to information received from sources close to opposition leaders, as many as six Russian border guards, not one, were killed in the recent clash along the Tajik border, and eight were wounded with two of them being in serious condition. The opposition contend that their like-minded associates were firing from Tajik territory. According to information from the same source, Tajik militants are arriving in great numbers from Afghanistan in the Pamirs. Tajik opposition members who live in Moscow cannot clearly explain what is happening in their own country because communications with their associates from Afghanistan have been broken. They think, however, that leaders of the Islamic Movement of Tajikistan in Afghanistan have decided that Dushanbe has breached the understanding reached with the opposition by starting to discuss a new constitution before the second round of talks, and has clearly gambled on a military solution of the question. Your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent has come to learn that Tajikistan leaders have been urgently summoned to Moscow.
