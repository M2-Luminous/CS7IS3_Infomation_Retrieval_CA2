"We will severely punish tax evaders and cheaters as well as those who threaten and do physical harm to tax collectors," pledged Li Yonggui, vice-director of the SAT. "The present punishment, mainly through fines, has hardly worked. The serious tax violators must be brought to court and sentenced according to law," Li said. China instituted a new law on individual income tax on January 1st this year. Under the new law, salaries or wages of Chinese citizens must be taxed after a deduction of 800 yuan. The deduction amount for foreigners in China is 4,000 yuan. But in both cases, the highest tax rate is 45 percent. As the national economy booms and especially with the latest overhaul of the wage system of government staff, the ranks of taxpayers have swelled. The state tax authorities today asked all government functionaries, starting from this month, to fulfill their duties by deducting the due tax from their staff's wages or salaries on behalf of the tax administration. "High-placed officials with the party Central Committee, the State Council and some of the ministries have either paid taxes or have had taxes deducted by relevant departments," said Li. Li disclosed that by the end of March, the country had collected 1.304 billion yuan in personal income tax, an increase of 470 million yuan, or up 56.2 percent over the same period of last year.
