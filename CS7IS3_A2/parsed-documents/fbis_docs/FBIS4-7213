The white paper prepared by the small and medium enterprise agency, which is affiliated with the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, described the environment changes facing smaller companies -- those capitalized at 10 million yen or less -- as unprecedented in terms of scale, diversity and seriousness. "Decisive" reform efforts that may lead to a "fundamental" review of traditional business practices and structure need to be made in line with these environment changes, the white paper said. The paper emphasized the need for creation of new business and services by ailing small enterprises. Such business chances are possible through diversification efforts and conversion to new areas, the paper said. The document also proposed reforms to revitalize smaller firms on the labor and organizational fronts, including investment in young and promising human resources, a practice rarely seen among smaller firms in the past, and formation of business ties beyond traditional boundaries. Summing up business activity in the past year, the white paper for fiscal 1993 said small- and medium-sized companies are struggling in almost all sectors because of the long-standing slump amid slack personal spending. Fiscal 1993 ended March 31. In fiscal 1993, the number of bankruptcies among smaller companies increased 3.5 percent from the preceding year, the paper said. The paper cited a significant deterioration in earnings, excessive manpower supply, a deepening cash shortage and a sharp drop in capital spending as the main elements affecting smaller businesses and which are a legacy of the lingering recession. The yen's sharp appreciation against the dollar since February 1993 dealt a severer blow on smaller companies than when the group of seven economic powers tried to drive down the dollar's value against other major currencies with the 1985 Plaza Accord. Other adverse environment changes for small companies cited by the white paper included increased competitiveness of products manufactured by Southeast Asian countries and newly emerging Asian economies. The trend has prompted many small companies in Japan to move production facilities overseas, the paper said. It said the economic doldrums in Japan are bringing about drastic industrial restructuring for small companies by forcing big changes in their relations with major corporations. Under the cloud of recession, the white paper said major automakers, for example, have been forced to extend the duration of model changeover cycles, simplify product lineups, unify component use for different models and shift to overseas operations, all eroding businesses previously assigned to subcontractors. "The situation is especially severer for third, fourth and fifth subcontractors of major corporations than those directly working with them," the white paper said. In order for these subcontractors to tide themselves over in the present economic climate, the white paper proposed they diversify client companies and develop their own brand products. There are chances for new business emerging for small firms, the paper said. It cited housing-related sectors, information-telecommunications fields, environments and services needs stemming from the aging society, the paper said.
