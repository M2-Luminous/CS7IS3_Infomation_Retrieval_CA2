Members of the group talked to republic of Srpska president Radovan Karadzic and assembly president Momcilo Krajisnik. Following the meeting the participants briefly talked with reporters, without disclosing any details. "We talked with Mr. Karadzic and his team and now we are first going to Sarajevo and then to our capitals to report on the results of the talks," said French diplomat Jacques-Alain de Sedouy, the representative of the European Union in the contact group. Asked about the specific results of today's meeting, de Sedouy replied that the group's members would submit a report about this to their governments. Republic of Srpska assembly president Momcilo Krajisnik said that the day is still far away when it will be possible to express optimism, but he stressed that today's talks were "very useful." "We exchanged opinions and proposals, and these issues certainly deserve a thorough debate. The leadership of the republic of Srpska will have detailed consultations about all issues. We still believe that the talks is a way to find a solution to the crisis in former Bosnia-Herzegovina," Krajisnik said. The contact group, which is trying to revive the peace process for former Bosnia-Herzegovina in Pale, consists of U.S. envoy Charles Redman, Russian envoy Aleksey Nikiforov, European Union representative de Sedouy, UN representative Paul Saso, Germany's Michael Steiner, and Great Britain's David Manning.
