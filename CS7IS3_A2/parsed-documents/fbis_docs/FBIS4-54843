General Mile Novakovic warned on Wednesday that patrols and reconnaissance groups of the Croatian Army in the area of Northern Dalmatia ("Sector South") occasionally entered the buffer zone and so violated an agreement between the R.S.K. and Croatia on the cessation of hostilities and on the disengagement of forces. General Novakovic, president of the R.S.K. Committee for the Implementation of the Agreement, informed the head of the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) observer team, General Bastijans, about this during their talks in Knin, the political center of the R.S.K. The talks were initiated by General Bastijans, General Novakovic told TANJUG. Novakovic added that General Bastijans was warned about the Croatian Army transports in the zones subject to transport control, and about the presence of Croatian heavy weapons in the areas covered by the agreement. The agreement, which took effect on April 4, provides for the two warring sides to withdraw their infantry one kilometer from the disengagement line and for UNPROFOR members to enter the buffer zone. It also provides for the R.S.K. and Croatia to pull out their heavy weaponry (mortars) 10 km and artillery and tanks 20 km from the front line. According to General Novakovic, it was specified during the talks that U.N. military observers were the only ones in charge of control of the implementation of the agreement on the Croatian side. Novakovic said they agreed during the talks that U.N. military observers were obliged to uncover possible preparations of the Croatian side for any military actions. The ceasefire agreement envisages such an obligation, which was not in the UNPROFOR mandate before this agreement. The military observers pointed out they did not want to be remembered by failing to accomplish their mission, said General Novakovic. The R.S.K. was formed in 1991 in the territory of Croatia populated by the Serbs in response to Croatia's secession from the former Yugoslavia and its attempt to reduce the status of Serb people to that of a national minority. The R.S.K. was proclaimed a U.N. Protected Area (UNPA) in March 1992.
