[Jovanovic] Good day. [Colovic] The news that there is no need for a military intervention by NATO in Sarajevo has been received and met with great relief, both in the country and in the world. In your opinion, who and what should be given credit for such a positive denouement? [Jovanovic] One should, above all, give credit to the consistent and courageous peace-loving policy that the Serbs in Bosnia and we in Yugoslavia have persistently been conducting in order to overcome and solve the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This peace-loving policy could not but meet with a reaction among those people who are also interested in a peaceful solution: First, Russia, but also other countries -- Greece and others -- who all had uneasy feelings about the possibility that NATO's reckless policy in this crisis could upset the balance and all the conditions for creating regional stability. This is why the agreement on a cease- fire has been accompanied by the agreement on the demilitarization of Sarajevo, which had been reached before issuing this hapless ultimatum that really appeared to be a shot in the dark. It was simply, as Mr. Karadzic put it, like walking through an open door [as heard]. This leads us to conclude that NATO also had other goals that it hoped to achieve with this ultimatum rather than influencing the solving of the crisis. It also had internal needs to reaffirm itself under the conditions of having lost its enemy and through aggravating the crisis in Bosnia, to strengthen its internal ranks, which were seriously threatened by the lack of outside danger. Therefore, the fact that peace was again maintained due to the presence of mind and principled stand of the Bosnian Serbs and us, as well as other peace-loving forces in the international community, is now a common good that.... [Colovic, interrupting] should be preserved. [Jovanovic] That should be preserved and strengthened so that strikes against the peace process will not be able to be (?repeated), such as the most recent one that could have permanently halted the peace process if one had failed to take care of it. [Colovic] Mr. Jovanovic, what will it depend on that this positive moment could be taken advantage of for new and even more decisive steps toward peace, not only in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina but also in the broader territories of the former Yugoslavia? [Jovanovic] This reasonableness, responsibility, and experience in approaching a tense and critical situation should certainly be preserved and increased. However, one should immediately be warned that dangers to the present peace still exist. They may, above all, come from the Muslim side, which is inclined to carry out all sorts of diversions -- both staged and not -- against peace. One should also be wary of the leading Western factors that are continuing, and even intensifying, the unbalanced approach to solving the Bosnian crisis. These are two negative aspects that are still present, despite the regressing of the present crisis, and that could greatly damage the peace process if they acted freely. Moreover, it is very important that this peace process be continued and that this positive example of Sarajevo be used to reduce tension and demilitarization in other regions in which battles are still being waged or which could be dangerous for the peace process. When all this is accomplished, then this just and permanent peace that has long been talked about would really be at an arm's length. Let me warn you, however, that the advocators of ultimatums, of a forced and unjust solution, are still thinking about imposing this solution by using political and other forces. [Colovic] Yes. Mr. Jovanovic, while you are on this topic, what else is equally important to strengthen this positive trend? I am mainly referring to what you have just mentioned -- that there are still people who would like to throw a monkey wrench into the wheels of this peace process, which has obviously been strengthened. [Jovanovic] The forces that are in favor of this process, of reaching a balanced and just political solution to the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina, should become even more active and should be the very side to impose the tone for further negotiations. It should not be those forces who want to use the peace process to sabotage it and persuade the world that the war option is the only one for solving the crisis. On the other hand, it is necessary to intensify our contacts with old and new neighbors who are also increasingly more interested in reaching this just and lasting peace. In this sense, we have permanent contacts with all our (?permanent) earlier neighbors, except for Albania, although we are open for contacts with this country as well. An envoy is visiting Turkey today and will hold political consultations with the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. We also hope to have more dynamic contacts with other neighboring countries [as heard]. Finally, in this context are also efforts to normalize our relations with Croatia in a way that would equally respect the legitimate rights and interest of the Serbian people in Krajina. [Colovic] Mr. Jovanovic, I thank you very much on behalf of the listeners of the "An Argument More" program. [Jovanovic] Not at all.
