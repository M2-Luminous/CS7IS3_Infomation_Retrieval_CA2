Stressing that the level of domestic banks' internationalization is far lower than that of foreign banks, the central bank said Korean banks face disadvantages in making inroads into international financial markets due to their low credit standing which the BOK said stems from their smaller sizes and bloated nonperforming assets. To get recognized as credible banks in international financial community, banks have to seek credit assessments from international credit rating companies like Standard & Poor's or Moody's, but there are only three Korean banks including Korea First Bank, Hanil and Sinhan which have received credit ratings from them. The BOK said one of the main reasons behind domestic banks' low credit standing in the international banking community is their smaller sizes. For domestic banks to expand into overseas financial markets and raise funds cheaply abroad, they should expand their organizations which can be achieved through mergers and acquisitions. In order to encourage M&As between banks, the central bank said the government should, among other things, guarantee various financial incentives to those which try to press ahead with M&As. It also called for the revision of related laws hampering M&As by financial institutions. It said that although international banking business is becoming more and more important in line with the trend to financial market liberalization and opening worldwide, Korean banks are lax in strengthening their muscle in the area. To stimulate domestic banks' internationalization, it said management at banks should establish bolder longterm strategies such as expanding investment in hardware and software in international banking divisions. "What banks should do first is to secure professionals who have skills and experience in international banking like foreign exchange, derivatives and financing for foreign enterprises," BOK's senior official Pak Chae-chun said. He said the absence of international banking strategy at most banks is another element hampering their modernization. "To push for internationalization which is very costly, they need responsible and autonomous management which can establish long-term projects and press hard ahead with them. The central bank called on banks to expand the number of their overseas branches and to actively develop foreign clients rather than Korean clients operating there. The Korean commercial banks' branches and subsidiaries operating overseas number only 127, far fewer than the 443 of 11 major Japanese banks. Furthermore, it also urged that overseas branches be localized in such a way as to hire more foreigners as top managers. Korean banks have employed few foreigners in their overseas networks, which the BOK said blocks them from developing foreign clients. According to the central bank, the ratio of foreign managers to Korean managers at Korean banks' overseas branches is only 33.6 percent. On the other hand, the corresponding ratio of foreign banks operating here is 87.7 percent. Korean commercial banks face limits in efficiently enhancing their international banking operations because they lack incentive systems in their personnel management. The central bank suggests that they pay higher wages to professional officials who deal with international banking than the other regular employees. It also recommended the government ease all restrictions preventing domestic banks from expanding into international banking. It urged gradual relaxation or elimination of cumbersome foreign exchange regulations. In particular, in order to help banks strengthen their ability to finance foreign enterprises, it said they should be allowed to extend long-term loans with maturities of more than 10 years to foreign enterprises. Domestic banks have faced many restrictions in foreign exchange transactions and developing derivative products due to heavy-handed regulations on daily foreign exchange fluctuation bands, foreign exchange holding and selling amounts. Korean banks lag far behind foreign banks in terms of financial futures transactions which have become more important instruments to hedge against growing risks. The outstanding amount of financial futures transactions of all domestic commercial banks is far smaller than at one American bank. That of Korean commercial banks amounted to only 3.4 billion dollars at the end of last year, compared to 976.4 billion dollars at Citibank of the U.S., it said. And the outstanding amount of Korean banks' derivative products was 5.9 billion dollars, compared to 977.9 billion dollars for Citibank.
