This is a premeditated fascist offensive to lacerate with the bayonet Hanchongnyon and students that are taking the lead in the movement for independence, democracy and reunification. NODONG SINMUN says this in a commentary today. Noting that Hanchongnyon resolved to build itself up more solidly and invigorate the movement for independence, democracy and reunification at the second-term inauguration of Hanchongnyon, the paper says: This deserves a praise by nation, not suppression. The analyst continues: The Kim Yong-sam group's repressive offensive against Hanchongnyon is part of its persistent moves to destroy Hanchongnyon. The Kim Yong-sam clique of traitors are scheming to block the action of the pro-reunification democratic forces and ensure the security of their power by getting rid of Hanchongnyon, the vanguard of the movement for independence against the United States, for democracy against fascism and for national reunification. Their repressive offensive against Hanchongnyon will add to their crimes. The Kim Yong-sam group must promptly stop the fascist suppression of Hanchongnyon and students and step down from power.
