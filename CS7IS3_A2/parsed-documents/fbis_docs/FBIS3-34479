The Israeli forces retaliated with intensive artillery bombardment of several villages in Iqlim al-Tuffah. The clashes later developed into artillery duels between Tallat Sujud and the resistance positions in Iqlim al-Tuffah in which 155-mm and 120-mm artillery was used. Israeli aircraft flew intensive sorties over the central and western sectors and over Tyre, breaking the sound barrier more than once. According to our correspondent in al-Biqa', a South Lebanese Army [SLA] foot patrol of 12, backed by a tank, crossed the contact line in the Zhaghlah-Hasbayya sector at 1000 today, advanced 2 km north of the security zone toward Mimis valley, and stopped 1 km from the Lebanese Army positions.
