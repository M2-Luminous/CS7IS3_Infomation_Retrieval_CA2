The discussion of the prepared drafts of the program document is an important moment in the life of the party, and it must demonstrate the irreversibility of the processes of renewal within the BSP. The debate in the runup to the congress is meant to confirm the ideological orientation mapped out by the "Manifesto on Democratic Socialism" and the "Platform for Further Renewal of the BSP" and to substantiate, supplement, and intensify the main characteristics of this orientation -- that of a party of democratic socialism, forming part of the Bulgarian and world Left that is undergoing renewal. The active and intense debate on the submitted draft programs should provide the answer to some of the key questions in the ideological evolution of the BSP, such as: -- the nature of the contemporary world and Bulgarian society, the changes that are ensuing in them, and their prospects as we approach the 21st century; -- the left alternative as a path for rescuing the country from the socioeconomic crisis in the course of the transition to a democratic, social state based on the rule of law; -- the BSP's ideological, social, and political identity; -- the changes needed in the BSP's organization and statutes; and -- the integration of the Bulgarian Socialists in the European and world Left. The intensive, in-depth ideological debate will contribute to understanding and assimilating the new views contained in the various program documents and help to bring them to the notice of every Socialist and BSP sympathizer. The municipal BSP councils should create the necessary conditions for ensuring that the forthcoming discussion is methodical and well organized, that the views expressed are summarized and disseminated in popular form, and that these views are presented in a timely fashion to the BSP Supreme Council. What is needed is not that each BSP organization should pass a formal vote of approval, but that each organization and every Socialist should give their own standpoints on the main issues of the ideological debate and the ways they are treated in the individual draft program documents. Such a standpoint can only be formed by a discussion in depth that involves all the party organs, the main and municipal party organizations, and every Socialist. The discussion should be an active and critical one, while observing the democratic principles established over the past four years. The BSP Supreme Council is sure that the discussion of the program will proceed in an atmosphere of mutual tolerance and forbearance, which will help to develop and enhance internal party relations. The discussion and adoption of a new socialist program should create conditions for rallying the party and strengthening its organizational and political unity. In the course of the discussion new ideas should be generated to enhance a future BSP program document. We call upon all the teams of authors to present their own draft documents before the accountability-election campaign enters its final phase, that is, before the municipal organizations hold their conferences. As the campaign proceeds, their participation through the submission of their drafts will enhance the debate and improve the resolutions of the meetings and conferences, promote a meaningful elucidation of the problems prior to the 41st congress, and considerably facilitate the work of the congress itself. We hope that we will succeed in mobilizing the BSP's political and scientific potential in the time remaining before the upcoming congress. The discussion of the program document is a good occasion to motivate the organizations, stimulate the ideological trends, and encourage the clubs of socialist intellectuals to involve themselves in a public dialogue encompassing the entire spectrum of left-wing intellectual thinking. The success of the debate on the program is unthinkable unless a permanent and authoritative speaker's platform is made available. It is essential to ensure greater commitment of the party publications to this goal, especially DUMA and NOVO VREME, so that they reflect in suitable form the views, remarks, and proposals of the participants in the debate. We should not limit the debate to the party organizations. The discussion of the ideological problems are a good opportunity to open up the Bulgarian Socialists to Bulgarian society, the European Left, and the world at large. We should seek a broad public debate on the way out of the crisis and the problems of the transition to a democratic, social state based on the rule of law, a debate that will establish the image of the BSP as a fundamental constructive factor in Bulgaria's political life. Such a debate will enable the 41st BSP Congress to make a comprehensive, in-depth assessment of the results of the ideological discussion within the BSP and to impart a new impetus to the party's efforts to confirm its program, the result of which is of immense importance not only for the Socialists themselves, but also for the Bulgarian Left and the whole of Bulgarian society.
