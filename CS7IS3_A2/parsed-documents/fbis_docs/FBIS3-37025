Kravchuk said he was convinced that Ukraine and Russia would also share common views on issues relating to peace and security in the future. While the Russian stance categorically objects, however, to the possibility of bombing, Kravchuk noted: "This step should be taken if there are no other ways to stop the insanity, but this must be settled by the world community--through the United Nations or the CSCE--rather than by one state". On 11 February, Ukrainian Foreign Affairs Minister Anatoliy Zlenko telephoned the head of the Russia Foreign Ministry regarding the initiative. They discussed the issue of Russian-Ukrainian relations and the development of the international situation. They examined the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, in particular, in the light of the latest NATO Council's decisions. Both sides expressed the opinion that the settlement of the situation should take place through stepping up political efforts-- primarily within the framework of the UN Security Council--rather than through escalating combat actions.
