In particular, he officially opened the French Institute in St. Petersburg, "the symbol," the minister reaffirmed, "of the new-found fraternity between Russia and France." "The aim of my visit was to assert the French Government's desire to give full strength to the partnership between our two countries. This objective has been achieved," he said after his talks with Andrey Kozyrev, his counterpart, President Boris Yeltsin, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, and Defense Minister Pavel Grachev. The Russian Government demonstrated a degree of caution with regard to the French stances, both on the partnership treaty with the European Union and on security in Europe. But Alain Juppe was able to clear up the misunderstandings. European Partnership [subhead] "We are similar. You like frankness and so do I," a jovial Boris Yeltsin, who was in "excellent shape," as the French foreign minister was able to observe, told him from the outset. Andrey Kozyrev confirmed his presence at the start of the Paris meeting [conference on stability in Europe] on 26 and 27 May and Russia's pledge to follow the agreements resulting from it. In particular, the Russians have given their agreement to the principle of a roundtable on Baltic problems. General Grachev also presented the French minister with the broad outlines of the proposal he is due to unveil to NATO on Tuesday. "France endorses the idea of a Partnership for Peace. In view of its history and its size, the fact that Russia should hold a special place in it goes without saying," Alain Juppe said. In his view, Russia should also join the Council of Europe. And participate in the work of the G-7, "which one day will become a G-8." Discussing the various crises within the CIS with the Russian defense minister, and especially the conflict between Ukraine and Crimea, Alain Juppe stressed that "France understands the special role which Russia can play in these regions," but that it can only envisage "peacekeeping operations under the auspices of an international organization." In the sphere of the partnership agreement with the European Union, the obstacle of the export of Russian nuclear fuel, which made Paris fear unfair competition on this market, is about to disappear. "I hope that between now and the meeting of the European Union ministers in Corfu, we will have found solutions which make it possible to sign this agreement," Alain Juppe said.
