He underlined the importance of the Partnership for Peace plan as an important element for a stable Central and Eastern Europe. It is necessary for Ukraine and Russia to develop democratically and to foster good relations both with the United States and NATO, Goncz stated. Goncz said that the Visegrad Four countries had expressed the same views on important issues related to the Partnership for Peace. Hungarian Premier Peter Boross stressed the economic aspects of the project and mentioned the planned conference in the United States which was to enhance Western investment in Central and Eastern Europe. He emphasized the importance of concrete steps in military cooperation. Hungarian Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky said that the question of the military exercises in Hungary would be specified after NATO General Staff sends its experts to the Visegrad Four countries. He added that joint military maneuvers in Hungary were first to be approved by parliament. Jeszenszky said that an agreement with Slovakia was not possible until the problems of ethnic Hungarians in Slovakia were resolved. He stressed that a large number of equally important problems of Slovak-Hungarian relations were still pending.
