Yi Chang-chun, assistant minister for policy planning, suggested that the two countries sign a friendship pact to lay a firmer groundwork for bilateral relations, officials said. Yi is in Beijing for the second South Korea-China Policy Planning Consultations. Seoul had cautiously suggested a "Beijing declaration" to showcase their budding relations when the two sides normalized ties in August 1992, but the idea died out. Yi and his Chinese counterpart Pei Yuan Ying discussed joint participation in regional security talks including the Asean Regional Forum (ARF), the officials said.
