FR940926-1-00027 FR940926-1-00010 Pollock roe produced from the roe season harvests represents a substantial portion of the gross wholesale value of the pollock fishery and roe maturity is one of the most important factors in determining product value. Good quality mature roe receives the highest price, followed by immature and over-mature roe. Therefore, in order to maximize the value of roe production, industry prefers to harvest as much roe as possible during the period of peak roe maturity and to minimize the harvest of immature and over-mature roe. Although the timing of peak roe maturity varies depending on the age of the fish, the location where fish spawn, and ocean conditions, industry sources report that the period of peak roe maturity usually occurs between February 10 and February 20. The pollock roe season length has shortened to the degree that some offshore processors participating in the open access fishery believe that the fishery closes before or during the timing of peak roe maturity. Consequently, the value of the pollock harvest is significantly lower than it could be if the season were delayed. This trend likely will continue under the open access management system. Concerns about a shortened roe season do not appear to be shared by participants in the inshore component pollock fishery or some of the offshore processors who also participate in the CDQ pollock fisheries, which occur after the close of the open access fishery. Inshore processors report that peak roe maturity generally occurs during the first 2 weeks of February and, because the 1994 roe season extended into early March, the fishery fully encompassed the period of peak roe maturity. Delay of the inshore component roe season would likely increase the harvest of pollock with lower valued, over-mature roe. At the request of offshore component processors, the Council first considered alternatives for delaying the pollock roe season at its June 1993 meeting. Lack of industry consensus on a preferred alternative prevented the Council from taking action. The continued shortening of the roe season in 1994 prompted the Council again to consider alternative season opening dates for the pollock roe season. At its June 1994 meeting, the Council considered the testimony and recommendations of its Advisory Panel, Scientific and Statistical Committee, fishing industry representatives, and the public on alternative dates for the start of the pollock roe season. For the reasons given below, the Council determined that delaying the offshore component roe season opening date to January 26 would provide the most benefit to the fishing industry and recommended that NMFS initiate rulemaking to delay the opening of the offshore component pollock roe season until this date. To discourage a shift in fishing effort into other fisheries by pollock vessels prior to January 26, the Council also recommended that vessels used to fish for BSAI or GOA groundfish or BSAI king or Tanner crab prior to January 26 be prohibited from participating in the offshore component pollock fishery until February 5. This prohibition would not apply to vessels participating in a CDQ fishery. Section 14.3 of the FMP requires that the Council consider the following criteria when recommending a regulatory amendment to change season opening dates: Biological, bycatch, exvessel and wholesale prices, product quality, safety, cost, other fisheries, coordinated season timing, enforcement and management costs, and allocation effects. The EA/RIR/IRFA prepared for this action addresses anticipated effects of the proposed delay relative to these criteria. The following discussion summarizes these effects relative to how the Council's objectives for an offshore component roe season delay are met under the proposed action. Biological or bycatch effects. A delay of the roe season opening date for the offshore component pollock fishery to January 26 would affect neither the amount of pollock harvested during the roe season nor the overall duration of the fishery. Although the proposed action would result in a 6-day shift of trawl effort, significant spatial differences in trawl effort distribution would not be expected because the location of spawning stocks of pollock likely would not vary significantly during this 6-day period. Similarly, a 6-day delay in the opening date of the pollock roe season would not affect the size of pollock taken in this fishery. When female pollock are entering a spawning condition, their energy is going into the production of eggs and maintenance, and not into growth. In the BSAI, Pacific halibut, red king crab, C. bairdi Tanner crab, and herring are prohibited species for which bycatch limits are established and apportioned each year to the pollock and other groundfish trawl fisheries based on Council recommendations. Pacific salmon also are prohibited species that may not be retained in the groundfish fisheries; however, no salmon bycatch limits currently are established. Few data exist to suggest that the proposed change in the pollock roe season would have any positive or negative impact on the prohibited species bycatch amounts. Observer data indicate that an opening date later into the season could help to reduce chinook salmon bycatch in the trawl fisheries. However, the effects of a change of less than 1 week for a start date are difficult to measure. The proposed action would not have an adverse effect on marine mammals or seabirds, because it would not increase pollock harvests or significantly change the temporal or spatial distribution of this harvest. Product quality and value. The proposed delay of the offshore component pollock roe season is intended to increase the value of the pollock harvested during the roe season by delaying the offshore component fishery so the season fully encompasses the period of optimum roe maturity. This action likely would affect the roe product quality and value experienced in the CDQ pollock fisheries.
