FR941117-0-00025 FR941117-0-00006 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 82 [FRL&hyph;5106&hyph;3] Protection of Stratospheric Ozone: Leak Repair; Partial Stay AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Partial stay of final rule. SUMMARY: This action promulgates a temporary stay of certain federal rules requiring the repair and/or retrofit of appliances containing ozone-depleting substances contained in the regulations implementing the National Recycling Program. EPA has already issued an action staying the effectiveness of 40 CFR 82.156(i), as they apply to industrial process refrigeration equipment only, including the applicable compliance dates, for a period of three months, pursuant to Clean Air Act section 307(d)(7)(B), 42 U.S.C. 7607(d)(7)(B), which provides the Administrator authority to stay the effectiveness of a rule during reconsideration (August 17, 1994, 59 FR 42169). This action promulgates a partial stay of the effectiveness of 40 CFR 82.156(i), and applicable compliance dates, beyond the three months pursuant to Clean Air Act sections 301(a)(1), 42 U.S.C. 7601(a)(1), but only to the extent necessary to complete reconsideration (including any appropriate regulatory action) of the rules in question. DATES: Effective December 16, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments and materials supporting this rulemaking are contained in Public Docket No. A&hyph;92&hyph;01, Waterside Mall (Ground Floor) Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460 in room M&hyph;1500. Dockets may be inspected from 8 a.m. until 5:30 p.m., Monday through Friday. A reasonable fee may be charged for copying docket materials.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The contents of this preamble are listed in the following outline: I. Background II. Rules To Be Stayed and Reconsidered III. Issuance of a Three-Month Stay IV. Proposed Additional Temporary Stay V. Comments Received VI. Response to Comments VII. Effective Date I. Background On July 13, 1993, the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA) sent to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) a petition for reconsideration of the Refrigerant Recycling Rule, promulgated May 14, 1993, (58 FR 28660), particularly the leak repair provisions under 40 CFR 82.156(i) as they concern industrial process refrigeration equipment. 1 On that same date, CMA filed a petition in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit seeking review of this Refrigerant Recycling Rule ( Chemical Manufacturers Association v. Browner, et al., D.C. Cir. Docket 93&hyph;1444.) As part of a settlement agreement signed by EPA and the CMA on May 20, 1994, EPA agreed to propose changes to the appropriate sections of the rules. A notice of the settlement agreement was published on June 14, 1994 (59 FR 30584), pursuant to the Clean Air Act section 113(g). Although several comments regarding the settlement agreement were submitted during the notice and comment period, none of them opposed the settlement or suggested that EPA not revise the regulation. 1 Industrial process refrigeration is defined in ยง82.152(g) of the final regulations (58 FR 28713). The definition states that ``industrial process refrigeration means, for the purposes of ยง82.156(i), complex customized appliances used in the chemical, pharmaceutical, petrochemical and manufacturing industries. This sector also includes industrial ice machines and ice rinks.'' The settlement agreement set a tight deadline for the completion of rulemaking, requiring EPA to propose changes by December 1, 1994, 2 and to take final action by June 1, 1995. EPA has issued a temporary stay of ยง82.156(i) as it relates to industrial process equipment, and initiated reconsideration of this provision. 2 The settlement agreement originally specified that a proposal be signed by September 1, 1994. Through a subsequent modification to the settlement agreement this date was revised. II. Rules To Be Stayed and Reconsidered Final regulations published on May 14, 1993 (58 FR 28660), establish a recycling program for ozone-depleting refrigerants recovered during the servicing and disposal of air-conditioning and refrigeration equipment. Together with the prohibition on venting during the service, repair, and disposal of class I and class II substances (see the listing notice January 22, 1991; 56 FR 2420) that took effect on July 1, 1992, these regulations should substantially reduce the emissions of ozone-depleting refrigerants. The petition filed by the CMA seeks for reconsideration of leak repair provisions under ยง82.156(i) as they relate to industrial process refrigeration equipment. In particular, the petitioners raised concerns regarding the ability to repair or retrofit some industrial process refrigeration equipment within the timeframes established by the final rule. CMA's concerns involve the need to shut down equipment and/or obtain custom built parts within the appropriate timeframes. CMA also raised the possibility of delays caused by other regulatory requirements related to changes at plants.
