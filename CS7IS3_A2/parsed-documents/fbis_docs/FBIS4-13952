In a statement to the INA, Mr. Hassun slammed the continuation of the blockade imposed on the people of Iraq which had direct harmful effects on the environment and the public health. He dealt with suffering of the municipal units under shadow of the blockade, saying these units were facing acute dearth in performance after the aggression owing to poor spare parts and other necessary equipment and the lack of cadres. He also said that because of the harsh circumstances of the blockade and its direct and negative impact, the Baghad Municipality had decided to stop implementing a number of cultural, touristic and service projects. Mr. Hassun appealed to all peace-loving people and forces around the world to understand Iraq's position and cooperate with the aim of breaking the unjustifiable blockade.
