"We in the Caribbean and in the ACP have to put our heads together to fashion out a package for the losers as a result of the new GATT arrangement," he told Parliament. He said that only four countries in Latin America stand to benefit from the new trading agreement. Brizan's comments came on the heels of a statement by the president of the United Nations General Assembly, Guyana's Samuel Insanally, who paid his first official visit to Grenada, urging the region to make its presence felt in international affairs. He told government and private sector officials in St. George's the region had the opportunity and the scope for shaping international events. Brizan spoke during debate on Grenada's 278 million dollar (one EC dollar - 37 US cents) budget, which allocated 30 million Eastern Caribbean dollars to agriculture. Brizan said the region stands to lose under international trading agreements such as GATT. "There will be winners and losers and countries in the Caribbean will be, unfortunately, losers in the GATT," Brizan said. He told Parliament: "So far, neither in theory nor in international policy has anything been done to address the case of losers as a result of this GATT agreement." He criticised the attitude of developed countries and international lending agencies toward smaller states, particularly those dependent on agricultural production for survival. The Grenadian agriculture minister said the region would be unable to provide for its people if its special needs and concerns were not taken into account.
