Idea of Diverting Siberian Rivers Seems To Have Captured Masses' Imagination Again''] [Text] The intensive contacts among the presidents of the former Central Asian republics that have characterized the start of the year, for all the seeming diversity of the problems raised and proposed for solutions, have one common thread. Every meeting has discussed the question of saving the Aral Sea. It is a truly important question and one that requires a prompt and effective solution. The ecological disaster zone that the Aral region has been declared is inhabited by people, and life is hard for them. But the remarkable thing is this: All the presidents want to solve the water supply problem not using their own funds and resources, but by diverting northern rivers to Central Asia. No one is talking about this openly, but just such an option is continually being implied. But why now, in winter? The time is not far off when it will be necessary to begin irrigating crops, a sizable place among which is held by cotton, and the meager water resources will start being divided. This year, judging from specialists' forecasts, will be just as dry as previous ones. And water has always been valued especially highly in the East: It has caused conflicts and strife, and things have often reached the point of using force. The Tajiks have fought with the Uzbeks and the Uzbeks have fought with the Kirgiz; this is true of not only ancient times, but also the very recent past. Today the new states of Central Asia are to some extent being saved by the continuing war in Afghanistan. It's terrible to say, but true. If the war were to stop and the Afghan tribes to begin raising crops, a very difficult situation would ensue. Four countries would immediately find themselves on dry rations. This is what accounts for the flurry of activity. One would think that the insane idea of diverting part of the flow of Siberian rivers to Central Asia had been buried once and for all. But this is not the case, and increasingly persistent efforts are being in Uzbekistan to sway public opinion in favor of a positive resolution of the erstwhile ``project of the century.'' It is being actively suggested to the people who are suffering from a water shortage and poor water quality that only the postponed diversion of Siberian rivers can save them from disease and utter extinction. But the devil is not so black as he is painted; in other words, what is the actual water situation in the republic? In the rayons of the Aral region, it is truly catastrophic. The waters of the Syrdarya essentially stopped reaching the area in 1976. Only up to three cubic kilometers of water a year flow into the Aral from the Amudarya. Yet both rivers initially carry almost 20 times that much. Is all the water being diverted by continually developing agriculture? Hardly, although this is true in the sense that farmers take as much as they can, not as much as they need. Irrigation norms in Uzbekistan are overstated by a factor of 1.6. A similar picture obtains in Kazakhstan and Turkmenia. And let us ponder the following fact: In just over the past 10 years, 84 billion cubic meters of water have been used for irrigation in the Aral basin, while discharges of water after irrigation into undrained valleys and losses in the much-touted Karakum canal exceed 100 billion cubic meters. An entire system of large lakes with no commercial purpose has formed in Central Asia and Kazakhstan. Waters that once could have fed the Aral Sea have now flooded vast tracts of land and farmland. On the one hand, we have a dying sea, and on the other hand, we have lifeless lakes that stretch for hundreds of kilometers. When the decision to drop the idea of diverting part of the flow of Siberian rivers somewhat sobered the most adventuristic heads, a great many alternative solutions to the problem were proposed in Uzbekistan--effective and serious proposals. Specifically, one plan called for diverting drainage waters that are currently being discharged into undrained steppe depressions (Aydarkul and Sarykamysh) along a natural channel into the Aral. Another proposal called for dividing the Aral's water up with earthen dams, thereby making it possible to manage its cycles. Yet another called for carrying out large-scale phyto-amelioration and forest-conservation projects, treating the drying sea bottom with cementitious material, building a right-bank discharge drain along the entire length of the Amudarya, and so forth. All these projects would require enormous capital investments, which Uzbekistan simply cannot come up with on its own. But the problem is not so much the money (it could ultimately be scraped together with Russia's help), as people. There is no one to implement the project in a republic burdened with surplus labor resources. A paradox? It's really more of a logically consistent pattern. The nearly 3 million people who currently live in the lower reaches of the Amudarya from Khorezm to the Aral do not want and will not build either a discharge drain or dams, despite the fact that they are the ones who are currently forced to use water contaminated with pesticides and other chemicals. Readers, believe this author, for he is hardly indifferent to the fate of millions of fellow citizens who live in the ecological disaster zone. But there is only one possible solution to this problem--to conserve the water already available in the republic. Writer P. Shermukhammedov, chairman of the committee for saving the Aral, believes that without large financial and other outlays, just by taking water conservation steps, the sea could receive 30 to 35 cubic kilometers of water annually, and that would stabilize the Aral at the existing mark. There is one other aspect of the problem that, if unremarked, makes it hard to explain just why the republic leadership is inclined to insist on the option rejected eight years ago. People in Uzbekistan try not to talk about it, for it is fraught with certain extremely negative consequences. The birth rate in Uzbekistan currently exceeds the average world level. Scientists call it a demographic explosion that could very likely become a social explosion. This is no joke, and the prognosis is not all that unrealistic. Suffice it to recall the events in the overpopulated Fergana Valley. Uzbekistan has more than 22 million people today, but as Karimov has said, that figure will double in 10 years. Meanwhile, Eastern-style democracy has revived previously suppressed Islamic religious forces that oppose any attempts to control the birth rate, something they say is at odds with true Muslim traditions. And one final point. Methods of saving the Aral are still in the theoretical stage. Despite the practical recommendations devised by a number of specialized institutes, their implementation remains highly problematical. I will venture to express what is perhaps a trenchant but, in my opinion, the sole possible explanation for what is going on. Impeding the implementation of the existing projects is a kind of Eastern stratagem whose aim is to exacerbate the situation in the ecological disaster zone so much as to make a diversion of Siberian rivers the only likely solution to the crisis. I hope I am wrong, but I fear that this is indeed the case.
