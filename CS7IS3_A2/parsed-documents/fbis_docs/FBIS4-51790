An official at the Taeyang Fishery Co. here, to which part of the captured fishermen belong, said Tuesday the Fishery Administration Office in Luxi, Jiangxi Province of China was demanding money in return for the release of the fishermen without reporting the case to higher authorities. Eleven of the 22 fishermen being unlawfully held in Luxi were the crew members of Taehung-ho No. 27 caught by a Chinese patrol boat in the high seas 175 miles southwest of Cheju-do last April 29. The 11 others were the crews of Songkwang-ho No. 2 also seized by a Chinese patrol vessel the same day roughly in the same area. The official said a message from Taehung-ho No. 28, a sister boat of the seized Taehung-ho No. 27, indicated that the Luxi Fishery Office forced the hostages to tell Taehung-ho No. 28 in telex to go back to Korea and bring 50,000 dollars. Chinese officials threaten that unless the money is given to them, they would handle the captured fishermen according to law, the official said. Luxi fishery office people even intimidate the hostages into surrendering all the money they have, he said. Taehung-ho No. 28 which was near the scene of the seizure, followed the Chinese patrol boat carrying the captured fishermen all the way to just outside the territorial waters of China and has been staying there. The Luxi fishery office was making a similar demand toward the 11 fishermen of Songkwang-ho No. 2, a source said.
