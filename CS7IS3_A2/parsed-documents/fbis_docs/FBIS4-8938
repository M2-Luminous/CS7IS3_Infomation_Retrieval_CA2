FBIS4-8938 "dreeu076_d_94007" FBIS-EEU-94-076 Daily Report 20 Apr 1994 SLOVAKIA Moravcik Reacts to CNN Complaint on License Moravcik Reacts to CNN Complaint on License AU2004142294 AU2004142294 BFN [Editorial Report] Bratislava SMENA in Slovak on 16 April on page 12 carries a 200-word TA SR report entitled "CNN Protests." The report states that the U.S. Cable News Network (CNN) company, which is one of the applicants for a license to broadcast on the STV (Slovak Television) 2 channel, which is to be partly privatized, "accused Slovak legislators of discriminating against foreign companies in the competition for a license to broadcast on the second Slovak Television channel." Bratislava PRAVDA in Slovak on 18 April on page 1, under the headline "Discrimination in the Law on Tenders?," carries a 200-word TA SR report on Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik's response to the CNN complaint. According to the Bratislava SMENA report, in a letter addressed to the Slovak parliament, the prime minister, and the president, CNN said that, "by setting four new conditions for license applicants, Slovakia has signaled that it is not interested in foreign capital" and charged that "the approach by the Slovak Council for Radio and Television Broadcasting discourages foreign investors and suggests that they are not welcome here." The CNN letter was referring to new requirements, under which foreign stake in the license holder's company must not exceed 45 percent and under which the license holder must reserve 50 percent of broadcasting time for European productions. The Bratislava PRAVDA report on Prime Minister Moravcik's reaction states that "the Government of the Slovak Republic is greatly interested in the observance of general customs, which are also laid down in our legal system, concerning competitions and public tenders. It is from this point of view that we will assess the whole matter surrounding the report on the CNN letter." Moravcik announces that the government will "assume an official standpoint" after it has familiarized itself with "the whole case."
