Spokesman for Aidid's Somali National Alliance (SNA) Mohamed Hassan Awale who accompanied the faction leader to Uganda said the United Nations peacekeeping force in Somalia (UNOSOM) had outlived its usefulness in the war torn-country now that famine had ended. "After the creation of an authority in (the capital) Mogadishu and our target is March, disarmament will start and if we need help we shall ask African leaders to provide a peacekeeping force," said Awale, Aidid advisor on international affairs. Aidid left the Ugandan capital Sunday after a four-day visit during which he had talks with President Yoweri Museveni. The warlord has repeatedly called for UN Operation Somalia's [UNOSOM] departure accusing the force of killing thousands of Somalis. The United States has set March 31 as the deadline for the pullout of its troops from Somalia, but the UN plans to maintain an 16,000-strong international force in the country. UNOSOM went to Somalia last year originally to keep the peace while aid workers distributed food to hundreds of thousands of starving people but the force was later locked in bloody clashes with SNA militiamen after the UN accused Aidid of ordering the killing of its soldiers and ordered his arrest. Awale said Aidid had "fruitful discussions with President Museveni on the situation in Somalia and the progress towards peace amongst the fighting factions". The meeting took place on Saturday. Aidid is going back to the Kenyan capital, Nairobi to continue peace negotiations with other Somalia factions, Awale said. He is expected to meet representatives from the Somali Salvation Democratic Front, the Somalia National Democratic Union and the Somali National Front, before returning to Mogadishu within the next couple of days, Awale said. Aidid travelled to Uganda from Nairobi on Thursday. He had been in Kenya since UN-sponsored peace negotiations in Addis Ababa collapsed.
