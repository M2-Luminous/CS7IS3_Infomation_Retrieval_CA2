Belgium has agreed to transport the equipment as long as French soldiers "ensure the safety of any surgeons sent to Rwanda," a spokesman said. Belgium also wanted to see the French security zone extended, "so our team can work in the best possible conditions." France was interested in the type of Belgian unit already used in Somalia, complete with medical supplies and personnel, which can carry out operations in any situation, he said. The location of the unit has not been established. Two field hospitals have already been set up at French base camps in nearby Zaire for Operation Turquoise, launched last Thursday, described by Paris as a humanitarian bid to stop ethnic killings in the Rwandan civil war.
