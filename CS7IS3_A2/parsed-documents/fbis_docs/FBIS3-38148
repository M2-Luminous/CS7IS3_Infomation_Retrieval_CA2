I did not consider it necessary to reply to your question whether my side accepts the principles of the package of the Confidence-Building Measures as set out in paragraphs 37, 38, 42 and 43 of your report of the 1st July 1993, document S26026, because as Your Excellency is aware during the talks held in New York from 24 May to 1 June 1993, the position of my side was that we accepted the proposal made by you i.e. the placing of the fenced area of Varosha under the United Nations administration including policing and the return of its inhabitants and the opening and functioning of the Nicosia Airport by the United Nations. We stated clearly then that should the Turkish Cypriot side accept the same deal, we would be prepared to discuss in detail the modalities for implementing the Confidence-Building Measures. For the sake, however, of avoiding any misunderstanding regarding my position now, I state emphatically, clearly and unequivocally that I accep? the principles of the package of the Confidence-Building Measures as set out in paragraphs 37, 38, 42 and 43 of your report of the 1st July 1993 (S/26026) and that I am ready to start talks on the modalities regarding their implementation as soon as the Turkish side clearly and unequivocally makes the same acceptance. His Excellency Dr. Butrus Butrus-Ghali, Secretary-General of the United Nations Organization, New York. Your Excellency will recollect that it was clearly stated by you that nothing in the deal should contain elements which would constitute or could be interpreted as constituting direct or indirect recognition or giving either side political advantage. You will also recollect, Excellency, that it was common ground that although t?e Confidence-Building Measures were necessary in order to facilitate a solution and thus should precede the solution, they would not constitute the solution itself and that negotiations should continue on the substance of the problem. Permit me now, Your Excellency, to refer to the Turkish position. Mr. Denktas raising security concerns of his side stated categorically that he could not agree to the whole fenced area of Varosha to be handed to the United Nations and that he wished to retain the part of the area north of Democratia Street. With respect to that area he stated that he intended to colonise it. On the Nicosia Airport issue his position was that parallel to the Nicosia Airport the occupied Tymbou Airport "Ercan" and the occupied ports of Famagusta and Kyrenia should operate legally. Your Excellency, pointed out that what Mr. Denktas was asking was contrary to the rule that nothing in the Confidence-Building Measures should imply recognition or give political advantage either to the one or the other side. Mr. Denktas insisted that he was not authorised by his "Parliament" to negotiate beyond those positions. He had asked for 15 days to return home for instructions. He promised that he would endeavour to persuade his side to accept the deal as proposed by Your Excellency and that at the end of the 15 days he would give an answer. During his return, speaking to his "Parliament," he rejected the deal as proposed by Your Excellency and did the same when addressing the Turkish National Assembly. Since then he purported that he could not reply because it was necessary to hold "elections." I regret to say, that he has not replied even today in a straight forward manner whether he accepts the deal as proposed by Your Excellency and in fact after wasting seven months, the position is as follows: On the question of the fenced area of Varosha he still raises security concerns which he wishes them to be taken into consideration. It is clear that he is not prepared to state that the entire fenced area of Varosha is to be handed to the United Nations alleging security concerns, and at the talks he will insist that the area north of Democratia Street must be denied to its inhabitants even if they were to return under United Nations administration. During my first meeting with Mr. Joe Clark on the 24th January, I asked whether Mr. Denktas is prepared to state that the entire fenced area of Varosha is part of the deal and Mr. Joe Clark did not think that Mr. Denktas would state so. To a further question of mine whether Mr. Denktas would raise the question at the talks regarding the area north of Democratia Street, he felt certain that he would. From what was said during my second meeting with Mr. Joe Clark, which took place on the 25 January i.e. after Mr. Clark saw Mr. Denktas for a second time, I formed the clear impression that Mr. Denktas still raises security concerns with regard to the area north of Democratia Street. As you know, Your Excellency, the reconstruction of Varosha will cost more than one billion dollars and Mr. Denktas is asking that Varosha be returned ?nder his administration should there be obstacles in the enjoyment of the benefits of the Nicosia International Airport by the Turkish Cypriots. The cost of rebuilding Varosha, which was looted by the Turkish side and was left as a ghost town for almost 20 years to go to ruin, is to be paid by the Greek Cypriots who will have to rebuild their properties. Which Greek Cypriot will spend money for the rebuilding of Varosha knowing that the administration may be handed to the Turkish side? Furthermore, Mr. Denktas in his letter to Your Excellency raises the issue of "lifting through practical measures the embargo that has been weighing so heavily on the Turkish Cypriot side" thus again he brings back the question of accepting a legitimate status for the occupied ports and airport in the north and the indirect recognition of the Turkish Cypriot break-away state. Finally, the sixth paragraph of Mr. Denktas's letter to Your Excellency may reasonably be interpreted as meaning that, even if we were to agree on the Confidence-Building Measures, we would have to leave them aside in order to consider how they fit into the comprehensive settlement of all aspects of the Cyprus problem. Your Excellency will recollect that at the end of the negotiations in New York last June, I stated clearly that I would not accept to discuss the Confidence-Building Measures unless the Turkish side accepted the deal which was proposed by you, i.e the total fenced area of Varosha and the functioning of the Nicosia International Airport, under United Nations control and that the issue of direct or indirect legalisation of the occupied ports and airport was out of question and out of the deal offered by Your Excellency. That was my position then, that is my position now. I do not propose at this stage to make any observations on the several other issues Mr. Denktas raises in his letter to Your Excellency, until I have clear answers to the following: a. Does he accept, irrespective of the so called security concerns, that the entire fenced area of Varosha will be handed to United Nations for administration and policing and that the Greek Cypriot inhabitants will return to their homes and properties? b. Does he abandon any notion that my side should recognise, either directly or indirectly through practical measures, a legal status of the occupied ports and airport in the north? C. Does he accept that any Confidence-Building Measures agreed will be implemented without waiting to see how they fit in the integrated, comprehensive and whole solution of the Cyprus problem? I would like to draw the attention of Your Excellency to the fact that seven valuable months have been lost and that instead of discussing the modalities of how to implement the Confidence-Building Measures, we are back to where the talks broke last June when Mr. Denktas did not accept the proposal made by Your Excellency and is still now not accepting it. With regard to the security concerns of Mr. Denktas, which he raises in his letter to Your Excellency both in connection with the final solution and with regard to the Confidence-Building Measures, I wish to point out that there are also serious security concerns of the Greek Cypriot Community both with regard to the final solution and with regard to the Confidence-Building Measures. Since both sides admit serious security concerns, it is obvious that we should discuss and solve our security concerns before anything else instead of finding them as an impediment in every step we make for progress. If Mr. Denktas is ready to discuss the security concerns of both sides I am ready to join issue. Though I stand firm that the deal as proposed by Your Excellency i.e. the entire fenced area of Varosha under United Nations administration and the functioning of the Nicosia International Airport under United Nations control is accepted by me and I am ready to discuss modalities for the implementation of the Confidence-Building Measures, nevertheless, in view of the non acceptance of the deal as proposed by Your Excellency by the Turkish side, and in view of the fact that seven months have already been wasted, and in order to save time, I propose that until the Turkish side makes up its mind on the issue of the Confidence-Building Measures, we revert to the discussion of the substance of the problem beginning with the security concerns of both sides, which appear to be the real obstacle and the thorn in any progress. I believe that confidence will be created and progress will be fade once the security concerns of both sides are met. Please accept, Your Excellency, the assurances of my highest consideration. (Glavkos Kliridhis) President of the Republic of Cyprus
