The president either did not want to or could not accept Fedorov's tough terms. [passage omitted] As a result, what has been expected actually happened: Fedorov resigned. The bitter struggle between the finance minister and the chairman of the Russian Central Bank ended with the latter's victory. Today Mr. Gerashchenko, enjoying bucolic delights in the company of the prime minister who has given him shelter, can settle his scores with Fedorov, who has really annoyed him, with relish. The paradox is that now Gerashchenko will have to bear the entire responsibility for the state of the monetary system. Meanwhile the current chairman of the Central Bank does not want to assume such responsibility. Selective support for the basic production sectors and the "nonmonetarist methods" of economic policy espoused by Mr. Gerashchenko are so popular in the new Cabinet today that there will be no place under the nonmonetarist sun left for the Central Bank chief. Gerashchenko is not so stupid or unprofessional not to understand the danger of this sweeping craze for similar ideas: Therefore there is no way that he can satiate the appetites of all the agro-industrial zaveryukhas [apparent pun: Zaveryukha, the last name of the non-reformist minister, sounding close to "zveryukha," meaning "(large) animal"]. Therefore the financial situation will be progressively, although perhaps not catastrophically, deteriorating while relations with his colleagues in the economic leadership will be cooling. [passage omitted] Prime Minister Chernomyrdin is more than a pragmatist; generally, he is little interested in the long-term economic consequences of his current decisions. While being much more qualified, from the apparatus point of view, than most of the "reformers," the prime minister is at the same time profoundly and hopelessly illiterate economically. This does not allow him to make unpopular decisions without outside pressure because he is incapable of understanding or believing in the inevitability of a positive outcome. Today a most serious danger is looming over the premier -- what has now become the traditional Russian "vice presidency syndrome." By virtue of his makeup and former experience, the incumbent prime minister is less than any others inclined to yield to emotions. Even so, the temptation of power has broken tougher men. Especially since Viktor Chernomyrdin has demonstrated his ability publicly to accentuate his independence from the president. [passage omitted] Statement by Boris Fedorov Boris Fedorov, who has resigned the post of finance minister, has announced the impermissibility of joining the Cabinet of Ministers or keeping in their posts "people who have caused colossal economic and political damage to the state and who are intransigent and open opponents of the reform policy." This is said in Mr. Fedorov's statement Wednesday after his meeting with Boris Yeltsin. "I cannot agree with the turn of policy that has recently been formulated by the premier and is now being implemented in practice," Boris Fedorov stressed. "The triumph of the nonviable and illiterate ideology of Gosplan [State Planning Agency] and the red economic managers in the cabinet, in the context of the market economy, inevitably dooms the country to collapse and the people to falling living standards," he stated. "There is no alternative to our policy, and we will soon be able to see this in practice. The turn away from the stabilization course means soaring inflation, the people's declining real incomes, the dollar rate surging to 10,000 rubles by the end of the year, the deprecation of savings, the beginning of a commodity shortage, increasing capital flight, and Russia's isolation from the world markets," Boris Fedorov stressed. "Moreover, there will be neither production growth, nor fresh capital inputs, nor ways to deal with the employment problem. The threat of a social explosion from theory becomes reality." Boris Fedorov appealed to the president: "An economic coup is under way in the country -- a retreat. The only hope is you! What matters is not Fedorov, who is always ready to come back and defend Russia's interests to the end. What matters is the fate of the country, which is being decided in these days and these hours. I hope that no one has any illusions that economics can be separated from politics." After his meeting with the president Boris Fedorov said in an interview with INTERFAX that "a team of red economic managers has come to power who know how to run large enterprises but do not know the meaning of macroeconomics." He thinks that the present government will be able to stay in office until fall 1994 when strong manifestations of social discontent are possible.
