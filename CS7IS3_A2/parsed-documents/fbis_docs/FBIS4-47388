L. Dobretsov, Joint Institute of Geology, Geophysics and Mineralogy, Siberian Department, Russian Academy of Sciences, Novosibirsk; UDC 551.14+536.25] [Abstract] Findings from projects undertaken under the program Global Environmental and Climatic Changes and articles in leading international and Russian journals published during 1991-1992 are reviewed and two principal groups of problems are examined: geological factors in global changes in the environment and importance of catastrophes and periodicity of geological processes. The influence of endogenous processes caused by periodic mantle plumes on global changes is expressed through periodic bursts of catastrophic volcanism both in the oceans and in the island arcs, as well as periodic changes of movement of an ensemble of lithospheric plates and relief in the ocean and on the land, which in turn results in a change in the system of currents in the hydroatmosphere and climatic changes with periods of 30-34 million years. Shorter period changes are related to cosmic factors, especially Milankovitch cycles, although an interaction between endogenous and cosmic factors is reflected at all levels. Short-term changes in currents and the entry of CO[.sub]2[/] may be stimulated by endogenous processes, and vice versa, changes in the Earth's magnetic field associated with endogenous factors may be superposed on solar activity changes. During periods of magnetic field reversal solar plasma may be ``locked'' in the Earth's magnetic field. All such theoretical concepts examined in this study require further development, particularly the theory of mantle plumes and their interaction with asthenospheric flows.
