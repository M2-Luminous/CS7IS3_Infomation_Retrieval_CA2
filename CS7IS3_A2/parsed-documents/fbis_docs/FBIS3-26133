Last year these departments achieved a total import-export volume of $2.34 billion, an increase of 16 percent over the previous year; of this amount, $1.61 billion was obtained from exports. At a provincial foreign economic relations and trade work meeting on 27 January, provincial party and government leaders Chen Bangzhu, Liu Fusheng, Wang Keying, Tang Zhixiang, and He Shaoqing fully confirmed their achievements. Earlier this year, the province was facing unprecedented difficulties in foreign economic relations and trade. The provincial foreign economic relations and trade commission pointed out the need to maximize export earnings. As a result, the province freed itself from this predicament. By the end of last year, 37 of the 41 foreign trade enterprises and companies directly under the provincial authorities had carried out the provincial task, and 36 of the 55 enterprises and scientific research institutions with export operational rights increased their foreign exchange earnings. On foreign economic relations, last year the province approved the establishment of 1,360 new three-capital enterprises. The foreign capital actually used by three-capital enterprises totaled $1.03 billion and their foreign exchange earnings topped $100 million. After listening to this feedback report, Governor Chen Bangzhu made an important speech on this year's foreign economic relations and trade. He pointed out: The key to expanding foreign exchange earnings and improving economic results is to adjust and optimize the mix of export commodities and to improve their quality. We should strengthen our investment guidance, pay close attention to the management of three-capital enterprises, and further improve our investment environment.
