In Category 4 (Computers), following Advisory Note 7, the Technical Note under the heading ``Information on How to Calculate Composite Theoretical Performance (CTP)'' is revised to read as follows: Information on How to Calculate ``Composite Theoretical Performance'' (``CTP''): Technical Note: ``Composite theoretical performance'' (CTP). Abbreviations used in this Technical Note CE ``computing element'' (typically an arithmetic logical unit) FP floating point XP fixed point t execution time XOR exclusive OR CPU central processing unit TP theoretical performance (of a single CE) CTP ``composite theoretical performance'' (multiple CEs) R effective calculating rate WL word length L word length * multiply Execution time `t' is expressed in microseconds, TP and ``CTP'' are expressed in Mtops (millions of theoretical operations per second) and WL is expressed in bits. Outline of ``CTP'' Calculation Method ``CTP'' is a measure of computational performance given in millions of theoretical operations per second (Mtops). In calculating the ``Composite Theoretical Performance'' (``CTP'') of an aggregation of ``Computing Elements'' (``CEs''), the following three steps are required: 1. Calculate the effective calculating rate (R) for each ``computing element'' (``CE''); 2. Apply the word length adjustment (L) to the effective calculating rate (R), resulting in a Theoretical Performance (TP) for each ``computing element'' (``CE''); 3. If there is more than one ``computing element'' (``CE''), combine the Theoretical Performances (TPs), resulting in a ``Composite Theoretical Performance'' (``CTP'') for the aggregation. Details for these steps are given in the following section. Note 1: For aggregations of multiple ``computing elements'' (``CEs'') that have both shared and unshared memory subsystems, the calculation of ``CTP'' is completed hierarchically, in two steps: first, aggregate the groups of ``computing elements'' (``CEs'') sharing memory; second calculate the ``CTP'' of the groups using the calculation method for multiple ``computing elements'' (``CEs'') not sharing memory. Note 2: ``Computing elements'' (``CEs'') that are limited to input/output and peripheral functions (e.g., disk drive, communication and video display controllers) are not aggregated into the ``CTP'' calculation.
