The picture is now complete, apart from three or four appeals to the regional administrative courts, perhaps announced simply because of a reluctance to admit being in the wrong. At 1400 hours [1300 GMT] yesterday the Appeal Court's central electoral office, in a marathon five-day session, completed its examination of 204 appeals submitted by candidates excluded from the election, primarily on basis of irregularities in the gathering of signatures for the electoral lists. The 20 magistrates -- chosen by the first chairman of the Supreme Court in view of their impartiality and the fact that they live in Rome -- returned to their regular jobs, leaving the clerk of the court's office working intensively until the evening faxing the magistrates' decisions to the various constituency offices that forwarded appeals to Rome. The final decisions entail Rete's exclusion from Campania 2 (Benevento, Avellino, Caserta, and Salerno) for the proportional vote and the reinstatement for the proportional vote in Calabria of the National Alliance lists (headed by Raffaele Valensise) and the Communist Renewal lists (headed by Fausto Bertinotti). But the Renewal [Rinnovamento], Pannella, and southern Italy lists were not successful. With regard to some of the smaller lists, the Veritas Movement and Fascism and Freedom were approved , while the Southern Movement and European Liberal Democrats were turned down. Last, the Popular Party's outgoing deputy for the single-candidate constituency of Catanzaro was reinstated. The Southern Action League -- a political grouping headed by Mayor of Taranto Giancarlo Cito -- will also be able to compete for the proportional vote. The same decision was reached in connection with Tommaso Mitrotti, former Italian Social Movement [MSI] senator and founder of Social Democracy, which is linked to Cito's movement, and Prince Sforza Ruspoli, linked with the mayor with the South Wind-Viva Zapata list. The Appeal Court turned down Novella Calligaris, a Chamber of Deputies candidate for Rome's constituency 6 on the Pact for Italy list. The same goes for Gianfranco Zambelli, on the same list in constituency 5, and Vincenzo Logasso of the Justicialist Party in constituency 12. As for Milan, all the appeals by Chamber candidates were turned down. Thus the exclusions affecting Uber Ravagnani (Italian Citizens' Union), Antonio Ziveri (Pact), and Eugenio Girolo (New Ecological Democratic Italy and Environment) still stand. Of the major parties, Forza Italia will be excluded from Umbria for the Senate and in Puglia for the proportional vote; the League in Rome and its province for the Senate and in the Marches; the Pact in Piedmont for the proportional vote and one of its candidates in Milan and two in Rome for the Chamber; the Democratic Alliance in Trentino for the proportional vote; the progressive alignment loses one Chamber candidate, again in Trentino, and is excluded from the Senate elections in Nuoro (Ayala's status as candidate for Catania is also in doubt); Communist Renewal in Sicily; Rete in Campania and Veneto; the Pannella list in two constituencies in Veneto for the proportional vote and in the Marches, where it was standing together with the Reformers; Renewal [Rinnovamento] in the Marches, Umbria (the Senate), and Puglia (lower house). Various kinds of appeal were announced the other day by the League over the expulsion of its candidates in the Marches and yesterday by Forza Italia in connection with its five lost candidates in Umbria; by Sgarbi's former spokesman, Franco Corbelli (Calabria); and by the Pannella list, which will appeal "in every civil, political, and judicial forum" over its exclusion from the two Veneto constituencies. Massimo Natale -- a Naples candidate not connected with any of the lists -- constitutes a separate case. The Appeal Court reinstated him, but completing the list of symbols is proving a problem in Naples because Massimo Natale does not have one. This means that, at least in theory, an insoluble dispute could arise. Parliament would have to have the final say on the matter. Last, some observations about the principles pursued by the Appeal Court's central electoral office. Appeals were allowed in the case of such venial sins as small excesses in the number of signatures, the use of non-regulation forms, the lack of adequate documentation -- that is, all the cases in which the errors did not undermine the relationship of trust between voters and candidate. The other cases were rejected -- shortage of signatures, their submission beyond the deadline, or obvious frauds.
