FR940725-0-00167 FR940725-0-00019 B. Congress Concluded That OSHA Regulations Are Necessary To Protect Workers From Occupational Hazards And That Employers Should Be Required To Reduce or Eliminate Significant Workplace Health and Safety Threats At section 2(a) of the OSH Act (29 U.S.C. 651(a)), Congress announced its determination that occupational injury and illness should be eliminated as much as possible: ``The Congress finds that occupational injury and illness arising out of work situations impose a substantial burden upon, and are a hindrance to, interstate commerce in terms of lost production, wage loss, medical expenses, and disability compensation payments.'' Congress therefore declared ``it to be its purpose and policy *␣*␣* to assure so far as possible every working man and woman in the Nation safe *␣*␣* working conditions [29 U.S.C. 651(b)].'' To that end, Congress instructed the Secretary of Labor to adopt existing Federal and consensus standards during the first 2 years after the OSH Act became effective and, in the event of conflict among any such standards, to ``promulgate the standard which assures the greatest protection of the safety or health of the affected employees [29 U.S.C. 655(a)].'' Congress also directed the Secretary to set mandatory occupational safety standards (29 U.S.C. 651(b)(3)), based on a rulemaking record and substantial evidence (29 U.S.C. 655(b)(2)), that are ``reasonably necessary or appropriate to provide safe *␣*␣* employment and places of employment.'' When promulgating permanent safety or health standards that differ from existing national consensus standards, the Secretary must explain ``why the rule as adopted will better effectuate the purposes of this Act than the national consensus standard [29 U.S.C. 655(b)(8)].'' Correspondingly, every employer must comply with OSHA standards and in addition, ``furnish to each of his employees employment and a place of employment which are free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm to his employees [29 U.S.C. 654(a)].'' ``Congress understood that the Act would create substantial costs for employers, yet intended to impose such costs when necessary to create a safe and healthful working environment. Congress viewed the costs of health and safety as a cost of doing business. *␣*␣* Indeed, Congress thought that the financial costs of health and safety problems in the workplace were as large as or larger than the financial costs of eliminating these problems [ American Textile Mfrs. Inst. Inc. v. Donovan, 452 U.S. 490, 519&hyph;522 (1981) ( ATMI ); emphasis was supplied in original].'' ``[T]he fundamental objective of the Act [is] to prevent occupational deaths and serious injuries [ Whirlpool Corp. v. Marshall, 445 U.S. 1, 11 (1980)].'' ``We know the costs would be put into consumer goods but that is the price we should pay for the 80 million workers in America [S. Rep. No. 91&hyph;1282, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. (1970); H.R. Rep. No. 91&hyph;1291, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. (1970), reprinted in Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare, Legislative History of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, (Committee Print 1971) (``Leg. Hist.'') at 444 (Senator Yarborough)].'' ``Of course, it will cost a little more per item to produce a washing machine. Those of us who use washing machines will pay for the increased cost, but it is worth it, to stop the terrible death and injury rate in this country [ Id. at 324; see also 510&hyph;511, 517].'' [T]he vitality of the Nation's economy will be enhanced by the greater productivity realized through saved lives and useful years of labor. When one man is injured or disabled by an industrial accident or disease, it is he and his family who suffer the most immediate and personal loss. However, that tragic loss also affects each of us. As a result of occupational accidents and disease, over $1.5 billion in wages is lost each year [1970 dollars], and the annual loss to the gross national product is estimated to be over $8 billion. Vast resources that could be available for productive use are siphoned off to pay workmen's compensation and medical expenses.␣*␣*␣* Only through a comprehensive approach can we hope to effect a significant reduction in these job death and casualty figures. [ Id. at 518&hyph;19 (Senator Cranston)] Congress considered uniform enforcement crucial because it would reduce or eliminate the disadvantage that a conscientious employer might experience where inter-industry or intra-industry competition is present. Moreover, ``many employers_particularly smaller ones_simply cannot make the necessary investment in health and safety, and survive competitively, unless all are compelled to do so [Leg. Hist. at 144, 854, 1188, 1201].'' Thus, the statutory text and legislative history make clear that Congress conclusively determined that OSHA regulation is necessary to protect workers from occupational hazards and that employers should be required to reduce or eliminate significant workplace health and safety threats.
