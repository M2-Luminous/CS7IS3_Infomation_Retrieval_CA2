According to a Voice of America report on 20 June, two U.S. senators, including Senator McCain, gave a news conference after their junket to South Korea, and advocated imposing tough sanctions against us and reinforcing U.S. forces in South Korea. They even made provocative, violent remarks, in an undisguised way, insisting that the United States launch a selective military strike against us. Prior to this, in a television interview, Representative Hamilton, chairman of the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee, remarked that there is a limit to U.S. patience. He said emphatically: It is necessary to complete the (?threat) potential of the ROK and U.S. Armed Forces and to make the intensification of sanctions a way to solve the issue on a priority basis. In recent days, a spokesman for the U.S. Defense Department has found fault with us by saying that our measure of withdrawing from the International Atomic Energy Agency is making the situation more dangerous. He made an undisguised remark to rapidly reinforce U.S. Armed Forces in South Korea and additionally deploy U.S. military airplanes and an aircraft carrier to the area near the Korean peninsula. THE WASHINGTON TIMES, a U.S. newspaper, has reported that the U.S. Defense Department has recently made an in-depth examination of ways to conduct a rapid dispatch of U.S. troops and U.S. fighter planes and a further dispatch of artillery detection radar, while additionally dispatching military intelligence experts to South Korea. According to THE WALL STREET JOURNAL, a U.S. newspaper, U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense Ashton has made it public that the United States is further reinforcing U.S. forces in South Korea with modern weapons and combat equipment.
