FR940826-1-00050 FR940826-1-00008 (a) Payments for outpatient maintenance dialysis are based on rates set prospectively by HCFA. (b) All approved ESRD facilities must accept the prospective payment rates established by HCFA as payment in full for covered outpatient maintenance dialysis. (c) HCFA publishes the methodology used to establish payment rates and changes in those rates in the Federal Register , as provided in §413.196(b). §413.174 [Redesignated as §413.198] 5. Existing section 413.174 is redesignated as §413.198. 6. A new §413.174 is added to read as follows: §413.174 Prospective rates for hospital-based and independent ESRD facilities. (a) In accordance with section 1881(b)(7) of the Act, HCFA establishes prospective rates using a methodology that_ (1) Differentiates between hospital-based facilities and independent ESRD facilities; (2) Effectively encourages efficient delivery of dialysis services; and (3) Provides incentives for increasing the use of home dialysis. (b) For purposes of rate-setting and payment under this section, HCFA considers any facility that does not meet all of the criteria of a hospital-based facility to be an independent facility. A determination under this paragraph is an initial determination under §498.3 of this chapter. (c) For purposes of rate-setting and payment under this section, HCFA will determine that a facility is hospital-based if the_ (1) Facility and hospital are subject to the bylaws and operating decisions of a common governing board. This governing board, which has final administrative responsibility, approves all personnel actions, appoints medical staff, and carries out similar management functions; (2) Facility's director or administrator is under the supervision of the hospital's chief executive officer and reports through him or her to the governing board; (3) Facility personnel policies and practices conform to those of the hospital; (4) Administrative functions of the facility (for example, records, billing, laundry, housekeeping, and purchasing) are integrated with those of the hospital; and (5) Facility and hospital are financially integrated, as evidenced by the cost report, which reflects allocation of overhead to the facility through the required step-down methodology. (d) In determining whether a facility is hospital-based, HCFA does not consider_ (1) An agreement between a facility and a hospital concerning patient referral; (2) A shared service arrangement between a facility and a hospital; or (3) The physical location of a facility on the premises of a hospital. (e) If all the physicians furnishing services to patients in an ESRD facility elect the initial method of payment (as described in §414.313(c) of this subchapter), the prospective rate (as described in paragraph (a) of this section) paid to that facility is increased by an add-on amount as described in §414.313. (f) Erythropoietin (EPO)/Epoietin (EPO). (1) When EPO is furnished to an ESRD patient by a Medicare approved ESRD facility or a supplier of home dialysis equipment and supplies, payment is based on the amount specified in paragraph (f)(3) of this section. (2) The payment is made only on an assignment basis, that is, directly to the facility or supplier, which must accept, as payment in full, the amount that HCFA determines.
