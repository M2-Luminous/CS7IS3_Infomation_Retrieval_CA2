However, people's understandings of a modern enterprise system are not very clear and uniform; in addition, people are also in the process of exploring and studying some concrete ideas on the establishment of a modern enterprise system. Therefore we specially interviewed Professor Liu Guoguang, a prominent economist, who participated in the drafting of the Decision on the Several Issues Concerning the Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic System. [Xiao and He] Enterprise reform has been going on for over ten years in our country. Why was the idea of establishing a modern enterprise system raised just now? Would you please discuss the background involved. [Liu] The Third Plenum of the 14th CPC Central Committee formulated the basic framework of a socialist market economic system, and a very important pillar and pivotal point is the establishment of a modern enterprise system. As we all know, to establish a socialist market economic system, it is first of all necessary to have fully developed actors engaged in market activities. And among various kinds of market actors, enterprises are the most basic and important ones. Over the past ten-odd years, while always situated at the center of our country's economic structural reform, the reform of state-owned enterprises has all along been one of the difficult problems puzzling the reformers. As should be recognized, the reform of state-owned enterprises has proceeded mainly in the direction of expanding enterprise autonomy, and the approach used has been one of "delegating power and giving away gains"; some progress has been made, thereby providing some foundation for enterprises' entry into the market. Nevertheless, up to now, the reform measures concerning state-owned enterprises have not deviated from the line of thought characterized by the idea of "delegating power and giving away gains," neither have they constituted breaking away from the confines of traditional ideas--taking the initiative in actively proceeding with the reform of the traditional enterprise system. Consequently such problems besetting state-owned enterprises as the failure to separate government from enterprises, the unclear property rights relationships, enterprises' lack of the right to freely enter the market, and soft financial-budget constraints have remained unresolved throughout all these years. The "one-third each" situation in which nationwide one-third of state-owned enterprises are making losses, one-third potential losses, and one-third profits means that the situation of low efficiency in state-owned enterprises has not been fundamentally improved. The economics community has been engaged in exploratory discussions of the issue of the necessity to fundamentally reform the system of state-owned enterprises, and has now reached rather unanimous understandings, that is, that to further proceed with the reform of state-owned enterprises, it is necessary to resolve deeper-level contradictions, turning from using the policy which mainly entails "delegating power and giving away gains" into carrying out enterprise system innovations which mainly include clarifying property rights relationships. In other words it is necessary to reform the form of embodiment of state ownership and the ownership framework governing state-owned enterprises, establishing an enterprise system of a new type which is mainly based on the system of corporate legal entities. This is the modern enterprise system clearly set forth in the Decision. [Xiao and He] Many people have now put forward the concept of "turning entities into corporations." As we read not long ago, when interviewed by a reporter of ZHONGHUA GONGSHANG SHIBAO, you also said that it was necessary to establish the system of corporate legal entities. What do you believe to be the main characteristics of the corporate system as a modern enterprise system? [Liu] The corporate system is a modern enterprise system; it is the product of prolonged development of modern market economics and socialized large production, an achievement of human civilization, and a part of mankind's common wealth. Since we have decided to establish a socialist market economic system, it is necessary to transform state-owned enterprises which constitute such a large proportion of the national economy into actors appropriate to a modern market economy. In my view, turning entities into corporations is also the process of transforming traditional state-owned enterprises. The corporate system has the following several main characteristics: First, property rights relationships are clear. It is thus possible to achieve the separation of the investors' ownership rights from the enterprise legal entities' property rights, so that enterprises may become legal entities with civil law rights and civil liability and actors in market competition, on the basis of corporate properties formed by investments from enterprise investors. Second, rights and responsibilities are clear. By having legal entity properties, corporations would both acquire effective independent management power, and have increased responsibility, to investors, for their own profits and losses and for preserving and increasing the values of assets. On the one hand an investor enjoys the owner's rights on the basis of the amount of capital he has invested in the enterprise, including those relating to returns on assets, important decisions, and the selection of enterprise managers, but does not directly intervene in the enterprise' management activities; on the other hand the investor assumes limited liability for debts on the basis of the amount of invested capital when the enterprise goes bankrupt. Third, there is a standardized corporate governing structure, that is, that a balancing and constraining mechanism which adjusts relationships among owners, representatives of the legal entity, managers, and the employees as a group will be established through the forming and functioning of such corporate governing institutions as the general meeting of shareholders, the board of directors, the board of supervisors, and executive departments (management departments). Fourth, the system is conducive to raising funds, thereby presenting a good way to increase the scale of production and to socialize capital. Having state-owned enterprises turn into being based on the modern corporate system will provide a foundation for severing the umbilical cords linking up enterprises with government, rectifying the relationships of property rights over state assets, and achieving the transformation of state-owned enterprises' mechanisms, and also increase the scope of fund raising, thereby promoting the development of socialized large production. [Xiao and He] What specific ideas do you have on transforming various enterprises in the various industries in our country into corporations? [Liu] In order to standardize corporations' governing structure and operating mechanisms, it is obviously necessary to diversify shareholding by having multiple shareholders. Overall, this objective can be achieved through transforming entities into multiple-shareholder corporations through issuing shares on the basis of the existing assets of state-owned enterprises, issuing additional shares on the basis of increases in their assets, selling or transferring their shares, or forming joint ventures. It is proper to determine the proportion of shares to be held by the state in an differentiating and flexible manner on the basis of such factors as the industries involved, the distribution of shares, and the situation of the financial market. More specifically, first, generally, practice sole state ownership and adopt the corporate-system management approach with regard to enterprises involving national security, sophisticated technologies, and special products; transform such enterprises into solely state-owned limited liability corporations, do not set up the general meetings of shareholders, and let the relevant agencies who have been entrusted to manage and supervise the enterprises' state assets send representatives to supervise the preserving and increasing of the enterprises' state assets. Second, with regard to the backbone enterprises in the basic and pillar industries, it is proper to gradually transform the solely state-owned corporations into state holding companies, so as to gather more social funds to be invested in key industries; the proportion of state-held shares should be determined by the position of the relevant enterprise in the national economy and by the degree of dispersion of the shares involved. Third, it is proper for the state not to hold controlling shares but just some shares of enterprises in ordinary competitive industries, and for the state to carry out market operations in view of the financial and fiscal situation, so as to invigorate state shareholding and ensure the preserving and increasing of the value of state assets. As should be noted, experience abroad shows that excessive dispersion of corporate shares is prone to make enterprises pay attention only to short-term returns but disregard long-term development interests, and would also result in the weakening of the constraining role in terms of providing effective supervision of enterprise operations. [Xiao and He] Some people worry that having state-owned enterprises turn into being based on the modern corporate system will inevitably weaken the leading role of the state sector because of the diversification of shareholders, or even result in a situation in which the relevant enterprises are in danger of being privatized. What are your thoughts on this issue? [Liu] I was going to discuss the issue of "privatization." Not only do some people have worries in this respect, but even more people believe that the idea of a modern enterprise system is not clear enough, and that it would be better to adopt the approach of privatization of state-owned enterprises. Or there may be many people who, while not speaking out publicly, believe in private that only "privatization" can save state-owned enterprises. I believe that both views are slanted. Perhaps some people would say that I am an eclectic, but this is not true. In my articles published in 1989, I already explicitly pointed out that it was no longer workable to continue to use the old "delegating power and giving away gains" approach to reforming state-owned enterprises, and that it was necessary to transform and restructure the system of state ownership, so as to resolve the aforementioned problems. Now I am even more adamant in holding this view and have further developed my understanding. In my view, through diversifying shareholders, having state-owned enterprises turn into being based on the modern corporate system can result in extensively gathering social funds for industries needed to be developed by the country, so as to make up for the insufficiency of state funds. If only the state can maintain its position as the holder of controlling shares in terms of the total amount of a corporation's capital, the leading role of the state sector not only will not be weakened, but will be strengthened, and the impact of the state sector will also expand. In the process of turning state-owned enterprises into corporations, while the state will retain some shares, some shares (shares based on existing assets or shares based on increases in assets) need to be sold to legal entities or individuals. But this would do no harm to state assets, neither should this be considered "privatization." This development would constitute the change of the form of state assets, turning shareholding into monetary funds; the value remains in the hands of the state. Surely it is necessary to emphasize here that in evaluating state assets in the process of transforming state-owned enterprises into corporations it is necessary to carefully inventory and evaluate assets so as to prevent the phenomenon of state asset washout caused by undervaluation of state assets. It is now clear that the inactivity of state assets under the old system was not good for preserving and increasing their value. Changes in the form of state assets and the flow of state assets, as a factor of production, are conducive to preserving and increasing their value and to reinvigorating the economy. On the other hand, I also have to point out that privatization may not necessarily be a shortcut, and would involve rather large difficulties and risks. In terms of experience around the world, the lessons of unsuccessful privatization in some transitional countries have begun to be noticed. [Xiao and He] If so, what do you believe to be the difficult issues which need to be urgently considered in the initial stage of the transformation of entities into corporations? [Liu] In my view, in reforming state-owned enterprises, it is necessary to think about: Making clear who will preside over the transformation of a state-owned enterprise on behalf of the original owner; and making clear who will be the representative of the state-held shares in the future corporation. Both issues will lead to many specific operational problems, and are therefore very complicated. It is necessary, I believe, to make clear theoretically that the function of the state as the owner of state assets and the political authority function of the state as the social and economic regulator should be separated, that is, that government and assets should be separated from each other. Each status of the government has its different purpose. If government and assets are not separated, then the government's command signals sent to enterprises would tend to be mutually contradictory and chaotic; nevertheless the administrative command nature of those signals would tend to make it difficult for enterprises to refuse to implement them. Therefore the failure to separate government from assets and the failure to separate government from enterprises are inherently linked together. If the problem of government's remaining not separated from assets is not resolved, then it would also be difficult to achieve the separation of government from enterprises. It is necessary to establish and strengthen the authority institutions exclusively engaged in performing the function of managing the ownership rights over state assets, changing the preexisting situation in which state assets are managed by multiple bodies but in which no one is actually responsible for the assets. Otherwise the phenomenon of the "absence of the owner" of state-owned enterprises will remain unresolved. This is the most difficult problem in the current efforts to reform state-owned enterprises. With regard to this problem, the Decision states that "it is necessary to actively explore the right form and way of managing state assets and of conducting business operations based on state assets." The statement is concise but comprehensive, giving reformers a large space and room for manoeuver. In my view, the management of state assets and business operations based on state assets should also be separated. Agencies managing state assets perform the function of administrative management of state assets. At the same time, it is proper to consider having state-asset management agencies authorize or entrust parent companies in some large enterprise groups, investment companies, and large enterprises capable of making the investments needed to get controlling shares so that they may become holding companies, performing the function of carrying out business operations based on state assets within a certain scope. It is also proper to establish some companies designed to engage in business operations based on state assets, mainly those of small and medium-sized enterprises and those in the form of value. Currently, for transitional purposes, the state may entrust some specialized economic agencies with the task of establishing state-asset supervision agencies which will supervise the subordinate enterprises with regard to the preserving and increasing of the value of the enterprises' state assets. With the dismantling of specialized economic agencies, those supervisory agencies should also be gradually turned into institutions carrying out business operations based on state assets. The existing national general corporations in the various sectors should be gradually transformed into several enterprise group corporations and state-asset business corporations of a holding-company nature, in accordance with the requirements of the modern enterprise system. Currently the situation of washout of state assets is serious. In turning entities into corporations, it is all the more necessary to adopt effective measures to prevent the situation where asset-based shares are characterized by low prices and where shares are sold at low prices or even given away free to individuals. It is necessary to plug loopholes in all aspects so as to ensure that state assets and the related rights and interests are not encroached upon. [Xiao and He] There exists now an argument that after becoming corporations enterprises may acquire their own property rights. What is you view? [Liu] In this respect, I believe, there exists a misunderstanding with regard to whether enterprises may hold shares of their own enterprises. This issue should be clarified. According to some comrades, after the "change from making appropriations into giving loans," the assets formed on the basis of state loans to enterprises after the repayment of debts are no longer state investments but should belong to the enterprises. Those assets should be considered the basis of shares owned by enterprises themselves when shares are issued on the basis of assets in the process of turning entities into corporations. Our view should be that the ultimate ownership of an enterprise's assets belongs to the investors, including the state's ownership rights. Enterprises themselves have legal-entity property rights formed on the basis of the investments made by the ultimate investors. Whether the assets involved are formed on the basis of profit retention under the situation of enterprises' shouldering all responsibility for their profits or losses or are enterprise assets after the repayment of debts relating to the practice of changing from giving appropriations into giving loans, ultimately the properties belong to the original owners, assuming the form of increases in the value of the stocks or increases in shares. Enterprises may not hold their own shares. Allowing an enterprise to hold "its own shares" would result in those running business operations based on state assets violating the rights of the owner, making it impossible to safeguard the owner's rights. If the owner holds shares by itself in addition to legal-entity property rights, then shareholding rights would represent both legal-entity property rights and ultimate ownership rights; as a result relationships between the owner and the actor carrying out business operations based on the assets involved will inevitably become disorderly, leading to a situation where the interests of the actor carrying out business operations based on the assets are promoted at the expense of the interests of the owner. Such a situation will not meet the requirements of a modern enterprise system. However they are produced, all increases in assets are manifested as investors' gains, and the right to returns on assets belongs entirely to the investors. Surely in the process of development enterprises need to provide drive-increasing incentives, but this issue is resolved through incentive mechanisms such as the systems of salaries and bonuses for management personnel and of wages and bonuses for workers. With regard to enterprise employees' holding a certain proportion of the shares of their enterprise, such shareholding should be limited and should not exceed a certain proportion. In order to develop, an enterprise needs to have funds and has to retain profits and keep common purpose funds, but the ultimate ownership rights involved belong to investors. An enterprise may carry out independent operations based on the shareholders' funds, and assume independent responsibility for profits and losses. Successful operations will be manifested as increases in the market value of the shares held by investors. In such a situation new shares may also be issued, but only to the existing investors instead of the enterprise. An enterprise has legal-entity property rights, and may control all the invested capital and carry out business operations based on such capital; if the operations are successful, the board of directors can reward and promote management personnel; the management personnel who have performed poorly will be dismissed. An enterprise may also make investments; however it may only invest, as a legal entity, in other enterprises and hold the shares of the enterprises receiving the investments, but may not hold its own shares. This misunderstanding should be eliminated; otherwise it can easily lead to a situation where those carrying out business operations based on assets encroach upon the rights of investors. By the way, another misunderstanding should also be eliminated. Some comrades believe that the basic content of the transformation of entities into corporations is to have shares embody property rights and to have corporations listed, regarding the move as an expedient way to gather funds and create new enterprises. The operating mechanisms of some listed corporations remain as before. This situation does not meet the requirements of the modern corporate system. According to experience abroad, the number of corporations listed in securities exchanges is very small; those corporations account for only approximately 1-2 per thousand of the total number of corporations. In the Western developed market-economy countries, the stocks of most limited-liability joint-stock companies are traded on trading markets outside the stock exchanges, and only the stocks of a small number of large corporations are listed and traded in securities exchanges. For instance, in the early 1980s only less than 2,000 of the approximately 2.5 million U.S. companies are listed in securities exchanges. Thus this misunderstanding has resulted in the distortion of stock market behavior. As state-owned enterprises have not completed the transformation into corporations in a standardized manner and as their accounting and auditing systems are not fully developed, the stock market has not only failed to perform a positive function, but on the contrary has to some extent induced excessive speculation and the "bubble" phenomenon. Such a situation is not conducive to the effort to transform entities into corporations. The chief goal of the effort to transform our country's enterprises into corporations is to transform mechanisms but not to gather funds. For a long time to come, enterprises' main fund-gathering method should be based on indirect fund gathering through banks, with direct fund gathering on the securities market serving as a supplementary means. Consequently, while it is proper to conduct active experiments on limited-liability joint-stock companies listed on the stock market, activities in this direction should not become the focal point of our country's current effort to transform entities into corporations. [Xiao and He] It seems that the property rights system is the link most critical to establishing a modern enterprise system. Is this your view? [Liu] I do not believe that it is proper to have such a simplistic understanding of the issue. Transforming state-owned enterprises into modern legal-entity enterprises based on the corporate system is a very complicated and difficult process. Rectifying property rights relationships is surely a critical link of the reform of state-owned enterprises, but many other problems currently besetting state-owned enterprises cannot be resolved through rectifying property rights relationships; on the other hand, if those problems are not resolved, it would be difficult to proceed with the rectification of property rights relationships in a successful manner. It can be said that the problems can be resolved only through adopting relevant comprehensive and mutually supportive policy measures and reform measures. Those problems include: State-owned enterprises' heavy tax burdens, a serious situation of unauthorized fund gathering, unauthorized levies, and unauthorized fees, growing burdens created by enterprises' retirees and surplus personnel, and enterprises' burdens caused by their role in providing various social-welfare services. For example, some people have suggested the use of the method of share-debt transformation for resolving problems such as those of how to get rid of the enterprises' historical burdens, how to shed the enterprises' burdens resulting from their role in providing social services, and how to resolve the widespread problem of debt burdens in state-owned enterprises. It is necessary to study whether such a suggestion is feasible. [Xiao and He] You suggest that social security matters be removed from the enterprise system, that state-asset holding companies be established, that reforms of the taxation system and the financial system be also carried out, etc. Would such measures not make the reform of state-owned enterprises have too widespread implications? Would people not be unwilling to wait for such a comprehensive reform, resulting in a failure to carry out the reform? [Liu] The reform of state-owned enterprises is certainly a very difficult reform. There is no doubt about that. Anyone saying that the state-owned enterprises with thousands of billions of yuan in assets can easily turn into being based on a true modern corporate system is, I believe, being irresponsible. With regard to some reforms such as the reform of the fiscal and taxation system, the separate taxation system used by market economy countries provides ready experience, and it would be fine to just proceed on the basis of referring to the experience; of course it is necessary to proceed in a way in line with our country's realities. The situation is the same with the reform of the financial system. The central bank's task is to control money, maintaining stability and formulating a right interest-rate policy and policies on open market operations, but should not engage in commercial operations. To commercialize specialized banks, it is necessary to separate the policy nature from the commercial nature. These macroeconomic regulation and control measures do not involve the issue of ownership to a great extent, and there exists ready experience to be referred to. But when the issue of transforming the ownership system is involved, what is at stake is something essential to socialism, that is, the leading role of public ownership. If we are unable to successfully restructure the state-owned enterprises' ownership framework and if we, following fashionable ideas, let some people use a "deceptive" approach to turn the enormous amount of state assets into private assets in a "deceptive" manner, injustice and corruption will become rampant across society. If such a method of cryptic transition is used, powerful people and swindlers will become very rich, whereas honest people and ordinary people will become very poor. Such a society is sure to be unstable, and political turbulence will be unavoidable. In such circumstances, what socialist market economic system is there to speak of! We should fully understand the difficult nature of the reform of state-owned enterprises. For not only does the transformation of entities into corporations itself have widespread implications, but the standardized operational designs of the corporate system themselves will encounter the issue of contrasting and competition among various interest relationships. Past reform measures were mostly the product of "one on one" bargaining; as a result contradictions and conflicts among different interests were often alleviated or delayed. But if all of the state's properties are to be redistributed, dodging interest contradictions might not work. Nevertheless, in any case the decision made by the Third Plenum of the 14th CPC Central Committee has described in a theoretical manner the contour and direction of the reform of state-owned enterprises in our country. An economist's responsibility should be to make more people understand what a modern enterprise system is so as to prevent the occurrence of the "deception" situation, and produce a rational, orderly, thorough, and feasible operational plan on the reform which turns entities into corporations, so as to produce a good foundation for the first-step reform, thereby creating conditions for further reform steps. Only in this way will we be able to accomplish the transition from traditional enterprises to the modern corporate system and to successfully reform state-owned enterprises at low costs.
