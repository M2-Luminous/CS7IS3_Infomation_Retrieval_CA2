FR940418-0-00040 FR940418-0-00011 E. Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence. Although the habitat occupied by this species is dependent upon some form of disturbance to set back succession (e.g., periodic fire and/or beaver impoundments), intense fires at critical times during the life cycle of the species can eliminate small colonies. Historically, this did not present a problem since there were undoubtedly other adjacent populations that could recolonize extirpated sites. However, the fact that only one population of this species now remains makes it more vulnerable to such threats as catastrophic climatic events, inbreeding depression, disease, and parasitism. Part of the occupied area is adjacent to regularly traveled roads, where there is the threat of toxic chemical spills into the species' wetland habitat. Current military use of the impact areas is favorable to this species; the frequent fires associated with shelling are undoubtedly a principal reason why the species is surviving on military lands and not on surrounding private lands. Department of Defense personnel are aware of the species' plight and have been cooperative in protection efforts. However, heavy siltation is a potential problem that could threaten the small drainages occupied by the species. Although troop movements directly through an area occupied by the satyr could have negative impacts, this has not occurred to date; these activities have now been directed away from areas where the satyr occurs. Other potential threats to the species include pest control programs (for mosquitoes or gypsy moths) and beaver control. Reasons for Emergency Determination In developing this rule the Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the past, present, and future threats faced by this species. Based on this evaluation, the preferred action is to list Saint Francis' satyr as endangered on an emergency basis. With only one population remaining (and this one having already been diminished by intensive collecting) and with the other subspecies having been completely eliminated from half the States where it historically occurred, the threat of over-collection cannot be denied. The Service has concluded that conducting the normal listing process will delay protection of the species until after the 1994 flight period, thus subjecting the species to an additional year of excessive collecting pressure. The resulting potential for further reduction of this last population could severely reduce the probability of the species' survival. Therefore, the Service is listing the species on an emergency basis to provide maximum protection to the known population during the 1994 flight period. Critical Habitat Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that, to the maximum extent prudent and determinable, the Secretary designate critical habitat at the time a species is determined to be endangered or threatened. At this time the Service has made a preliminary finding that designation of critical habitat is not prudent for this species. As discussed under Factor B in the ``Summary of Factors Affecting the Species'' section, Saint Francis' satyr has already been impacted by over-collecting and continues to be threatened by collecting pressure. Publication of critical habitat descriptions and maps would make the satyr more vulnerable to collection and would increase enforcement problems and the likelihood of extinction. Protection of this species' habitat will be addressed through the recovery process and through the Section 7 jeopardy standard. The single remaining population is located on military lands, where the Department of Defense is aware of its occurrence. Comments regarding the designation of critical habitat will be accepted and reviewed during the comment period established by the proposed rule, which is published in this issue of the Federal Register .
