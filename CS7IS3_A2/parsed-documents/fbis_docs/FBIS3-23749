The Government of Russia in Decree No. 1308 has transferred 27 federal enterprises and organizations to the ownership of Arkhangelsk Oblast. The list contains this line: "Editorial offices of the mass circulation oblast newspaper PRAVDA SEVERA." "The way we read the government decree is that the subject of transfer is not the editorial collective but only the property this collective uses," explained Grigoriy Perfilov, chairman of the oblast committee for administration of state property. "The editorial offices are furnished with tables, chairs, bookcases, and typewriters, which belong to the state. The newspaper leases this property from the Arkhangelsk Oblast administration, or to be precise, from our committee. That is all." An alarming detail: PRAVDA SEVERA is not a state-owned newspaper; it was founded by the newspaper's journalistic collective, and therefore the legitimacy of the government degree with respect to this newspaper is questionable. According to Grigoriy Perfilov, it was the oblast's publishing and printing administration that added the newspaper to the draft of this decree. PRAVDA SEVERA journalists name another "author": The petition to the government to transfer the newspaper to the oblast was signed by the former chairman of the former oblast soviet, Yuriy Guskov. PRAVDA SEVERA Deputy Editor in Chief Aleksandr Sakharov emphasized that the oblast administration does not encroach on the newspaper's freedom of action and even provides material assistance to journalists of the independent publication. In particular, it made up for the losses on discounted subscriptions for low-income subscribers--an amount of more than 68 million rubles. On the other hand, with this government decree in effect, PRAVDA SEVERA could be kept in check even without interfering with the editorial personnel. The building where the newspaper is located is federal property, while the newspaper's equipment belongs to the oblast. Thus, the journalists found themselves completely dependent on a benevolent attitude of two masters simultaneously. Either of these masters, should they decide to hike the rent, could easily bankrupt the paper. So far, thank goodness, there is no indication of such an intent. But the noose has been put in place and for that reason is already dangerous for freedom of speech. It cannot be precluded that our bureaucrats, always active in fighting journalists, will replicate the "Arkhangelsk noose" with respect to all the regional publications and thus will be able to manipulate public opinion. Today the central newspapers, because of diminishing circulation, have little influence on public opinion in the provinces. The authority of local publications, on the other hand, had increased sharply. PRAVDA SEVERA has a circulation of more than 70,000: one copy per 20 oblast residents, including infants. On the day I visited the PRAVDA SEVERA editorial offices they got a call from Moscow--from the judiciary chamber on information disputes, and from St. Petersburg--from the regional inspectorate on protection of freedom of the press. They promised all sorts of assistance if someone tries on the basis of the government decree to encroach on the newspaper's legitimate rights. This preventive alarm is understandable. Although the law is sacred in Russia, the lawmakers are foes.
