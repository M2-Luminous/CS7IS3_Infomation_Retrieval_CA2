Russian-Finnish contacts, including those at the parliamentary level, will develop in future too. Rybkin informed the high guest that Russian people wait with interest for a visit to Moscow by the Finnish parliament speaker. The sides pointed to the importance of developing further economic cooperation between the two states, which, as they put it, should be given a boost. The president displayed interest in how investment legislation progresses in Russia. "The question of guarantees is of top priority for us," he noted. Rybkin described the economic and political situation in the country to the president, stressing that "it was not an easy thing for us to adopt" the Social Accord Treaty. He noted that it was fathered by the State Duma (lower house) which adopted a decision on economic and political amnesty last February. "When the process was joined by the president who buttressed it with his prestige, the cause of consolidation picked up much more speed," he said. "We in the State Duma supported the government's unpopular measures by adopting a very tense federal budget for this year in the first reading and made this move consciously," Rybkin said, stressing that "we should bear the burden of our reforms together with the government". "It is important that social accord was reached and that cooperation between the two arms of Russian Government is successfully developing," Ahtisaari said. "I had the same impression after my talks with Boris Yeltsin and Viktor Chernomyrdin," the president added.
