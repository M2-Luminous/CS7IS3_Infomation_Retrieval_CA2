China should not be bullied and isolated, he said, adding that no one could insult China without harming the interests of the United States and the whole world. Bush, U.S. president from 1989 to 1993, made the comments when addressing Citibank customers, prominent government officials, diplomats, and leading businessmen and bankers. He arrived in Singapore on Thursday on a two-day visit to the country as part of Citibank's Asian Leadership Series, which was launched in 1992 in celebration of Citibank's 90th anniversary in Asia. Bush also clashed with President Bill Clinton in opinion over the case of Michael Pater Fay, an American teenager, who has been found guilty for vandalism here last month and sentenced to imprisonment and six strokes of caning. Clinton had expressed his objection to the caning sentence, describing it as too "severe." He had reportedly sent a personal letter to Singapore President Ong Teng Cheong, pleading for clemency. Bush said that when one was in someone else's country, he must follow the law of that country. A country could not establish a set of laws for its citizens, but another set of laws for Americans, and another one more for people from other countries, he said.
