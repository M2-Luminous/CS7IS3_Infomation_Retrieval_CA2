The project includes further development of the Shenfu-Dongsheng coalfield in northwest China's Shaanxi Province, which will have a total production capacity of more than 100 million tons a year; construction of the Shenfu-Huanghua railway with a total length of 820 km; and construction of the Huanghua port on the Bohai Sea in north China, which will have an annual handling capacity of 100 million tons of coal. The project is aimed at transporting the fine-quality coal from the Shenfu-Dongsheng coalfield to the eastern part of the country. The Shenfu-Dongsheng coalfield already has a yearly production capacity of 10 million tons. The second-stage development of coal mines with a total annual capacity of 30 million tons has been listed as one of the 151 national major projects for 1994. The Shenmu-Shuoxian section of the Shenfu-Huanghua railway has already gone into operation. The design of the electrified multiple-track Shuoxian-Huanghua railway has been completed thanks to the efforts of over 300 designers over the past several months. Now, a 1,000-member survey team is making the final survey along the railway line to pave the way for the start of the construction. Work on overall design of the Huanghua port is now in full swing. Meanwhile, preparations for construction of the supplementary projects of the port such as power and water supply projects and telecommunications and communications networks will soon be completed.
