That sum is to be used to cover the federal budget deficit during this period. This move was not possible earlier, since the necessary legal basis was created only in the last session of the Assembly, Dr. Radoje Kontic, federal prime minister, informed newsmen. The deficit in the federal treasury has remained unchanged, but in practice this means that foreign-exchange reserves will be used to cover 335 million dinars of the federal state's deficit and the sale of some commodity reserves, another 180 million dinars. It was explained to newsmen that 23 million dinars will be realized from the sale of farm products, about 5 million from energy products, and 17 million from the sale of industrial raw materials.
