This request is listed in point 15 of the issues to be discussed during the foreign ministers' meeting, entitled "Report on the Bolivian Maritime Problem." According to some sources, the Chilean position on the Bolivian claim of a maritime outlet through the Chilean coast is an issue that should be discussed by the two countries and is not a multilateral issue for discussion in an international meeting. According to the local press, the Chilean Government believes there are no pending conflicts with Bolivia, with which Chile has maintained consular relations since 1978. The Chilean delegation to the OAS will be headed by Chilean Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa, who left for Brazil on 4 June. Figueroa will then leave for an official visit to Argentina on 8 June. The Chilean press said the Bolivian claim for a sea outlet to the Pacific is one of the recurrent issues submitted to the OAS Assembly. Bolivia lost its sovereign sea coast after the 1879 Pacific War, which it fought with Peru against Chile.
