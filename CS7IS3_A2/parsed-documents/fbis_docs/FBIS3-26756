Meng Jianzhu, deputy mayor and head of the leading group, attended the meeting and spoke. According to figures, the municipality made remarkable progress in cracking down on smuggling last year. Over 1,500 violations involving smuggling and selling of contraband goods were uncovered last year in the Shanghai area. The goods involved in those violations were estimated at 334 million yuan. The focus of Shanghai's anti-smuggling work this year will be on the investigation of major cases, with special emphasis on cracking down on smuggling by enterprises and establishments through cargo transport channels, and organized smuggling and blackmarketing. We should, in particular, strike at the ringleaders, principal offenders, and habitual criminals. Cases of gross violations that involve huge amounts of illicit goods, the use of violence to resist antismuggling efforts, collaboration from within and without, law- breaking by law-enforcement personnel, and pose a great harm to society must be dealt with promptly and severely.
