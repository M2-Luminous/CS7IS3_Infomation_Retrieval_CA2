The talks were also attended by Macedonia's Foreign Minister. On this occasion, they exchanged opinions regarding the strengthening of the cooperation between the two countries and the current situation in the region. It was jointly assessed that the latest Greek measures, namely the closing of the border, are illegal, harmful, and that they can cause vast consequences to the stability in the region. Gligorov expressed full readiness of Macedonia to resume the Macedonian-Greek negotiations within the framework of the UN, without previous conditions and pressure. Mr. Schafer yesterday held talks with Foreign Minister Stevo Crvenkovski. The two politicians exchanged opinions regarding the situation on the Balkans and the mutual bilateral cooperation and the possibilities for its strengthening. Minister Crvenkovski briefed the German guest on Macedonia's international activities and the efforts for its admission to the international institutions. It was jointly concluded that there are many possibilities for a development of the bilateral relations and economic cooperation. Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski informed Mr. Schafer of the latest government measures in relation to the transformation of the Macedonian economy, particularly in the implementation of the programme for economic stabilization, as well as the difficulties Macedonia is facing since the introduction of the economic embargo by Greece. Mr. Schafer expressed hope that the newly developed situation, following the embargo, will be overcome with an aim of normalizing the transport of goods and services on the southern Macedonian border.
