FBIS4-46999 "jpusr063___94007" FBIS-USR-94-063 JPRS FBIS Report: Central Eurasia 28 May 1994 INTERSTATE AFFAIRS Duma CIS Committee Official on Zatulin's Views, Duma CIS Committee Official on Zatulin's Views, `Neoimperialism' 944Q0408A Moscow NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA in Russian 28 May 94 p 4 944Q0408A Moscow NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA Russian CSO [Article by Vyacheslav Igrunov, deputy chairman of the State Duma Committee on CIS Affairs and Relations with Fellow-Countrymen: "Come Out of Egypt As We Are"] [Text] My first reaction to the publication of Zatulin's interview was the desire to immediately write a rebuke and raise in the Duma the question of dismissing K.F. from the position of chairman of the Committee on CIS Affairs and Relations with Fellow-Countrymen. A phone call from Sochi arrived just in time, however, promising to give a refutation, time dragged on, and ... it seems, I am now forced to dispute the viewpoint, not of Zatulin, but of his interviewer. No, it is not that I changed my attitude toward Konstantin Fedorovich's views -- I considered, and still consider them to be ruinous and tremendously damaging for Russia. It is not that I doubted the authenticity of the interview -- in private conversations the "well-known politician" had uttered the precise words that were conveyed on the pages of NG, even those which were not confirmed by tape recording. The point is that in I. Rotar's article, "Rossiyskiy neoimperializm" [Russian Neoimperialism], I detected depressing cliches and a distressing superficiality, born, perhaps, in the heat of polemics and excusable for a current-affairs commentator, but bitter in the texts of such a thoughtful researcher and ethnic-political scientist as Igor Rotar. First of all, I should like to touch on a few generalizations. It is extremely hasty to identify Mr. Zatulin's revelations with "the position of official Moscow" and even of the PRES Party. Zatulin does not even express the position of the State Duma, which can be seen from the votes on its proposals. The fact that he is the chairman of the committee reflects, unfortunately, not the Duma's orientation in Commonwealth affairs, but the merely formal assignment of duties in the parliament, which was approved as a package. The striking divergence between Zatulin's authority and the status that he has acquired once again emphasizes the depravity, under our conditions, of the method of impersonal allocation of seats to appease the powerful extremist wings in parliament. Igor Rotar's "high-ranking collocutor" obtained his post because, in the allocation of seats, the position of chairman of the Committee on CIS Affairs fell to the lot of PRES, and not because his program most adequately reflected the mood in the Duma. In turn, Mr. Shakhray offered this post to Konstantin Fedorovich, not because the latter has great prestige in the faction or reflects the point of view of its leader, but because it was necessary to settle accounts fittingly according to pre-election obligations. I assure you, Mr. Rotar, the faction and Sergey Shakhray are scarcely delighted about this. Of course, the very fact of Zatulin's presence in such an important seat attests to the level of responsibility of the Duma and certain specific leaders and political factions, but this is nothing more than a politically conscious position on cooperation within the framework of the Commonwealth (or imperial politics, if you like). Whatever the Duma's position was, however, today it plays a negligible role in the real foreign policy of the state. More important here, for example, is the position of the MID [Ministry of Foreign Affairs]. Here the author of the article "Rossiyskiy neorealizm" [Russian Neo-Realism] alludes to the pronouncements of Vadim Kuznetsov on the "constructive relations that have been formed" with Zatulin. It was perceived as a sensation, however. This attests only to the fact that in his official utterances, Mr. Zatulin behaves with much greater restraint, and in general, much more judiciously. Being not so much Mr. Zatulin's opponent as his antagonist, I am often forced to express my solidarity with his position, not because I am myself an imperialist, but because Zatulin knows how to take into consideration in his speeches the opinion of other members of the Committee and the atmosphere of the encounters and moods of the collocutor. All this is done in a very talented way, so that many of those who were shocked by Zatulin's revelations were sometimes delighted by his speeches. Nothing is so natural to people as the ability to be easily deceived. Zatulin's successful "diplomacy," therefore, must not be identified with the position of the MID or even of Mr. Kuznetsov. Let us put aside the perpetrator of the scandal, however, because he provides only the grounds for I. Rotar: the article contains an interesting analysis of Russian politics. The accusations here are better-founded and more serious. Not only the author of the article, but also a tremendous number of political scientists and journalists are now pumping out the myth of a new Russian imperialism. Not that there are no grounds for it: the Soviet people form a policy with Soviet mentality, poisoned, moreover, with industrialized nationalism. This tendency to decide how best to "build up" Russia or the new abroad from Moscow will remain for a long time yet (and institutional and ideological counterbalances to this will have to be worked out), because nothing is so conservative as human culture and psychology. Is this, however, a basis for declaring any integrationalist movement imperialist? Cultural expanses and economic associations, just as other self-organized systems, have mechanisms of the homeostasis of self-renewal. These mechanisms are a powerful force in history. In the middle of the first millennium, the Persians created a world empire which existed for three centuries. This was enough so that two centuries after that the unified space was reintegrated time after time within approximately the same limits. Just as many characteristic integration features are perceptible in the history of Europe, beginning with the days of the Roman Empire. What is more, Russia inherited the tremendous integration potential of the Mongolian Empire. Not all integration or reintegration, however, follows the course of an empire (we will not discuss the imperial legacy itself in such a short piece of material). For example, the integration of modern Europe is completely non-imperial in nature. The creators of anti-Russian rhetoric relate the unification of the monetary systems of Russia and Belorussia [Belarus] as evidence of a neoimperialist policy, even though it is obvious that here the initiative does not at all stem from an imperialist center. This does not mean, by the way, that we are guaranteed against the restoration of vassal relationships, but this possibility does not stem directly from Russia's readiness to go halfway to meet Belorussia, Armenia or Tajikistan. In order to avoid the restoration of an empire, we must show what is unjustified in the integration mechanisms and suggest alternatives, not fight against integration itself as a potential for the Fall. Critics of neoimperialism, however, do not as a rule go beyond the limits of the label. This can also be seen in the use of terms such as "former metropolitan state." Can one speak of Russia this way? If there was a metropolitan state in the USSR, it was by no means Russia, but rather, Moscow within the limits of the MKAD [Moscow Ring Road]. A Ukrainian resident enjoyed no fewer rights in the metropolitan state than did a resident of Saratov or Nezhniy Tagil. In general, the USSR was an organism organized in a very complicated way, in which citizens were divided into a multitude of types according to a whole set of criteria, and the striving to convert the Russians en masse into an "imperial nation," Russia into a metropolitan state, and the 14 other republics into a colony is therefore no more than an ideological cliche. Fit, alas, only for destruction. Thus, I insist that, it is by no means only the motive of bringing back imperial grandeur that is present in the striving toward reintegration, but also the natural motive of ensuring economic prosperity, observance of human rights, cultural self-realization, etc., etc. This striving does not just come from Russia and not just from the Russians. Not being foisted on us from without, and being voluntary, this striving is building a new, integrated world, which will inevitably retain the features of the old centralized state, with its imperial mentality for some time, but will not be blanketed by them. The alternative to this "stained" shadow of past integration, however, will be only disintegration and degradation, which can be alleviated in some cases, but cannot be overcome. Decivilization, which has already assumed unprecedented rates in the expanses of the Soviet Union, is the only real alternative to integration. But did not those who strove to destroy the USSR really do this out of a striving to ensure human rights? A worthy emergence into world civilization? (I am not speaking of those who used anti-Sovietism as an instrument of struggle with Russia -- any Russia, totalitarian or democratic). If these aspirations are sincere, however, just how can one indict Russia for its concern with the rights of the Russian people in the new near abroad? This is its duty, which is inscribed in the obligations of all civilized peoples to ensure adherence to human rights, regardless of race, religion or nationality. Why should concern for the rights of the Estonians (expressed in granting independence to Estonia) run counter to concern for the rights of the Russians (expressed in the striving to acquire citizenship in our own native land)? And why does the use of economic levers seem, a priori, terrible? Were economic sanctions not applied against the USSR, which had violated human rights? Or against Serbia? Or against the UAR? The liberals, who almost go into a coma at the mention of Russian economic sanctions, supported and are supporting sanctions of another type. Why such a double-faced moral? Other things aside, economic levers can be not only negative, but also positive. Both constitute the customary practice of democratic states. It is therefore superficial to reject a certain specific instrument without considering the specific forms of its application. Otherwise, we will be dealing, not with politics, but with hysterics. The possibility of retaining military bases in Tajikistan, Georgia or Moldova inspires us with horror. What will happen, though, if there is no other way to ensure stability and safety? I am not talking about thrusting our bases on them forcibly, but is military intervention in the Tajikistan of which I. Rotar writes, really more forcible in nature than in Somalia? Bosnia? Etc., etc. As for what certain politicians say, they are using the same old cliches, which correspond fully to their troglodytic mentality. Alas, our country has no other politicians or other people, and we should come out of Egypt as we are, in order to step on the soil of Jericho just 40 years later, and if we do not want our Jericho to be a repetition of our Egypt, we must not reject the path through the desert but, stubbornly going toward our goal, should cast our riches upon the fire every day.
