Located by Jinji lake in the eastern part of Suzhou city, the project covers an area of 70 sq km, and is expected to develop into a modern industrial park with modern industries as the main structure, and new- and high-technology as the leading sectors, complemented by service industries and public welfare services. According to an agreement concluded by the two sides, the Suzhou Industrial Park will be developed in three stages. The first stage will focus on building a trunk road linking the park with the downtown area and a 45-ha industrial district. Construction of standardized workshops with a combined floor space of 90,000 sq m, 1,200 apartments and an office block is in full swing in the district, which is scheduled for completion in July next year. In addition, the park is building a special highway linking the city with Shanghai's Hongqiao airport. A number of Singapore companies will support the development of the project, with 65 percent of the shares owned by the Singapore side and the rest by the Chinese side.
