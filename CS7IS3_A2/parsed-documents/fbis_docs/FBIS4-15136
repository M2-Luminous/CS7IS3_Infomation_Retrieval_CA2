FBIS4-15136 "drsov067_t_94005" FBIS-SOV-94-067 Daily Report 6 Apr 1994 BALTIC STATES Estonia Negotiators Give News Conference Negotiators Give News Conference WS0704084194 Tallinn BNS in English 1821 GMT 6 Apr 94 WS0704084194 Tallinn BNS English BFN [Text] Tallinn, Apr 06, BNS -- The Russian delegation at talks with Estonia today announced that Russia won't withdraw troops by Aug. 31, 1994, the Estonian Foreign Ministry says in a statement issued after the ending of the 18th round of negotiations between the two countries in Moscow today. Russia officially withdrew the article in the draft agenda on troop withdrawal that set Aug. 31 as deadline for the pullout. The Estonian Foreign Ministry says that because of Russia's position, the talks by now have fallen back to the situation that existed before last August when Russia first said it will pull out its forces by next Aug. 31. Estonia's chief negotiator Vaino Reinart told reporters that Russia at the latest round of talks had set ultimative demands. Also the statement by the Estonian Foreign Ministry terms the "manner and tone" of the Russian delegation at the past round as ultimative. "This gives proof of the positions of the Russian side having become more rigid," the statement reads. The Aug. 31 deadline was first disputed by Russia's chief negotiator Vasily Svirin at the 17th round of the talks in March, when Svirin said the deadline was "no longer actual." In the latest step, the Russian delegation at the Moscow round on Tuesday [5 April] set a demand for Estonia to change its laws and give all retired Russian military living in the country permanent residence permits, regardless of whether their staying in Estonia in legal or not. Russia also again took up its earlier demand that Estonia must pay 23 million USD to build houses for the repatriated military in Russia. Russian representatives today said their country was ready to withdraw troops if Estonia, as they put it, will resolve the issue of residence permits for the retired military and of ensuring their social security. Both heads of delegations at a press conference today said the parties had failed to reach any "constructive cooperation" at this round of the talks. Russia's Vasily Svirin reminded that not a single draft document under discussion has been initialed during the four latest rounds of the talks. The Estonian Foreign Ministry in its Tuesday's statement pointed out that a number of foreign countries and international bodies, including NATO, the European Union, CSCE, the Nordic prime ministers, and the United States, after the March round of Estonian- Russian talks publicly expressed their support for Estonia and suggested that Russia withdrew its troops by Aug. 31 this year. Reinart said Russia's demands to grant permanent residence permits to all its retired military in Estonia, a step that needs changing Estonian legislation, was in contradiction with resolutions by international organizations that press for a speedy, orderly and unconditional withdrawal of Russian troops from the Baltics. The head of the Estonian delegation explained to BNS that a big number of the retired Russian military in Estonia were quite young and that many of them also had served in the Soviet military intelligence, KGB, or special task force units. Therefore, he said, some of the military pensioners are a jeopardy for Estonia's security. His Russian counterpart quoted data at the press conference that only some 1,600 of the 10,000 retired Russian military in Estonia were under 50 years of age. "The overwhelming majority of them simply want to live their lives to the end peacefully, and we are asking our Estonian partners -- let's provide them the possibility to do this," Svirin said. Both heads of delegations said the countries despite everything had no plans to break off the talks. Reinart told BNS Estonia had taken the issue of breaking off the talks "off from the agenda". The country after the 17th round considered suspending the negotiations or changing the set-up of its delegation. At the same time Reinart added that Estonia continued to deliberate the possibility of calling in mediators. The head of the Russian delegation in his comments said his country was not opposed to the prospect of mediation by a third party, but added that in such a case the talks would no longer be bilateral. The Estonian delegation proposed to convene for the next round of the talks in Tallinn in May, and expressed hope that Russia then would agree to discuss issues that are not in contradiction with Estonian legislation.
