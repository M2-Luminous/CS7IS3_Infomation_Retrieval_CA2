The agreement should be welcomed in every way, since it will help to "civilize" Russian exports and will promote Western capital investment in the Russian economy. This opinion was expressed with typically English restraint by British Prime Minister John Major. A more frank and optimistic assessment of this event was given by FRG President Richard von Weizsaecker. "The spirit of unity which has been established in Europe testifies that the Cold War era will never return," he said. On the whole, the tone of the statements by all the EU representatives was almost wholly positive. Only journalists expressed a certain skepticism. Thus THE LOS ANGELES TIMES, while noting that the agreement will undoubtedly facilitate European capital investment in Russia, which is undergoing a severe economic crisis, at the same time reminds its readers that the document still has to be ratified. Journalists accredited to the EU Council session noted that, despite the significance of all Russia's latest diplomatic steps, much mutual suspicion still remains in the new partners' relationship. Questions on which agreement has not yet been reached include Russian access to the European Investment Bank, the unconditional application of international rules in mutual trade, and the relaxation of visa regulations for Russians in EU countries. And the demand for the removal of restrictions on the activity of five Western banks on Russian Federation territory is hardly going to increase the optimism of Russian financiers. But Britain's THE GUARDIAN notes that the resolution of virtually all international problems will be made easier for the Russian leadership by the fact that the West has staked too much to allow the risk of Russia's returning to isolation. Russia will undoubtedly receive a number of benefits. Almost all Russian and Western observers incline to this conclusion. Above all, there is access to Western markets. But the Russian Federation has secured this access on the same terms as other countries whose economic development and cooperation led to the elaboration of today's market laws. Here a problem arises. The Russian economy urgently needs to reorient itself toward the harsh conditions of competition. Concessions should not be expected here. And observance of the strict norms in the EU's relations with other states in Europe is closely monitored, with a whole arsenal of punitive measures being used against offenders. Will Russia, with its current legislative chaos, be able to be a normal partner for the EU, and observe its own interests as well?
