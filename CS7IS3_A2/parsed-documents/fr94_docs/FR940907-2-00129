FR940907-2-00129 FR940907-2-00091 A body of literature currently exists concerning best practices for information dissemination (see Backer, ``Knowledge: Creation, Diffusion, Utilization,'' Vol. 12, Number 3, March 1991, Sage Publications). Through a model project, this Center will evaluate the effectiveness of these recommended practices and assist researchers to develop strategies they can use to determine the best formats and methods to disseminate their research findings to all appropriate audiences. The proposed center shall support all of the costs associated with the pilot project described below. Proposed Priority A D&U center for the dissemination of disability research shall_ •Identify the format, availability, accessibility (including electronic accessibility), and obstacles to utilization of disability research faced by a wide range of potential target audiences, including, but not limited to, persons with disabilities and their families, advocacy organizations, researchers, policymakers at the local, State and Federal level, journalists, and disability-related service providers; •Identify unique issues of disability research information dissemination that apply to persons from minority backgrounds and develop strategies to address those issues; •Identify and develop dissemination strategies that disability researchers can use to identify all appropriate target audiences, understand the audiences' interests and needs, and disseminate the appropriate information to all target audiences using each audience's preferred information medium; •Identify, develop, and distribute to all NIDRR grantees, technical assistance materials that address format, availability, accessibility, and dissemination strategies in order to assist the grantees to disseminate their research findings as effectively as possible to all appropriate audiences; •Respond to technical questions and requests for technical assistance on dissemination from all NIDRR grantees and provide training to the project directors at their annual meeting; •Develop (within six months after the award), implement (beginning within 12 months after the award), and evaluate (beginning 24 months after the award) a pilot dissemination project that solicits nominations of research results from NIDRR's Rehabilitation Research and Training Center Program grantees, Rehabilitation Engineering Research Center Program grantees, Field-initiated Research Program grantees, and Research and Demonstration Program grantees, selects a wide range of those research products (at least one set of products from each of the programs listed above), and disseminates those findings to all appropriate target audiences using a wide range of formats and media in order to ensure maximum availability, accessibility, and utility; and
