The Twelve will discuss what position to take regarding the safety of Europeans living and working in Algeria, as well as their position on fundamentalist groups resident or active in certain European capitals. The APS Brussels office believes the "Twelve," in today's expected communique, will express support for Algeria's efforts to combat terrorism and find solutions to its serious economic problems, but will demand in exchange a national dialogue on major political and economic reform. A diplomatic source in Brussels yesterday disclosed that Algeria will be urged to open dialogue with all those willing to participate, with all sectors concerned about restoring security in the country and opening the way toward a return to democratization--"even with moderates in the FIS [Islamic Salvation Front], if they have renounced violence and terrorism and accept the ground rules of democracy," according to a source in the Belgian delegation. "We're not giving the Algerian regime a blank endorsement for anything it wants to do; rather it is urgent to get on the path of dialogue with people who do not resort to violence and assassinations, or who have renounced that path," added a source in the French ministerial delegation. A Belgian observer described this stance as "rather positive for Algeria," but cautioned that the Twelve have yet to adopt this common position on the Algerian question. The deteriorating security situation, especially the new strategy of the armed groups--which have begun indiscriminately killing intellectuals, members of the security forces, simple citizens, and now foreigners residing in Algeria--has shocked public opinion in Europe and around the world and made governments of those countries realize the threat to their own societies posed by instability in Algeria. This change in the position of Algeria's European partners is first of all apparent at the political level. While it may be true that Europeans are still unwilling to accept the nullification of Algeria's elections, neither can they accept the killing of innocent people--much less foreigners--as a means to achieving political objectives. The European countries, which to varying degree have been plagued--in some cases still are--by terrorism, have thus condemned terrorist acts committed in Algeria and expressed their "sympathy" for the country. The European Parliament has even endorsed a proposal to forgive the debts the Algerian Government owes to the EEC, debts which total some $6.5 billion. This was a highly symbolic gesture of support to Algeria on the part of the Eurodeputies, but actual implementation must first be approved by EC executive authorities. The Community is said to favor expressing its sympathy for Algeria with cold, hard cash, on the condition that Algerian authorities commit themselves to solving their political problems through a national dialogue and pledge bold economic reforms. The communique expected to be published today by the EC demands, in exchange for greater economic and financial cooperation with Algeria, the opening of a national dialogue, acceleration of economic and political reforms, and launching of negotiations with the international financial institutions. Mr. Willy Claes, Belgium's foreign affairs minister and current president of the Ministerial Council of the Twelve, has clearly described Europe's position on the Algerian situation. "It is obvious that we will support the democratic sectors and a regime that will be opposed to the fundamentalists," he said, maintaining that negotiations on economic and financial questions will resume once "the Algerians express their resolve to move ahead on economic and financial reorientations, which will permit us to move quickly to put exploratory talks, followed by negotiations in the framework of the Euro-Maghrebian dialogue, on the Community agenda." The recent decision of Algerian authorities to negotiate an accord with the IMF--a decision that Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, described as "good news"--appears to Algeria's western partners to be a step in the right direction. The previous, incumbent, and next presidents of the Council of Ministers of the Twelve, i.e., the foreign ministers of Denmark, Belgium, and Greece, will visit Algeria in the coming weeks, APS has announced, although the purpose of the visit has not been disclosed. At all events, it seems Algeria has finally broken through the financial blockade that has constrained it for the last two years.
