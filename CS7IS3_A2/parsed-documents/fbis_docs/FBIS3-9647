He spent his birthday attending a four-hour session of the BSP [Bulgarian Socialist Party] Executive Bureau and having two-hour meetings with Professor Todor Vulchev, Bulgarian National Bank [BNB] governor, and Deputy Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev, and then found time to give an interview to DUMA before setting off to his next working meeting. [Chichkova] Is the BSP leadership worried by the state of the foreign exchange market, and how is it planning to react? [Videnov] We are seriously concerned about the lev's weakness. There are no objective reasons for the market to have passed the barrier of 50 leva to the dollar. The people and business circles have real fears connected with the forthcoming taxation reform, the price rises for energy and postal and communication services, and certain difficulties arising in the foreign debt negotiations. However, all these fears have been deliberately played upon to create a psychosis and to enable dishonest people to reap financial and political dividends. This can only be countered in one way -- by coordinated efforts on the part of the BNB and Council of Ministers, assisted by parliament, to create an atmosphere of security, clarity, and greater confidence in the institutions. [Chichkova] Which circles have exploited the situation? [Videnov] I am certain that the attack on the lev was specially mounted by foreign currency speculators. They have already gained hundreds of millions in profits. The worst thing is that some circles want this situation to continue, not simply to obtain fresh profits, but also to cause hyperinflation. The people who want this are banks that hold considerable amounts of bad debts, holders of large amounts of foreign currency (mostly in foreign bank accounts), and middlemen who have "blocked" the sale of the large state enterprises so that they can buy them for a song. And last but not least, there are political circles in Bulgaria and abroad that for months have been trying to destabilize the country. Everyone knows who they are. [Chichkova] Nevertheless, is there a risk of hyperinflation? [Videnov] Hyperinflation can only be provoked artificially. Neither the budget, the policies of the BNB, and the taxation system, nor the realities of the domestic economy provide preconditions for this. The measures that the Council of Ministers and the BNB should take are well known; I refer to strong foreign exchange controls, collecting the budget revenue to the last stotinka, closely monitoring prices and providing timely compensation for the incomes of the weakest social groups, and adopting a much tougher approach in the foreign debt negotiations. At a series of meetings that I have had these last few days with Ministers Georgi Tanev, Stoyan Aleksandrov, Valentin Karabashev, and Evgeni Matinchev and with BNB Governor Todor Vulchev, I think that we have reached agreement on what measures are needed. [Chichkova] Is a cabinet crisis possible? [Videnov] It can only be caused by factors outside the government, especially by irresponsible domestic and foreign politicians. Some of them want to cover over the traces of their deals in 1992, while others want to make up for their lack of action in 1993. The best thing now is to support the Council of Ministers and the BNB and not allow the sabotage plotted against them to succeed. [Chichkova] What do you think about the insinuations that the country's salvation lies in a new cabinet, and a caretaker cabinet at that? [Videnov] This is utterly ridiculous. The present parliament cannot produce a new government, and it would be a crime to restore the former cabinet. The only other solution is immediate elections, which would take us years back into the past. A caretaker government could only prepare for such elections. Anyone who thinks that this solution can save Bulgaria is an open enemy of the country.
