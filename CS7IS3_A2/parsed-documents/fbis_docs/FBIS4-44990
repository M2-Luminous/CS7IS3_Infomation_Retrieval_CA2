The consolidation of ministries, of which much is being said these days in agricultural circles, was one of the subjects we discussed in our interview with Dr. 'Isa Kalantari, minister of agriculture. In this discussion many issues became clear to us, as economic writers. We did not know that one-third of the ministers in Vietnam's Government deal with agricultural issues. We did not know, for example, that New Zealand, whose agriculture and animal husbandry are famous, has done careful scientific planning to establish a separate ministry for each agricultural field, and after it achieves its goal they dissolve that ministry and then start anew in another field. Fortunately, Dr. Kalantari knows no fatigue, and in speaking with him one can discuss every agricultural subject. Whenever the subject is progress and development, his face is cheerful, and whenever he feels that a danger threatens Iran's agriculture, sadness and sorrow are evident on his face. In this interview we came to the conclusion that if any kind of change or consolidation were done without expert study and research in agriculture, which covers one-third of the nation's economy, it would be a national crime. Iran's farmers had four ministries at one time, at one time they had three, at one time they had two, and at one time they had one, and these baseless changes have transformed Iran from a food exporter to one of the region's main food importers. Below you will read the second part of the interview with Dr. Kalantari. [ABRAR] Mr. Minister! If you are willing, let us digress from the main subject and talk about the consolidation of ministries. As you know, the Majles has approved the consolidation of the Ministry of Industries, the Ministry of Heavy Industries, and the Ministry of Mines and Metals, and it is said that it is also studying consolidation of the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Construction Jihad. What is your view on this? [Kalantari] Well, whatever is "the law" must be implemented. [ABRAR] Yes. There is no doubt about this. However, we are asking you this question not as a minister of agriculture, but as Dr. 'Isa Kalantari, a real person, a man whose studies and executive occupations have had to do with the nation's agriculture for more than a decade. We are asking the Dr. Kalantari who has seen many of the nations that have agricultural industries, and who has close familiarity with the way they work. [Kalantari] Well, we must ask what is the goal of doing this? If the goal is to have one organization responsible for the agricultural sector, we must sit and see what this will accomplish for our agriculture. I say this not as the minister of agriculture, but as someone who at least has the right to express an opinion on this matter, someone with 13 to 14 years experience in agricultural executive work and who has familiarity with the nation's problems, and who knows what our problems are in the agricultural sector. [ABRAR] Yes, in view of the things you mentioned, we wanted to know, what views have you put forward in the meetings to make decisions on this important matter. [Kalantari] Not in this matter, but even in the matter of food industries, which you mentioned previously, we are mostly observers. They do not even ask us in what part of the country a certain food industry should be located. For example, it is possible that they will give an agreement in principle in a certain region to a food industry that is not a part of our system of cultivation at all. [ABRAR] Do you mean that these kinds of decisions are made without even coordinating it with you? [Kalantari] Yes, these decisions are made without coordination with us. [ABRAR] In view of the close similarity of the work of the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Construction Jihad, in your view what organizations from your ministry should be attached to the Ministry of the Construction Jihad, and which ones from the Ministry of the Construction Jihad should be added to your ministry? [Kalantari] I do not see many organizations that should be removed from these two ministries. The development of food industries should have a role in both of these ministries. [ABRAR] Is the development of food industries now under the mantle of the Ministry of Industries? [Kalantari] Yes. I am not saying that we should be in charge of the executive activity, but views must ultimately be given. Of course, in general the goals must be to improve the agricultural situation. This executive officer or that executive officer is not personally important to me. [ABRAR] Is there no communication among the ministries? For example, in the production of agricultural machinery, aren't "needs" taken into account, with production done on the basis of needs? [Kalantari] Sometimes needs are taken into account and sometimes they are not. [ABRAR] Meaning that these communications are not maintained constantly between the ministries? [Kalantari] These communications are very little. When they wish to do so, they establish them, when they do not wish to do so, they do not. [ABRAR] How necessary are these communications? [Kalantari] They are absolutely necessary! [ABRAR] Is this discussed in the Council of Ministers as a problem? [Kalantari] Of course, it has been discussed, and it was decided that a review would be done of the government organizations. [ABRAR] What is your personal opinion about the consolidation of the two ministries? [Kalantari] In my personal view, not only would this consolidation be of no benefit to the country, but as a solution to several small problems, it will create larger problems. In the area of production, we are now nearing the leaps we desire to make. We are preparing infrastructure. We will suddenly be faced with a huge expansion with which we will be absolutely unable to deal. I think that if one ministry comes into existence, the official in charge of it will not have the ability to think, nor will he have the ability to monitor the situation. This is a greater task than you think. [ABRAR] Especially when in agricultural matters producers are absolutely affiliated with the government, they are absolutely supported by the government. [Kalantari] This is really the main problem. If our agricultural producers were like the industrial producer where there is overall management, they would all be literate and their producing units would be big. In this case we would not have subsidies where the government would have to intervene. [ABRAR] At a time when our country needs to do more to improve its agricultural lands, we hear officials saying that billions of tumans worth of the nation's pastures, soil and forests are on the verge of destruction. For example, they say that 64 percent of the nation's soil resources remain unused. What is the government doing? Why don't you do something? [Kalantari] In view of the nature of our country, natural resources must be a separate matter. There should be a separate ministry for that. I believe that if we want to preserve our water and soil, for the next 30 to 40 years we must rebuild our natural resources in a mobilized and revolutionary way. [ABRAR] By mobilized and revolutionary, do you mean outside administrative limits? [Kalantari] Yes, outside the administrative bureaucracy. That is, all the nation's resources, when idle, should be mobilized to preserve natural resources. I mean all forces, even military forces in peacetime. Even during summer vacations, students should be used for this national mobilization, which is very vital. [ABRAR] Have you presented this idea anywhere? [Kalantari] It has been presented again and again, but we have yet to reach a conclusion. What I am saying is that to improve the agricultural situation the two existing ministries are not enough. [ABRAR] You are now emphasizing work on natural resources. Will a transfer of activity, such as transferring from the Ministry of the Construction Jihad to the Ministry of Agriculture, be useful for accomplishing this? [Kalantari] Of course it depends on what decision is made. Transferring will not help at all. For example, it will make no difference to transfer activity from the Ministry of the Construction Jihad to the Ministry of Agriculture. The issue is that more attention should be given to natural resources. The ability to work must be increased. [ABRAR] Other than natural resources, what other areas need more attention? [Kalantari] The next problem is rural development. [ABRAR] In view of these problems, in view of the fact that there are 60,000 rural areas in the country, don't you think that if the Ministry of the Construction Jihad were closer it would be more useful to the Ministry of Agriculture? [Kalantari] No, this still needs work. Rural development must be done. [ABRAR] Rural development is being done now. Is there mutual cooperation? [Kalantari] Perhaps there is not a lot of need for cooperation. An executive officer can work on it, but there are few resources and little attention. More attention must be given to the nation's rural development, water and soil. This is a vast task. I really don't know, in view of the vastness of the task, what those people who want to have one ministry in the agricultural sector are thinking about. [ABRAR] I think this idea is in its early stages. It is still at the level of murmurs, talk, and study. [Kalantari] No, a special commission has also been formed. However, this is a dangerous decision. It is a decision that will definitely bring our problems up to 100, yet the benefits probably won't even come to 10. [ABRAR] Apparently they are considering manpower adjustment and reducing costs. They are thinking of reducing the number of buildings and other things... [Kalantari] You have put your finger on an interesting point. Those who favor consolidation are thinking for example that if two ministries become one, there will be seven or eight fewer deputy ministers, 30 to 40 fewer general managers and five to six fewer consultants. [ABRAR] Yes, it is just so. There will be reductions here. [Kalantari] Yes, there might be a total of 200 fewer people. On the other hand, what would be lost? The respected Majles deputies and other officials who will be deciding must consider what return we will get for the country on an tuman we invest in these circumstances, and what will the return be under the new conditions? We employ thousands of people in the agricultural sector. We must also meet our needs in the training, research, infrastructure, and other sectors. Definitely, if we want to have an active agricultural sector, we will not reduce manpower, we will increase it. These increases will take place in the specialist sectors, for our agriculture must necessarily move in that direction. Apart from that, if manpower is reduced by 200 people, they will be employed elsewhere. [ABRAR] What about the administrative buildings? Won't we save in this area? [Kalantari] It is even possible that 10 to 15 buildings will be added, with a possible value of 2 billion or 10 billion tumans, but what will we be losing? The losses will be in the hundreds of billions of tumans. Economic, social, and scientific accounting, writing and adding and subtraction must be done, and then a decision must be made. Of course, whatever decision the respected Majles makes will be implemented. However, I think that neither now nor in the next 10 to 20 years should we be thinking of reducing the size of the organizations in the agricultural sector. Ultimately, we will have to expand it. Agriculture has a role in one-third of the nation's economy. We must give more attention, much, much more attention to it. [ABRAR] There have been many changes in the administration of the agricultural sector in our country. Sometimes these changes have been damaging. During one period the agricultural sector had four ministries (the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Agriculture and Consumer Materials, the Ministry of Natural Resources, and the Ministry of Cooperatives and Rural Affairs); it had three during one period (the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Natural Resources, and the Ministry of Cooperatives and Rural Affairs); during one period it had two ministries (the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources and the Ministry of Cooperatives and Rural Affairs); and during one period it had one ministry (the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development). Several years after the revolution responsibilities were divided with the establishment of the Ministry of the Construction Jihad, and now that the responsibilities have been divided, and now that after several years these two ministries have become established, they are thinking of change again. The question, though, is won't our agriculture be damaged by all this change? In your view, as a person who is educated and is a specialist in this field and who has worked in the agricultural sector for 12 to 13 years in various capacities, does our agricultural sector need several ministries? I have heard that in some some countries they have four or five active ministries in the agricultural sector. There is even a country like New Zealand, which creates a ministry in a specific field such as fisheries for 20 to 25 years, and then converts this ministry to function under another ministry (agriculture) after activating that field, and they establish another ministry in another field. [Kalantari] I think our agriculture needs more than two ministries. I think there should now be one organization responsible for rural development, another responsible for the nation's natural resources, and another responsible for the nation's agriculture. This need will exist for our country for the next 20 to 30 years.
