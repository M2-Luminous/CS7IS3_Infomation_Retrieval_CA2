Sethuram: "Will India Gain From GATT?"] [Text] At last, a new world trading system is emerging from the tortuous negotiations spread over seven years which could have been short-circuited had a deal on farm subsidies been struck by USA and the European Community at the ministerial meeting in December 1990. That collapse was followed by the comprehensive Draft Final Act (DFA) popularly known as "Dunkel Draft" to which India had been the bitterest opponent among developing countries. The positive conclusion of the Uruguay Round on December 15 is undoubtedly a major milestone for the global which now enters an era of greater and fierce competition for markets by both developed and developing countries. Most of the world barring former Soviet Union and China, which are yet to be formally admitted to GATT will be bound by the new rules and disciplines governing international trade. Who will gain more and who will lose out in the bargain will depend more on each country's outward-orientation, its productive efficiency, and competitive strength. To the extent that India measures up to these standards, it should stand to benefit, if not in the short-run, at least over the longer term. India had from the beginning taken a clearcut stand that its hopes are bound up with only a multilateral trading system with transparent rules and non-discriminatory treatment. This does not mean that protectionist barriers raised over the last decade by the major industrialised nations are going to be instantly lowered. Nor would the global accord in any way diminish the ardour of nations seeking regional fortresses. For India, which is not in any of the trading blocs, the single market of Europe or NAFTA, which comes into existence on January 1, 1994, multilateralism provides the best insurance against marginalisation, especially given its already low share of world exports at around 0.60 per cent. Developing countries could have got a better deal in the Uruguay Round had there been effective coordination among themselves through the long period of negotiations. The South-South cooperation was not brought into sharp focus while it has been ritualistically emphasised at meetings of G-15 or other forums of developing countries. India's main concerns with the Dunkel Draft were in respect of intellectual property protection, textiles, agriculture and services. It become difficult to get any revision of the Dunkel text in regard to Trade-Related Intellectual Property Right (TRIPS) when all developed nations as well as a large number of development countries themselves had gone with the kind of intellectual property protection regime provided for. Of course, there is a ten-year transition period before India would have to fall in line with the new regime. In textiles, developing countries seem by and large satisfied with the phasing out of the multifibre agreement though the maximum liberalisation would materialise only in the latter half of the ten-year period from January 1, 1995. India has been assured by its major trading partners and GATT Director General Peter Sutherland that the Dunkel Draft would not affect present level of subsidies to agriculture or the food security system through public distribution or use of seeds by farmers. In services, it is not clear whether India's interests (labour migration) have been embodied in the final document. Overall from India's point of view the outcome of the Uruguay Round should be regarded more positive than negative. Until India becomes internationally competitive, there is the risk of its market being more open and being flooded with cheaper imports. The only safeguard against this would be an effective anti-dumping legislation. Also India is entitled to retain some non-tariff barriers so long as its balance of payments situation continues to remain difficult. While the East Asian economies owe their dramatic success to exports of manufactures--an area where India could do equally well now that the economy has been liberated to a considerable extent--India can also become a significant exporter of agricultural commodities without domestic injury as the country is capable of producing surpluses, especially in superior varieties of rice and commercial crops. The Uruguay Round had largely been played out as a big power game and the developing countries, more than 45 of which had started reforming their economies were watching helplessly. They fell so frustrated that any deal would have been welcome for them. It is in this situation that India could achieve little in what started as the most ambitious and comprehensive trade negotiations in 1986. A strengthening GATT with safeguards mechanism and trade dispute settlement machinery can be expected to monitor the observance of the new rules and disciplines more effectively.
