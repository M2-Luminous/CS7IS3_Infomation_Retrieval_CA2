According to a CERIGUA report, Francisco Villagran, member of the URNG's political-diplomatic commission, said: Gen. Enriquez is failing to comply with the signed agreements by warning that any guerrilla leader who comes into the country will be immediately arrested and prosecuted. Enriquez made this statement on 18 April as he commented on the possibility that guerrilla leaders may come to Guatemala to participate in the second peace and democracy meeting, to be held in late April. Villagran said that the minister's statements are also a threat, because the URNG is interested in working with the civilian sectors, especially because its proposals will be taken into account when reaching an agreement at the negotiating table. The guerrillas believe that the government and the Army, instead of implementing the recently signed agreements, are conducting an active campaign of disinformation on the agreements' contents. In addition, the guerrillas reported that there is a destabilization plan aimed at hindering the negotiation process. The guerrillas also demanded the government comply with the Human Rights General Agreement strictly and without any delays and harshly punish those who try to destabilize the situation.
