According to available information, leaders of the Tajik opposition have ordered the fighters of the so called Kumsangirsko-Pyanj and Kulyab fronts to conduct a series of subversive acts against the frontier detachments of the Pyanj and Moskovskiy frontier detachments and against the civilian population living in Tajikistan's Khatlon Region. Leaders of drug and mafia circles have made two attempts to block the military cantonment of the frontier detachment and one of the detachment's posts on the territory of Gorno-Badakhshan since 18 June. According to the press bureau, the command and leadership of the Russian frontier forces in Tajikistan are undertaking all appropriate measures to guard and defend the border.
