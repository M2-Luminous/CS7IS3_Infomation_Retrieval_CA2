About 600 villages in the suburban areas have become better-off ahead of time. They also have made great achievements in science and technology, education, culture, and in health care. Meanwhile, township enterprises are mushrooming in the suburban areas. The city now has 30,800 township firms, employing 885,700 workers. The rural industrial output value accounts for 36 percent of the city's total. Also, economic development zones at all levels have taken initial shape, and more than 100 projects in the zones have gone into operation. The latest figures show that the overall rural industrial output value of the zones accounts for 36 percent of the city's total. Some 14 township enterprises engaged in metallurgy, machinery, chemicals and textiles have achieved a total annual output value exceeding one billion yuan each. As rural industrialization progresses farmers have begun to turn their eyes from solely production to the market. Large numbers of business and trading companies which combine production and sales have been set up in the rural areas. Each year the suburban counties provide the city with more than two billion kg of fresh vegetables. In addition, some of them have become processing centers for non-staple foodstuffs. So far, Tianjin has built 44 satellite towns with all the necessary utilities and modern multifunctional buildings. The majority of the suburban towns and villages have schools, hospitals, nurseries and entertainment centers. In Tianjin all the villages have electricity and running water. In the rural areas about 95 percent of the farmers enjoy social welfare. The average per capita living space has reached nearly 18 sq m, and most farmers live in two-story houses. Meanwhile, since the rural areas provide abundant labor and raw material resources, about 80 percent of the city's garment factories and several auto parts companies have been set up in the suburban areas.
