[Pangalos] I would start somewhere else: Let's correct as much as we can, because we have responsibilities. From there on, I share the common Greek view and the anger over the unjust and unjustified attacks. Attacks against the country affect me more than attacks against myself. I can endure personal attacks. [Panayiotarea] What can we correct? We always appear with our hand extended.... [Pangalos] The country's economy. Depend less on EC loans. I don't mean the funds to which we have a right and I reject the view that we get a lot of money from the EC. We receive a lot because this is what the computer allocates. No one within the Community makes gifts. In the future we must avoid EC loans so that we may start a procedure that will improve the public debt, budget deficit, and inflation. [Panayiotarea] Do the reports represent EC views about Greece? [Pangalos] They are malicious. [Panayiotarea] Do they have a particular direction? [Pangalos] I don't know. They are malicious and don't represent reality. Our problem is economic, not international relations.... [Panayiotarea] This means we cannot raise our voice and at the same time plead for a loan. Isn't that it, Minister? [Pangalos] If I know that in a day or two I must ask the same people I confront today, either newspaper owners or governments, to support me economically because I cannot do it myself, then inevitably I have a weakness.... [Panayiotarea] Is Skopje another issue on which we "inevitably" have a "weakness?" [Pangalos] We handled Skopje very poorly, unskillfully. We have gone backward. We were led to a deadlock. We must get out of it. The government made a reasonable proposal: Skopje must stop behaving in a provocative, expansionist, and irredeemable manner. It must abandon its flag, which declares a war against Greece by implying territorial pursuits. We will mutually guarantee border inviolability and permanency. Skopje must change that part of its Constitution that sets out as a goal the freeing of...supposed Macedonians. [Panayiotarea] What if your reasonable proposal is not accepted? Will we be led to...unreasonableness? [Pangalos] We have spoken. There is no need to run around talking continuously, because it shows nervousness in our diplomatic relations. It reveals insecurity, something that is not my style. I have mentioned Skopje. [Panayiotarea] Do you know that by saying Bosnia-Herzegovina, not Skopje, is a priority for you has created a painful impression? [Pangalos] ...But we cannot do anything we want in the Presidency. We do what the Community wants. Every Greek must realize that. The Presidency's role is not to turn the 12 states into a great Greece. We have made a proposal. Let Skopje react. Let's be patient. One of the Greek's greatest faults is that he finds it impossible to wait. We honk our horns continuously even before the green light comes on. Let's wait for the green light. This is enough on Skopje. I want to say nothing else. You keep asking: "What are we going to do next?" "Are we going to start a dialogue?" My answer is: "I do not know. When it happens, we will see." [Panayiotarea] ...and if it does not happen? [Pangalos] Obviously the atmosphere will change for the better if it happens. If it does not, there is a great chance that the climate will worsen. I can say that now. This is the message Skopje receives. I have nothing else to say. [Panayiotarea] Are we ready? [Pangalos] I will answer nothing else. Excuse me for being so absolute, but this discussion must close. You must stop asking questions on these issues. We must maintain our position to appear serious and constant. If you read about Skopje, you will see that every two weeks the Greeks made a counterproposal that contradicted the previous one. How can our partners or the Skopjeans respect us.... [passage omitted] [Panayiotarea] What are you going to do with the white paper when average unemployment is 13 percent and the 17 million unemployed in Europe are panicking? [Pangalos] This is the main issue. The decisions of the latest summit include these proposals. [Panayiotarea] But it is a general framework.... [Pangalos] We will implement the specific Commission proposals to secure the necessary concessions.... [Panayiotarea] Some European reports say EC expansion with new members will be delayed because of the Greek Presidency. [Pangalos] We have no reason not to support the participation of new countries. I will remind you that the Greek resistance was united with these countries in brotherly relations during the dictatorship. They were the only ones to support us. In any case, the effort toward 1 March [when Community expansion will be discussed] is superhuman. There will be difficulties because the internal common view in some member states is rejectionist. Anytime a new member is accepted, there is an opportunity to settle the various relations on a new basis. These are issues that we will handle in the best possible way. But we can impose no decisions on anyone. [Panayiotarea] ...What about Cyprus? [Pangalos] It is an additional, national reason for which we want the expansion. Cyprus and Malta are small countries that will cause the Community no economic problem. Cyprus will even finance the Community from its budget. [passage omitted]
