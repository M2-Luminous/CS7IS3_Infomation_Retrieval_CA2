The ministry has invited over 40 local officials whose villages and townships rank among the best in construction and development to attend a meeting held in Beijing, asking for their opinions and suggestions in the field. China has a total of 3.75 million villages and 37,000 townships. The Chinese Government attaches great importance to their construction and modernization in the current reform and economic development drive. In recent years the country has seen large numbers of modern towns with good layout, environment, and industrial and commercial strengths emerge in rural areas. Construction Minister Hou Jie and Deputy Construction Minister Mao Rubai have issued letters of appointment to the 25 consultants. Hou said the booming rural economy has promoted the development of township construction. While talking with some village and township heads, Hou found that many of them have rich experience in local development. The 25 consultants were selected as representatives from developed areas in the east, south and coastal regions, and from underdeveloped areas of the west, north and central parts of the country.
