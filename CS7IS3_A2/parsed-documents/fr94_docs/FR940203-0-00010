FR940203-0-00010 FR940203-0-00003 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;04&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;8809; AD 94&hyph;03&hyph;03] Airworthiness Directives; Lockheed Model 382, 382B, 382E, 382F, and 382G Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule; request for comments. SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Lockheed Model 382, 382B, 382E, 382F, and 382G series airplanes. This action requires inspections to detect loose, missing, or deformed fasteners in the upper truss mounts of certain engines, inspections to detect cracking in the associated tangs, and replacement of damaged parts with new or serviceable parts. This amendment is prompted by a report of fatigue cracking of the upper tang of the truss mounts. The actions specified in this AD are intended to prevent multiple failures of the upper truss mounts due to the problems associated with fatigue cracking, which could adversely affect the integrity of the engine mount structure. DATES: Effective February 18, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of February 18, 1994. Comments for inclusion in the Rules Docket must be received on or before April 4, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;04&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Lockheed Western Export Company (LWEC), Zone 0755, 86 South Cobb Drive, Marietta, Georgia 30063&hyph;0755. This information may be examined at the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington; or at the FAA, Small Airplane Directorate, Atlanta Aircraft Certification Office, suite 210C, 1669 Phoenix Parkway, Atlanta, Georgia; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Thomas Peters, Aerospace Engineer, Flight Test Branch, ACE&hyph;160A, FAA, Small Airplane Directorate, Atlanta Aircraft Certification Office, suite 210C, 1669 Phoenix Parkway, Atlanta, Georgia 30349; telephone (404) 991&hyph;3915; fax (404) 991&hyph;3606. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Recently, the operator of Lockheed Model C&hyph;130 (military) series airplanes reported that, during routine maintenance inspections, the truss mounts on the upper tangs on the outboard engines of several airplanes were found to be cracked. These airplanes had accumulated between 9,000 and 14,000 total hours time-in-service. Since these military airplanes are typically subjected to more rigorous flight operations (such as low level penetration, air drop, and soft landings during training missions) than their civilian aircraft counterparts, the fatigue life of the components on these military airplanes are affected more adversely. These findings of cracking, which have been attributed to fatigue, were found in the upper attach fittings between the engine truss mounts and the front wing spars. This cracking occurred in the tangs that penetrate the front wing spars and progressed to the point of overload failure. Similar cracking was also found on a civilian Model 382G series airplane that had accumulated approximately 23,000 total hours time-in-service. Complete fracture of a single upper truss mount would not adversely affect the fail-safe structure of the airplane; however, the effect on the fatigue life of the remaining upper truss mount is unknown at this time. Additional failures of the upper truss mount, if not corrected, could adversely affect the integrity of the engine mount structure. The engine mountings on the military Model C&hyph;130 and the civilian Model 382G series airplanes are identical in design to the mountings on civilian Model 382, 382B, 382E, and 382F series airplanes on which the outer wings have been replaced in accordance with Manufacturing End Product (MEP) 12R/13R or MEP 9T/10T. Although cracking has not been found on these specific civilian airplanes, the FAA has determined that those airplanes could be subject to the same type of fatigue cracking in the subject engine mounts that was found in the military airplanes and in the civilian Model 382G series airplane. Additionally, although cracking has been detected only on the engine mounts of the number one engine, the FAA has determined that fatigue could similarly stress the engine mountings of both outboard (number one and number four) engines, and that consequent fatigue cracking is likely to occur on the mountings of both engines. The FAA has reviewed and approved Lockheed Alert Service Bulletin A382&hyph;71&hyph;19&hyph;A82&hyph;687, dated December 23, 1993, that describes procedures for inspections to detect loose, missing, or deformed fasteners, and cracking of the upper tangs of the truss mounts on the outboard engines. Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other Lockheed Model 382, 382B, 382E, 382F, and 382G series airplanes of the same type design, this AD is being issued to prevent multiple failures of the upper truss mounts, which could adversely affect the integrity of the engine mount structure. This AD requires repetitive general visual inspections to detect loose, missing, or deformed fasteners on the inboard and outboard upper truss mounts of the number one and number four (left and right outboard) engines, and repetitive general visual inspections to detect cracking in the upper tangs of the truss mounts of these engines. The actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with the alert service bulletin described previously. This AD also requires replacement of loose, missing, or deformed fasteners with new or serviceable fasteners, and replacement of cracked truss mount upper tangs with new or serviceable tangs. This is considered to be interim action until final action is identified, at which time the FAA may consider further rulemaking. Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective in less than 30 days. Comments Invited Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption `` ADDRESSES .'' All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would be needed. Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket. Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94&hyph;NM&hyph;04&hyph;AD.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct an unsafe condition in aircraft, and is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption `` ADDRESSES .''
