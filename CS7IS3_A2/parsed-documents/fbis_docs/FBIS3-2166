At a joint press conference with visiting Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk, Clinton said the new relationship between the two countries would make a better future for the people of both nations. Kravchuk, who has signed a number of accords on economic and trade cooperation with the U.S., said today marked a "historic moment" in friendly relations between Washington and Kiev. Clinton praised Kiev's endorsement of the U.S.-Russian-Ukrainian accord signed last January on getting rid of the 1,800 nuclear warheads on Ukrainian soil as well as the first strategic arms reduction treaty. The U.S. President also expressed the hope that the Ukrainian parliament would eventually approve the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. He welcomed Ukraine's commitment to comprehensive market reforms as well as Kiev's agreement to join NATO's Partnership for Peace Program last month. Kravchuk, whose country is now experiencing an economic crisis, brought an entourage of high-ranking officials including the ministers for foreign affairs, defense, economics on the current official visit. At the core of the talks between the two leaders were economic matters, which apparently is the main purpose of Kravchuk's visit. Clinton also promised today to press for economic aid from other Western countries and lending agencies to Ukraine. Besides meeting with U.S. officials, Kravchuk will also be seeing officials from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank on outside economic assistance. Kravchuk leaves for New York Saturday for a meeting with U.N. Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali and to attend the opening of Ukraine's general consulate.
