FR941227-2-00043 FR941227-2-00036 [Docket No. CP95&hyph;121&hyph;000] Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co.; Notice of Application December 20, 1994. Take notice that on December 16, 1994, Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company (Tennessee), P.O. Box 2511, Houston, Texas, 77252&hyph;2511, filed in Docket No CP95&hyph;121&hyph;000 an abbreviated application pursuant to Section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act, as amended, and Sections 157.7 and 157.18 of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (Commission) regulations thereunder, for permission to abandon two compressor units and appurtenant facilities located in Chautaugua County, New York, by sale to Hanover Compressors (Hanover), all as more fully set forth in the application which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. Tennessee proposes to abandon two 500 horsepower units and appurtenant facilities. Tennessee advises that it acquired the compressor units on January 1, 1992, under Tennessee's blanket certificate authorization granted in CP82&hyph;413. Tennessee states that the producer at this facility, Belden & Blake, has advised Tennesee that it plans to install its own compression, thus obviating the need for Tennessee's compressors altogether. Tennessee indicates that it no longer has any gas purchase obligations behind these facilities and that the proposed abandonment would not result in the loss of gas service to any existing transportation customer. Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before January 10, 1995, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC, 20426, a petition to intervene or a protest in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211) and the regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party to the proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a petition to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules. Take further notice that, pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to the jurisdiction conferred upon the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by Sections 7 and 15 of the Natural Gas Act and the Commission's Rules of Practice and procedure a hearing will be held without further notice before filed within the time required herein, and if the Commission on its own review of the matter finds that the abandonment is required by the public convenience and necessity. If a petition for leave to intervene is timely filed, or if the Commission on its own motion believes that a formal hearing is required, further notice of such hearing will be duly given. Under the procedure herein provide for, unless otherwise advised, it will be unnecessary for Tennessee to appear or be represented at the hearing. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
