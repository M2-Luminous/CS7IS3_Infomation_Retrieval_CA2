FR940707-2-00142 FR940707-2-00068 National Park Service Notice of Intent to Repatriate a Cultural Item in the Possession of the Anchorage Museum of History and Art, Anchorage, Alaska AGENCY: National Park Service, Interior ACTION: Notice. Notice is hereby given under the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990 of the intent to repatriate a cultural item in the possession of the Anchorage Museum of History and Art that meets the definition of ``object of cultural patrimony'' under Section 2 of the act. The item consists of a headdress in the form of a wolf's head, with a wicker frame, calico lining, red trade cloth tongue, and cape with ermine skins. The headdress was purchased by the Museum in 1983 from Boyd Didrickson and is designated accession number 83.134 in the Museum records. Evidence provided by the Yanyeidi Clan of the Taku Tlingit confirms that the headdress is of ongoing historical, traditional, and cultural importance to the clan, and that at the time the headdress was separated from the Yanyeidi Clan of the Taku Tlingit, no individual clan member was considered to have the right to convey it to a non-clan member without clan consent. The Douglas Indian Association, an association recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians, has petitioned for the repatriation of the headdress on behalf of the Yanyeidi Clan of the Taku Tlingit. Representatives of the Douglas Indian Association, the Yanyeidi Clan of the Taku Tlingit, and the Museum have determined pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2) that there is a relationship of shared group identity which can be reasonably traced between the headdress, the Douglas Indian Association, and the Yanyeidi Clan of the Taku Tlingit. The Museum has agreed to repatriate the headdress. Representatives of any other Indian tribe or Alaska Native village or corporation that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with this item should contact Patricia B. Wolf, Museum Director, Anchorage Museum of History and Art, 121 W. 7th Avenue, Anchorage, Alaska 99501, (907) 343&hyph;4326, before [ thirty days following publication of this notice ]. Repatriation of the item to the Douglas Indian Association, on behalf of the Yanyeidi Clan of the Taku Tlingit, may begin after that date if no additional claimants come forward. Dated: June 30, 1994 C. Timothy McKeown, Acting Departmental Consulting Archeologist Acting Chief, Archeological Assistance Division.
