Addressing a news conference on Wednesday, he reported that a total of 141 drug cases were being investigated at the moment, as compared with 993 drug-related crimes registered in 1992 and 2,183 crimes registered last year. The interior officer listed Ukraine and Asian regions as the main transshipment points on the way of drugs to Moscow. Non-traditional types of narcotics are smuggled from Latin America, while Germany supplies crack and heroin. One gram of quality hashish trades for 100,000 roubles on the black market, the same as one glass of dried poppy, one gram of heroin costs 150 U.S. dollars. High prices force drug-addicts to commit grave crimes in order to pay for dope. Khayretdinov stressed the need for setting up a centre to fight drug-trafficking, with the participation of experts in different fields. The first step in this direction has already been taken: an orphanage for children addicted to drugs is now functioning in Moscow's Cheremushki district. Another orphanage is to be opened in the south-eastern municipal district.
