"On Monday [23 May] we will sign a coalition agreement with the Democratic Left Party (SDL), the Social Democratic Party in Slovakia (SDSS), and the Farmers' Movement," Pokorny announced. Under the coalition agreement, the order of candidates on the list of candidates is to ensure the SZS six deputies' seats (in the 150-seat Slovak parliament), provided the coalition acquires the expected 15 per cent of vote. The SZS will propose a total of 34 candidates. The agreement will enable the SZS to create its own deputies' group in parliament, to promote their program, and veto stances of the coalition, Pokorny said. He said that if his party entered the elections separately and received five per cent of votes, it could gain seven parliamentary seats. But it may fail to enter parliament if not part of the coalition. Pokorny said that three former SZS members, who would have preferred a SZS coalition with the opposition Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), were founding the Slovak Green Party, adding he believed that this step aimed to weaken the SZS before the elections. However, the SZS coalition with the left-wing forces has annoyed only a few individuals of the 1,500-2,000 members of the party. Pokorny informed journalists that the SZS intended to establish a foundation to finance the conversion of the unfinished nuclear power station in Mochovce, west Slovakia, to vapor- and gas power.
