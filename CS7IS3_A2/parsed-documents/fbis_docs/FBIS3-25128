The minister who was addressing a "forum" organized on the Congolese television, said the return of peace in the residential districts of Brazzaville is a precondition for holding these by-elections stipulated by the international arbitral college. The by-elections will be held in nine constituencies where election results were canceled by the arbitral college. The college reviewed 58 petitions for annulment submitted by parties of the presidential group and the opposition after the early elections held last May and October. Two out of the nine affected constituencies are in Brazzaville, one in Pointe Noire and the remaining in the country's northern regions. The outcome of the by-elections should not compromise the majority position held by the presidential group at the national assembly. The presidential group won 64 out of the 125 parliamentary seats. In a statement on national television on 6 February, Mr. Mberi, who is a minister of state, expressed satisfaction with the "cease- fire agreement" concluded on 31 January by parliamentarians from the country's four southern regions.
