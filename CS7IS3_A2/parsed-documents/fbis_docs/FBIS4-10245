The coalition triumph, which the polls had predicted, surpassed estimates because according to the first unofficial poll it reached between 30-35 percent, according to several sources. The Justicialist Party (Peronist) dropped in Buenos Aires to a distant second with between 25-30 percent, and the UCR dropped to between 14-15 percent. Carlos Alvarez, Great Front candidate for the federal capital, said that residents "voted for ethics and to warn the government that it cannot protect those responsible for corruption." The vote for punishment for Peronism and for the UCR is, according to Alvarez, "a reflection of the people's weariness and moral fatigue and who tell the government `enough.'" In the rest of the country the victory went to Peronism, with more than 40 percent, according to polls, while the UCR was second. [Hamburg DPA in Spanish at 2201 on 10 April reports from Buenos Aires that the Argentine elections "ended this afternoon normally."
