Lobskiy: "Admiral I. Kasatonov: `I Side With These People and I Am Ready To Defend Their Interests'"] [Text] A group of officers from the Navy's Joint Chiefs of Staff headed by Admiral Igor Kasatonov, deputy commander of the Russian Navy, has paid a three-day visit to the Baltic Sea Fleet. The inspection was aimed at organizing combat, tactical, and command training for the new year, as well as to examine issues connected with the withdrawal of fleet units from the Baltic states. Summarizing the results of the inspection, Adm. Kasatonov emphasized that the Baltic Sea Fleet positively distinguishes itself among other Russian fleets. The final grade received by the fleet -- "good." Nevertheless, Igor Vladimirovich [Kasatonov] devoted the main part of his speech to an analysis of shortcomings and oversights. After all, as one of the officers pointed out, "Kasatonov would not be Kasatonov if he were less adamant." In the opinion of the admiral, there are many shortcomings in the organization of command, the headquarters' performance in the development of naval combat tactics is poor, many officers are not sufficiently acquainted with documents regulating their responsibilities, and the work at headquarters is improperly organized. However, I dare say that the most important part of the inspection on the Baltic Sea Fleet was Kasatonov's visit to the city of Liepaja, where he met with Latvian Navy Commander G. Zeibots. In the course of the meeting, they discussed issues connected with the transfer of Russian Navy facilities to the Lithuanian side. According to Zeibots, the Lithuanians feel resentment toward Russian servicemen who, in his opinion, do not properly prepare the facilities for the transfer, which makes it impossible to use these facilities. As an example, he cited a building in Bolderaja, a suburb of Riga, which had been handed over to Latvia half ruined. Yet, the Russian side refuted such accusations. Providing two Liepaja military schools as an example, they proved that facilities are transferred in suitable conditions, however, following the transfer, they are left completely unprotected which leads to pilferage. G. Zeibots admitted that such complications really exist, but, he believes that the main problem is the lack of appropriate transfer procedures. Also discussed at the meeting was the possibility of Russia's using the Liepaja and Riga ship repair yards. The commander of Latvian Navy requested that Adm. Kasatonov sell two signal cannons which are essential for Latvia to conduct protocol ceremonies. According to the former's words, although this issue has already been discussed for more than two years, it has not been resolved. Assessing the results of the meeting, G. Zeibots noted that in general it was conducted in a business-like, constructive atmosphere. He also emphasized that the complex problems, which appear in connection with the withdrawal of Russian troops from Latvia, are solved more constructively in cooperation with the Russian Navy leadership than the Command of the Army. The same day, Adm. Igor Kasatonov met with Liepaja administration representatives. Imant Vismins, head of the administration, requested the Russian Navy Command complete the pullback of naval units from Liepaja by 10 May 1994. In his opinion, this is necessary to stabilize the political situation in the city on the eve of municipal elections scheduled for the end of May. Admiral Kasatonov stated that the deadlines for the withdrawal are defined by a special timetable, which takes into account the capabilities of the railroad system, accessibility of new facilities for moving troops, and coordination of timetables for the withdrawal of Russian troops from other Baltic republics, Germany, and Poland. He also emphasized that the Russian Navy Command may fulfill the request of the Liepaja Administration, if the necessity of doing this is convincibly motivated and the rights of the Russian-speaking population are guaranteed and protected. Leaders of the trade union committees of the Liepaja Naval Brigade and representatives of veteran organizations who participated in the meeting recalled facts testifying that civilian personnel of Russian military units are discriminated against in terms of housing and certain other issues. "I entirely side with these people," stated Igor Kasatonov adamantly, "and I am ready to defend their interests." According to Vismins, the Liepaja branch of the Department of Citizenship and Immigration is not subordinated to the City Administration. Nevertheless, he promised to apply measures for assuring compliance with Latvian law if it is violated. Having heard reports by commanders of Russian units deployed at the Liepaja Naval Base and examined the timetable for their withdrawal, the first deputy commander of the Russian Navy noted that the timetable for withdrawal of equipment, property, and personnel had been thoroughly cross-examined and is completely realistic. In a conversation with a STRAZH BALTIKI correspondent, he agreed that it is possible to complete the pullout of the Liepaja naval brigade by 1 June 1994. The greatest difficulty, which cannot be definitely solved at the moment, is housing for the families of servicemen. At the same time, Adm. Kasatonov emphasized that the issue of the Navy's withdrawal will be solved in the context of Russian- Lithuanian relations and based on government agreements. Yesterday, the officers' group headed by Adm. Igor Kasatonov departed for St. Petersburg.
