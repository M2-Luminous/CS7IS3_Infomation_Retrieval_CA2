A noteworthy speculation circulating in the UN diplomatic circles is that he has been relieved of his position after being reprimanded for his mistaken report to Pyongyang on the results of the New York working-level contact which took place toward the end of 1993 and in which the United States and North Korea agreed on nuclear inspections. Deputy Chief of Mission Ho's departure from his post was confirmed approximately a week ago when Western intelligence agencies found out that he reserved a seat on a China Airlines [as published] flight -- that leaves New York on 24 February -- to go to Pyongyang via Beijing. The North Korean mission refused to confirm this report over the telephone, and finally, on 19 February, a mission official concerned confirmed his departure for Pyongyang. When asked why Ho Chong would depart for Pyongyang, he said he "is not in a position to comment." It has been learned Deputy Chief of Mission Ho is now preparing for his return home after concluding his official duties. His last official duty was reported to be his 15 February contact with his U.S. counterpart to discuss measures to be taken to follow up North Korea's acceptance of nuclear inspections. This year is his fifth year at the United Nations. He was originally scheduled to leave for Pyongyang early last year when his term expired. Therefore, it is speculated his departure results from a mere change of hands. Still, the speculation that he is departing after being reprimanded has become more convincing. This speculation goes like this: He was reprimanded for his distorted report to Pyongyang on the results of the New York working-level contact. At that contact, the United States and North Korea agreed to hold the third stage of U.S.-North Korea high-level talks under the condition that North Korea allows the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] to inspect all facilities to the extent that North Korea ensures that continuity of nuclear safeguards and that North-South dialogue for the exchange of special envoys resumes. However, when notifying Pyongyang of the results of the negotiations, Deputy Chief of Mission Ho reportedly stated that the agreement between North Korea and the United States requires North Korea to receive not full-scope inspections [chonmyon sachal] of the seven reported nuclear facilities but restricted inspections [chehanjok sachal] of facilities it wants to open to the extent that North Korea ensures the continuity of nuclear safeguards. Because of Ho Chong's notification, North Korea reportedly underwent significant confusion and internal trouble before it announced it would accept nuclear inspections. North Korea's insistence on restricted inspections during its negotiations with the IAEA is an example. The analysis of the diplomatic circles in the United Nations goes like this: In further contact with the United States, North Korea realized that Ho Chong's report was wrong. Therefore, North Korea, at a last phase, notified the IAEA that it would accept full-scope inspections of the seven nuclear facilities. During a meeting with domestic reporters in New York on 16 February, ROK Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said: "One of the reasons North Korea had been stubborn before it announced it would accept nuclear inspections this time is the structural problem in communications between Ho Chong, Kang Sok-chu, and other working-level officials in charge of the nuclear issue and Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il." He also said: "Working-level officials in charge of negotiations seem to worry that they may be reproached for not making efforts to the end but making concessions to the United States." Those remarks by Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu is more proof of Deputy Chief of Mission Ho's mistaken report.
