FR940429-0-00256 FR940429-0-00015 (d) Appeal procedures. (1) An institution may appeal the loss of participation in the FFEL programs under paragraph (c)(1) of this section by submitting an appeal in writing to the Secretary's designated department official that is postmarked no later than 30 days after it receives notification of its loss of participation. The institution may appeal on the grounds that_ (i)(A) The calculation of the institution's cohort default rate for any of the three fiscal years relevant to the end of participation is not accurate; and (B) A recalculation with corrected data verified by the cognizant guaranty agency or agencies would produce a cohort default rate for any of those fiscal years that is below the threshold percentage specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section; or (ii) The institution meets the following criteria: (A)( 1 ) Fifteen percent or fewer of the institution's students who are enrolled on at least a half-time basis receive Federal Stafford or Federal SLS loans for any twenty-four month period ending not more than six months prior to the date the institution submits its appeal; or ( 2 ) For any twenty-four month period ending not more than six months prior to the date the institution submits its appeal, two-thirds or more of the institution's students who are enrolled on at least a half-time basis are individuals from disadvantaged economic backgrounds, as established by documentary evidence submitted by the institution. Such evidence must relate to qualification by those students for an Expected Family Contribution (EFC) (formerly institutions were required to use the Pell Grant index), as defined in 34 CFR 690.2, of zero for the applicable award year or attribution to those students of an adjusted gross income of the student and his or her parents or spouse, if applicable, reported for the applicable award year of less than the poverty level, as determined under criteria established by the Department of Health and Human Services. (B)( 1 ) Two-thirds or more of the institution's students who were enrolled on a full-time basis in any twenty-four month period ending not more than six months prior to the date the institution submits its appeal completed the educational programs in which they were enrolled. This rate is calculated by comparing the number of students who were classified as full-time at their initial enrollment in the institution, and were originally scheduled, at the time of enrollment, to complete their programs within the relevant twenty-four month period, with the number of these students who received a degree, certificate, or other recognized educational credential from the institution; transferred from the institution to a higher level educational program at another institution for which the prior program provided substantial preparation; or, at the end of the twenty- four month period, remained enrolled and were making satisfactory academic progress toward completion of their educational programs. The calculation does not include students who did not complete their programs because they left the institution to serve in the armed forces; and ( 2 ) The institution had a placement rate of two-thirds or more with respect to its former students who received a degree, certificate, or other recognized educational credential from the institution in any twenty-four month period ending not more than six months prior to the date the institution submits its appeal. This rate is calculated by determining the percentage of all those students who, based on evidence submitted by the institution, are on that date employed, or had been employed for at least 13 weeks following receipt of the credential from the institution, in the occupation for which the institution provided training, or are enrolled or had been enrolled for at least 13 weeks following receipt of the credential from the institution, in a higher level educational program at another institution for which the prior educational program provided substantial preparation. (2) For purposes of paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, a student is originally scheduled, at the time of enrollment, to complete the educational program on the date when the student will have been enrolled in the program for the amount of time normally required to complete the program. The ``amount of time normally required to complete the program'' is the period of time specified in the institution's enrollment contract, catalog, or other materials, for completion of the program by a full-time student, or the period of time between the date of enrollment and the anticipated graduation date appearing on the student's loan application, if any, whichever is less. (3) An appeal submitted under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section is considered to be filed in a timely manner if the institution submits a letter of appeal by the 30-day deadline notifying the Secretary's designated department official that it is appealing on this basis, including with that letter a copy of the institution's request to each cognizant guaranty agency for verification of the cohort default rate data, and submits the verified data to the Secretary's designated department official within five working days of its receipt from the guaranty agency. For purposes of paragraph (d)(4) of this section, the institution's appeal is not considered complete until the institution submits the verified data to the Secretary's designated department official. (4) The Secretary issues a decision on the institution's appeal within 45 days after the institution submits a complete appeal that addresses the applicable criteria in paragraphs (d)(1) (i) through (iii) of this section to the Secretary's designated department official. (5) The Secretary's decision is based on the consideration of written material submitted by the institution. No oral hearing is provided. (6) The Secretary withdraws the notification of loss of participation in the FFEL programs sent to an institution under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, if the Secretary determines that the institution's appeal satisfies one of the grounds specified in paragraphs (d)(1) (i) through (iii) of this section. (7)(i) An institution that appeals under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section must submit a written request to the guaranty agency or agencies that guaranteed the loans used in the calculation of its cohort default rate to verify the data used to calculate its cohort default rate and simultaneously provide a copy of that request to the Secretary's designated department official. (ii) The written request must include the names and social security numbers of the borrowers the institution wishes the agency to verify and detailed information on the nature of the suspected inaccuracy in the data the institution is requesting the agency to verify. (8) An institution must include in its appeal a certification by the institution's chief executive officer that all information provided by the institution in support of its appeal is true and correct. (9) An institution that appeals on the ground that it meets the criteria contained in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section must include in its appeal the following information: (i) For purposes of paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(A)( 1 ) of this section_ (A) The number of students who were enrolled on at least a half-time basis at the institution in the relevant twenty-four month period; and
