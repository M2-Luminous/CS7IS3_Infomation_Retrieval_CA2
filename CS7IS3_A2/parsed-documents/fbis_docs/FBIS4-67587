The Danish Government will help support a broader liberalization of European energy markets only if some significant prerequisites are fulfilled. According to the energy policy report, which Energy Minister Jann Sjursen (Christian People's Party) will submit to the Folketing on Thursday, the government will emphasize three main points. First, there should be a clear connection between an opening of energy markets and concern for environmental protection. Second, transitional arrangements should be ensured -- not least with regard to the young Danish natural gas sector. Third, the subsidiarity principle should be maintained. "It is the government's position that the liberalization proposals not be dealt with in isolation but be seen within a greater energy policy context in the European Union [EU]," Sjursen will tell the Folketing on Thursday. EU's Environmental Requirements Should Be Made the Same He believes that special emphasis should be put on a greater effort in the environmental area. A liberalization of the electricity and gas markets must not be promoted at the cost of more environmentally sound forms of energy production. Increased competition should be followed up with joint and more ambitious EU environmental requirements so competitive conditions will become the same. Among other things, the government will work for a common CO[.sub]2[/] excise fee within the EU, but it will also work to ensure that the liberalization proposals establish only overarching principles. The working out [of details] and their regulation should be left to member countries. Denmark is ahead of other countries when it comes to reducing CO[.sub]2[/], and in his report Sjursen sticks to a Danish goal of a 20-percent reduction of CO[.sub]2[/] emissions by 2005 in relation to 1988. And he made no effort to conceal the fact that special emphasis would be placed on energy consumption by industry. Industry Must Bear the Brunt "The government feels it is crucial that emphasis be put on making industry's efficiency measures in the area of energy consumption more cost effective. There is still in fact a significant potential for further efficiency measures in industry. If this potential is not utilized, then households will have to institute even more expensive measures to achieve the goal while relatively cheap savings possibilities in industry remain unutilized," Sjursen says in his report. Sjursen believes that environmental and energy excise fees can be implemented without reducing competitiveness. Excise fees should be behavioral in nature and the proceeds be returned to industries "in a compensatory fashion." But the average Danish consumer of energy as well is to be made to alter his behavior. A committee has come out with a number of recommendations for a greater effort to get consumers of electrical heat to convert to more energy-efficient forms of heating. "The government will now work to see to it that a general agreement is reached between the energy companies and the authorities about converting electrical heat," writes Sjursen, who also believes that in the area of realizing savings on electricity, "there is still a significant potential that can realized."
