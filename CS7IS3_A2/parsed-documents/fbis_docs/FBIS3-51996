The URNG [Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity] Political- Diplomatic Commission stated that neither the EGP [Poor People's Guerrilla Army] nor any other guerrilla group is responsible for the grenade attack on 18th Street and 6th Avenue A, Zone 1, on 17 January. One person was killed and 17 were injured in that attack. The communique also denied any rebel involvement in the attacks that destroyed judicial files in Quiche, blasted the front of the Legislative Palace, and destroyed GUATEL radio and television repeater towers in Tecpan Guatemala, Chimaltenango. In addition, a spokesman for the URNG Political-Diplomatic Commission explained via telephone that "the URNG's actions have not gone beyond exploding pamphlet bombs in various parts of the capital to mark the EGP's anniversary and to extol the struggle of popular organizations. " The source added that the URNG attacks have not been designed to threaten human lives or damage private property because only light charges placed have been used. That is why, the spokesman reiterated, the URNG rejects the government accusations, above all those made by the military commander in Quiche, who accused the EGP of burning judicial files. "The URNG General Command stresses that the terrorist actions can be attributed to sectors that oppose a political and negotiated solution to the internal armed conflict and to the death squads, which, under the direction of the Army Staff, have been functioning since last 28 November," the URNG spokesman concluded.
