The statement stresses that much work has been done since the convention on chemical weapons was opened for signing more than a year ago. The work mainly concentrated on working out and coordinating mechanisms of implementing the convention. However, according to the Russian view, much has yet to be done to fulfil the mandate of the preparatory commission. Few of the twenty-three tasks set for the commission by the Paris resolution are close to completion, and nearly one half of the total number have not yet been proper considered. Moreover, the statement says, we are alarmed by the attempts made from time to time in the course of the preparatory commission's work to revise the essence of certain clauses, as well as to enforce interpretations of the text, which was taken for granted at the moment of signing. In particular, this concerns the correlation of the national constitutional norms and the granting of access to chemical installations to inspectors at their request, the uncertainties in the understanding of the key definitions, such as ``chemical weapons'' and ``a facility producing chemical weapons.'' In addition, Russia, which will have to bear the cost of eliminating and controlling its own stocks of chemical weapons, cannot agree to some of the proposals concerning the distribution of costs among all member-stations. When signing the text of the convention on 13 January 1933 in Paris, Russia which has a stock of chemical weapons with the total weight of the toxic substances totalling 40,000 tonnes, was well aware of the scale of the obligations it assumed. However, proceeding from an understanding that the convention is a major step towards global disarmament and the strengthening of international security, and reflects a compromise reached as a result of difficult many-year negotiations, Russia was among the first to sign this international agreement. When signing the convention, Russia stressed that the realisation of the obligations under the convention will be contiguous with a number of economic difficulties. This implied the lessening of Russia's spending on international supervision and verification and elaboration of economically-acceptable procedures of conversion of the former facilities producing chemical weapons to peaceful uses. Russia counted on the possibility of a favourable solution of these problems. During the parliamentary hearings about the participation of the Russian Federation in international agreements on the elimination of chemical weapons, some committees of the State Duma noted the need for the final clarification of the situation concerning the cost of the realisation of the convention. Questions about Russia's spending, as well as about the vague idea about the final text of the convention and the uniform interpretation of its key terms, the amount of basic obligations which determine the scope of the convention will inevitably arise when the document is submitted for ratification by the Russian Parliament and will in fact predetermine the result of its consideration. Unfortunately, in the past year, the preparatory commission has failed to examine the procedure of payments for the verification activity and the conversion of chemical weapon plants to peaceful production, and no decisions on these matters have been made up to date. Russia draws everyone's attention to the fact that the enforcement of the convention on chemical weapons in 1995 will be hampered by the failure to solve the above problems as soon as possible. This is necessary to allow the states that signed the convention to obtain a full idea about all aspects of implementing the convention at the stage of its ratification, the statement said.
