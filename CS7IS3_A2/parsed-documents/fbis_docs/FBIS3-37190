The goal of this action is to force the parliament and government to resign. About 2,000 people gathered in Independence Square in front of the government building. Approaches to the government offices have been blocked by the police. INTERFAX correspondents have not noticed any military equipment in the streets adjacent to the square. A police officer in charge of ensuring the security of the place, who preferred to remain anonymous, told INTERFAX that the law-enforcement bodies had to put up with volitions [as received] of the Independence Square's status, according to which no mass actions can be held in it except celebrations of the official national holidays. He also said that the police did not disperse so as not to fan tensions. [sentence as received] Belarusian Parliament Speaker Mechyslav Hryb told INTERFAX that the current political situation was complicated. He also said that his attitude to the strike was negative. All political problems must be tackled without pressure or violence, and at the negotiating table, he said. Hryb believes that the idea of holding the strike was initiated by the Belarusian strike committee and the opposition Belarusian Popular Front, not by the workers. "These organizations pursue their own goals which have nothing to do with the interests of ordinary workers," he said. He noted that the political strike may delay the conclusion of the monetary agreement with Russia. He also pointed out that in the current situation the law enforcement bodies will act strictly within the limits of the law, and that all illegal actions will be curbed. Belarusian Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich told INTERFAX that the strike committee was manipulating the current economic problems to destabilize the economy. To quote Kebich, the strike leaders' assertions that many industrial enterprises had stopped work at their call were ungrounded. Many factories stopped working for economic reasons, long before the strike was announced, he said. Neither the strike committee, nor the Belarusian Government could tell INTERFAX how many people had gone on strike.
