The top government spokesman told a news conference, "Sharp or unstable movements resulting from speculative transactions are not desirable." He said there is a need to make the yen's movements against the dollar stable through appropriate measures. In Tokyo on Tuesday, the dollar fell momentarily below 102 yen for the first time since last August, and ended the morning session at 102.85 yen, down 2.84 yen from Monday's close. The dollar has been under strong downward pressure against the yen since Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton failed last Friday to reach an accord on a new framework to slash Japan's bilateral trade surplus and boost the share of imports in its markets.
