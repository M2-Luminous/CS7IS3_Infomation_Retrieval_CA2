From a religious and moral point of view, much time will be needed for passions to recede and wounds to heal. From a political viewpoint, the only way to overcome this tragedy is to implement the Oslo agreement. I understand the Palestinians' situation. They are reconsidering their position, and then we need to hold talks away from the media to make sure the agreement comes into force more or less within the agreed upon time frame. The Palestinians understand that the Hebron killing was an isolated act which the whole of Israeli society condemns very strongly. [LE POINT] This raises the problem of Jewish settlements in Gaza and the West Bank... [Savir] One cannot solve the issue of settlements at this point. It will be dealt with as part of the negotiations on the final status of Gaza and the West Bank, which will start two years after the entry into force of the interim autonomy agreement. Of course, outside the scope of the negotiations, Israel is free to decide where its own interest lies. I do not believe that the time has come to send a signal that might spark delusions. The Oslo approach is a gradual one. We steered clear of anything related to the most contentious issue: sovereignty. For decisions to be made on the future of the settlements, we need a large consensus among Israel's population. Racist, violent, and extremist settlers must be neutralized. And they will be. [LE POINT] The Palestinians seem intent on securing new concessions from Israel: disarming the settlers; bringing an international force into the occupied territories... [Savir] We must stick to the agreement. If we call that into question, the whole process will collapse. 'Arafat knows perfectly well that we listen to him when he is being reasonable. The agreement does mention a temporary international presence. Therefore this is an issue we can discuss. The PLO is also confronted with a formidable challenge: to control the Hamas movement, which has been doing all it can to sabotage the peace process. Hamas will likely be the biggest obstacle to peace. [LE POINT] Do you still believe in peace? [Savir] It will be a difficult peace, fraught with violence and tragedy. If the Palestinians manage to establish open and effective economic institutions, a multiparty political system, and a reliable leadership, things will work out. Something very important was born in Oslo. Everybody fears it may now be destroyed. The true secret of the Oslo success consisted in the creation of common interests. We must go all the way with this process.
