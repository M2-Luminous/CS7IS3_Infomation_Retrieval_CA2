NATO threatened to use air power against Bosnian Serbs if they did not withdraw their heavy artillery to 20 kilometers from the center of Sarajevo within ten days. At the same time, NATO called for the Moslem heavy artillery to be placed under the control of the U.N. The same circles quote Chapter Seven of the UN Charter which clearly states that actions, like those supported by the North Atlantic Council, could be undertaken only in the event of aggression of one state against another and if they jeopardize peace and security in the world. Civil war is therefore not mentioned in this case and the international community has determined that the conflict that has been raging between the local Serbs, Croats and Moslems in the former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina for almost two years is a civil war. If the UN Charter was to be observed to the letter NATO could be declared an aggressor against whom the international community would have to take decisive actions because, according to numerous world analysts, the use of air strikes on positions around Sarajevo could jeopardize peace and international stability. By taking these decisions NATO has not only addressed an ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs but has also shown its readiness for retaliation. The UN Charter, however, does not recognize retaliation as justified and describes it as aggression. As far as the ultimatum is concerned, the Belgrade diplomatic circles consider that it is in fact a form of planned political pressure on the Bosnian Serbs ahead of the fresh round of peace talks due to start Thursday afternoon. The NATO officials' interpretation of the three Security Council Resolutions 824, 836 and 844, which according to them provide sufficient legal foundations for action without Security Council approval, is not accepted in Belgrade. Belgrade points to the possibility of an arbitrary interpretation of these resolutions due to their generalized content. At the same time Belgrade recalls the official positions of the two permanent members of the Security council, Russia and China, which are opposed to air strikes. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoliy Adamishin said in Moscow Thursday that the NATO ultimatum could not be accepted and said that it is not NATO's job to take such a decision, especially not about the use of force. How NATO will act remains to be seen. It is nevertheless clear that NATO has decided to adopt a high-risk policy which was confirmed by Boris Yeltsin's spokesman Anatoliy Kraskov who quoted the Russian president's warning in Moscow Wednesday that medicine should not be worse than the malady.
