Speaking from this northern Italian town where he is taking a few days holiday, Bossi said his federalist party was insisting on one of its members becoming premier. "We cannot give in on this point. I repeat, Berlusconi cannot be president of the Council (prime minister)," he said. But he did seem to allow for a way out to the dispute between the three parties which emerged victorious from last week's general elections, by saying: "If it is not possible to find a solution to the problem of making a square out of a circle, the League can do many things, such as offer external support without entering the government." Bossi, who did not take part in initial talks Friday in Milan between his own party and Berlusconi, leader of the Forza Italia (Go, Italy) party, said he would attend the next meeting scheduled for Wednesday. "The League must be in a position to influence and easily foster change," Bossi said. The Northern League and Forza Italia are in a fragile alliance with the right-wing National Alliance. But the National Alliance, led by the neo-fascists, favours greater central control while the Northern League wants greater autonomy for the rich industrial north of the country.
