FBIS4-62001 "drsov092_u_94004" FBIS-SOV-94-092 Daily Report 30 Apr 1994 Latvia Prime Minister Affirms Support for Coalition With Farmers Prime Minister Affirms Support for Coalition With Farmers WS1105141494 Riga DIENA in Latvian 30 Apr 94 p 1 WS1105141494 Riga DIENA Latvian BFN [Article by Nellija Locmele: "Latvia's Way Will Not Break the Coalition With the Farmers Union"] [Text] Riga, 29 Apr -- During a meeting today with representatives of the mass media, Latvian Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs expressed the conviction that Latvia's Way could form a coalition even without the Farmers Union, but it will naturally try to maintain the present coalition as long as possible, and, for its part, will never attempt to break it. The threat to the ruling coalition arose after the Wednesday [27 April] vote of Farmers Union deputies in the Saeima [parliament] concerning the case of rescinding the mandates of the Saeima "five" [deputies accused of KGB collaboration], but, as Birkavs stated today, it was a vote of conscience which cannot be attributed to factional discipline. V. Birkavs also expressed the view that the signing of the agreements with Russia could mean "the end of the coalition." Nonetheless, the prime minister admitted that no changes in the government are being planned for the present time. There also have been no concrete proposals on this matter from the Farmers Union -- "there are only some attempts to increase one's own influence by taking advantage of the unstable situation." Considering the possibilities that could result from an eventual split in the coalition, V. Birkavs first of all mentioned the creation of a new coalition which will be able to fulfill the economic policy of Latvia's Way, with perhaps some contributions regarding a few portfolios or a slight slowdown in the pace of reform. Latvia's Way, however, will never consent to a radical alteration of course. The creation of the coalition can be problematic, because Latvia's Way has its supporters in foreign policy, as well as in economic and social policies, but they do not represent one definite political group or direction. The consultations with these supporters are being held on an ongoing basis. V. Birkavs described it as a strengthening of the existing coalition. As a second possibility which may arise if the present coalition ceases to exist, V. Birkavs mentioned the support which Latvia's Way will render in the process of creating a new government based on radical national forces. At the same time, however, Latvia's Way will not fail to point out the losses which Latvia could incur.
