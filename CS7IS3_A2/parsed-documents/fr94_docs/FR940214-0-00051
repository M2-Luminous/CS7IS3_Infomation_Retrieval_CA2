FR940214-0-00051 FR940214-0-00004 For proposed congregate projects, the analyst will be responsible for researching the current need for, and usage of, services in the market area. The types of services being used, the provider of the services, and their location will be included. Homeowners will not be included in the determination of need and demand for rental units. The analyst will discuss the current market for single family houses and how sales, or the lack of, will affect the demand for elderly rental units. If the economic conditions reflect a trend toward normal selling times for houses in the market area, then the discussion should point to how elderly homeowners may reinforce the need, but only as a secondary market and not as the primary market. A statement, with signature, certifying that the analyst (including an individual under contract to the analyst's company) actually traveled to and physically surveyed the community where the proposed project will be located is also required. I. Market Area_General The market area will be the community where the project will be located and only those outlying rural areas which will be impacted by the project (excluding all other established communities). Except in specific cases of congregate housing projects where an expanded market may be justified, the market area will not include the entire county (or parish, township, or other subdivision). Any deviation from this definition must be coordinated with the servicing office. The market area must be realistic. The criteria for selection should be described by the analyst. A map showing the market area will be required. The following is an example of a market area description: A. Based on an analysis of population and housing development patterns, major employers and commuting patterns, the effective market area for the subject proposal is defined to include all of (Name), 35 percent of (Name) and 25 percent of (Name) census divisions. This area is shown on Map 2 following Table 4 (page 11) in Section II of this report. In 1980, this geographic market area contained an estimated 6,350 persons (6.1 percent of the county total of 103,829 persons). During the 1970's decade, the overall market area experienced growth of 1,253 persons (representing 13.5 percent of total gains in the county). In 1990, the (Name) market area population of 7,603 represented 6.7 percent of the county population of 113,086. (See Table 4 and Map 2 in Section II for details.) B. The effective market area for the subject proposal includes the town of (Name) and a portion of the unincorporated areas to the east and south. The (Name) River forms a natural barrier restricting development to the west. Housing development and population growth have occurred along major transportation corridors, particularly Interstate 81 and U.S. 11 between (Name) and (Name). Secondary growth has occurred along State Roads 63 and 68 to the northwest and southeast of (Name). The Interstate Industrial Park, with 16 employers providing 999 jobs, is centrally located within the market area. II. Site This section will contain a full description of the site, its position in the community and location with respect to residential support services. A. The proposed site is located in the eastern section of (Town) on (Major Thoroughfare). The area surrounding the site is predominantly comprised of modest single family dwellings. The terrain is gently sloped, with grass, oak trees, and some shrubs. B. The site is currently zoned for commercial business and is currently owned by a local car dealer. C. The site is approximately .3 mile east of the heart of town which contains a grocery store, drugstore, restaurants, banking facilities, the post office, and town hall. Other shopping is available .2 mile south at (Town) Plaza. D. The medical clinic, which provides services of an osteopath, X-ray technician, a physician's assistant, and a nurse, is approximately .8 mile north of this site. This clinic is open daily and also provides 24-hour emergency service. The nearest hospitals are (Large Town) and (Town).
