The bulk alumina handling facilities, costing "several million dollars," are jointly owned by by Trans-World Metals, the UK-based trading group, and the Vanino Port Authority, one of the new Russian joint stock companies. Russia has only one other such handling facility, at Murmansk. According to Mr Alan Bekhor, managing director of Trans-World, said to be the biggest trader in Russian aluminium: "The Vanino facilities open the way for alumina to get to Russia more efficiently. They represent a logical link between Australia, the world's biggest alumina producer, and Russia's big Siberian smelters." The first alumina through the facilities was bought from Alcoa of Australia. Mr Bekhor said that within three months a second stage would lift the bulk alumina handling capacity at Vanino to 50,000 tonnes a month. The port is at one end of the Baykal-Amur railway which runs parallel to the Trans-Siberian railway. In theory the facilities are available to all but "TransWorld will probably keep them busy for the rest of this year." However, Mr Bekhor stressed: "This is a long-term investment and there will be no quick returns."
