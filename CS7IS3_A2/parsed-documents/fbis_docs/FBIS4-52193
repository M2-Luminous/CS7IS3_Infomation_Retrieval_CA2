This was verified when a M-16 gun bullet was found in his body in an autopsy done by the Scientific Investigation Institute on May 5. Prof. Yi Yun-song of Seoul National University, who had participated in the autopsy, also stated that the death of the student was by a live bullet. The bereaved family of the student and representatives of Sejong University are angrily denouncing the criminal act of the warmaniacs and strongly demanding the resignation of the puppet minister of defence. The General Student Council of Sejong University at a press conference on May 4 urged the resignation of the puppet minister of defence, declaring that Chang Tok-su died because of the unprecedentedly intensive, murderous training.
