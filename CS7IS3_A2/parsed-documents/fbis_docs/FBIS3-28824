At the meeting, Aichi touched on the issue of the defense budget for fiscal 1994 and demanded that expenses be approved as requested in the roughly estimated budget demand. Director General Aichi said: "The roughly estimated budget demand calls for a 1.95 percent increase compared to the DA budget for fiscal 1993. However, we can keep it down to about a 1.6 percent increase if we look closely into the contents, including the foreign exchange rate. I hope it will not be trimmed more than that because further reduction will affect training and other matters." Moreover, Ko Nakai, deputy secretary general of the Social Democratic Party, also met with Prime Minister Hosokawa on the same day at the prime minister's official residence. Nakai handed over a request, which calls for the approval of the 1994 DA budget's full amount while giving considerations to defense industries, to the prime minister.
