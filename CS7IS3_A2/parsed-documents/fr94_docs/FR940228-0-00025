FR940228-0-00025 FR940228-0-00002 (b) You must provide written notice to us if you were prevented from planting (see subsection 1.(p)). This notice must be given not later than three (3) days after: (1) The final planting date if you have unplanted acreage that may be eligible for prevented planting coverage; and (2) The date you stop planting within the late planting period on any unit that may have acreage eligible for prevented planting coverage. (c) Late Planting: (1) For spring-planted wheat acreage in counties for which the Special Provisions designate a spring final planting date, and all barley, flax, oat, and rye acreage which is planted after the final planting date but on or before 25 days after the final planting date, the production guarantee for each acre will be reduced for each day planted after the final planting date by: (i) One percent (.01) for the first through the tenth day; and (ii) Two percent (.02) for the eleventh through the twenty-fifth day. (2) In addition to the requirements of section 6 (Report of Acreage) of the Common Crop Insurance Policy (ยง457.8), you must report the dates the acreage is planted within the late planting period. (3) If planting of the insured crop continues after the final planting date, or you are prevented from planting during the late planting period, the acreage reporting date will be the later of: (i) The acreage reporting date contained in the Special Provisions; or (ii) Five (5) days after the end of the late planting period. (d) Prevented Planting (Including Planting After the Late Planting Period) (1) If you were prevented from planting the insured crop (see subsection 1.(p)), you may elect: (i) To plant the insured crop during the late planting period (The production guarantee for such acreage will be determined in accordance with paragraph 12.(c)(1)); (ii) Not to plant this acreage to any crop that is intended for harvest in the same crop year (The production guarantee for such acreage which is eligible for prevented planting coverage will be 50 percent (50%) of the production guarantee for timely planted acres. In counties for which the Special Provisions designates a spring final planting date, the prevented planting guarantee will be based on your approved yield for spring-planted acreage of the insured crop. For example, if your production guarantee for timely planted acreage is 30 bushels per acre, your prevented planting production guarantee would be equivalent to 15 bushels per acre (30 bushels multiplied by 0.50). This subparagraph does not prohibit the preparation and care of the acreage for conservation practices, such as planting a cover crop, as long as such crop is not intended for harvest); or (iii) To plant the insured crop after the late planting period (The production guarantee for such acreage will be 50 percent (50%) of the production guarantee for timely planted acres. For example, if your production guarantee for timely planted acreage is 30 bushels per acre, your prevented planting production guarantee would be equivalent to 15 bushels per acre (30 bushels times 0.50). Production to count for such acreage will be determined in accordance with subsections 11.(c) through (e)). (2) In addition to the provisions under section 11 (Insurance Period), of the Common Crop Insurance Policy (ยง457.8) the beginning of the insurance period for prevented coverage is the sales closing date designated in the Special Provisions for the insured crop in the county. (3) Unless we agree in writing, prior to the sales closing date, the acreage to which prevented planting coverage applies will be limited as follows: (i) Eligible acreage will not exceed the greater of: (A) The number of acres planted to the insured crop on each ASCS Farm Serial Number during the previous crop year (adjusted for any reconstitution which may have occurred prior to the sales closing date); (B) The ASCS base acreage for the insured crop reduced by any acreage reduction applicable to the farm under any program administered by the United States Department of Agriculture; or (C) One hundred percent (100%) of the simple average of the number of acres planted to the insured crop during the crop years that were used to determine your yield;
