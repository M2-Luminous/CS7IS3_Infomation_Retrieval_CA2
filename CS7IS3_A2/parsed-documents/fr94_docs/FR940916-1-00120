FR940916-1-00120 FR940916-1-00016 FRA also proposes to require that railroads limit the speed of trains to 30 mph when an en route failure occurs to a two-way EOT, or equivalent device, that would prevent that device from initiating a brake application from the rear of the train. FRA's rationale for this limitation is that two-way EOT devices are not required on trains that travel less than 30 mph. Thus, operating with a non-functional two-way EOT device is the same as not having a device; consequently, trains operating with failed two-way EOT devices should be subjected to this same limitation. Furthermore, FRA feels that the concerns raised by several railroads regarding train delays, missed deliveries, and safety are not justified. The AAR as well as several railroads commented that these devices are very reliable and have an extremely low failure rate. In addition, Canada currently requires a 30-mph speed limit for an en route failure of these devices, and no one commented that this requirement has produced the problems raised by the railroads. Consequently, FRA believes that the concerns of the railroads are outweighed by the potential harm to both the public and railroad employees caused by trains being allowed to operate without the devices at speeds which Congress and FRA feel require the added safety benefits provided by these devices. Section 232.817. This section contains the requirements for operating in the event of an undesired emergency brake application. FRA believes that undesired emergency brake applications pose a safety hazard to both the public and railroad employees that needs to be addressed. Therefore, FRA proposes to require that a train crew attempt to pinpoint the car causing the undesired application and drop that car off at the next point where repairs can be made to that car's brake system. FRA recognizes that identifying a car as source of an undesired emergency brake application is not always possible. Section 232.819. This section contains the requirements for developing operating requirements for extreme meteorologic, topographic, or other conditions. FRA recognizes that neither railroad or labor representatives supported the mandating of additional testing in cold weather or in mountain grade territory. FRA agrees that the development and use of welded pipe fittings, wide-lip hose couplings, and ferrule clamps have greatly reduced the effects of cold weather on the air brake system. However, FRA believes that there are several extreme operating conditions that involve added safety risks and that need to be further addressed by the railroads. These include cold weather and mountain territory operations as well as the operation of long and heavy trains. Although FRA does not intend to mandate additional tests or procedures to cover these extreme operating conditions, FRA does expect each railroad to develop detailed operating procedures for these types of operations, tailored to the equipment and territory of that railroad. FRA believes that requiring the development of written operating procedures will require railroads to go through the thought process necessary to analyze their operations under these extreme conditions in order to determine the inherent safety hazards involved and develop procedures to minimize these hazards. Section 232.821. This section contains operating requirements specific to conventional freight trains. FRA proposes to prohibit the use of ``feed valve braking,'' in which reductions and increases in the brake pipe pressure are affected by manually adjusting the feed valve. ``Feed valve braking'' has been recognized by both the railroad industry and FRA as an unsafe practice. Most railroads already have some type of operating rule prohibiting this type of braking. In addition, FRA proposes to prohibit the use of the ``passenger'' position on the locomotive brake control stand on conventional freight trains when the trailing equipment is not designed for graduated brake release. The ``passenger'' position was intended only for use with equipment designed for graduated brake release. Consequently, use of the ``passenger'' position with other equipment can lead to potentially dangerous situations. FRA also proposes to prohibit ``bottling the air'' when detaching a locomotive from a train. This procedure involves closing the angle cock on the standing cars after making a brake application. The purpose in doing so is to save air in the brake pipe but can lead to an unintentional release of the brakes and a runaway. FRA will require that the brake pipe be left open on standing cars. Section 232.823. This section contains operating requirements specific to intermediate speed freight trains. FRA believes that the operation of freight trains at speeds in excess of 79 mph will occur in the near future. Although these types of operations do not yet exist, FRA feels that these proposed regulations are an appropriate context for FRA to establish some general operating limitations for such operations. FRA proposes to require that an intermediate speed freight train be limited to a maximum weight of 8,000 tons and a maximum length of 5,000 feet and be made up of zero-slack or limited-slack equipment. FRA is proposing these limitations in order to counteract the increased safety risk assumed as the speed of a freight train is increased. FRA would also like to implement specific train make-up requirements for intermediate speed freight trains that minimize the potential for dangerous train handling situations created by the manner in which the weight of the train is distributed along the length of the train. As there are no intermediate speed freight trains currently in operation, FRA requests comments and suggestions from the industry regarding these proposed limitations and any additional limitations or requirements that may be applicable to these types of trains.
