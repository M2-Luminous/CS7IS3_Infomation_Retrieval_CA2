FBIS4-20716 "jpnea017___94012" JPRS-NEA-94-017 JPRS Near East & South Asia 31 December 1993 NEAR EAST REPUBLIC OF YEMEN Despite Optimism, Possibility of Civil War Rises Despite Optimism, Possibility of Civil War Rises 94AE0086B Paris AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI in Arabic 31 Dec 93 pp 27-29 94AE0086B Paris AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI Arabic CSO [Text] The question posed in Yemen today is no longer: Has the unity experiment reached an impasse that will force a return to partition and separation or the use of federalism? Those who know the secrets of the behind-the-scenes activities are very afraid of a civil war like Somalia's, in which sultans will intervene in party conflicts and tribal disputes. The Socialists accuse President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih of concocting this scenario with outside parties, aimed at escalating the situation and pushing the southerners into separatism. This could only end with military intervention in defense of Yemen's unity and stability. How was this scenario prepared, what are the alliances and balances of power, and where will it lead Yemen? Sanaa Turns to Fundamentalist Movements, Tribes, and Sultans to Liquidate the Socialist Party Observers of the Yemeni scene are still trying to learn the factual secrets that the leader of the "southern" Socialist Party and vice president of the unified state, 'Ali Salim al-Bid, brought back from his trip abroad. This trip, which he took right after the parliamentary elections, took him to several world nations, including the United States. Sources close to 'Ali Salim al-Bid confirm that he learned some very serious information from his American meetings with American and Western experts in Yemeni affairs. He returned with a different view of the future of the unity experiment and the dangers that threaten both it and him. This caused him to return directly to Aden and begin a period of seclusion, starting on 19 August. Nothing gives the impression that it will end peacefully, with dialogue and conciliation, despite all the mediation and optimistic statements that have appeared from time to time. For more than two months, events in Yemen have called for pessimism, not only with regard to dissolving the unity agreement, but also the very serious repercussions that this consequence bears. They go beyond a return to partition and separation, or even using the option of a federation or confederation, to the danger of an outbreak of a bloody and destructive civil war, kindled by the flames of partisan conflicts, tribal disputes, and foreign interference. This causes many observers to express fear that this war could exceed Lebanon's and reach the level of Somalia's. Despite indications of optimism that appear from time to time through statements of mediators, or even through the policy of moderation and sincerity that Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih has expressed, hinting at his readiness to offer the necessary commitments to save unity and avert the sacrifice of life and blood, the continual actual events are more of an indication for observers of what Yemen can expect. They see a very dangerous explosion being prepared that will be far different from those honeyed words. Sources close to the Socialist Party believe that a true reading of the situation in Yemen calls for going beyond the declaration of intentions to study the reality of the scheming intentions that are revealed by the actions and policies being pursued. They accuse President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, i.e., the government in Sanaa, of exaggeration in raising and defending the slogans of unity and claiming to ardently adhere to them, while moving secretly in the opposite direction. They say that he is working to escalate and ignite the flames of dispute. Last week, those who are critical of President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih offered new evidence of his secret policy, when they confirmed his responsibility or, at least, the government's responsibility under his orders, for objecting to the procession of Prime Minister Haydar Abu Bakr al- 'Attas along the heights of Sanaa. When he returned to the capital to resume dialogue meetings, groups of military police acted provocatively toward him, to the extent of pursuing the motorcade even down al-Sitin Street inside Sanaa. It was clear that the purpose of this action was to escalate the situation further, in circumstances that would aggravate matters and increase their complexity day after day. This would help to increase tension between Sanaa and Aden while, at the same time, President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's circles stress his eagerness to contain all disputes and overcome difficulties. He has also approved the 18 points that the Socialist Party put forth as a condition of 'Ali Salim al-Bid's return from seclusion. This last issue has poured oil on the fire, kindling more disputes and emphasizing the continuation of the two sides' mutual estrangement and the impossibility of dialogue. Circles close to the Socialist Party have asked how President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih can announce his agreement to the conditions, while his opposing Haydar Abu Bakr al-'Attas's parade reflects continued violation of a basic point in dispute. This point is the interference of military police in security affairs, especially internal security, in addition to the continued militarization of cities and intensified deployment of military forces, especially in Sanaa. In this atmosphere, informed circles in Sanaa and Aden express fears that the two sides will decide in the end to pursue the return to partition and separation, putting an end to three and one-half years of the unity experiment, which began on 22 May 1990. These circles note that each side uses a different special and tactical way to arrive at this depressing result, considering that the Socialist Party plays an overt game of endorsing the return to federalism and local rule, which was expounded by Salim Salih Muhammad, member of the Presidential Council and assistant secretary general of the Socialist Party. On the other hand, the game of the Popular General Congress embraces a great deal of noise, suspicions, and questions. These circles say that the Socialist Party has discovered that the ruling party in Sanaa is playing with a well-thought-out mixed deck. Under cover of defending unity and expressing strong enthusiasm for it, it is pursuing a tactic aimed ultimately at squeezing the southerners and forcing them into separatism. At this point, President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih could find an appropriate opportunity to intervene in Aden and occupy it, on behalf of saving unity and protecting the country's higher interests, security, stability, and civil peace. In the end, this would lead to the actual unification of Yemen, but under Sanaa's authority. Intervention Scenario 'Ali Salim al-Bid supporters stress that he has obtained data confirming this scenario. He has learned that a group from the pro-Iraqi Ba'th Party and Saddam Husayn supporters inside the regime in Sanaa have been pushing in this direction. They have prepared the political and military details to achieve this end. 'Ali Salim al-Bid adds that the Iraqi military experts, who are working beside the Republican Guard in Sanaa, are supervising preparation of military and security plans in this regard. Socialist Party groups stress their conviction that all events in Yemen over several months are contributing to this scenario. They say that all acts of escalation that have occurred--and will occur--despite repeated invitations to dialogue, are aimed at pursuing this plan to the end. They enumerate a series of actions that have led to increased difficulties and obstacles impeding the unity experiment, and that have bogged down any practical implementation of it. They include a series of assassinations against leaders and prominent figures of the Socialist Party, as well as other acts of intimidation and terrorism. The insistence of the Popular General Congress in Sanaa on controlling the decision-making sources in the unified government and occupying the most important and sensitive posts has led to Socialist and southern feelings of having been cheated, which have caused them to complain and hint at separation. The fact is that there is an official and unofficial current in southern circles that says bitterly and angrily that the south was the biggest loser in the unification process, whose agreements have not been effectively applied. Some people in Sanaa say that unification was between the Socialist Party and the Congress and, even then, only on the level of the northern governorates, whether with regard to the general treasury or the division of jobs. The Socialist Party has continued to rule the south. Southerners have accused the regime in Sanaa of pursuing a policy of annexation and abrogation against them, of dealing with the southern and eastern governorates as if they were "an annex of Yemen, and as if there were a birthright-Yemeni and a derived-Yemeni and citizens of lower degrees," quoting Brigadier General Baras, chairman of the Preparation Committee for the Hadramawt [meeting]. This impression has been emphasized more than once by Salim Salih Muhammad, criticizing the mentality that "looks at us as if we actually came from outside Yemen." He pointed to the complete ban on the Socialist Party in the north, while the Congress has set up shop in all the governorates, where Congress members are commanders of security, police, and customs, and officials of the Ministry of Finance. Salim Salih Muhammad got to the nub of the matter when he asked: "How many Socialist Party cadre are there in the Office of the Presidency?" Perhaps this feeling of being cheated is what has caused 'Ali Salim al-Bid and the Socialists to refer more than once to the fact that they made a mistake in agreeing to unity. Southerners add to these elements an important economic factor. Because of this factor, southern Yemen with 3.5 million inhabitants has suffered more than has the north from economic problems. In the south, prices have gone up more, and the inflation rate has reached 600 percent. At the same time, in the north, inflation has been held to 40 percent. There has been no distribution of wealth, specifically oil, and the government has not kept its pledge to establish a free zone in Aden. In addition to the exorbitant rise in prices and, consequently, increased popular resentment because of living standards, there have been breaches of security and public order and increased acts of violence, especially organized assassinations, which have shown the Socialists that they are the targets. It is worth mentioning that 'Ali Salim al-Bid has not concealed the fact that one of the reasons for his return to Aden and his seclusion there was his fear of meeting the same fate as former North Yemen President Ibrahim al-Hamdi. Al-Hamdi was pro-unity and was killed in mysterious circumstances in October 1977, on the eve of an intended visit to make to Aden. Al-Bid has indicated that al-Hamdi's assassination was "the result of treachery. We must get rid of this deception and trickery." The Socialist Party's leadership has, more than once, accused elements connected with Sanaa of being behind the assassinations and attempted assassinations, to which more than one party official has been exposed. It has said that those who carried out these acts enjoy the protection of prominent northern officials. The party has made the issue of exposing them and conducting investigations a basic condition with regard to returning to "normalcy." In the past few days, prominent Socialists have bluntly revealed the existence of a plan aimed at assassinating party figures and leaders in Sanaa, including Minister of Defense Haytham Qasim Tahir, and certain Socialist Party Political Office members. They stress that there is no security for the lives of southern officials in Sanaa. A few days after the discussion of these plans, a senior southern officer was kidnapped by unknown persons who led him away from his room in one of Sanaa's hotels. He had come there from Aden on a mission. Observers believe the case of Lieutenant Colonel Mahmud Mas'ad al-Huraysi, a senior Armed Forces officer, is very serious and intended to stir up discord among individuals of the Armed Forces, which have not only remained un-united, but have also recently been conducting military movements. They are making continuous preparations to guard against any surprise, and have brought back partition--in a way--by placing barrels [at border crossings]. The situation is tense along border areas between north and south, which have previously seen three wars. Fundamentalists and Sultans Socialist Party circles accuse the Popular General Congress of carrying out a series of assassinations, for the purpose of further escalating the crisis in accordance with a prepared scenario. They have information that Sanaa, in order to achieve its escalation strategy, is relying on other factors and elements. The first factor is Islamic extremists. Socialists accuse many of them of fomenting security disturbances in Aden and carrying out assassination attempts against Socialist officials, after having been mobilized against this Marxist party and urged to take revenge against its anti-Islam policy. The Socialists have--more than once before--stressed that Sanaa is giving military and material aid to a number of Yemeni Afghans and mujahidin to carry out operations in the south and to assassinate southern officials in the north. Undoubtedly the Socialist Party, which is afraid of the repercussions from the results achieved by the Reform Alliance in the recent legislative elections, leading Shaykh 'Abdallah al-Ahmar to the chairmanship of the Leadership Council, is even more afraid of a fundamentalist intifadah in the south and the growth of extremist Islamic movements. The second factor is the split in the south caused by the stirring up of so-called family sensitivities, or the return to inciting the sultans against the Socialist Party, which has nationalized the property of the wealthy and the sultans. At the beginning of this year, the arrest of the sultan of Abyan, Tariq al-Fadli, on the charge of assassinating 'Ali Salih 'Abbad, a member of the Socialist Party's Political Office, stirred up a crisis between Sanaa and Aden. In recent weeks, it was noted that the sultans have returned to provocative activities and intervention in the existing crisis. This clearly began when Sultan Ahmad 'Abdallah al-Fadli, the previous sultan of Abyan, sent a telegram to both President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar, in which he accused the Socialist Party of working to separate south Yemen, after having confirmed the existence of large oil reserves in its territory. Perhaps the greatest danger that looms on the Yemeni horizon today is the danger of resumption of tribal conflicts, with some tribes bearing arms against others. Yemen lives today with the fear of the historic conflict between the Hashid and Bakil tribes. According to some, the visit to Aden by Shaykh Sinan Abu-Luhum, who led a large delegation seeking to reconcile points of view, was interference in an alliance between 'Ali Salim al-Bid and the Bakil tribes in the north. These tribes are well known for their animosity against the Hashid tribes, to which President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Shaykh al-Ahmar belong. Some observers believe that the Socialist Party is not unlikely to react against Sanaa at the risk of a bloody war, while security in the south is ensured, thanks to the domination of the cohesive and ideological southern army, considered militarily stronger than the army of the north. In the last few weeks, it was noted that several tribes and areas have begun to move into the line of conflict and that the dangers of an explosion are increasing. The Hadramawt area, for example, has severely criticized the north and has called for local rule, broad powers, and the enjoyment of privatization. That should be granted to it to make use of the more than 60 percent of Yemeni oil reserves that lie under its territory. Despite the insistence at the Hadramawt meeting on rejecting separation, observers think that this initiative is an indicator that goes beyond putting pressure on Sanaa to save unity. As for the Khawlan tribes that stress they are an indivisible part of the Bakil, they have demanded participation in power, commensurate with their size. Civil War At this time, the mobilization campaign continues in the south because of indicators that there is a threat of something that is far beyond separation. This campaign intensified after the assassination attempt in Aden against 'Ali Salim al-Bid's sons, Nayif and Yusuf, and the assassination of his sister's son. Al-Bid's sister waved her son's blood-splattered clothes in his funeral procession, old southern revolutionary anthems were played, and the blue and red-starred party flag waved. The demonstrators shouted for revenge, calling for the return of confrontation lines on the borders and for the bearing of arms against the north, instead of continuing to live like beggars in the unified Yemen. In fact, there is increasing talk about arming the youth and readying armed militias among the citizens. Together with that, media campaigns and the exchange of accusations between the two sides continue. There are also southerners returning to the north and northerners to the south, along with military reinforcements and reports of arms and experts arriving by this route or that. Observers expect tension to increase during the next few days. They think that the south will continue to work to propose a federation or confederation as the ideal solution to avoid separation and return to partition. However, Socialist Party leaders are convinced that Sanaa will persist in a policy of no alternative to unity from its own perspective, in order to impose domination over both the north and south. These observers expect that, in the next phase, the south will experience security disturbances and widespread acts of assassination and abduction, accompanied by a suffocating economic crisis. The purpose of this is to generate a vast outcry for separation, which would be achieved. Then, Sanaa would intervene. According to the latest information, Sanaa has been arranging strong relations with southern tribes, sultans, and fundamentalist movements. It has ended its negotiations with the former southern president, Nasir Muhammad, to host him in Sanaa, in an attempt to win over the last wave of Socialist old-timers. However, Arab and foreign observers and mediators, who have tried and are trying to obtain conciliation and not allow matters to reach a point of no return, know full well the dangers of continued escalation in this direction, because that will ultimately lead to Yemen's getting into a civil war, whose results and repercussions would be more dangerous by far than all the wars that have previously been fought by the people of this single country.
