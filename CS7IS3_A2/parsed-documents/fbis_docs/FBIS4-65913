Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev declared on several occasions on Tuesday and Wednesday that Moscow would set no conditions for joining the Partnership for Peace (PFP) programme. However, he said Russia still wanted regular political consultations on European and global security with NATO on a regular and emergency basis. There was no immediate NATO response. Grachev was speaking at a meeting of defence ministers from the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation with their counterparts from the former Soviet bloc. U.S. Secretary of State William Perry said Grachev had given an "excellent presentation" on Russia's new nonaggressive post-Cold War military doctrine, and expressed pleasure at Russia's pledge to join the PFP. NATO countries had been worried that Russia would present a list of unacceptable demands for joining the PFP, which was launched in January and groups the Western alliance with countries of the former Soviet bloc. Their fears had been fuelled by months of conflicting statements from officials and politicians in Russia, ranging from support for military cooperation with the West, to outright chauvinistic refusal. "But today we are relieved and happy," one diplomat said. British Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind told journalists: "It is looking very good. Russia clearly wants to play a constructive role, working on issues of common interest." A NATO official said: "Nobody here wants confrontation, neither NATO nor the Russians. Everybody here wants to cooperate with the Russians." Perry confirmed that a compromise was emerging -- that Russia would not get the treaty on political relations with NATO that it had sought, but could bank on special cooperation on nuclear issues such as arms control. Diplomats said this was a face-saving compromise for Russian leaders which would allow them to claim at home that the West regarded Moscow as a nuclear super-power more influential than its East European neighbours. Grachev reiterated that Russia was not insisting on special political links with NATO as the price for signing the PFP, which has already been joined by 16 countries of the old Soviet bloc. But he announced he would present NATO later Wednesday with proposals for specific Russia-NATO cooperation, involving a "protocol of intention or programmes specific to Russia-NATO cooperation." Some countries, particularly the United States, say they do not want NATO-Russia links formalised on paper, but to evolve depending on Russian cooperation in the PFP programme. A Polish diplomat warned that Warsaw and other East European countries would not accept Russian involvement in NATO decisions concerning their security. "Our political standpoint is that there should be nothing about us without us," he said, citing a Polish proverb. An example of what Poland would not accept, the diplomat said, was a proposal from Moscow for joint Russia-NATO security guarantees over countries such as Poland. But Perry said fears that NATO and Russia might divide up East Europe into Cold War-style spheres of influence were "entirely inappropriate and misplaced."
