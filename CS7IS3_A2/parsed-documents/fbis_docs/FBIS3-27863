A proposal made by the government's Tax Commission last November on the tax issue appears to be focusing too much on the concept that the proposed income tax cuts should be financed by tax revenues, Kubota told a regular press conference. The scope of such sources could be further expanded, Kubota said, citing the possibility of unexpected revenues emerging from "economic adjustment" under various proposals by an advisory body to the prime minister. Kubota was referring to the easing of government controls proposed last year by the advisory group for economic restructuring. The Tax Commission tends to think of everything only in terms of a tax framework, she explained, while the government advisory body has a broader framework that would create new business needs in the future. Kubota's remarks came at a time when the ruling coalition parties and the Finance Ministry are engaged in a tug-of-war over how to finance the income tax cuts which are expected to be included in the government's new economic stimulus package Thursday. The Finance Ministry, adamantly against issuing "untreated" deficit-financing bonds, or bonds not backed by financial sources to repay them, has proposed hiking the consumption tax rate from the current 3 percent. The coalition parties are in disarray over the issue, chiefly due to strong opposition to the consumption tax raise from the Social Democratic Party (SDP), the largest of the seven-party coalition. Kubota, an SDP member, said she hopes the coalition will reach a consensus that would lead to tax reforms which balance income and consumption taxes. Kubota, the head of the agency that is responsible for formulating the economic package, refrained from specifying the size of the proposed income tax reductions.
