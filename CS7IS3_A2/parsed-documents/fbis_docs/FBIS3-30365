It was stated that the newly-formed coalition will act jointly in the assembly of the republic of Serb Krajina and will jointly form a government and other bodies of power. The agreement envisages that each party, i.e. member of the coalition, should participate in the government and other bodies of power in proportion to the number of seats in the Krajina parliament. In last week's parliamentary elections the Serbian Democratic Party of Krajina won 32 seats while the Radicals won 16 of the overall number of 84 seats in the assembly of the republic of Serb Krajina. A statement from the meeting today says that the coalition partners reached an agreement on the division of the posts in the presidency of the Krajina assembly and Krajina government which correspond to these parties. Following this meeting, Seselj stated that the two parties have agreed that one party will hold the post of assembly speaker while the other will have the prime minister's post. The political goal of the coalition, as the statement says, is the affirmation of the national and state interests of the Serbian people and the republic of Serb Krajina, and the securing of stable conditions for the democratic functioning of bodies of power, while the basic goal is the unification of all Serbian lands and the establishment of a unified Serbian state.
