MTUC President Zainal Rampak said: As a matter of priority, the MTUC has called upon the TUC, through its affiliates, supporters and union members, to use its sphere of influence and put pressure on the British press to retract its defamatory allegations against Malaysian leaders and tender its apologies. This would eventually pave way for British-Malaysian relations to return to normalcy. Zainal said in a statement that MTUC made clear that it was the TUC which would have to take the first step to normalise reletions between the two countries and MTUC would extend its cooperation and assistance as a follow-up measure. The MTUC received a letter from the TUC dated March 11 which, among other things, requested MTUC to play a role to bring about a speedy restoration of bilateral relations betweeen the two countries in the light of the Malaysian ban on awarding public works contracts to British companies, he added. In reply, MTUC stated clearly that though it sympathized with the plight of British workers who faced the imminent possibility of losing their jobs, we cannot, as a matter of principle, condone the activities of any institution, including the press aimed at tarnishing the image of Malaysia as an independent, sovereign nation. He also made it clear that the present state of affairs had been spurred by adverse British media reports on Malaysian political leaders. Following the series of allegations of corruption against Malaysian leaders by the British press, the Malaysian Government imposed the ban on the awarding of contracts of government projects to British companies on Feb. 25. While the ban does not cover private sector ventures, the two governments said the policy did not affect their normal bilateral relations.
