Up to March this year, total investment in Zhejiang has topped 3.3 billion U.S. dollars, including contracted investment of 2.4 billion U.S. dollars from Taiwan. First, the number of huge projects invested in is increasing. Among the 1,722 Taiwan investment projects, there are 34 projects with an investment of over 10 million U.S. dollars each. Although the number is quite small, their invested funds account for two-thirds of all Taiwan investment. Second, the investment field has been enlarged. Taiwan first invested in Zhejiang in such areas as beverage production, restaurants and clothing. Now, Taiwan investments have expanded to energy, transportation, petrochemicals, machinery, textiles and construction materials. And more and more technology-intensive and even high-tech industrial enterprises are emerging. Third, long-term investment is growing. Many Taiwan businessman pay attention to intensive investment within professions, coordination between professions and development of series of products. The recently established Far-East Toy Industrial City and Taiwan Machinery Industrial City are good examples. Zhejiang has advantages in attracting overseas investment. A Taiwan investor said, "I chose to invest in Zhejiang for its social stability and good basic infrastructure."
