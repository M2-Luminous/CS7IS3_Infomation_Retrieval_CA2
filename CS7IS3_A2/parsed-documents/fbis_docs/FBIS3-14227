Baraq said the massacre in Hebron fell on the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] like a bolt from the blue and was totally unexpected. Our correspondent Mira Amsalem reports: [Begin recording] [Amsalem] The chief of staff's testimony is continuing now behind closed doors, and this will bring to an end today's proceedings. This morning the chief of staff also testified for two hours behind closed doors. Baraq's public testimony also lasted for two hours. Baraq's testimony was fluent, firm, and extremely lucid. He said the IDF is acting on the basis of what it estimates to be reasonable and expected. A massacre is not an event that the Army could have prepared itself for. A bolt out of the blue -- this is how Baraq termed the incident. Baraq said that the security procedures at the cave where good, but even so the massacre could not have been prevented -- rather only minimized -- had these procedures been adhered to. The chief of staff opened his public testimony with an hour-long review of the situation. The first part dealt with the situation in the territories; the threat of terrorism, dangers stemming from terrorist acts, and the pursuit of fugitives. Baraq said this situation has exacerbated since the beginning of the intifadah, and that things got even worse after the Oslo agreement and in the wake of the political process. During all this time the IDF has initiated an active campaign against Palestinian terrorism. The chief of staff said this was the IDF's main mission in Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip, as he himself and the defense minister have explained to all the Army echelons. The chief of staff said that Colonel Me'ir Kalifi, Major General Sha'ul Mufaz, and Major General Dani Yatom are the officers in charge of the struggle on the ground -- and these three were also the three senior IDF witnesses at the Shamgar Commission. The chief of staff defined their work as complicated and difficult. During the second part of his review the chief of staff explained the IDF's open-fire orders. He said they were formulated by the General Staff and approved at the most senior legal levels. He said they have not been changed in terms of law or principles, but there have been adaptations to new situations on the ground. Baraq said the measures adopted by the soldiers on the ground were also kept proportional to the dangers confronting them. Baraq said the orders left a large room of discretion for the soldiers on the ground. The Army chose to simplify the orders rather than going into the fine details of hypothetical situations, as was deemed appropriate by jurists. The chief of staff said that there was no order not to fire at Jews. Let us hear how Baraq described this issue: [Baraq] In no case is there, nor can there be, an IDF order saying it is forbidden to fire at a settler even if he is directing gunfire at other people or at the soldiers. On the contrary, there is an order relating to life-threatening situations explicitly stating the opposite. If there was a misunderstanding -- and from some of the testimony it appears some people did misunderstand the orders -- it could have stemmed from misunderstanding answers given to soldiers during briefings. This issue should indeed be investigated, and normally we would have thoroughly investigated it by ourselves. Now I am not certain we should do so, in view of the fact that the issue is being examined by this commission of inquiry, among others. [Amsalem] The chief of staff said no briefings are held in anticipation of a massacre. This is how Baraq defined the massacre: [Baraq] All this is not required for a massacre. Here everything is clear: A massacre is a massacre is a massacre. There is no need for special orders or directives to know what has to be done in such cases. [Amsalem] Baraq said the misunderstanding of the orders stemmed either from the briefings or from temporary procedures introduced several months ago regarding imposing the law on Israelis in the territories. These procedures included a clause dealing with directing shots at Israelis. The chief of staff said these procedures did not deal with life-threatening situations. Baraq said that in the six years of the intifadah there has not been even one case in which a soldier saw an Israeli shooting without a reason. There were no fatalities stemming from criminal acts perpetrated in the presence of soldiers. The chief of staff finished his review with a comparison of the IDF with the French Army fighting in Algeria. He said the problems were somewhat similar; in Algiers, however, the French Army suffered a moral deterioration, whereas the IDF is trying to preserve moral standards. After Baraq's review ended, the questions started. Justice al-Zu'bi wanted to find out if the chief of staff bears responsibility for the massacre. Baraq said he bears the overall responsibility, but the chief of staff's responsibility detracts nothing from the responsibility borne by any officer regarding his sphere of command and concrete responsibility -- this is how the chief of staff differentiated between his responsibility and that of the officers on the ground. Answering another question regarding the settlers' right to bring weapons into the cave, Baraq said there was no room to change this, because there was no concrete warning regarding dangers posed by Jews: [Baraq] We did not expect a murder by such a lunatic, we did not expect this sort of action. We did not conceive of the possibility of such an action. I am afraid that in order to be honest with ourselves we must state that such a suicidal and determined lunatic can murder people; he can murder Israeli citizens and Palestinian Arabs. In other places in the world such a lunatic can carry out mass massacres, shoot down jetliners, or murder the president of a superpower who is guarded by an entire secret service. I think we should have no illusions regarding what we cannot accomplish. I think it is impractical to act on the assumption that the IDF or any other element can come up with a foolproof security plan which would give a complete answer to any coldblooded or lunatic suicide attack. [Amsalem] Answering a question posed by commission member Menahem Ya'ari, the chief of staff expressed reservations about comments made by Yisra'el Bluementhal, head of Hebron's home guard, who issued the IDF weapons to Goldstein. Bluementhal defined the massacre as a battle. The chief of staff ended his public appearance by stating that in the restrictions under which it is operating, the IDF is imposing law and order in an even-handed fashion. [end recording]
