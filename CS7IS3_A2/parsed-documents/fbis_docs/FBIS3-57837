Rexrodt told FOCUS that pensions are "by no means" safeguarded after the year 2010. The Free Democratic Party of Germany minister thus rejected attempts by Labor Minister Norbert Bluem and Christian Democratic Union [CDU] social expert Heiner Geissler to stifle the discussion on pensions. "Populist-oriented politicians fear that this encourages a weariness with politics and that elderly people could turn their backs on the CDU." Bluem "must now have the courage to say: In the interest of 30-year-olds we have to think beyond the year 2010." The economics minister suggests that the time spent bringing up children should be taken more into account in calculating pensions. Rexrodt rejects the idea of a basic pension, suggested by Saxony's Minister-President Kurt Biedenkopf, because "this would mean that nonachievement would also pay." Hundreds of thousands of people would no longer pay any contributions if they got a basic pension anyway. "You would have to be stupid to pay," the minister said.
