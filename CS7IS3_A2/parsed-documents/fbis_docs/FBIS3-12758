AL-BA'TH stresses the importance of having a balanced and effective European role in the peace process. However, the paper warns that the Israelis' emphasis on the Europeans, from the economic viewpoint, seeks to market the Oslo Agreement, in which some people found an opportunity to enter the region. The paper says: This view is based on a host of unfounded illusions, which will harm principally the peace process and the Europeans themselves, in view of their interests in the region and strong ties with the Arab states. The paper wonders: Will the European Community agree to serve as a bridge on which Rabin can cross to hamper the peace process? AL-BA'TH concludes by saying: Israel has on more than one occasion tried to use the European role to its advantage. But that role remained balanced to some extent over the issue of the Arab-Israeli conflict. With Rabin's moves, which precede his visit to Washington, this role should not lose its balance because the wager on the Oslo Agreement will fail.
