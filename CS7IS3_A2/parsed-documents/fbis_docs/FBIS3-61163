There is no sense in talking about the entire amount of indebtedness, though, since it also includes the part of it which is related to the passage of payments. The problem worrying everyone is the outstanding debt in industry -- the main object of the non-payments. On 1 October it was R6.9 trillion. Indebtedness in the Mirror of Statistics If we recall the "peak" of the non-payment crisis -- last summer -- it turns out that in absolute figures, the amount of the outstanding debt doubled: on 1 July 1992 it was R3.2 trillion. During this 18-month period, however, prices rose over 10-fold. Consequently, the outstanding debt, on a relative scale, not only did not increase, but even dropped. The indicators characterizing the relative proportion of non-payments in the national economy also indicate this trend. The relative proportion of outstanding debt in the entire amount of indebtedness during last-year's non-payment crisis was 61-62 percent, but after the introduction of pre-payments and carrying out reciprocal setoffs, it dropped to 49-46 percent, and in January 1993 it was 42 percent. It remained at this level until October of this year. The next indicator makes understandable the way in which outstanding indebtedness relates to the entire industrial output. In August of last year the indebtedness exceeded the amount of goods produced by a factor of 2.6. In December of last year this indicator was 135-140 percent. It held at this level for the last 10-11 months: the figure for 1 October is 137.5 percent. A characteristic indicator is the relative proportion of outstanding debt to the gross domestic product. At the "peak" of non-payments it was 1.7 percent of the VVP [GDP]. In the autumn, after carrying out the reciprocal setoff, it was 86 percent of the GDP, in December -- 70 percent, in February 1993 -- 48 percent and in March -- 32 percent. It stayed at this level for the entire remainder of the year: on 1 October the relative proportion of outstanding debt was 34 percent of the gross domestic product. A year ago, the outstanding indebtedness exceeded the monetary funds in the enterprises' accounts by a factor of 2.6. In June of this year, the relative proportion of outstanding debt exceeded the enterprises' funds by a factor of 1.3. In October it rose slightly -- to a factor of 1.6. In the meantime, when examining the dynamics of the growth of outstanding indebtedness, allowance should be made for the fact that the data on 1 October of this year is not totally comparable with the entire preceding series. Up until 1 October, the outstanding indebtedness was calculated in production cost prices. Beginning on 1 October, a new type of accountability was introduced, and non-payments were calculated in sale prices. Even a non-specialist knows that the sale price is higher than the production cost price, and specialists refine this to a difference of 20-30 percent. The latter indicators, therefore, overstated the relatively comparable series by at least 20 percent. We can therefore say precisely that no rise took place in the relative proportion of outstanding indebtedness in the national economy. Moreover, it was reduced in the relative indicators. This is demonstrated visually by the graphs: after the summer "peak" of 1992, the volumes of outstanding indebtedness emerged on an even plateau somewhere toward October and were at a stable level for a year, and for certain sectors even fell. Let us sum up everything that has been said. There are non-payments in the economy. The problem, however, remained at approximately the same level of urgency throughout the year. There is therefore no objective basis for talking about the exacerbation of the problem of non-payments, and there is no payment crisis right now. The Reasons for Non-Payments Since the beginning of the reform, in January of last year, the enterprises have been relieved of the obligatory ties, "designated" by the government, with each other, and with buyers and suppliers. On the one hand, this relieved them of "obligations" and disadvantageous partners, and made it possible for them to seek more advantageous ties. It is obvious, however, that such things cannot be done overnight, and the enterprises continued "from force of habit" to supply their output for the traditional buyers, without waiting for payment. The recipients of the goods either had no money in their accounts, or had money, but had lost interest in the goods supplied them. As a result, the gross heap of non-payments increased quite quickly. The compulsory pre-payment for goods supplied, introduced by government resolution, should theoretically eliminate the payment problem as a phenomenon. In practice, however, pre-payment has only partially eased the urgency of the situation. What is happening now? The idea is that the enterprises should wait until the money arrives before they ship their products. In reality, however, they are, as before, not waiting for the pre-payment. Why? The certainty, to quite an extent encouraged by last year's reciprocal setoff, continues to exist among enterprise directors that sooner or later the government, the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, whoever you like, will pay them. This illusory hope is also fed by the fear of facing the truth: if they do not pay, this means that the shipment must be stopped, and consequently, production cut back or completely curtailed. In principle, in a normal economy, the normal producer will do just that. If he is not paid for the goods, why produce them? Our shipping of goods in exchange for "air" stems from the residues of the former mentality. What Reciprocal Setoffs Are Leading To If we look at the experience of other countries with a transitional economy -- Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic -- we observe a considerable amount of non-payment in them. It has been fluctuating at a level of 20-30 percent of the gross domestic product for many years. This problem is being gradually solved by privatization and by enterprises adopting true market behavior. The owner or boss is appearing who is beginning to follow a more efficient policy. This is, of course, possible only after a wave of bankruptcies, unemployment and changes in production structure. In the last few years we have emerged at a non-payment level at which we will stay for several years. In no case should this phenomenon be combated by methods of reciprocal setoff, although this possibility is constantly discussed, and the Central Bank of the Russian Federation is coming forth as a zealous advocate of following it. Just what did carrying out reciprocal setoff lead to last year. Immediately upon the payment of a credit balance, the Central Bank issued a relatively small number of loans, a fact of which it loves to remind us. Apart from the R150 billion of credit emission, however, a little over R1 trillion was issued to the accounts of the commercial banks, which was then transferred to the accounts of the enterprises. In the course of time, the loans were converted into a cash monetary mass, which rained down on our market in a month or two, and gave a colossal splash of inflation. After all, after the January 1992 price shock, the correcting inflation was quite quickly reduced to 10 percent a month. The growth rates of foodstuffs in August of last year were the lowest in the entire history of the reform -- 6 percent a month. The restrictive monetary credit policy followed by the government gave every chance of reducing inflation to 2-3 percent a month by the end of last year. In August the non-payment knot was untied, but at the price of 25-30-percent inflation last autumn. There were, of course, other reasons -- the technical loans to the neighboring countries, the cash ruble banknotes, which were transferred in innumerable amounts to the states of the ruble zone. Carrying out reciprocal setoff, however, was one of the most powerful creditogenic and emissionogenic factors. We carried out one reciprocal setoff. Ukraine carried out four of them. Did they solve any non-payment problem? No. It is as urgent as it was, remains and, apparently, will remain. The enterprise directors, considering the last four reciprocal setoffs, naturally hope that they will not be dropped in the abyss for a fifth time. Reciprocal setoffs are not the least of the reasons that the growth rates of inflation in Ukraine exceeded 40 percent a month in 1993. In September they had 65-percent inflation, and early October estimates fluctuate within a range of 70-80 percent. That is, Ukraine has entered a stage of hyperinflation, in which it is not the solution of the non-payment problem which is regarded as of paramount importance, but the survival of the nation. If we follow this path, we will repeat Ukraine's experience. After all, we now have a real possibility of achieving a reduction in the inflation growth rates. We began the year with 30-percent inflation, in which in some weeks the price growth rate reached 12 percent. The technical mark of hyperinflation was close at hand. From this dangerous level, thanks to the government's consistent and basically restrictive monetary policy (which did not please the overwhelming majority of the people who were getting money), we emerged, in the second week of November, at a level of 2.3 percent. (The results would have been even more impressive if it had not been for the monetary reform, which caused an inflation splash.) If the reciprocal setoff between enterprises is carried out all the same, then all the government's efforts to "beat down" inflation and all the sacrifices that society has made in the last two years will again come to naught. In addition, engaging in reciprocal setoffs for non-payment between enterprises is destroying the producers' adaptation to the changing market structure, and is depriving them of objective criteria. Credit emission is changing their guidelines, and is inclining them toward the paternalistic support of the state. The Problem of Payments with the Neighboring Countries The nature of non-payment among producers who are now foreigners to each other is analogous to that of the domestic, the Russian. Why do the enterprises of the CIS countries continue to supply goods to Russia without waiting for payment from their partners? Because they hope that sooner or later their expenses will be paid. Why do Russian enterprises not introduce pre-payment for their goods and in general do not count on it? Apparently, because they do not need these goods. It is also obvious that the enterprises themselves should solve the problems between them. The states, having established the general rules, do not have the right to interfere in their affairs. The main thing is that the payments pass through the RKTs [accounting-clearing center] on time. Here, the Central Bank must be given its due -- it has made great efforts to accelerate the passage of the payments. Making settlements among the enterprises of the neighboring countries is intensifying, but the Central Bank has not solved another problem -- the lack of a mechanism to determine the exchange rates of national currencies in relation to the Russian ruble. The Central Bank quotes the Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian national currencies through the dollar. The exchange rate of the Ukrainian karbovanets is established at stock exchange marts. For a number of currencies of the neighboring states, however, the quotations are either not introduced at all (they include the Georgian kupon, the Azerbaijan manat), or are introduced at an artificially fixed level -- these are the Belorussian, Uzbek and Kazakh currencies. "Floating" quotations, and market determination of the exchange rate of the currencies of our neighboring countries are vitally necessary. Otherwise, we will continue to subsidize these states due to an overstated currency rate of exchange. Non-Payments and Structural Reorganization If an enterprise director is absolutely certain that no reciprocal setoff for non-payments is in the offing, and that he will receive no help or indulgence from either the government or from the Central Bank, he will stop supplying his goods "for air." Then he will be obliged to change the enterprise's policy: to cut back or completely curtail the output of goods for which he is not paid, and begin to produce things which will be sure to be paid for with real money. The producer will adapt to the market normally, and this will above all be manifested in structural changes in the economy. It is in this that the real sense of all reforms lies. Let us face the truth: structural reorganization is, of course, accompanied by a rise in unemployment. You must pay for everything. Including with unemployment, for this sort of employment structure -- a copy of the production structure -- does not answer the market needs. Even if we have a 20-percent unemployment level in our country, we must remember that this is only one-fifth of the population. When, however, we support industry which does not meet the demands of the market through credit emission, reciprocal setoffs and subsidies, we have inflation, and 100 percent of the population suffers from it. Paradoxically, it is also reassuring that, under the conditions of an economic recession, the production of a number of goods, mainly durable goods -- irons, microwave ovens, freezers and television sets -- is increasing, and for some items -- by 20-30 percent. This is a colossal increase by any measuring standards. At the same time, the production of combines and tractors is being cut back. This means that structural changes are taking place in a sector such as machine building, which has been sluggish all these years. Do you know which sector is feeling the burden of non-payments least of all? The food sector. This is understandable: food products are paid for immediately. The growth rates of this sector in the course of this year have been 2-3 percent. This is the first sector to emerge from the recession. A whole sector and sub-sector (production of household electrical appliances, which is "seated" in machine building) emerged from the crisis, after carrying out structural reorganization. Why them, precisely? Because they stand nearest of all to the consumer market and detect all the demand fluctuations more quickly. Other sectors, however, representing the demand for raw material and completing items, will also gradually emerge from the crisis. Structural reorganization of the economy is a process which will last for more than just a year and even for more than just a decade. It is a real art to sense the demands of the market and attune to it. Products that have not been paid for are among the visible signs of production non-competitiveness. Carrying out reciprocal setoff for non-payments will therefore only distort the pulse of the market and deprive the producer of a market guideline, which is not all that easy to find. </graphic> </graphic> </graphic> </graphic> </graphic> </graphic>
