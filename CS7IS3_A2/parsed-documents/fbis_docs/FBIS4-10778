This is what PT candidate Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said on 13 April to Aviation Colonel Jose Celso Lauande, the center's commander, who met Lula to show him the way the project is operating. The project has been fully developed with Brazilian technology. Lula, who started another stage of his Caravan of the Citizenry in Maranhao, carefully listened to Lauande's briefing. To help him ask the colonel questions, Lula was accompanied by Reserve Colonel Geraldo Cavagnari, who helped the PT design its program for strategic areas and advanced technology. The PT candidate showed his indignation at the fact that the center needs $40 million to operate at full capacity. Of the center's total cost of $260 million, $117 million remains to be provided, for which reason the space program has been considerably delayed.
