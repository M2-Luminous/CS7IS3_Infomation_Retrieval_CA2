But as a world trade leader and defender of ethical, free, and fair competition in international trade, the United States should be the first to observe the rules, and set an example of what it preaches. Following the donation of $800 per ton of frozen chicken exported to Arab countries, the U.S. Government has now decided to grant a bonus, within the same system of subsidies (Export Enhancement Program), of $47 per ton to help sell 798,000 tons of wheat to the PRC. The United States thus has no authority to demand within the GATT/World Trade Organization that developing countries (like Brazil, India, etc.) be condemned for "social dumping" for having lower salaries in their export production sectors than do the industrialized countries.
