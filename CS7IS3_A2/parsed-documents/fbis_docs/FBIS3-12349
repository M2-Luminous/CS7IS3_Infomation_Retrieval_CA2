Hundreds of Palestinian women marched alongside the demonstrators carrying black flags in mourning for the 52 Palestinian Moslems who were killed in a West Bank mosque on Friday by an Israeli settler. They shouted "Death to 'Arafat" and "Death to Zionists" before burning an effigy of the PLO leader at the Martyrs Cemetery, where many Palestinians killed in confrontations with Israelis are buried alongside Lebanese. Supporters of Hezbollah and radical Palestinian organisations based in Damascus participated in the demonstration which took off from outside a mosque in Beirut's mostly Shiite Moslem southern suburbs. Many denounced the September 13 peace deal between the PLO and Israel.
