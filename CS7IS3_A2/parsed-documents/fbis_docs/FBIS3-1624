CRI [China Radio International] correspondent (Li Gengxian) reports from Zhengzhou, capital city of central China's Henan Province. Their large-scale grain wholesale market there is playing a pioneer role in the burgeoning price reform. Here is Du Lijun with the story: [Du Lijun] The price of farm products has long been under strict government control. Under this system, the local governments bought grain from farmers and sold it to the rural residents at fixed low prices. Farmers did not feel motivated to do their job well because there was no profit incentive. In central China's Henan Province, the bread basket of the country, farmers have wished for grain price reform for a long time. Finally, a new grain wholesale market with no preset price control has been set up. Grain and edible oils can be bought and sold at real market value. The Zhengzhou grain wholesale market is the first and only trial market of its kind which has been approved by the State Council. It has been co-organized by the Ministry of Internal Trade and the Henan provincial government. Our correspondent (Li Gengxian) said that since the market opened its doors in 1990, great economic and social benefits have been achieved. It has over 380 network members in 24 of China's provinces and municipalities. They study market demand in order to coordinate grain distribution throughout the country. By the end of last year, about 4 million tonnes of grain and edible oil had been traded. Trade volume in the new market has reached 3.5 billion yuan, or about $410 million. Open and fair competition defines the spirit of the Zhengzhou wholesale market. The grain price settled on among buyers and sellers here is a good source of information for foreign grain market observers. (Li Gengxian) said that because of the success of the wholesale market, the Zhengzhou Commodities Exchange made it stable in May of last year. It is the first farm and subsidies future in China. [sentence as heard] During the second half of last year, the futures market signed more than 1 million standard contracts at a total volume of 3 billion yuan. At the same time, transaction rules and management at the exchange center have improved. The commodity exchange is now automated to enable more efficient trading. Each day, the exchange center delivers information to the world through the ASSOCIATED PRESS and REUTERS news agencies, as well as the China Broadcasting Communications Company. The grain futures exchange center is also building strong business links with its foreign counterparts in the United States, Japan, and Canada. The quick development of the Zhengzhou grain wholesale market and futures exchange center is another door opened for China's rapidly growing economy. [end Du Lijun recording]
