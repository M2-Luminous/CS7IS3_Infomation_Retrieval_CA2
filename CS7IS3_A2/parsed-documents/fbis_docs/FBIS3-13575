The leadership was briefed at the meeting on a number of contacts that took place during the last few days with the envoys of the U.S. Administration, the Russian leadership, the Israeli Government, and the Norwegian Government to the Palestinian leadership. An authoritative Palestinian source stated that the Palestinian stance, which has affirmed the need to take urgent and necessary measures to protect the Palestinian people in the occupied territories following the massacre of the al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron, and to take radical steps to uproot Israeli terrorism, was reiterated to the envoys. The source added that the PLO, while reiterating its commitment to the peace process and its aims, would like to stress the need for urgent action in order that such a process would regain its dynamism and credibility, and in order to create suitable opportunities for making the Declaration of Principles, signed between the PLO and the Israeli Government, successful as soon as possible. The source added that the contacts and meetings, which were held with both the U.S. and Israeli sides, have not produced any real progress that will help in overcoming the hurdles facing the peace process, because of Israel's determination not to take effective and real measures, particularly in Hebron and elsewhere, its insistence on only taking a number of superficial and routine steps and bypassing the stance of the international community, which is being supported by a large part of Israeli public opinion, and on the need to take effective measures to put an end to the terrorist activities of the Israeli settlers, a matter that was also recently boosted by the agreement between Rabin and the SHAS Party. The source added that the PLO stressed that the task of the peace process was to insure security for all. That was why the Palestinian people and all the forces that supported peace in the region were doubtful about the seriousness and credibility of the process in light of the grave threat to the security of the Palestinian people, as a result of the presence of hotbeds of Israeli terrorism in the settlement areas in the occupied territories, and the lack of international protection for the Palestinian people under occupation. The source said that the PLO stressed that it was impossible to overlook the Hebron massacre, its causes, effects and lessons, and that the Israeli Government, which bore full responsibility for the massacre, had encouraged the stepping up of campaigns of repression and killing against the sons of our people after the massacre, and attempted to ignore the fact that the massacre was the outcome of the settlement-based and expansionist ideological structures, and was not the action of an individual or individuals. The official source stressed that while refusing to divert its attention from the core of the matter and the massacre, the PLO emphasized its rejection of any pressures and attempts to compromise on the implementation of the necessary requirements for the protection of the sons of the Palestinian people. The source stressed that while calling on the sons of the Palestinian people to consolidate the unity of ranks, the PLO affirmed that it would continue to work at all levels to insure the security, stability, and protection of the Palestinian people in the framework of any move toward achieving a just and comprehensive peace. The leadership continues to follow up the situation with all the concerned parties and at all levels.
