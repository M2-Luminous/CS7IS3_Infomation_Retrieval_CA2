SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response Title: Collection of Economic and Regulatory Support Data Under RCRA (ICR No. 1641.01). This ICR requests approval for a new collection. Abstract: EPA's Office of Solid Waste (OSW) is requesting approval for a generic clearance to collect economic and regulatory impact data through surveys, interviews, or focus group meetings with industry or other parties in support of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) rulemaking actions. RCRA, as amended by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments, requires EPA to establish a national regulatory program to ensure that hazardous waste is managed in a manner protective of human health and the environment. EPA is authorized under sections 2002 and 3007 of RCRA to collect information from industry and other parties when necessary to carry out its regulatory responsibilities. The information collected will be used to assess the costs and benefits of various potential regulatory and nonregulatory actions. The first collection to be administered under the generic clearance, the Hazardous Waste Identification Rule (HWIR) Expert Elicitations, is included in this ICR. Information will be collected through interviews (expert elicitations) with hazardous and industrial solid waste experts to support development of alternative approaches for hazardous waste identification. The Agency will conduct two sets of expert elicitations, one for each HWIR regulatory option: Contaminated Soil and Sediment Media; and Contaminated Debris. Burden Statement: The public reporting burden for this generic collection is estimated to average 3 hours per response and the burden for the HWIR Expert Elicitations collection ranges from 15 minutes to 1.5 hours per respondent. These estimates include all aspects of the information collection including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Respondents: Hazardous waste generators, scientists, industry experts, and treatment, storage and disposal facilities. Estimated Number of Respondents: 3,000. Estimated Number of Responses per Respondent: 1.4. Estimated Total Annual Burden on Respondents: 12,780 hours. Frequency of Collection: On Occasion. Send comments regarding the burden estimate, or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing the burden, to: Sandy Farmer, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Information Policy Branch (2136), 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460. and Jonathan Gledhill, Office of Management and Budget, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, 725 17th Street, NW., Washington, DC 20503. Dated: June 13, 1994. Paul Lapsley, Director, Regulatory Management Division. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;14819 Filed 6&hyph;16&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;F
