He said Pakistan considers fulfillment of some of the conditions to be imperative -- the reduction in the forces in occupied Kashmir, the release of Kashmiri leaders, and an end to brutal repression -- for the continuation of the dialogue. The foreign minister stated this at a news conference in Islamabad yesterday, during which he commented on the upcoming India-Pakistan foreign secretary-level talks on the Kashmir issue beginning in Islamabad on 2 January. He said that massacre, molestation of women, and the burning of villages all continue in occupied Kashmir with no abatement of Indian brutalities there. Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali said that during the next round of negotiations, comprehensive and detailed discussions will be held on the Kashmir issue and Pakistan will approach the talks with the utmost sincerity in spite of the grave situation prevailing in the occupied valley, because Islamabad believes in the negotiated settlement of this problem. He reiterated Pakistan's commitment to hold talks on all aspects of the Kashmir question and said, unlike New Delhi, Islamabad will fulfill its commitment. India had a long time to improve the situation in occupied Kashmir, and if New Delhi does not take steps to improve the situation in the valley, there is no use holding negotiations on the issue. The foreign minister clarified that Pakistan has not asked China to play the role of intermediary between India and Pakistan. He added that China has expressed profound grief and concern at the atrocities and violation of human rights committed by Indian forces in occupied Kashmir. China, he said, has welcomed the upcoming foreign secretary-level talks between India and Pakistan.
