French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said there was strong pressure to lift the embargo from some sections of the U.S. Congress, the Islamic Conference Organisation and "in France also." Addressing a meeting of the Anglo-American press association, Juppe said: "Can we continue to resist this pressure? I am no longer sure. If the situation bogs down, the pressure will become irresistible." Without an early political solution, he said, the outcome would be "the solution of despair, with immeasurable consequences" and the withdrawal of United Nations peacekeepers. Juppe called for a meeting of the foreign ministers of Russia, the United States and the European Union [EU] to relaunch peace efforts based on the EU's peace plan within 10 days. He urged unity of approach by Washington, Moscow and the EU to prevent the Bosnian protagonists from playing off one against the other, criticising the slowness of "itinerant diplomacy" by the contact group trying to set up new peace negotiations. Juppe also called for Brcko, thought likely to become the next Serbian target in Bosnia, to be declared a security zone "with an air strike in response to the first Serbian shell." Juppe said the Serbs were reportedly moving troops and heavy weapons towards Brcko, where the Bosnian Moslems are seeking access to the Save River, a tributary of the Danube, as part of any peace settlement. The Serbs want control of Brcko to widen a corridor linking their conquests in eastern and western Bosnia. The French foreign minister said that Brcko should be added to the list of six other safe areas in Bosnia including Gorazde, Sarajevo and Srebrenica. Negotiations held under EU auspices had been within a hair's breadth of success before being sidelined by the arrival on the scene of Russian and U.S. diplomats last February within the contact group, he said.
