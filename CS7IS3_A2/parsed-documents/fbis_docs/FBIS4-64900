In Trier, Interior Minister Manfred Kanther (Christian Democratic Union) had to cut short his speech because of the asylum policy and weapons exports to Turkey. There is general indignation about the entire political mess. This is all because of your flirting with the Union. [Scharping] Seven thousand people in Hamburg, 200 from the "Black Bloc," two dozen eggs, and then indignation toward the entire political mess. Do you seriously consider the "Black Bloc" to be a barometer of political development? [DER SPIEGEL] That is how 1968 started. A grand coalition was in power then. [Scharping] There will be no grand coalition this time; you know that. It is historically inaccurate to compare the reform and student movement of the 1960's with the violence-prone "autonomists" of today. [DER SPIEGEL] Are you not worried about being called "Helmut Scharping" or "Kohl with a beard" all the time? [Scharping] That is enough of the cliches. Shall we get to the point? [DER SPIEGEL] Many citizens say you and Kohl share a similar understanding of politics -- both of you want power. [Scharping] No political changes can be made without a majority. But my understanding of politics is fundamentally different from that of Dr. Kohl. Let me give you an example. In over 200 public meetings over the space of several months, the SPD discussed a government program and opened itself up to nonmembers. No other party has done that. [DER SPIEGEL] An internal paper for the Union faction leadership says: "One should note that a lot of the starting positions presented by the SPD could also be adopted by the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Socialist Union [CDU/CSU] without any alterations. The programmatic declarations about the need to safeguard jobs, create new jobs, and combat unemployment cannot be emphasized highly enough." [Scharping] All that means is that the Union wants to adopt the SPD's definitions. Anyone wishing to understand the CDU's policies must view the results of those policies -- for instance, the highest state debts and highest unemployment ever. [DER SPIEGEL] Despite the fact that unemployment has hardly fallen at all, how do you explain that surveys indicate that your popularity and that of the chancellor are growing closer together, and that the Union once again comes before the SPD in terms of economic prerogatives? [Scharping] I read quite different opinions last week, even in DER SPIEGEL. [DER SPIEGEL] Perhaps more and more voters are becoming discouraged because you and the SPD lack a profile. Take a look at employment policy. [Scharping] In Germany this year, there are about 500,000 more unemployed people than there were last year. Foreign demand is increasing. That means we are reaping the fruits of better economic policies in other countries. On the other hand, this government has drastically cut the amount of funds available for an active labor market policy, resulting in 700,000 people losing their jobs. We must close the gap concerning investments and innovation or else there will be no new jobs. [DER SPIEGEL] On the subject of social justice, your own supporters do not see any originality. The magazine of IG Metall wrote that the SPD and the CDU's concepts of taxation policy are as effective as a fire extinguisher in a prairie fire. [Scharping] No. We are going to make three decisions. First of all, we will effectively help families with children by means of a child benefit of 250 marks [DM] per month for every child. Second, we will make the lowest wages free of tax. Third, we will dispense with Kohl and Waigel's idea of a 7.5-percent surtax on every taxpayer and replace it with an extra tax on incomes from DM120,000 upwards in the case of married couples, and DM60,000 upwards in the case of single people. That will relieve over 80 percent of the population, release demand, and set the economy on its legs. [DER SPIEGEL] How will you fill the DM40-50-billion tax loophole that will arise when you make the lowest wage levels free of tax? [Scharping] If the problem is solved within the framework of the taxation system, there will he no loophole. We will see what the experts Waigel has appointed to deal with the tariff reform suggest. [DER SPIEGEL] Your central topic is the combating of unemployment. Have you a chance of winning when the economic upturn occurs? [Scharping] Yes. The SPD's chances are increasing. Apart from that, I would be happy just like every sensible person if unemployment dropped. But before that can happen, the economic situation in Germany must improve. Therefore, we do not want to raise state expenditures above the levels planned in 1995, and even reduce them in the medium term. [DER SPIEGEL] Is the economic upturn not already visible? [Scharping] Tyll Necker, chairman of the Association of German Industry, says that what we have now is no upturn. It is merely a "turn" without the "up." All the experts agree. [DER SPIEGEL] According to surveys, more and more people believe things will improve. Thus, more and more people no longer belong to the SPD. [Scharping] The SPD is in the lead, and a good thing, too. The coalition has not had a majority for months. [DER SPIEGEL] The SDP has once again eaten away at your leading position with the debate on the speed limit. [Scharping] I consider this debate premature. In any case, the SPD also wants a speed limit on freeways. Just like in the United States and Japan, we must treat environmental change as a scientific challenge. All development must be environmentally friendly. [DER SPIEGEL] That is exactly what the automobile industry is saying. After all, it is the SDP that said for decades that a low speed limit is a gauge of environmental responsibility. [Scharping] That is why the speed limit forms part of the program. [DER SPIEGEL] You have not included a 130-kmh speed limit in the program. The SPD has hidden this figure behind the resolutions of the European Parliament. [Scharping] But the resolutions of the European Parliament are clear. The 130-kmh limit will apply to some 90 percent of all freeways. There is no question of concealment. [DER SPIEGEL] Your financial spokesman Oskar Lafontaine refuses point blank to tell motorists what kind of gasoline price increase the SPD's tax reform calls for. Are you afraid to tell the truth before the elections? [Scharping] No, I am not, but the safeguarding of jobs by means of environmentally friendly growth has priority. In the previous presidential election campaign in 1990, the SPD demanded that labor be made less cost-intensive and that the consumption of energy and raw materials should not be detrimental to the environment. At that time, we wanted a tax allowance for using one's car for business purposes, and we wanted car tax to be converted to a tax on gasoline. After that, we thought to ourselves in 1990, the gasoline tax could be gradually increased. But what happened? There is still no tax allowance on the use of cars for business purposes, but there is still a car tax. The Bonn coalition has raised the gasoline tax by about 40 pfennigs, despite its promises and following a loud spate of election propaganda against the SPD. [DER SPIEGEL] Is that why the SPD has no courage to face the truth? [Scharping] On the contrary. The traffic sector must bear the costs it incurs. Let me repeat that jobs and growth come first. Therefore, we must put an end to new taxes and levies. I want to have a modern country that helps citizens, not one that keeps on imposing new taxes on them. [DER SPIEGEL] We were talking about the future financial burden on motorists. [Scharping] Motorists are already burdened enough as it is. Anyone who wants to see a gasoline price of DM5 per liter, like the Greens do, goes against the spirit of the broad ecological reform policy that we in the SPD would like to see. [DER SPIEGEL] The voters expect anyone capable of predicting the errors of others to give accurate information about his own plans. [Scharping] Ernst Ulrich von Weizsaecker from the Wuppertal Environmental Institute supports a continuous increase in energy prices. But even he says that to encourage environmentally friendly development and increase purchasing power, there should be no further financial burdens on the motoring sector. [DER SPIEGEL] But how do you finance the development of a car that consumes three liters of gas per 100 km if you do not drastically raise gasoline prices? [Scharping] That is a question of new technology in car engines and materials. Automobile companies are reacting to international competition and rising energy prices. [DER SPIEGEL] Your program also says that carbon dioxide emissions should be reduced by at least one-quarter by the year 2005. At the same time, you want to consume the same coal levels as today. Experts say one cannot do both at the same time. [Scharping] We must improve the efficiency of fuel, like the case of modern power stations -- for example, those in Saarland. Preserving the coal mining industry and providing it with a secure financial framework involves much more than just safeguarding jobs. Apart from that, a modern energy policy is impossible without solar energy. [DER SPIEGEL] In his latest book, which he considers a kind of pro-SPD election guide, Helmut Schmidt warns against further subsidies for jobs that he considers eternally dependent on budget support, mentioning the coal and steel industries and agriculture as an example. [Scharping] I am pleased about Helmut Schmidt's support. However, that does not mean we think alike on every issue. He has his own head, and I have mine. [DER SPIEGEL] You have set your party a task very early. Within the Union spectrum, the SPD could win 15 percent of the votes; within the Greens spectrum, it might win 4 percent. [Scharping] Not quite. I said that some 15 percent of the electorate fluctuates between the CDU and SPD, and 4 percent fluctuates between the SPD and Greens. [DER SPIEGEL] Many have interpreted this as a call to compete for the political center. [Scharping] It is not a question of competition. The point is that the SPD has returned to the center of social problems. We are dealing here with a competition between the CDU and the SPD concerning the political leadership in Germany. [DER SPIEGEL] How seriously do you take the warning of Reinhard Klimmt, SPD faction chief in the Saarland, one of your closest aides, whereby the SPD would jeopardize its "political efficiency" if it neglected the environmentally conscious part of its electorate and the social movements? According to him, one-third of SPD voters give second preference to the Greens, and 80 percent of the Greens give second preference to the SPD. [Scharping] It is our joint conviction that reform policy geared to the year 2000 and beyond must combine an essential economic growth with equally essential environmental progress. [DER SPIEGEL] Then how do you explain the criticism of Green spokesman Ludger Volmer, who feels nothing but malice vis-a-vis the SPD program? [Scharping] That man is waging an election struggle. The Greens, however, enjoy no political monopoly. They have no right to decide who or what is environmental, like some high priest. [DER SPIEGEL] Fewer and fewer Greens fancy sharing a government with Scharping's SPD, and, five months before the elections, the political distance from the Union is becoming smaller and smaller. [Scharping] The strongest party always finds a partner. In the end, there will be more partners than necessary. That increases the SPD's possibilities and makes it easier to negotiate. [DER SPIEGEL] You said that even if you lose the elections, you will still go to Bonn to lead the opposition. Are you sure your comrades would like to have you in this role? [Scharping] I am going to Bonn, preferably as chancellor. Can you imagine Germany enjoying a good future with another four years of Kohl? [DER SPIEGEL] Thank you for the interview, Herr Scharping.
