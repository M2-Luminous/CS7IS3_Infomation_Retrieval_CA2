FR940317-1-00162 FR940317-1-00014 •A description of how the State will meet the rural expenditure requirements under seciton 307(a)(3)(B) of the Act, •An exhibit that details how the State meets the requirements of 307(a)(37) of the Act to identify total actual and projected costs of providing services in rural areas, •A comparison between the current intrastate funding formula and the proposed one using the best available demographic data, the Commissioner's guidelines, the geographic distribution of older individuals, and of those older individuals in greatest economic and greatest social need with particular attention to low-income minority older individuals, as required by section 305(a)(2)(C) of the Act including: •A numerical statement comparing the current intrastate funding formula to the proposed one under section 305(a)(2)(C); •A comparison of the population, economic, and social data for each planning and service area used for the current and for the proposed formulas; and •A comparison and demonstration of the allocation of Title III funds allocated to each planning and service area under the current intrastate funding formula and the one proposed; (2) Section 1321.17(c)(5) is added to assist AoA in monitoring and assessing the State's progress in meeting the new requirements under section 307(a)(37) of the Act which require that State plans identify, for each fiscal year of the plan, the actual and projected additional costs for providing services to older individuals residing in rural areas. In addition, the information obtained under this section will assist AoA in carrying out the requirements of section 202(b)(27)(A) of the Act which requires the Commissioner to ``conduct a study to determine ways in which Federal funds might be more effectively targeted to low-income minority older individuals, and older individuals residing in rural areas, to better meet the needs of States with a disproportionate number of older individuals with greatest economic need and older individuals with greatest social need.'' It is our expectation that providing this information in the State plan will greatly reduce the paperwork burden that would be incurred with a separate national study conducted solely for this purpose. Accordingly, using the definition of rural areas in §1321.3 of this NPRM, we propose that each State plan include a table displaying planning and service areas (PSA's) ranked by the proportion of rural older individuals in each as a percentage of the rural population in the State; showing the distribution of Title III funds in each PSA under the current intrastate funding formula and under the proposed intrastate funding formula (IFF); and the source of the distribution information (which must by law be the best available data).
