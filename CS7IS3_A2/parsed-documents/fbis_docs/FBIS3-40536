STEP, a product model data conversion standard, is the result of development by specialists in Japan, the U.S., Europe and other countries. It appears that all twelve parts of STEP's initial release finally will be lined up and will be released as part of the ISO 10303 document. In Japan, participants in the STEP Center -- including companies such as Toshiba, NEC, Hitachi, Fujitsu, and Mitsubishi Electric -- have succeeded in experiments using STEP data conversion management prototype systems to convert data from drawings, thus confirming that data can be converted accurately. The time is arriving for practical applications of STEP. It is anticipated that a second version of STEP will be issued after two to three years during which data conversion experiments involving international joint development will continue to expand the applicability of data conversion. ``Version 2'' in Two to Three Years Currently several intermediate file formats such as IGES and DXF are used as data conversion standards for CAD/CAM systems. However, these have defects such as vagueness in interpretation of specifications and inability to be converted to product management information due to data conversion's focus on display data. Moreover, demand for data conversion between different systems is rising with the increasing complexity and sophistication of data conversion as LANs (local area networks) spread and CAD/CAM systems' capabilities advance. STEP solves the problems of existing standards and proceeds toward standardization with the goal of achieving complete data convertibility at all stages of product lifecycles. Success in Conversion Experiments A data conversion management prototype system using the STEP standard has already been developed. Experiments have been carried out which successfully converted the 3-dimensional solid model, 2-dimensional basic geometric shape, free curve and curve shape data that is essential to STEP. The development system has been revised for V01, V02, and the improved version of V01. For the improved version of V02, specification definitions are described in EXPRESS language for conversion between data models and general-purpose systems that rely on a special application protocol. Some of the special features are as follows. A dictionary is automatically generated from the schema described EXPRESS. SPI (standard application programming interface) is offered. The dual advantages of the code creation method and the real-time interpretation method are used. A STEP environment (STEP cell) is offered. This development system is used for conducting experiments on data conversion of 2-dimensional drawing data between current commercial CAD systems and will expand experimentation to 3-dimensional data, product modeling, industry-specific application models, and so on. This is for the purpose of issuing version 2 of the ISO's STEP standard in two to three years. The phrase ``data conversion for CAD/CAM systems'' doesn't suggest the variety and breadth of fields that are affected by STEP. Unconscious of Compatibility The first version of the standard which will be issued in April 1994 is about two thousand pages of standards on twelve topics [sic]: overview; EXPRESS language specifications; physical files and mapping rules; methodology, framework, and general concept for verification; foundation for product description and support; framework for expression of shape expression (geometric and phase); product structure and composition; representation; basic models of products; drawings; and composition management design. Practical application of STEP, the key to integrating next-generation CAD/CAM systems, makes possible the accurate and efficient conversion by differing machines of vast quantities of design data created and amassed by CAD/CAM systems. This means that product design can be made more efficient and design quality can be increased through the integrated use of design data between and inside companies. Moreover, CAD/CAM users will be able to replace and introduce new kinds of CAD/CAM systems without thinking about compatibility. STEP-based accurate data conversion between CAD/CAM systems is essential for progressing with system architecture for CIM (computer-integrated manufacturing) which is being promoted as part of the corporate movement toward greater use of information systems. The STEP Center is continuing with data conversion experiments with an eye to establishing the second version of STEP. The experiments will aim at achieving perfect conversion of product model data by addressing problems such as the small differences between CAD/CAM systems in data expression specifications even when data is accurately converted by STEP. For example, this involves small differences such as the size of characters and shape of arrows.
