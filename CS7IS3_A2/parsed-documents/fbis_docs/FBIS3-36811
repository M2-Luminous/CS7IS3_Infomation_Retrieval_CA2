Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's address was connected with his recent trip around former Yugoslavia. According to him, "millions of Serbs are appealing to Russia for protection." After a brief excursus on the history of that country, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy said the people living in Bosnia-Herzegovina are "a single Orthodox people, some of whom at some time were forcibly converted into Islam and Catholicism." In the opinion of the LDPR leader, the only way to resolve the Yugoslav problem is to withdraw all foreign military contingents and afterward "the people who live there will decide for themselves what they should do next." The economic sanctions against Belgrade, he thinks, will also fail to achieve results. "Children are dying because of them," Vladimir Zhirinovskiy believes. Vladimir Zhirinovskiy called on the Duma to adopt a unanimous position on the matter. On behalf of "the party which won the elections on 12 December," he said, "the countries whose pilots will dare to bomb Serbian positions will be completely eliminated." After this statement by the LDPR leader there were numerous requests from the audience to switch off Zhirinovskiy's microphone. Then he promised all parliamentarians unhappy with his address "a trip to the north in the very near future." "Russia's Choice" deputy Viktor Davydkin, who spoke after Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, proposed to the chairman that the microphones of those people's elects who take liberties to speak "in the tone and style of the LDPR leader" should be switched off. In addition, Yuliy Gusman, another "Russia's Choice" deputy, addressing Vladimir Zhirinovskiy as "one Orthodox Christian addressing another Orthodox Christian," demanded that the latter should stop provoking the people's elects and said that, apart from the LDPR leader, "there are a lot of loud-voiced and boorish deputies in the audience ready to give a proper rebuff to Vladimir Zhirinovskiy." Yuliy Gusman also promised Vladimir Zhirinovskiy that it would be him who would go to the north "in the very near future, together with his relatives."
