Potdar, designated judge dealing with cases under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, has acquitted a Nigerian national who was accused of being in possession of over 16 kg of brown sugar on the ground that there were discrepancies in the police version and that the prosecution had not been able to prove its case. Bernard Ugochukwa Acaribe was arrested at Bombay Central railway station at about 3.30 p.m. on April 6, 1989. The police said he was carrying a big suitcase in which were 18 Samsonite rexin handbags containing brown sugar. Samples of the brown powder were sent to the chemical analyser who confirmed that it was a crude form of heroin. The accused was arrested and was subsequently charge-sheeted on January 27, 1994. He was brought to trial before Judge Potdar. Before the trial commenced, however, the drug allegedly seized from the Nigerian was destroyed in keeping with the provisions of section 52 of the Act. The accused told the court that he had been falsely implicated in the case. He alleged that he had not been arrested at Bombay Central station at all and that he had, in fact, been picked up at Marine Drive area on April 6, 1989. He said that the drugs were not found on him and that the suitcase and its contents were planted on him. Judge Potdar recorded in his order that it was difficult to believe that the Nigerian was guilty of the offence alleged against him since there were material discrepancies between the evidence given by police officers and a panch witness. The judge also found fault with the chemical analyser's report since it did not mention the per cent of the drug in the brown powder that was seized. While one police officer, Mr Bagwan, told the court that he did not remember how the suitcase was opened, another officer, Mr Birje, stated that it had a combination lock. However, the panch witness testified that the accused opened the bag with a key. All the three were part of the raiding party that arrested the Nigerian. While one of the police officers told the court that the samples to be sent to the analyser were collected in polythene bags, the panch witness said that they were collected in paper envelopes. Judge Potdar mentioned that both the officers and the panch witness were present at the time the accused was accosted. The order also recorded that there were discrepancies in the weight of the 18 packets as mentioned by the police in different records. The judge pointed out that the panch witness differed with the police officers with regard to the colour of the powder seized, the mode in which the samples were packed and the manner in which the suitcase was opened. Judge Potdar agreed that a person could be convicted merely on the testimony of police officers if the panch witness turned hostile. But in such a case, the evidence of the officers had to be unimpeachable. Mr V.I. Panwani appeared for the state of Maharashtra. Mr Ravi Gurnani, Mr P.S. Hingorani and Mr Ayas R. Khan represented the accused.
