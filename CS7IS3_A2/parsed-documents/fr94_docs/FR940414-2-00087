FR940414-2-00087 FR940414-2-00064 PENSION BENEFIT GUARANTY CORPORATION Request for Extension of Approval of Collection of Information Under the Paperwork Reduction Act; Requests for PBGC Approval of Multiemployer Plan Amendments AGENCY: Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. ACTION: Notice of request for OMB approval. SUMMARY: The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (``PBGC'') has requested that the Office of Management and Budget (``OMB'') extend approval, under the Paperwork Reduction Act, of a collection of information in its regulation on Procedures for PBGC Approval of Plan Amendments (29 CFR part 2677) (OMB control number 1212&hyph;0031; expires May 31, 1994). The effect of this notice is to advise the public of the PBGC's request and solicit public comment on this collection of information. ADDRESSES: All written comments (at least three copies) should be addressed to Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project (1212&hyph;0040), Washington, DC 20503. The PBGC's request for extension will be available for inspection at the PBGC's Communications and Public Affairs Department, suite 240, 1200 K Street NW., Washington, DC 20005&hyph;4026, between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Judith Neibrief, Attorney, Office of the General Counsel, Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, 1200 K Street NW., Washington, DC 20005&hyph;4026, 202&hyph;326&hyph;4024 (202&hyph;326&hyph;4179 for TTY and TDD). (These are not toll-free numbers.) SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (``PBGC'') administers the pension plan termination insurance programs under Title IV of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (``ERISA'') (29 U.S.C. 1001 et seq .). Section 4220 of ERISA (29 U.S.C. 1400) requires the plan sponsor of a multiemployer pension plan covered by Title IV of ERISA to submit for PBGC review certain plan amendments authorized by ERISA sections 4201 through 4219 (29 U.S.C. 1381&hyph;1399). These amendments deal with modification of the statutory provisions regarding when a withdrawal from a multiemployer plan occurs and how the withdrawing employer's withdrawal liability is determined. Any such amendment is effective only if the PBGC approves it or, within 90 days after receiving notice and a copy of the amendment, fails to disapprove it. The PBGC may disapprove an amendment only if it determines that the amendment creates an unreasonable risk of loss to plan participants and beneficiaries or to the PBGC. Part 2677 of the PBGC's regulations (29 CFR part 2677), Procedures for PBGC Approval of Plan Amendments, includes, in ยง2677.2, rules for plan sponsor requests for agency approval of multiemployer plan amendments. Paragraph (d) of ยง2677.2 requires the submission of information that the PBGC needs to identify a plan and evaluate the risk of loss, if any, posed by the amendment (and, hence, determine whether it should disapprove the amendment). The regulation also permits submission of other information the plan sponsor believes to be pertinent to its requests. The PBGC is requesting that the Office of Management and Budget (``OMB'') extend approval of this collection of information (OMB control number 1212&hyph;0031; expires May 31, 1994) for another three years. The agency estimates that it will receive three requests annually and that each request will take two hours to prepare, for a total annual burden of six hours. Issued in Washington, DC this 8th day of April, 1994. Martin Slate, Executive Director, Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.
