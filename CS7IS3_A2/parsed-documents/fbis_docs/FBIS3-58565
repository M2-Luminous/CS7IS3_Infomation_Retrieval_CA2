We will continue with a working dinner, and will probably remain in contact with you to brief you on what will be discussed over dinner. At the invitation of the Greek Presidency of the European Union, we welcome Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg to Athens. We also welcome Ambassador (Marsais) and Messrs. (Landlow), (Ramsarand), (Sabenoir) and (Dan) from the European Commission. The subject of our talks is known; it is the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina. We exchanged views, we briefed each other on the latest developments and the ongoing effort by the cochairmen [of the Geneva conference on the former Yugoslavia] and the Greek Presidency of the European Union. You know things are difficult. We are trying to do something better than has been done. We always hope. We hope the Geneva talks will be positive. The Greek Presidency will make every effort to achieve a positive outcome in Geneva, doing as much as it can to influence things with the interested parties. You also know that today we begin what is the first chapter in the efforts of the Greek Presidency toward achieving an immediate cease-fire in Bosnia-Herzegovina and promoting the Franco-German plan we have accepted in the European Union, enforced as I said with the thoughts and views of the Greek Presidency, especially as Greece is a Balkan country. Thank you very much, now I turn the podium over to Lord Owen. [Owen, in English followed by Greek translation at the end of his remarks] Mr. Foreign Minister, first of all, Mr. Stoltenberg and I thank you very much indeed for your hospitality. As you say, the meeting will continue but it is very important at this early stage in the Greek Presidency that both of us should exchange views with you. As you say, as a Balkan state, you contribute to the European Union from the depth of knowledge and of your proximity to this tragic situation. There is no doubt that the neighbors to the former Yugoslavia are paying a very heavy price, not just financially but in many other respects for the continued fight and the destruction that this is causing in the region. Therefore, we must profoundly hope that we can make a comprehensive peace settlement and we certainly approach the talks in Geneva with that intent, that one has to say that if the public statements of the parties are to be believed, then the prospects are not very good. But let us hope that those are statements for the morale of the fighting forces and that when it comes to the actual negotiations, the parties will seek the difficult compromises which can alone achieve a peace settlement.
