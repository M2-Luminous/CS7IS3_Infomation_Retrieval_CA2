L. Zaytsev, A. G. Sokolskiy, O. R. Rzhiga, A. S. Vyshlov, A. P. Krivtsov and V. A. Shubin; UDC 621.396.96:523.6] [Abstract] Precise radar observations of the asteroid 4179 (Toutatis) were made on 8 and 9 December 1992 when the asteroid approached the Earth to within a minimum distance of 3.6 million km. The asteroid, discovered in 1986 by French astronomers, can be identified with 1934 CT, discovered in 1934 but then lost. The angle between the orbital planes of the Earth and Toutatis is only 0.46ï¿½ and it constitutes a potential danger to the Earth. Radar measurements of the Doppler shift of echo signals made possible a substantial improvement in the orbital parameters, an increase in the reliability of prediction of orbital motion and an evaluation of the degree of danger of collision during its periodic approaches to the Earth. The supplementation of the 136 optical observations of the asteroid made between 1934 and 1992 by recent radar data reduced the prediction error for 29 September 2004 when the asteroid will approach the Earth to a distance of 0.01 AE. An analysis of the spectra of reflected signals revealed that this is a double asteroid consisting of approximately equal bodies which are in close contact. An estimate of the period of asteroid rotation made using measurements of the spectral width of the echo signal on the assumption that the axis of rotation is normal to the line of sight suggests rotation with a period 5.7...6.5 days. The radar albedo of the asteroid is 0.08 if its radius is 2 km. Its surface characteristics were determined, as were the polarization ratio and radar cross section. The asteroid will be within the limits of accessibility of national radar apparatus at the time of successive approaches in 1996, 2000 and 2004. Figures 5; references 12: 5 Russian, 7 Western.
