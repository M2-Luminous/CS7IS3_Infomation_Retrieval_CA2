FBIS3-28590 "dreas026__a94011" FBIS-EAS-94-026-A Document Type:Daily Report 8 February 1994 ANNEX Japan Tokyo To Adopt Action Program for Procurement OW0302121094 Tokyo YOMIURI SHIMBUN in Japanese 2 Feb 93 Morning Edition p 1 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0302121094 Tokyo YOMIURI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] It was learned on 1 February that the government has formulated a draft action program for government procurement in response to foreign criticism that Japan's current procedures for the government procurement lack transparency. The draft action program calls for: 1) making it a principle for the government to procure goods through open competitive contracts; 2) lowering the size of government procurement subject to public announcement from the current amount of 1 million SDRs (the IMF's special drawing right and approximately 162 million yen) to 0.8 million SDRs (approximately 130 million yen) and expanding opportunities for foreign firms to obtain information on the government procurement; and 3) making all goods subject to the current complaint-addressing procedure in order for foreign companies to file their complaints with the government about its procurement. The government, which will formally decide on the draft action program at a cabinet meeting on 4 February, plans to brief the U.S. side on the draft action program at the Japan-U.S. summit talks on 11 February. Both Japan and the United States have been locked in a sharp confrontation in their negotiations on the government procurement under the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks. The government intends to break the deadlock in the negotiations by describing the action program as a "declaration of the Japanese market opening in the government procurement sector," (says a Foreign Ministry source). The draft action program calls for making it a principle for the government to procure goods through open competitive contracts which allow foreign firms to bid for contracts out of consideration to U.S. complaint that "Japan's free (individual) contracts shut foreign firms out of biddings for the contracts." The draft action program explicitly calls for cutting the number of free contracts that are concluded between the government and the government- designated individual enterprise. The draft action program also calls for the need to raise the transparency in the government procurement by announcing the government's procurement plans beforehand in the Official Gazette even if the government inevitably concludes free contracts. In the government procurement of computers in which the U.S. companies are greatly interested, the draft action program calls for adopting a general assessment formula under which the performance of computers is assessed as a criteria for procurement judgment in addition to the current tender formula under which contracts go to under-bidders [saiteikakaku rakusatsuhoshiki]. As for large-scale government procurement, the government has made public its plans for the procurement of goods worth more than 1 million SDRs once in January every year since 1991, but the draft action program calls for holding down the amount to more than 0.8 million SDRs. For foreign firms which are eager to bid for contracts but have no detailed knowledge of the government procurement, this step will promote their market access by helping them gain more and quick information on the government procurement. As part of freedom of information efforts, the government intends to increase the transparency of its procurement by releasing an annual report (white paper) on the government procurement. In addition, the government plans to expand the application of the current procedure to address foreign complaints about the government procurement of computers to all other goods. As part of steps to prevent a recurrence of bid riggings, the government plans to ask the Fair Trade Commission to set a guideline on biddings for the government procurement and deal sternly with illegal practices.
