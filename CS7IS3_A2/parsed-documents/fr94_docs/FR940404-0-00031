FR940404-0-00031 FR940404-0-00014 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Michael Ball of the Regional/State/Local Coordination Section at (202) 233&hyph;9005. See the ADDRESSES caption for the mailing address. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background On August 19, 1987, EPA proposed a two-phase national program to reduce summertime gasoline volatility. 1 EPA found that gasoline had become increasingly volatile, which caused an increase in evaporative emissions from gasoline powered sources. These emissions are volatile organic compounds (VOCs), a precursor of ozone and a major contributor to the nation's serious ground level ozone problem which results in harm to human health and to the public welfare. The Agency published a Notice of Final Rulemaking on March 22, 1989 that put into place Phase I of the program to require VOC reductions available through refining changes that could be accomplished by the beginning of the 1989 summer ozone season. 2 The Phase II volatility standards were finalized on June 11, 1990 3 and went into effect May 1, 1992. 4 1 52 FR 31274 (August 16, 1987). 2 54 FR 11868 (March 22, 1989). 3 54 FR 23658 (June 11, 1990). 4 As described in greater detail in the Background section, the Phase II regulations were repromulgated to incorporate changes in the federal RVP program as directed by the Act. The final rule for the Phase I program established a federal volatility standard in Colorado of 10.5 psi for the month of May, and 9.5 for June through September 15. The Phase II rule required a further reduction in the volatility standard to 9.0 psi for May and 7.8 psi for June 1 through September 15 beginning in 1992. Under the Phase I and Phase II approach, the gasoline volatility levels were applicable on a state-wide basis. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, however, established new requirements for the fuel volatility program. Section 211(h) of the Act as amended required that EPA modify the Phase II fuel volatility program. Section 211(h)(1) requires that EPA promulgate regulations making it unlawful to sell, offer for sale, dispense, supply, offer for supply, transport, or introduce into commerce, gasoline with an RVP level in excess of 9.0 psi during the high ozone season as defined by the Administrator. It further provides that EPA shall establish more stringent RVP standards in nonattainment areas if EPA finds such standards are ``necessary to achieve comparable evaporative emissions reductions, on a per vehicle basis, in such areas, taking into consideration the enforceability of such standards, the need of an area for emission control, and economic factors.'' The Act also allows EPA to impose an RVP standard lower than 9.0 psi in any former ozone nonattainment area which is redesignated as being in attainment. On May 29, 1991, EPA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking which modified the Phase II summer ozone volatility standards to reflect new section 211(h) of the Act. 5 In this notice, EPA proposed that, beginning in 1992, the RVP standard would be 9.0 psi in all attainment areas where this standard was not already in place. The effect of this proposal was to prohibit the sale of gasoline with a Reid Vapor Pressure above 9.0 psi during the summer ozone season in all areas designated attainment for ozone for 1992 and beyond. For areas that had been designated as nonattainment, EPA proposed that the original Phase II standards published on June 11, 1990 not be changed. On December 12, 1991 EPA finalized these modifications. 6 5 56 FR 24242 (May 29, 1991). 6 56 FR 64704 (December 12, 1991). The Denver-Boulder metropolitan area is designated nonattainment for the ozone NAAQS. The nonattainment area which encompasses Denver's entire six-county Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area, with the exception of Rocky Mountain National Park in Boulder County and the eastern portions of Adams and Arapahoe Counties. Under the Phase II rule finalized on December 12, 1991, the standard applicable in the Denver-Boulder nonattainment area beginning in 1992 was determined to be 9.0 psi in May and 7.8 psi from June 1 to September 15. The standard applicable in other areas of Colorado was established at 9.0 psi from May 1 to September 15. On November 6, 1991, EPA issued its ozone nonattainment designations in the Federal Register pursuant to section 107(d)(1)(C) of the Act, as amended. In the November 6, 1991 notice, EPA designated the Denver-Boulder nonattainment area to be a ``transitional area'' as determined under section 185A of the Act, as amended. A transitional area is ``an area designated as an ozone nonattainment area as of the date of enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (that) has not violated the national primary ambient air quality standard for ozone for the 36-month period commencing on January 1, 1987, and ending on December 31, 1989.'' As stated in the preamble for the Phase II volatility controls 7 and reiterated in the proposed change to the volatility standards published on May 29, 1991, 8 EPA will rely on states to initiate changes to the EPA volatility program that they believe will enhance local air quality and/or increase the economic efficiency of the program, within the statutory limits. EPA provided a mechanism for the Governor of a state to request a less stringent volatility standard for some month or months, if the petition could demonstrate the existence of a particular local economic impact that made such changes appropriate and if the petition could demonstrate that sufficient alternative programs were available to achieve attainment and maintenance of the ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). 7 The Phase II final rulemaking established procedures by which states could petition EPA for more or less stringent volatility standards. 55 FR 23660 (June 11, 1980). 8 56 FR 24242 (May 29, 1991).
