The man in charge of the planing portfolio in the PNA is Dr. Nabil Sha'th: [Begin Sha'th recording] The PNA held its first session today, with the participation of all its members who are now present in Gaza and Jericho. It was an important session that laid the groundwork for the organizational structures. We agreed to adopt a spirit of teamwork and on the need for each department to have its own organization and budget. We will be holding weekly sessions in Jericho and Gaza alternately. We will next meet in Jericho next Sunday [3 July], God willing. We also agreed to meet again after lunch for another look at certain important matters, including the detainees and prisoners, as well as mundane, everyday issues in Gaza and Jericho. The PNA then met with a World Bank team to assure themselves that the money flows from the donor nations via the World Bank channels will be enough to meet the current expenses of all the departments and municipal projects, including one to clean up Gaza. The World Bank team answered all the questions that were put to them. They have now returned to Jerusalem. I will have my first meeting with General Danny Rothschild next Tuesday at Eretz [crossing point from Gaza to Israel] to work out the mechanism and agenda and methodology [preceding word in English] for future negotiations and committee meetings. It will be a preparatory session. Before my meeting with Gen. Rothschild, I will confer with Minister Yosi Sarid also at Eretz. I will likely travel to Cairo Thursday [30 June] for a scheduled meeting with Belgium's foreign minister and the donor nations. On 4 July, the Palestinian Police Support Group is due to convene its first meeting. It will bring together representatives of all the donor nations. [end recording] Reacting to the findings of the Shamgar Commission [the inquiry that investigated the 25 February massacre of Muslim worshipers in Hebron by Dr. Baruch Goldstein], Dr. Nabil Sha'th said: [Begin Sha'th recording] The matter is now on brother Abu-'Ammar's [Yasir 'Arafat] desk. I think the entire PLO Executive Committee membership will also look at the findings. [end recording]
