[Serreqi] Albania issued several official announcements to the fact that it respects the borders of its neighbors and opposes any change in them by force. However, we are greatly concerned by the conditions under which the Albanian minorities in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], and especially in Kosovo, live. We demand that their normal human and national rights are respected. They must have the democratic possibility to express their opinion. [STANDART NEWS] If the conflict in Bosnia is resolved, will Serbian aggression in Kosovo follow? [Serreqi] I think that the crisis in the former Yugoslav Federation has many aspects. The fighting in Bosnia is the gravest and most tragic aspect, but the conflict also has other dimensions. One of them is Kosovo. If the conflict spreads there, it will affect the entire Balkan peninsula. This is precisely why we insist on the deployment of international observers in Kosovo. They would prevent the expansion of the conflict and facilitate the discussion about Kosovo's official status. We think that the first thing that must be done is to return to the Albanians in Kosovo the rights and autonomy that the Constitution of 1974 guaranteed them. [STANDART NEWS] Do you want the restoration of that constitution? [Serreqi] No. The Albanians in Kosovo must discuss the future of their region, but this is where the discussion must start. It is unacceptable to speak about another autonomy, which will not even guarantee the conditions provided by the older constitutions. Thus, if the peace process progresses, then the sanctions and all measures of the international community vis-a-vis Serbia must be connected not only to Bosnia but also to the other crisis areas -- Kosovo, Krajina, Vojvodina, Sandzak.... [STANDART NEWS] What could you say about the Serbian protest against your proposal? They think that Kosovo is their internal matter. [Serreqi] Kosovo is not an internal Serbian problem, because it is not an integral part of their country. This is not even a regional, but rather an international issue. An Albanian Government cannot decide whether there should be an intervention or not. However, the Albanians will react on a national basis, because the people in Kosovo are a physical part of Albania. [STANDART NEWS] Do you maintain any contacts with Rugova -- the prime minister of the self-proclaimed Republic of Kosovo, recognized only by Albania? [Serreqi] We maintain constant contacts. The Albanians in Kosovo demonstrated their civilized character by silently withstanding the terrible pressure and the violation of human rights. The tension reached a critical level about one year ago, when the Serbian expelled the CSCE observers from the region. Despite this Rugova and the other leaders continue to control the situation. However, we are concerned, because the people there feel abandoned. [STANDART NEWS] Could you comment on the rumors that Albania supported a coup attempt on the part of the Macedonian Albanians, revealed four months ago by the government in Skopje? [Serreqi] Albania was among the first countries which recognized Macedonia. We are convinced that this country's sovereignty is in the foundation of the region's stability. We are prepared to help Macedonia to endure more easily the consequences of the Greek sanctions. However, it is obvious that our relations with Macedonia are connected with the situation of the Albanian minority there, which is about 35 percent of the population. I am sure that the Macedonian Government could and should do more for the Albanians' rights. [STANDART NEWS] Could you nevertheless compare the rights of the Albanians in Macedonia and Kosovo? [Serreqi] Of course, the situation is not identical. The Albanians in Kosovo are subjected to horrible repressions. Nevertheless, I think that the Albanians in Macedonia must acquire the status of "first class" citizens -- as all the rest. Macedonia should be declared a multinational status. It is very suited for this. After all, Bulgarians, Macedonians, Albanians, Serbs, and Greeks live there.
