Although his imminent departure has yet to be announced, securities experts in China and overseas have already begun to wonder whether his resignation will mean any policy changes on mainland enterprises' domestic and overseas listings. "The general feeling in China's securities industry is that (Mr) Liu should take the blame for the B-share doldrums in the two mainland stock markets, which has lasted for more than a year," one source said. "He has been criticised by the mainland exchange officials as having been paying too much attention to the A-share market and has neglected the (development of the) B-share market. Such a situation was crucial in his downfall," the source added. A securities watchdog spokeswoman in Beijing refused to comment on the strong rumours of Mr Liu's resignation. When questioned, she said: "I don't know...this is not a question that we would be in a position to answer". Mr Liu seemed to favour overseas listings in the form of H- shares, preferring this form of raising capital to cultivating a solid infrastructure for B-share markets. The 64-year-old, Soviet-educated economic technocrat is a former deputy governor of the People's Bank of China and vice-minister of the State Commission for Restructuring the Economy. He is regarded as China's best-known banker overseas. He was appointed the central bank's vice-governor in 1982 and has represented China at meetings of the International Monetary Fund. Mr Liu was appointed to the hot seat when the national securities watchdog was set up in 1992. His appointment at that time was read as a compromise of interests between the State Commission for Restructuring the Economy and the central bank. The development of the securities industry in China has long been a power game between the two entities. Before the setting-up of the national-securities watchdog, stock market development was nominally under the Stock Exchange Executive Council (SEEC) but in practice was under the supervision of central bank. The bank played both a policy-making and an executive role through the financial divisions of its local branches in Shanghai and Shenzhen. When the CSRC was formed, the State Commission for Restructuring the Economy appeared to have in turn gained an upper hand. But struggles went on behind the scene. "(The) CSRC is a coveted body in China. It represents influence and money," one local analyst said. It is said Mr Liu will be succeeded by the 54-year-old Hong Hu, who is presently the vice-minister of the State Commission for Restructuring the Economy. His formal appointment will underline the diminishing role of the central bank in the securities industry. Swiss Bank Corporation associate director Lawrence Ang noted that the development of the mainland securities industry had reached a critical point, and it made Mr Liu's departure more unusual. "His apparent preference for H-share listings overseas, American listings in particular, plus the recently announced measure of doubling the number of B shares by the end of the year have been extremely controversial," Mr Ang said.
