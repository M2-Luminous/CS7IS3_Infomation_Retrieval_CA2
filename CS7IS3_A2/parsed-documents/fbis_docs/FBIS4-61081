It is worth noting that this took place on the eve of the holiday celebrating solidarity among working people. The desire to change anything and everything in Russia has not bypassed May Day either. It has been proposed that henceforth it be called the spring labor holiday. A fine name, of course, but it does not reflect this date's historical essence. As we know, it was not at all because joy filled their hearts that workers first went out onto the streets on 1 May. Russian working people have few reasons for rejoicing now either. That is why columns of working people will be carrying not flowers and leaders' portraits (as was the case at festivities full of false cheer) but demands and appeals to those who are in power. On the eve of May Day TRUD's correspondent met with FITUR Chairman Mikhail Shmakov. [Yemchenko] Mikhail Viktorovich, you recently had a meeting with the Russian president. What prompted it and what problems were discussed? [Shmakov] The meeting was organized at our request. The economic situation in the country has hit labor collectives above all. The mutual nonpayments crisis has led to a situation whereby wages have stopped being paid to people. Social tension in certain regions and sectors of production has reached a critical level. Therefore the need for a direct meeting with the head of state arose, in order to make him aware of the full seriousness of the current situation and to state the Russian trade unions' position without using intermediaries. [Yemchenko] What were the results of the talk with the president? [Shmakov] I must observe that Boris Nikolayevich reacted to our alarm with understanding. After our meeting, incidentally, he instructed Premier V. Chernomyrdin to solve the problems which caused the closure of Zil's [I.A. Likhachev Motor Vehicle Plant] main production line. Questions of reorganizing industrial enterprises were discussed at the meeting with Yeltsin. Putting it simply, problems of bankruptcy. Our position is quite definite here: Every enterprise must be dealt with individually. Plants and factories are often being shut down not because there is no demand for their output but because consumers do not have the means to purchase it. It became apparent from the conversation with the president that some of his advisers are urging the head of state and government to take what is in their view an easier path: Declaring bankrupt all enterprises which are currently unable to settle accounts for raw materials, energy, and transportation services. But this measure will lead to one-half of the country's being unemployed. We favor the preservation of jobs. If an enterprise's output is really not needed by the market, that means its specialty must be changed and new technology introduced. People must have work and earn their keep. Unfortunately, there are many people in power structures who support Russia's conversion into a retail market for foreign firms' output. They say that this way the population's demand can be satisfied faster and more reliably. But we will thereby be encouraging the development of foreign producers, and we will ruin our own industry once and for all. I want to stress that our position and the president's views on this question completely coincide. [Yemchenko] It is understandable that society's social problems were the main topic of your conversation. I would like to know whether you broached the equally pressing question of the attack on trade union rights? As far as I know it is being actively discussed at virtually all trade union aktiv meetings and conferences. I am referring to the transfer of control of the social insurance fund to the state, attempts to lay hands on trade union property, and the draft of the new Labor Code which gives trade union organizations a secondary role. [Shmakov] As regards the draft Labor Code prepared by Labor Ministry staffers, I can say one thing: We will never agree to such a version of this document. It is not only that it demeans the role of trade unions in regulating labor relations. This draft envisages a sharp reduction in social guarantees for hired workers. In other words, it is a rejection of all that has been won by working people in the long years of struggle. I think that even now, during discussion of the draft, its authors can see that this version of it will not be accepted. As regards control of the social insurance fund. The State Duma is now preparing a law on social insurance. We have made our own proposals in it. This fund should operate under trade union control, otherwise it is unimaginable. [Yemchenko] I suppose that at the meeting with the president you could not have failed to broach a document such as the Treaty on Social Accord. [Shmakov] Quite so. Say what you like, today the problem of civic peace in society worries the country's entire population equally. The squabbles on the political Olympus are costing our state too dear. That is why the trade unions support the president's idea of achieving a solution based on civic accord to the crisis which has engulfed all aspects of our life. In deciding to join the Treaty on Social Accord, the FITUR General Council Executive Committee noted that the draft document includes the main critical comments made by sector trade unions, regional trade union associations, and primary trade union organizations. Thus, for example, it recognizes the importance of implementing the general agreement for 1994 between all-Russia trade union associations, all-Russia employers' associations, and the government, as well as sector wages agreements. In short, the treaty envisages the use of levers of social partnership, and beyond this, we know, lies the solution of specific questions associated with the payment of wages, pensions, benefits and with creating a decent living standard for people. At the same time the text of the document does not take account of a number of important proposals, therefore we will sign the treaty not unconditionally but taking account of the trade unions' dissenting opinion. This is that there can be no question of a "moratorium on strikes:" If through the fault of the authorities the collective treaty and the agreement on questions of wages, labor conditions, employment, and preserving established social guarantees are not implemented -- in this case the trade unions reserve the right to take collective action. We are also insisting that the existing budget debt as regards the payment of wages must be cleared not within one year but as early as in the first half of the year. In our dissenting opinion we demand that Federation components' organs of state power solve a nationwide problem: Preserving the system of free general secondary (full) and primary vocational education. Finally, the document must provide for an efficient mechanism of responsibility for all parties which have signed it. [Yemchenko] A very important condition. But I am afraid that few people know the structure of the "mechanism." How can influence be exerted on the power structures if they contravene the signed document's provisions? [Shmakov] As you know, the country's president is a guarantor ensuring that the commitments assumed will be met. He has sufficient powers. In this context I would like to say that not so long ago we signed a tripartite general agreement between entrepreneurs, the government, and trade unions. It envisages the prompt payment of wages, guaranteed labor safety, and the preservation of jobs. [Yemchenko] Mikhail Viktorovich, the May Day holidays are almost here. This year they coincide with Easter. Because of this there have been calls to scrap any demonstrations and processions. What is the trade unions' position regarding this? [Shmakov] For us May Day has been and will remain a day of solidarity among working people in the struggle for their rights. That is why trade unions are organizing demonstrations and rallies, at which demands defending the interests of hired workers will once again be heard. [Yemchenko] In that case what do you understand by the word solidarity and how can it be expressed now? [Shmakov] I will guess the subtext of your question. Yes, every sector has its own specific interests. And sector trade unions endeavor to protect them above all. But modern production development is such that all sectors within it are closely linked to each other. Therefore working people, wherever they work, have common interests, and that means common objectives of struggle. That is the whetstone on which solidarity is sharpened. [Yemchenko] I think that solidarity among working people is also demonstrated by the extent to which trade unions are united. Unfortunately the reverse process can now be observed. What is your view of the future of the Russian trade union movement? [Shmakov] Trade unions, like all of our society, are now experiencing a period of renewal. This process is never easy. At the moment it is too hard to say how they will emerge from it. But the fact that the trade union movement will in time become strong and united goes without saying. Hired workers have no other way of standing up for and protecting their social interests.
