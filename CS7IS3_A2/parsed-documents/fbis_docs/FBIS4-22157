In 1993, the military-industrial complex produced the following: --520,000 kW of steam turbines; --20.044 billion rubles [R] worth of oilfield and drilling equipment and spare parts for it; --nearly R10 billion worth of equipment for manufacturing knitted fabric; --7,748 woodworking machines; --3,587,500 televisions; --212,000 knitting machines; --3,261,200 refrigerators and freezers; --188,700 motor blocks; --R31.928 billion worth of automobile spare parts; --R1.0163 billion worth of medicines; --R33.933 billion worth of sporting equipment; --3,844,000 pairs of shoes. At the same time, in those areas where it is necessary to maintain expensive fixed assets, a sharp decrease in production volumes is observed: 42 percent in the arms industry; 40.2 percent in the shipbuilding industry; and 29.9 percent in the electronics industry. A particularly difficult situation has taken shape in the electronics industry, where the volume of production has decreased to the 1991 level to 67 percent, including to 35 percent for military products and to 81.6 percent for consumer goods. Computer equipment production last year was 32 percent less than in 1992. The 1993 budget level did not make it possible to compensate for the increase in cost of maintaining fixed assets of equipment, which are the basis of high technologies, and led to a decrease in the share of funds allocated for wages. As a result, the average monthly wage in the defense complex in 1993 was R28,600 with the statistical average for Russia at R58,400. The draft 1994 budget allocated approximately 46 percent of the 1993 level of funds for national defense needs. In the next 3-4 months, this may deprive about 20 million people of means of existence.
