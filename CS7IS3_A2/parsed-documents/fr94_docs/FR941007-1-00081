(c) Assigned ratings. The OCC shall assign to each bank one of the following four ratings as set out in §25.28 of this part and Appendix A of this part: ``outstanding''; ``satisfactory''; ``needs to improve''; or ``substantial noncompliance'' based on: (1) The results of the applicable assessment test(s) or standards or performance under an approved strategic plan; and (2) Any evidence of discriminatory or other illegal credit practices. (d) Safe and sound operations. This part and the CRA do not require any bank to make loans or investments, or to provide services that are inconsistent with safe and sound operations.

(3) The OCC shall weigh the bank's community development lending according to the characteristics and needs of the bank's service area(s), the capacity and constraints of the bank, and the opportunities available to the bank for this lending. (b) Assessment criteria. The OCC shall evaluate a bank's lending performance pursuant to the following criteria: (1) Geographic distribution. The geographic distribution of the bank's lending (based on the location of the loan as provided in §25.12 of this part), including: (i) The proportion of total lending in the bank's service area(s); (ii) The dispersion of lending throughout the bank's service area(s); and
