It also deals with the question of what role Han Dongfang has set out for himself. With the overseas democracy movement seemingly quieter with each passing day, suddenly, we have the events surrounding Han Dongfang's challenging Beijing and then running into roadblocks. According to my view from the sidelines, the Chinese Government and the overseas democracy movement each do their own talking, but they never have any contact. Hence, what has emerged is a situation of mutual denouncement, mutual revilement and harming the opponent but never attacking his vital points; not because both sides are different, but only because the mental knapsacks of both sides are crammed so full of their stock roles and phrases, they are unable (or unwilling) to talk about that which is the most crucial. The CPC Cannot Bring Itself To Mention Han Dongfang If we look closely at the relevant legal statutes, the Chinese Government is in the wrong. Everybody maintains that Han was issued an valid passport, and if they want to put him in prison, to kill him or want to force to surrender, they must first allow him to enter the country, at least in theory. If they don't in fact imprison him, or kill him, then most likely they will also not be able to play the game of inducing him to capitulate, and will not be willing to sink so low as the Kuomintang and resort to assassination, so it will push the view abroad that everything is just fine, something that is clearly naive, is it not? Of course, using the term "naive" to describe the CPC I fear is a perfectly inappropriate use of the word. The problem is that is it not naive to use the term naive in regard to the CPC? My response is that I find it difficult to talk about this. What do I mean by difficult to talk about? First we must talk about Han Dongfang. Han emerged as a leader of the "Workers' Free Trade Union" in 1989, and no matter how hard he worked to appear moderate and rational, within the government and the society as a whole (including the US AFL-CIO and Hong Kong's HK Alliance in Support of Democratic Movement in China) there is fear that in his own mind, his social role and orientation is as a "leader of a workers' movement." But what is the workers' movement? For China what was yesterday's, what is today's and what will be tomorrow's worker's movement? How will this movement be led? And after this movement, what then? I think that it is Americans and Hong Kong people who do not understand these questions, including in this group the hard working and honest Mr. Szeto Wah; Han Dongfang himself does not understand very well. The CPC has the most understanding of the issue, but cannot say anything. This is because it does not want to allow those hundreds of thousands of industrial workers inside the country to understand. In fact, it does not matter much if the industrial workers understanding of these questions is no better than their confusion regarding them, but this touches on the theoretical foundation on which the CPC established the party and established the government. I do not know if the readers have all had this experience: Among CPC cadres there is no lack of people who are warm and sincere and do solid work, but if you touch on ideology, and the theory of class struggle, then each and every one has a wooden face, and unshakable determination. Therefore, in talking about this "Han Dongfang returns to China and runs into obstruction" event, one must start from the basic theories of the CPC and the Chinese workers' movement. Since there have been machines, there have been workers to run the machines, and there have been workers who understood themselves that they should be able to make a decent livelihood, and that after struggling for a certain period for this livelihood, there will be a worker's movement and for convenience this movement will organize unions. This circumstance has continued to the present, and has continued until at the same time as the Han Dongfang case, the entire Hong Kong Immigration Bureau asked for sick leave. Over the last several centuries, people are already quite familiar with this concept, that in order to describe this below for convenience, we will for the moment call workers that for their own economic interests conduct a struggle to form an organization a welfare [material benefits] union movement. Lenin Changed Welfare Union Movement Into a Political Activity A welfare union movement is not very frightening, and this can be said to stem from its strong industrial character (it also does not have an all-encompassing social nature) and its consultative character, and its social destructive power is limited. After the goal of material benefit has been attained, the movement also ends, and the society as before relies on its own rules and regulations. This is also why countries that only have welfare movements, though at times there are some who are discontent and disturbances occur, the society as a whole is consistently comparatively stable, and labor unions can jointly exist with capitalist industrial production, as they have up to this day. What is unfortunate is that in the 19th century, we have the emergence in Europe of the philosopher and economist Karl Marx, who expounded the labor theory of value. This was an achievement puffed up with the conceit of academic circles (compared with Marx's academic activity, his revolutionary practice appears quite minor); later, Lenin, a social activist who fully accepted the tradition of the purity of the people, in a critique of the value of this theory, added emotion (injustice), and the next step then was to extend the theory to the political realm (ending this injustice), and the result was trouble arising in a Russia that was outside the bounds within which this theory was expounded. Again later on, after this theory, including the carrying out of practice based on this theory through "the sound of gunfire," had arrived in China, the CPC regarded it as a divine instruction, and as "advanced," and even definitively stated that the burning-with-impatience intellectuals should start to look down on any other theory outside of this Leninized principle, and from this abandon their base and take the path of theory, marching in succession towards the factories and mines, playing the character of a 20th century Chen Sheng-Wu Guang Uprising [209 B.C., first large-scale peasant uprising in China's history] with a guiding principle and an organization. For old Communist Party members this is very important indeed, and when we think about the Cultural Revolution period, and in order for the picture of Mao Zedong and Liu Shaoqi entering the Anyuan Coal Mine to have been drawn and create such a hubbub, we realize that this was no trivial matter. At this time, the "politically awakened" workers could not be controlled by a few cadres for a few hours, and many waved some money in front of their eyes. This was a formula used by scab unions to draw in corrupt workers. A working class armed with advanced thinking had to be political, and had to "cast off the shackles from their bodies, and take on the whole world!" Some Characteristics of the Situation of Workers in China Originally, China was an agricultural country, and the workers' movement had little effect during the struggle to seize power. But this did not hinder the thoroughly astute Mao Zedong from using a greatly simplified and Sinicized unified theory to arouse the peasants, and this allowed him to force other people, including the oldtimers [laobizu], foreigners, the representatives of foreigners, and "leaders of the white areas," to one by one stand aside, and in the end he prevailed through absolute superiority--this before ever entering a city. After entering the cities, the situation for Chinese workers then really becomes difficult to explain in a few words. To sum it up, it involved the following points: 1) Workers were put in a very high political position by the CPC. "Roots red, seedlings straight!," "leadership in everything!", everybody was familiar with these sayings, and didn't say them much. 2) Because on the mainland a policy of bringing living standards to the same level, the people's economic position was not bad, including that of idlers and fools. 3) Although there are unions, they are hollow, useless organizations--the All-China Federation of Trade Unions is subordinate to the CPC Central Liaison Department. Union grass-roots level organizations also exist as subordinates of the Trade Union Federation, but they only manage dances and organize excursions. There is no way for them to clamor for material benefits: Are you not the owner of the factory? How can the owner petition himself? 4) In terms of politics, people think but all do not use their thoughts. You are the leading class, you already have rights, what further is there to ask about politics? If one does not think about this or take any interest in it, there are also opportunities, and the CPC early on gave you a firm definition, but which political movement in the end was able to dispense with the stand taken by the working class. In 1957, the turning point in the Anti-Rightist Struggle from "attracting" to "attacking" was when "the working class had spoken;" in 1976, the "attack" was already concrete as the workers arrived on the scene with government-issued clubs for dealing with the students and city residents. But this was not only "the broad masses of the workers"; some were fortunate to be able to serve as leading cadres, even central leading cadres. The Reasons Why the CPC Will Not Let Han Dongfang Return The reasons CPC authorities will not allow Han Dongfang return should be very clear. First, what type of movement actually is the workers' movement led by Han Dongfang? Is it a Western-style unionist welfare movement or is it a CPC-type political movement? For me, looking at Han since 1989, including an examination of his statements and actions prior to his imprisonment and after his release, what he has done is exactly the same as Wuerkaixi and Chai Ling, completely deviating from the CPC's mold, by marching along in the footsteps of the elder generation, in which the intellectuals were concerned with society, and really becoming involved with the thoughts and feelings of social reform, going down amongst the workers, and arousing them, organizing them.... This time, the intellectual's actual educational pedigree, and occupation, including his consistently vainly hopeful moderate positions and reasonable dialogue, have already become not important, and the part he plays is the role more than 70 years ago of Zhang Guotao and that played by Liu Shaoqi (exactly like the May Fourth Movement and 9 December Movement hero images compiled by the CPC and studied by Wuerkaixi and Chai Ling). This is the first layer. Second, at that time the CPC was arousing the workers, arousing the students, and those in power constituted the "KMT reactionary regime," therefore this was right. Now, however, with the peoples' regime under the leadership of the CPC, what you are doing resembles, and again is modelled on the complete teachings of the CPC, which, in this case, I beg your pardon, is counterrevolutionary!! The reader I'm afraid still remembers those days in 1989, those two characters meaning "patriotism," and how justly and forcefully the students demanded, how justly and forcefully Li Peng would not give, making the whole world as a result feel injured and resentful, and that the truth lay here. Third, any of those in power know that in arousing the students, even if those aroused to take the lead cherish the most utilitarian of political goals, it is also possible to have nothing extraordinary occur--the South Korean students and the police have fought day after day, while the nation's power all the same has continued to increase. Arouse the workers, and they can cut off water supplies, electricity, cut off transportation, their power to disrupt society is too great. A movement to gain material benefits uses just this type of deterrent to achieve its goals. But economic demands also have a finite end, and the capitalist side goes to extremes to declare that it will go bankrupt. Political demands are difficult to deal with, and if as luck would have had it, they had been in compliance with the CPC's political demands of that year, would the movement have been of any size? Among these people, who is there that has an even clearer stand than the CPC itself? Would the authorities be able to contain you as you carried political motives in arousing the workers? Fourth, I will form a movement for material gain, is this allowed or not? As a matter of fact, China at present already has a number of fragmentary movements seeking material benefits, but these have not been stirred up by people concerned for their country or their people such as Han Dongfang. Rather, their standards are low, their scale is small, the extent of their contacts is narrow, and their goals are simple. Even though they are this way, the authorities pay close attention to each occurrence, and in the shortest possible period and within the smallest possible scope, either control and stop it, or the problem is resolved and issue dropped. Movements for material benefits in China are by no means the same as in a country with private ownership and market economic mechanisms. In China, capital is the state, and the interests that one demands conflict with the interests of the government and takes from the government's pockets, so how can the authorities not be in pain? This is commonly understood. Arriving at the present time, the anger of China's hundreds of thousands of workers does not come from one place alone. Reform, reform, from the halls of officialdom come petty thieves and hoodlums, all getting rich, and only the greatly perspiring and hard working "leadership class" is suffering. Add to the fact that Li Peng has been floundering about for several years, and large- and medium-sized enterprises are not doing well. If they do not act in accordance with Li Peng's approach, to greatly expand imports, then the fact is that state-owned enterprises will be even more anemic. Running here, running there, finances worsening, wages not being paid. At this juncture, engaging in a movement for material benefits is exactly the type of tool that an out-of-power politician searches for to cut down those in power, if it is not subversion, what is it? How can the authorities dare allow Han Dongfang to return to Beijing? What Role Does Han Dongfang Want To Play? In response, your government blocks the way of one Han Dongfang, has the situation turned into a completely economic one? Han Dongfang cannot enter the country, China is such a large place, how is it that there have not emerged a Zhang Xifang [west], a Wang Nanfang [south] or a Zhao Beifang who cherish the same ideas, and along with him experienced the same "growing up accepting the Party's education?" The question is how in terms of principles and policies, to make Hang Dongfang and industrial workers understand that revolution is not a good method for resolving China's problems, and is by no means the only method. The CPC itself succeeded in revolution, but China's affairs have not been handled well; today change is arising in the same way, and those suffering losses will still be the common people. It is a pity that the CPC today has sealed off channels through which criticisms and suggestions could be communicated to the leadership, and wants to as before through talking big, "stuffing" the workers, playing a new trick by having a beauty contest, and singing soft popular tunes, to lull the workers, and not allow people to discuss principles with clarity. This being the case, it is forced to taste bitter fruit--including the various types of inconveniences that go along with Han Dongfang. For Han Dongfang, I only hope that he has given a lot of thought to his place in society. If he only has a happy, patriotic desire, then he should go and do what he will do; if he wants to be the leader of a workers' movement for material benefits, he must first clearly understand the circumstances of China's industrial workers; if his ultimate goal is to be a social activist, a politician out of power, and then become a wielder of power, like China's Wang Zhen or Poland's Lech Walesa, having just experienced everything, this would also be one stage in his own revolutionary career, as well as not requiring too much grief.
