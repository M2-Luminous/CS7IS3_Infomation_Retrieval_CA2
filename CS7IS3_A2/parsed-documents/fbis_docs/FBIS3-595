Mr Kriel was speaking to National Party workers in East London at the start of a three-day tour of the border. He said he telephoned Gen Holomisa who is also an African National Congress [ANC] candidate last week and said the NP wanted to open an office in Transkei. "He said I must put it in writing, which I did." In return he received a message in which Gen Holomisa listed "all thoughts" [as received] of preconditions. "He said we must give more vehicles for their police force and sought out all thoughts [as received] of other issues. That is not levelling the playing fields. That is not democracy. That is pure blackmail." Mr Kriel said he was still considering how to deal with the situation. The most likely route would be through the Independent Electoral Commission, but he would discuss this with his National Party colleagues first. He said he had written to Gen Holomisa in his capacity as vice-chairman of the National Party in the Western Cape. "When it suits (Gen) Holomisa he's an independent state and he can do exactly what he wants. But as soon as he needs something, then we are responsible." If Gen Holomisa had organised his country better he could have bought the vehicles he needed. Mr Kriel said negotiations with Transkei on a joint investigation into the Heidelberg tavern killings were continuing but "I don't think progress has been all that great". He still believed Transkei was a haven for the Azanian Peoples Liberation Army [APLA]. Even though the Pan-Africanist Congress [PAC] had said it was suspending the armed struggle there were still "loose cannons" running around over which the PAC and APLA had very little control. "I believe they are still using Transkei as a safe haven." He rejected the Transkei demand that the territory's police should be allowed to interview those responsible for the South African Defence Force [SADF] raid on an alleged APLA base in return for allowing South African Police into the territory to investigate the Heidelberg killings. The Umtata raid was a "legitimate military operation" to capture criminals and the two could not be compared. Referring to the people killed in the SADF raid, he said: "It's also a debatable point as to whether they were so-called children. I've seen children of 14 or 15 years running around with AK-47s. So a child can be dangerous." Mr Kriel had brief talks on Thursday morning with a delegation from the Border Chamber of Business on security in the region. He is to meet later on Thursday with the King William's Town town council and Berlin farmers to discuss the same issue. On Friday he travels to the North-East Cape.
