[Aliukoniene] Most goods are smuggled from Russia, Kaliningrad Oblast, Azerbaijan, Georgia, and other former USSR republics. People are bringing poppies and other narcotic substances to our country. Such contraband usually arrives by rail, because it is easier to hide poppies there. Post-Soviet southern states also import arms, ammunition, and explosives. [Laucius] What contraband is brought into Lithuania? [Aliukoniene] In 1993, the Prosecutor General's Office instituted eight criminal proceedings for drug trafficking. One of the largest such cases is that of two Russian citizens, incidentally, students, who tried to bring in 3.6 kilograms of hashish hidden in the staff compartment on the "Moscow-Kaliningrad" train. A criminal action was brought against one Lithuanian citizen who tried to smuggle 15,200 packages of cigarettes worth 27,500 litai through the customs house in Lazdijai. The largest contraband in 1993 was 4 tonnes of quicksilver illegally brought from Belarus. Its value at prices of that time was estimated at almost 4.5 million rubles. However, a large number of goods are smuggled through border crossing points, which are practically uncontrolled, rather than customs houses. Knowing that Lithuania has 15 customs houses and 75 border crossings, one can only imagine the scope of contraband.... [Laucius] Is contraband usually brought in by Lithuanians or by foreigners? [Aliukoniene] It is mostly imported by foreigners--inhabitants of Kaliningrad Oblast and southern regions. Many problems arise due to this, because by applying administrative punishments to foreigners, we do not have a legal mechanism regulating the retrieval of money in cases when foreigners do not have it.... Customs officers in Lazdijai are the most busy ones--the road to Europe runs through there. Last year, however, the largest amount of goods was confiscated in the Vilnius customs house--worth as much as 4,548,970 litai. [passage omitted] [Laucius] Could you mention any cases where the largest amount of contraband was detained? [Aliukoniene] The Customs Department has instituted 13 criminal actions for arms contraband as early as this year. In the beginning of this year, an aircraft fully packed with arms and ammunition, shipped from Buenos Aires, landed at the airport in Karmelava. The prosecutor's office of the Kaunas region is conducting a preliminary investigation into this case. Inspection on a transit train at the Kena railway post in the Vilnius region discovered a large number of gas pistols and ammunition hidden in the restaurant car, which someone tried to deliver to Moscow. Transit shipments cause great concern because they do not require customs duties. The so-called "fake transit" is extremely widespread, when according to the documents goods seem to travel to another state, while actually they remain in Lithuania, and customs officials only mark in the documents that the load was exported. Certainly, such services are well rewarded.... [passage omitted]
