The Twelve must first come to a mutual agreement on how decisions are to be made in a Europe with 16 members. After that, their accession must also be approved by the European Parliament [EP], the national parliaments, and the people in the intended new member states. The biggest obstacle is still the veto issue and the intransigent attitude of Spain, and especially Great Britain, on this matter. These two countries are threatening to raise the blocking minority from 23 to 27 votes. Doing so, it would become more difficult for two large countries and one small country to block measures. The Council discussed the veto issue until 0400 [Belgian time] Wednesday [16 March] morning, but the foreign ministers went home empty-handed. A new, extraordinary meeting on general affairs is scheduled for next Tuesday in the Council. Until this meeting is held, the matter of enlargement will remain stuck in an impasse. British Chancellor Kenneth Clark said yesterday on BBC radio that "large countries, such as ourselves, cannot reconcile themselves to a system in which 60 percent of the European population -- represented by a group of small countries -- can vote us down on important issues." Clarke said that he welcomed the accession of Austria, Norway, Sweden, and Finland, but that it "it must be a union in which large countries, such as Great Britain, can block issues which I, as a pro-European conservative, do not want to see happen." The anti-European conservatives -- the so-called Euroskeptics -- in the British Parliament, expressed still stronger views. "I am delighted that Minister Hurd has adopted such a determined position," said Sir Teddy Taylor. "What causes me concern is that the Commission is trying to use the accession of new countries as an excuse to gain more power for itself. It is kind of blackmail." Upon his return from Brussels Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said only that Great Britain would continue to strive for a "fair and sensible" compromise on the veto question. However, in the meantime, Great Britain has continued to reject all compromises. The proposal to raise the blocking minority to 27 votes -- but to reserve the possibility of 23 votes on the condition that they are comprised by three countries -- has not made much of an impression. Greek Proposal Tuesday evening, the Greek Presidency also came up with a compromise in the Council. The Greek representative, Kranidiotis, reported the compromise yesterday morning to the European Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs. "The Greek Presidency has proposed to set up a committee in which experts from the national governments, the Commission, and the Parliament would prepare a report on the institutional reforms in anticipation of the intergovernmental summit in 1996," said Kranidiotis yesterday before leaving for Greece. "In anticipation of the creation of this committee -- no earlier than the Corfu summit in June -- the blocking majority would be raised from 23 to 27 votes. The Greek view is that the number of votes must end up at 27 anyway. We are proposing, however, to do that on a temporary basis. In the meantime, the committee of wise men can already debate the institutional reforms." The committee members did not seem to be under this impression. The committee was introduced as a committee of wise men, but is actually nothing more than an ad hoc committee of government representatives, they said. Taken literally, Kranidiotis said that the committee should take inspiration from the work of Parliament. President Enrique Baron Crespo let his displeasure show over the fact that "the Council needs the Parliament in order to approve the enlargement, but does not feel it necessary to keep us informed." "The European Parliament is not a counter serving merely to rubber-stamp documents," Crespo said. Parliament The European Parliament is not against EU enlargement, but demands that it go hand in hand with institutional reforms which go further than just determining the number of votes needed for a blocking minority. Parliament is advocating what is known in jargon as a "super-qualified majority." "Such a majority would replace the current unanimity and would mean in fact, the end of the veto right," said Therese Lepoutre-Dumoulin, department head of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. An possible agreement on the veto issue would not settle the conflict between the Council and the Parliament. "We were promised that the enlargement would be accompanied by institutional reforms. That has not been the case. The only thing they are doing now is mathematically extrapolating the blocking minority to apply to a Europe with 16 members." Parliament feels that a blocking minority of 27 votes is a minimum requirement. It will accept nothing short of that. "If they say it is going to be 23 then Parliament will never give its approval to enlargement. And without Parliament's agreement, the enlargement cannot proceed."
