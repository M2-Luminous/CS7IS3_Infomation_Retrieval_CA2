We have come in response to an invitation from brother President Abu-'Ammar, he said. He added that President 'Arafat will address an appeal concerning the democratic national dialogue with all Palestinian forces and factions, and immediately afterward he ['Arafat] will begin this dialogue. Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi also said: We hope this invitation will receive good responses and understanding from everyone and contribute toward the realization and entrenchment of the overall national unity. He added: During those meetings with President 'Arafat, we emphasized the necessity to recall the qualified Palestinians in various fields to build the Palestinian objectives, a matter that requires the existence of an actual democratic practice, and this is what our memorandum stressed. Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi added that the response to the proposals of the group was that some of those proposals were already in practice, and that there was a council that planned and exercised this required role. [sentence as heard] We have requested the activation of this body, and with regard to human resources, we expressed our desire to be selected according to qualifications and competence. Concerning the Construction and Economic Development Council, the response was that there was a special bureau that was in charge of that matter. Concerning the consultative committees within and outside the occupied territories, the response was that the national authority will be composed from people inside and outside [the occupied territories], and the authority council will undertake whatever was necessary -- such as the setting up of committees and dealing with other questions, such as municipal affairs. Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi stressed that during these deliberations, the need to firmly establish the democratic concept and begin the national dialogue were emphasized in order to realize comprehensive national unity.
