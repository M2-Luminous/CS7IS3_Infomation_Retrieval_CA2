Golyba and V.K. Zaruba, candidates of technical sciences, and T.A. Oks, engineer, Power Generation Equipment Design Institute (Energoproyekt), Kharkov; UDC 662.66] [Abstract] Now that Ukraine has gained independence, it must find ways of meeting its energy needs through its own energy resources. At present, Ukraine's own energy resources are providing no more than 30 percent of the power needed by the country. Because Ukraine virtually lacks reserves of gas-and-oil reserves, it should concentrate on developing its solid fuel reserves and using them to meet its energy needs. To make fuel supply as reliable as possible, Ukraine should locate its thermal electric power plants [TES] and fuel bases as close to one another as possible so as to create ``coal deposit-TES'' complexes. On the basis of R&D conducted at the Ukraine Coal, Ore, and Gas Industry Scientific Research and Design Institute [UkrNIIproyekt] and State Mine and Ore Enrichment Plant Design Institute [Yuzhgiproshakht] developments, researchers from the institute Energoproyekt in Kharkov are working to develop ``coal deposit-TES'' complexes near the Barvenkovskoye and Bogdanovskoye deposits. The 12-km[.sup]2[/] Barvenkovskoye deposit, which is located in the south of the Kharkov Oblast, contains lignite and is suitable for open-pit mining. The Barvenkovskoye coal is of medium quality and has been characterized as follows: calorific value, 2,000 kcal/kg; moisture content, 45 percent; ash content, 13.7 percent; sulfur content, 1.5 percent; and yield of volatiles, 60 percent. The mine is suitable for stripping at a rate of 8 million tonnes of coal yearly, and that amount may expanded to 12 million tonnes in the future. Barvenkovskoye coal may be burned in boilers at electric power plants and is also suitable for briquetting and for coal-chemical processing. Its quality is similar to that of the lignites of the Ural and Aleksandriyskoye deposits, the Kansk-Achinsk Basin, and the Yugoslavian and German lignites that are widely used in power generation. The Bogdanovskoye deposit measures 24 by 20.5 km and is located in the new Northern Donbass Coal Region in the north of the Lugansk Oblast and is estimated to contain total reserves of 1,068 million tonnes and commercial-quality reserves of 860 million tonnes. Coal from the Bogdanovskoye deposit is characterized as follows: average calorific value, 4,362 kcal/kg; ash content, 24.8 percent; moisture content, 17.2 percent; sulfur content, 1.6 percent; yield of volatiles, 45.9 percent; ash melting point, 1,110ï¿½C; and level of easily sublimed Na[.sub]2[/]O in coals supplied to GRES, 1.2 percent. Preliminary estimates have indicated that the Barvenkovskoye deposit may be used as a basis for constructing a 1,600- to 1,800-MW state regional electric power plant [GRES] and that the Bogdanovskoye deposit is sufficient as the basis for a ``coal deposit-TES'' complex that includes a 2,700-MW GRES. In view of the great inertia of Ukraine's fuel-and-energy complex, technical and economic reports regarding the creation of ``coal deposit-TES'' complexes for the Barvenkovskoye and Bogdanovskoye deposits need to be completed in 1993-1994.
