Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to give him the authority to order air strikes against Bosnian Serb forces. Hatano said, "The U.N. has neither sufficient military capability nor financial means, so it is quite natural that it asked NATO to cooperate in making up for its limited military capability." Hatano made the remark at the Japan National Press Club two days after Butrus-Ghali requested that NATO authorize him to order air strikes by NATO planes against Bosnian Serb war machines. Nato's 16-member decision-making meeting, the North Atlantic Council, is to decide on Butrus-Ghali's request later Wednesday. Hatano, who has served at the U.N. Headquarters in New York for four years, is to be replaced by former Vice Foreign Minister Hisashi Owada soon. U.S. bombers under NATO command destroyed a Serbian tank and other military machines as the Serbs pushed into the U.N.-designated safe area of Gorazde last week. NATO and U.N. officials said the strikes were conducted not to deter the Serbs from taking territory but to comply with the U.N. request to do so in order to protect peacekeepers from the U.N. protection forces. However, after the limited NATO action was suspended, Serbian forces stormed into Gorazde and threatened to attack the northern Bosnian corridor around the town of Brcko as their next target. Butrus-Ghali's request was for NATO to authorize him to order air strikes to prevent the Serbs from killing more Bosnian Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina. "Serbian forces may initiate a large-scale offensive as soon as they hear NATO say it is not going to intervene militarily," Hatano said. "Although decisive military intervention may not be desirable...the U.N. could deter Serbian aggression effectively by threatening that NATO planes might make other strikes," he said. Hatano called on NATO to comply with Butrus-Ghali's plea, saying, "Mr. Butrus-Ghali said during his official visit to Japan in February last year the most crucial need for the United Nations is how to secure and maintain cooperation from regional security organizations" like NATO. Russia, a traditional ally of Serbia, has balked at the further use of NATO warplanes, saying it might involve the U.N. in the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Meanwhile, Hatano urged the Japanese to accept the notion of "peace with justice," saying the international community "has questioned the Japanese attitude that peace is equivalent to justice." "The international community believes it should intervene even with military force to restore justice, as in Yugoslavia and Somalia," he said. Hatano asked the Japanese to give more thought to the plight of people in faraway countries, noting that European and U.S. television and newspapers often devote their top news slots to "the agony of starving Somalis or Yugoslavian children being evacuated from Sarajevo with their mothers left behind." "The Japanese have to learn to develop an interest in events all over the world," he said.
