Tzou and Sofia Wu] [Text] Marrakech, Morocco, April 11 (CNA) -- The Republic of China [ROC] is welcome to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) as soon as possible, GATT Director-General Peter Sutherland said here Monday [11 April]. Sutherland made the statement while meeting with ROC Economic Affairs Minister P.K. Chiang at a reception given by the Moroccan Government in honor of delegates from some 150 countries to a GATT ministerial meeting scheduled to open here Tuesday. As Taiwan is a major trading country, Sutherland said he believes Taiwan's accession to GATT will help boost the healthy development of a world trading system. Sutherland further said Taiwan's GATT membership application has nothing to do with Mainland China's. "They are two separate cases and are being screened by two different working groups," he explained. "So I think there is no such problem as which side of the Taiwan Strait should join GATT first," he said. "Either side which can win the support of two-thirds of GATT contracting parties will enter the body first," he added. Taiwan applied to join GATT as a separate customs territory in 1990 and was awarded observer status in the world trade regulatory body in 1992. It hopes to become a full member by the end of this year. Mainland China, which applied for GATT membership in 1986, is also a GATT observer. Chiang, heading a 15-member delegation, arrived here Sunday to attend the four-day GATT ministerial meeting, which will set the seal on a sweeping new world trade treaty, also known as the Uruguay Round accord. While here, Chiang will hold informal tariff concession talks with delegates from the Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Egypt, New Zealand, Singapore, Switzerland, and the United States with a view to accelerating Taiwan's entry into GATT, which is scheduled to be superseded by the World Trade Organization next January.
