It is a great mission and objective sought by every zealous Yemeni citizen who believes in unity. Therefore, success has been a permanent companion of these forces in their triumphant unionist march. The misled elements in the Armed Forces under the hegemony of the gang of apostasy are confidently siding with the forces of legitimacy, ridding themselves of the hegemony of the gang of apostasy. They are sincerely and honestly joining the forces of unity in all fighting positions and all axes of the great unionist march. Similar to these unionist stands by the military, the civilians, too, take the initiative in welcoming the forces of legitimacy and unity and cooperating with them in their national unionist mission. They realize that they are forces of protection, salvation, legitimacy, security, and peace, and believe that they are forces seeking to entrench unity, support the pillars of democracy, uphold the word of the people, and rid them of the renegade gang under which they suffered bitterly. The citizens have long suffered from the sins of this gang. Now they realize that the hour of salvation is coming and that the moment of liberation is imminent, God willing, through the determination of the free unionists. Accordingly, it is a foregone conclusion to tell all citizens in the operational sectors and to all unionists in the Armed Forces axes: These are your forces which express your ambitions, achieve your aspirations, work for your salvation, and watch over you and your interests. They protect you from the evil of the renegade gang and tyranny. They are your guarantee for a true unionist future, a just and democratic society, and a free and dignified life. They are the vanguards of love and peace, harbingers of concord and order, protectors of unity and democracy, carriers of the banner of renaissance and development, and guardians of right and legitimacy. Therefore, the strongholds and fortifications of apostasy and secession in all positions and axes are collapsing daily in front of their unionist march everywhere. The successes scored by these unionist forces give clear evidence that the forces of constitutional legitimacy and the armies of unity and democracy represent the hand of the divine power, which has ordained that the secessionist parasites be uprooted and the dens of the renegade gangs be destroyed. They express the popular will to destroy this gang, get rid of its evil, and destroy its conspiracy against the homeland, unity, and democracy. This gang wanted to obliterate others so that it could control everything and dominate all the people. Therefore, it had to be removed from the path of the people and erased from the history of the homeland after suffering from what it intended for the citizens. This renegade gang wanted to destroy democracy and foil unity, but God destroyed their pillars and made them taste grievous punishment. Their end is imminent, God willing.
