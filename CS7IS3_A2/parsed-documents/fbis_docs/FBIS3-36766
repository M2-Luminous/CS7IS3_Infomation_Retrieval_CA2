He said that if a moderately rigid credit and financial policy is pursued, the state budget deficit will stand at 7-7.5% by the end of the year compared to the Gross Domestic Product, while the monthly inflation rate will be at 7-9%. He said that the year 1994 must become decisive in the implementation of the radical economic reform. If the government fails to make achievements in the priority economic branches by controlling budget spending, the forecasts for the size of the budget deficit in 1995 will not come true, he said. On Tuesday, Shokhin addressed the congress "Reality and Prospects for Russia's Economic Development." This forum's organizing committee is chaired by Secretary of the Russian Federation's Security Council Oleg Lobov, while the event itself was prepared by prominent economists Nikolay Petrakov, Leonid Abalkin and Stanislav Shatalin. The economists participated in the preparation of a report entitled, Socio-Economic Reforms in Russia; the Current Situation and New Approaches. Anther author of the report, Stanislav Assekritov, vice president of the Reform International Foundation, expects the report to be discussed by the government at its meeting on February 24. He believes the document has much in common with the position of Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, who, he said, might "disown the results of the two years of shock therapy" at that meeting. So far neither Chernomyrdin nor President Boris Yeltsin have responded to the report, said Assekritov, who doubts that the prime minister would make a public statement of his socio-economic position before Yeltsin gives his message to parliament on February 18. Only after that "will Chernomyrdin either do what the president would like him to or will just be swiping around," Assekritov said. He said another two reports had been sent to the premier, one of them written by former Minister of Foreign Economic Relations Sergey Glazyev, today a member of the State Duma, where he represents the Democratic Party, and the other by economist Yevgeny Saburov, economics minister in Ivan Silayev's government.
