I just heard a great phrase: [When it comes] to research, information is more important than labs. It is impossible to do research, no matter how many labs, without information. We are going to speak about information with engineer Carlos Guerrero from the Biotechnology and Medical-Pharmaceutical Industry Information and Consultation Center [Centro de Informacion and Consultoria para la Biotecnologia y la Industria Medico-farmaceutica], popularly known as Biotech. [Guerrero] Biotech's goal is to provide logistic support to every center and institution in the western scientific hub. The support takes two main forms. The first is the preparation of directories. For example, we created the Biotech International Directory which has over 7,000 entries and includes 120 countries -- it lists the most important companies in this sector in the world. It is available in printed form and on compact disk, CD-ROM. It is undoubtedly one of the best directories in the world on this subject. We also have other directories such as the one on Cuban biological sciences, which lists all the institutions working in biotechnology and the medical-pharmaceutical industry in Cuba. Another important Biotech line of work is analysis reports. We prepare market reports, company profiles, product performance, studies on issues such as cancer, optic diseases, or others requested by our customers. We have another very important product: The Biotech Guide for Export to Cuba. It includes all the customs and noncustoms regulations, as well as technical regulations for exporting biotechnology and medical and pharmaceutical products to Cuba. The information services Biotech provides to researchers are also important. We have over 50 data bases available to researchers. These include commercial and specialized information for consultation at our libraries and center. [Gonzalez] Are these Biotech services also available to foreign companies or enterprises? [Guerrero] Of course. It is not that we put our services on the market, but that we have important customers abroad who use our services.
