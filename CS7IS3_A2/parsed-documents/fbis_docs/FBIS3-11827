This will allow Congress to approve several projects presented by the Executive Branch. The president told the new members of his cabinet: "The stage for creativity has ended. Now another stage can begin; one of practical and specific actions." Sanchez de Lozada made changes in his 10-member cabinet after five ministers resigned. He also created a minister at large, thereby putting an end to what he believes is the first stage of his administration, which was inaugurated on 6 August 1993. The Bolivian leader affirmed that this change was necessary because it comes at a vital and significant time for the country. Sanchez de Lozada is trying to get Congress to approve several draft laws regarding capitalization, popular participation, and education reform. [passage omitted] Leaders of the four political parties that comprise the ruling coalition were present at the ceremony. They said the new cabinet will carry out the changes and programs set forth over the past seven months. Max Fernandez, a leader of the Solidarity Civic Unity, who is said to be responsible for the cabinet crisis, said, "the time has come for the president to receive the conditional support of the ruling coalition to demonstrate that changes have finally come for the Bolivian people." Fernandez demanded a greater say within the Executive Branch in exchange for votes to approve the laws Sanchez de Lozada has presented to Congress.
