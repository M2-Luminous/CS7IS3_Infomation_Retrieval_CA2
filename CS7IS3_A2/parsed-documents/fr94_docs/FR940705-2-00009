Comments must comply with Subsections 301.5(a)(3) and (4) of the regulations and be filed within 20 days with the Statutory Import Programs Staff, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, D.C. 20230. Applications may be examined between 8:30 A.M. and 5:00 P.M. in Room 4211, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. Docket Number: 94&hyph;075. Applicant: West Virginia University, Physics Department, G-30 Hodges Hall, Morgantown, WV 26505-6315. Instrument: Atom/Radical Source, Model CARS25. Manufacturer: Oxford Applied Research, United Kingdom. Intended Use: The instrument will be used in research concerning the formation of point defects during molecular beam epitaxy growth and doping of wide band gap semiconductors. Application Accepted by Commissioner of Customs: May 27, 1994. Docket Number: 94&hyph;076. Applicant: The Georgia Institute of Technology, 225 North Avenue, NW, Atlanta, GA 30322. Instrument: High-Shear Mixing Bleach Reactor, Model CRS1015. Manufacturer: CRS Reactor Engineering, Sweden. Intended Use: The instrument will be used in a study to develop novel bleaching technologies, such as ECF and TCF processes, other than traditional chlorine processes. The instrument will be used for educational and research purposes mostly by graduate students seeking advance degrees. Application Accepted by Commissioner of Customs: May 31, 1994. Docket Number: 94&hyph;077. Applicant: The Ohio State University, Aeronautical & Astronautical Research Laboratory, 2300 West Case Road, Columbus, OH 43235. Instrument: High Power, High Pressure Arc Discharge Plasma Source System. Manufacturer: Institute of Problems of Electrophysics, CIS. Intended Use: The instrument will be used for research that involves the determination of arc discharge mode, energy and power transfer efficiencies, electrode and insulator damage and wear. The experiments will be conducted for various gases over a range of initial pressures and currents and will involve electrical, pressure transducer and optical measurements. In addition, the instrument will contribute to educational objectives by providing the basis for student thesis research and design projects, and by challenging students with problems related to their coursework. Application Accepted by Commissioner of Customs: June 3, 1994. Docket Number: 94&hyph;078. Applicant: University of Pittsburgh, Chemistry Department, 350 Thackeray Hall, Pittsburgh, PA 15260. Instrument: Mass Spectrometer, Model VG AutoSpec. Manufacturer: Fisons Instruments, United Kingdom. Intended Use: The instrument will be used to produce mass spectra of a wide variety of unique synthetic products and intermediate compounds (natural products, organic substrates for enzyme interaction, vitamin derivatives, and novel synthetic products) in the support of various research programs. The instrument will also be used to investigate the mechanisms of bombardment induced gas-phase ion chemistry and will involve the designing of additives to a FAB matrix that will induce specific chemical reactions within the mass spectrometer. In addition, the instrument will be used for educational purposes in the course Chemistry 2700 Graduate Research. Application Accepted by Commissioner of Customs: June 3, 1994. Docket Number: 94&hyph;079. Applicant: Argonne National Laboratory, 9700 South Cass Avenue, Argonne, IL 60439. Instrument: EPR Spectrometer, Model ESP300-E-10-12. Manufacturer: Bruker Instruments, Germany. Intended Use: The instrument will be used to study photo-induced charge separation in natural photosynthetic and model photosynthetic systems. The experiments to be conducted will be both conventional electron paramagnetic resonance experiments on stable radicals and time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance. Application Accepted by Commissioner of Customs: June 3, 1994. Docket Number: 94&hyph;080. Applicant: University of California, Los Alamos National Laboratory, P.O. Box 990, Los Alamos, NM 87545. Instrument: Electron Microscope, Model JEM 2010. Manufacturer: JEOL Ltd., Japan. Intended Use: The instrument will be used for the study of liquid crystal polymers and thermosets. Experiments will be performed on a variety of liquid crystalline materials to investigate the effect of different preparation schemes on the structure and the resulting properties. Application Accepted by Commissioner of Customs: June 7, 1994. Pamela Woods, Acting Director, Statutory Import Programs Staff.
