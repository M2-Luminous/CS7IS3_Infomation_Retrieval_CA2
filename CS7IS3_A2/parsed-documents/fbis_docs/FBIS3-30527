Growing is support for the Democratic Union [UD], which is the strongest opposition party; support for its closest ally, the Liberal-Democratic Congress [KLD], is on the wane. There would be seven parties in parliament: all of the present parliamentary parties plus the KLD. The SLD has lost a lot of support where it felt strong in November: among the employees of state enterprises, unskilled workers, as well as inhabitants of small and medium-sized towns. Support for the SLD especially dropped among people who have the best educations and the highest incomes. Also people employed in private companies back the party of Aleksander Kwasniewski much less frequently than they did before. The SLD is still supported by the poorest people, as well as by the unemployed, who back this party more often than any other. Over the past two months, the PSL has discouraged many older voters--60 years old and older. It is still the second-most-popular grouping in this milieu (the most popular is the now nonexistent election coalition "Fatherland," comprising such parties as the Christian-National Union and the Party of Christian Democrats). However, support for this party among 60-year-old respondents is no higher than in the other groups. The PSL is still the favorite party of peasants and agricultural employees; almost 60 percent of respondents in these groups would vote for it today. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Election Preferences(in percent) | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Nov 93 |Dec 93 |Jan 94 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |SLD |> 25 |24 |19 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |PSL |20 |19 |118 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |UD |16 |14 |14 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Union of Labor |9 |9 |9 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Confederation for |5 |5 |8 | |an Independent Po-| | | | |land | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |KLD |7 |6 |5 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Nonparty Bloc in |3 |4 |5 | |Support of Reforms| | | | -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
