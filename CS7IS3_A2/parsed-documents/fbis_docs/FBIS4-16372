Speaking at a news conference in Moscow on Thursday, Vorobyov said that currently six new agreements are being prepared for signing, including on the legal status and terms of and procedure for the withdrawal of Russian troops temporarily stationed in Moldavia. These issues were in the centre of attention at the seven round of talks between the governmental delegations of Russia and Moldavia held in Kishinev [Chisinau] on April 5-6, Vorobyov said. It is hard to set the time of the withdrawal of the 14th Russian Army from Moldavia because of the absence of progress in resolving the Dniester conflict. The self-proclaimed Dniester Republic has been insisting on special political status for itself. Another reason for disagreements at the talks is the legislation of the Dniester Republic which contradicts Moldavian laws. "We are criticised that the talks are moving slowly, and this is fair enough," Vorobyov said. Asked about the disagreements between the commanders of the 14th Army and the Dniester leaders, Vorobyov stressed that they are not crucial and cannot affect the course of talks. Both the leaders and the population of the Dniester Republic are interested in Russian military presence in the region, Vorobyov continued. "But we are interested in bringing the armed forces within Russia's borders, so that the troops were gathered together and sorted out," he said.
