Bids will be invited soon for the privatization of the HungarHotels Corporation. HungarHotels is the only hotel chain the privatization of which has not yet begun, although several units were separated from the firm earlier. The make-up of the corporation will be further modified on the basis of the latest decision in February. Bids will be invited for 15 Hungarian and two German hotels, as well as for four Budapest hotels in the near future. The corporation currently has a capital of 9 billion forints [Ft], from which a business share worth Ft1.5 billion will be separated. The AVU is hoping for a professional investor who is also expected to underwrite a credit guarantee of Ft1.1 billion. HungarHotels used to underwrite this guarantee as the former owner of the Club Tihany Corporation. The AVU wants to invite bids for Club Tihany after the future of HungarHotels has been decided. The resort at lake Balaton was built from a Ft1.2-billion Austrian loan, and though it is profitable, the repayment of the loan is too great a task for the firm. A decision was made about the dividend policy of the firms belonging to the AVU. Although the budget expects a dividend payment of Ft4 billion, the AVU would only take as much from the firms as would not hamper the functioning of the corporations, and is even willing to pay the budget less than the projected amount. The first one of the firms owned by the Employee Stock Ownership Program, Aranypok [Golden Spider] Corporation, will appear on the stock exchange. The AVU still has a 10-percent share in the corporation which they are offering one-to-one for compensation vouchers. The underwriting can take place between 9 and 13 May.
