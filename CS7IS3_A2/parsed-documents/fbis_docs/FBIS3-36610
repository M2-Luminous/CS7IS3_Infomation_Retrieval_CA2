As a result of two rounds of UN-sponsored talks held in Geneva through the good offices of the Russian Federation and with the participation of the CSCE, a memorandum of 1 December 1993 and a communique of 13 January 1994 were signed. Both documents urge the conflicting sides to renounce violence, mapping out ways for a peaceful settlement. Nevertheless, Gudauta separatists are continuing to use artillery to shell the population in the Kodori gorge, burn down villages in Gali Rayon, and kill and attack civilians, women, children, and the elderly. Facts have emerged of killings of dozens of people, including prominent public figures. In effect, the deliberate policy of genocide and ethnic cleansing against the Georgian population in Abkhazia is continuing. Details of the latest act of vandalism committed by Gudauta separatists have emerged. With the use of heavy equipment, they burned down six villages in Gali rayon - Priveli Gali, Konstitutsia, Rechkhi, Pkhira, Namarkeli, and Ghumerishi. Hundreds of innocent people were burned to death in the fires. It is noteworthy that this latest act of barbarism occurred ahead of two important dates mentioned in the Geneva Communique of 13 January: 8 February, when a joint group of experts working on Abkhazia's status meets in Moscow, and 10 February, which is the beginning of the voluntary and peaceful repatriation of refugees and displaced persons to Gali Rayon. It is likely that the latest brutal act committed by the separatists was aimed at wrecking the Geneva process. The government of the Republic of Georgia states that it remains a supporter of and participant in the peaceful settlement of the conflict in Abkhazia but, at the same time, is ready to take all measures to defend Georgia's citizens who remain on the territory occupied by the separatists and their hirelings. We are also saying this in order to bring it to the attention of forces in Russia who by their opposition to the treaty between Russia and Georgia have in fact incited the Gudauta group to step up their barbarism.
