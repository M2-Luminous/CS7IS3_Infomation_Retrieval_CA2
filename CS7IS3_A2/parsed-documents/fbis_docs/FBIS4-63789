This incident took place on the day of "Kurban Bayrama" ("Festival of the Sacrifice"), observed throughout the Muslim world. At the time when President Geydar Aliyev was greeting people on the occasion of the holiday, the capital's arm of the law was dispersing crowds of people trying to get onto the central square. The police did not particularly stand on ceremony -- citizens and even deputies were crammed into buses and dispatched to interim detention centers. The catalyst in the exacerbation of the already complex relations between the authorities and the opposition forces in Azerbaijan was the fact that Baku has agreed to the terms of a truce in Karabakh and to having peacekeeping troops brought into the republic. The republic's parliament refused to discuss this problem. Deputies who demanded that this question be included on the agenda were accused of trying to destabilize the situation in the republic so as, subsequently, to take advtantage of that in order to take power into their own hands. Then the opposition adopted a decision to hold a rally. The authorities ignored their opponents' opinions and organized a persecution campaign against the leaders of the People's Front and the "Musavat" and National Independence of Azerbaijan parties. Extensive powers were given to the police, who then more than justified the hopes pinned on them. Having been a witness to the police beating one of the participants in the rally, your IZVESTIYA correspondent turned to an officer standing nearby. This proved to be enough for them to put me in the bus and take me to the rayon police station, keeping me there for over three hours. Since the leadership of the police station was unable to give me an intelligible answer as to why a journalist was arrested, and consequently deprived of the possibility of carrying out his professional duty, this question has been re-addressed to the prosecutor's office of Nasiminskiy Rayon.
