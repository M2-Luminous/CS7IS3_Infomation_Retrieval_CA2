FR941103-0-00006 FR941103-0-00002 The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. Such handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities. The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and the rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small orientation and compatibility. There are approximately 250 producers of Florida tomatoes under this marketing order, and approximately 50 handlers. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601) as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. The majority of Florida tomato producers and handlers may be classified as small entities. The budget of expenses for the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal period was prepared by the Florida Tomato Committee, the agency responsible for local administration of the marketing order, and submitted to the Department for approval. The members of the Committee are producers of Florida tomatoes. They are familiar with the Committee's needs and with the costs of goods and services in their local area and are thus in a position to formulate an appropriate budget. The budget was formulated and discussed in a public meeting. Thus, all directly affected persons have had an opportunity to participate and provide input. The assessment rate recommended by the Committee was derived by dividing anticipated expenses by expected shipments of Florida tomatoes. Because that rate will be applied to actual shipments, it must be established at a rate that will provide sufficient income to pay the Committee's expenses. The Committee met September 8, 1994, and unanimously recommended a 1994&hyph;95 budget of $2,215,000, $467,000 less than the previous year. Budget items for 1994&hyph;95 which have increased compared to those budgeted for 1993&hyph;94 (in parentheses) are: Office salaries, $297,300 ($276,000), depreciation, $18,200 ($16,200), communications, $12,000 ($10,000), employee's retirement program, $46,600 ($37,300), insurance and bonds, $7,000 ($5,000), office rent, $24,700 ($22,600), social security tax, $20,000 ($19,000), supplies and printing, $7,500 ($6,500), and audit, $2,500 ($2,300). Items which have decreased compared to those budgeted for 1993&hyph;94 (in parentheses) are: Research expense, $192,100 ($200,000), and education and promotion expense, $1,500,000 ($2,000,000). All other items are budgeted at last year's amounts. The Committee also unanimously recommended an assessment rate of $0.04 per 25-pound container, the same as last year. This rate, when applied to anticipated shipments of 55,000,000 25-pound containers, will yield $2,200,000 in assessment income. This, along with $15,000 in interest and other income, will be adequate to cover budgeted expenses.
