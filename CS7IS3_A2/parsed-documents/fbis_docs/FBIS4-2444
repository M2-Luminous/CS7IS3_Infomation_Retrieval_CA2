Shi Guangsheng, vice minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation, made the above announcement at the fourth national work conference on cracking down on the illegal export of textiles through the transit trade, which opened today. The conference, which is cosponsored by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, the General Administration of Customs, and the State Bureau of Commodity Inspection, will formulate a set of specific procedures for cracking down on illegal transit activities and will name a number of enterprises involved in the illegal export of textiles through the transit trade. Illegal transit textiles are textile products which were originally made in China but which were exported through fraudulent means to avoid the controls of textile quotas and through the transit trade via third countries or regions to countries having a quota limit on imports of Chinese textiles. The vice minister said: Such activities violate not only Chinese laws and regulations but also international agreements and relevant bilateral accords, thus seriously jeopardizing China's foreign trade export conditions and environment. Recently, China has strengthened efforts to crack down on the illegal export of textiles through the transit trade. Principal leaders of local economic and trade commissions, customs offices, and commodity inspection departments, as well as textile companies, have strengthened their leadership over this work, while many localities have set up joint task forces, have formulated a series of rules and regulations, and have publicized them through various documents and the media, thereby enabling more enterprises to realize the serious harm caused by such illegal transit textiles and thereby bringing such activities under control. He pointed out, however: The problem of illegal transit exports has not been totally solved. Although the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, the General Administration of Customs, and the State Bureau of Commodity Inspection have stepped up the efforts to curb and crack down on such illegal activities, and although the amount of illegal transit textiles exported after clearing customs is really insignificant, there still exist in Chinese territory a number of productive and operational undertakings aimed at illegally exporting textiles through the transit trade. Although the majority of foreign trade companies are aware of the need to crack down on the illegal export of textiles through the transit trade, and although they understand the relevant regulations against such illegal activities, some enterprises, especially foreign-funded enterprises and village and township enterprises, know little about the situation. For this reason, most of the problems result from them. Judging from the small number of cases uncovered occasionally, they resorted to more deceitful means. Shi Guangsheng said: In cracking down in the future on the illegal export of textile products through the transit trade, we will -- in accordance with the laws and statutes of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, of customs, and of the goods inspection administration, and proceeding from the characteristics of their professional work -- concentrate on quickly formulating a crackdown measure which stresses the division of work to check illegal activities and which also stresses coordination, and we will put this into effect as soon as possible. This year we will concentrate on the following tasks: While integrating prevention with control and cracking down, we will mainly rely on prevention; we will continue to carry out random checks of key areas and enterprises, strengthen the training of personnel assigned to crack down on the illegal transit trade in textile products, and coordinate closely with the governments of the relevant countries or the authorities of the relevant regions in the joint effort to crack down on the illegal transit trade.
