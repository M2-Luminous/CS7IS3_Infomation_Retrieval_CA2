The first of three reports states that "The United States is maneuvering to conduct a war exercise on the East Sea of Korea [Sea of Japan]. According to a report, the Japanese newspaper TOKYO SHIMBUN dated 23 March reported that the U.S. Government is considering an independent war exercise on the East Sea of Korea. The paper reported that the United States is employing a hardline policy against our country, such as the deployment of Patriot missiles in South Korea and setting up specific plans to resume the Team Spirit joint military exercise. The paper added that the U.S. Government is pushing ahead step by step with plans to implement a specific hardline policy." The second item begins: "According to a report, the Japanese newspaper YOMIURI SHIMBUN dated 23 March reported that Hajime Izumi, assistant professor of Sizuoka University, a Korean affairs expert, urged Japan to take measures to support the U.S. forces in Japan in case of emergency on the Korean peninsula." The report notes Izumi's call for an enactment of necessary laws for Japan "to effectively cope with a military conflict on the Korean peninsula." The report concludes, "This shows that if the United States provokes a new war on the Korean peninsula, Japan is scheming to actively cooperate and participate in it." The third item reports: "According to a report, the Japanese newspaper TOKYO SHIMBUN dated 23 March disclosed that the Japanese Self-Defense Air Force openly conducted a field maneuver of Patriot missiles on (Shariki) base in Aomori Prefecture on 22 March. The paper said that the missile launch pads are aimed at the northern sky. The missile field maneuver by the Self-Defense Air Force, which is conducted at a time when the United States is intensifying the military threat against our Republic, saying that it will deploy Patriot missiles to South Korea, shows that Japan is dancing to the tune of U.S. military pressure."
