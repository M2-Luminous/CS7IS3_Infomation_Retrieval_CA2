The meeting will be attended by experts from Asian and Pacific countries and the United Nations, they said. At the environment conference for Asia and the Pacific (ECO Asia '93) held in Chiba last June, Japan's Environment Agency pledged to draw up a report on such measures with the help of other Asia-Pacific nations and the U.N. The first meeting on the project called "ECO Asia 21 Plan" will decide on the date of release of the report while discussing concrete measures, the officials said. Japan will tell the meeting that it wants to submit an interim report to a gathering of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) to be held next year and a final report to a special U.N. General Assembly session in 1997, they said. The plan will propose policies, financial aid and international cooperation needed to maintain the environment and yet promote development in the region. The experts will draft the program after making projections for the region's future population, economic growth, manufacturing, agriculture, forestry, demand for energy, state of urban areas, and environmental conservation policies, the officials said.
