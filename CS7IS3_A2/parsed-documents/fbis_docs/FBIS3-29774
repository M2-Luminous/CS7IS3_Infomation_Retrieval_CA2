As a result, they agreed on the following: 1) They will support the Hosokawa administration qualitatively; 2) the two parties will continue to cooperate in the lower house by maintaining the joint floor group; and 3) Diet members of the two parties will further solidify their ties. Following the meeting, a senior Sakigake member explained: "Supporting the Hosokawa administration qualitatively means that we will support it even if Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura is assigned to another post in the cabinet reshuffle." Thus, he indicated Sakigake would accept a cabinet reshuffle if it means Takemura is not ousted and remains in the cabinet.
