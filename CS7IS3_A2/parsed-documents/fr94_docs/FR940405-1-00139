FR940405-1-00139 FR940405-1-00014 (3) Incorporating the sunscreen transmission spectrum into the convolution spectrum to obtain a UVA effectiveness ratio which is conveniently expressed as a UVA protection percentage (APP). The comment maintained that, unlike other methods, the APP represents the fraction of full spectrum UVA (320 to 400 nm) removed by a product. The comment stated that because the original ``full spectrum'' method produces an SPF value analogous to the clinically determined SPF number, the APP has direct relevance to the SPF determined on human subjects and is a subset of the full-spectrum SPF determination. The comment added that once an SPF has been determined clinically, it is simple to take the full-spectrum absorbance spectrum and calculate the APP based on the clinical test results. Therefore, although the determination of the APP does involve in vitro measurements, it also relies on direct clinical measurements. The comment contended that there are a number of advantages to using the APP system: (1) It is a subset of the existing SPF for sunscreen drug products and, therefore, relates to an erythemal endpoint in normal skin; (2) It does not unnecessarily duplicate clinical testing; (3) It clearly demonstrates whether a sunscreen drug product provides meaningful protection against UVA radiation, and it is useful in determining comparative UVA protection; (4) It avoids the deficiencies of nonsolar light sources, photosensitizing chemicals, the failure of dose reciprocity for human UVA exposures, and endpoints which do not relate to known UVA damage to human skin; (5) It is independent of exposure dose or duration; (6) It includes all the UVA wavelengths in their direct proportion and intensity as found in natural sunlight; and (7) It is directly relevant to overall product effectiveness. The comment added that in the absence of a light source specific to the UVA range, APP determination is the best measurement of a product's UVA protection level. One comment stated that the in vitro APP test is difficult to extend to a human in vivo situation and that the test cannot be used to study substantivity or stability. The comment added that because the APP test uses the erythema action spectrum and a mathematical extraction of the UVA segment of the solar spectrum, it overestimates the actual amount of UVA radiation blocked by most products. A reply comment argued that the APP technique is derived from well-studied and extensively published in vitro SPF methodology (Refs. 9, 10, and 11), that it is simple to evaluate water resistance using this model, and that data on water resistance have been published. The reply comment added that APP values are derived from the same spectral data (320 to 400 nm) that provide in vitro SPF values. The final SPF value from clinical studies is compared to the in vitro SPF and the absorbance spectrum can be matched to the exact clinical SPF for UVA calculations. The UVA portion of the sunscreen's efficacy can then be calculated from the in vitro SPF data. Therefore, the comment argued that the APP has direct relevance to the clinical effectiveness of the sunscreen product, but does not require the exposure of human subjects to unnecessary UV radiation. One comment stated that an in vitro method developed by Diffey and Robson (Ref. 12) avoids many of the limitations of in vivo methods (e.g., lack of reciprocity and light sources that produce 5 to 20 times the intensity of the sun) and allows the correct estimation of the attenuating power of a sunscreen drug product. The comment described this method as recording photocurrent in 5 nm steps from 290 to 400 nm and measuring the spectral transmission of UV radiation through a sample of Transpore TM tape with and without sunscreen applied. Transpore TM tape is UV radiation transparent and has a rough surface that distributes sunscreen products in a way similar to the uneven surface of the skin. Any radiation source may be used, providing there is a continuous power distribution between 290 and 400 nm. This method assesses the SPF of a product and the UVA/UVB ratio. The UVA/UVB ratio compares the reduction of UV radiation in the UVA region with that in the UVB region of the spectrum. According to the comment, this ratio can be used as an indicator of the UVA protection properties of a sunscreen drug product. One comment claimed that the method developed by Diffey and Robson (Ref. 12) has many advantages, as well as being simple, inexpensive, and well correlated with clinical testing. The comment noted that the method does not require a biological endpoint such as erythema, tanning, or immediate pigment darkening. The comment stated that the method provides a basis for the classification of the UVA protection provided by a product and added that a manufacturer planned to utilize the Diffey and Robson method to standardize the UVA claims of its products. Sunscreen products would be labeled with one to four stars depending upon the amount of UVA protection provided by the products as determined by the Diffey and Robson method. The comment concluded that using the ``star'' rating system for UVA claims and the SPF designation for UVB claims provides a simple method for consumers to determine the protective nature of a sunscreen product. The comment submitted a description of the manufacturer's methodology and ``star'' rating system (Ref. 13). Another comment submitted data describing the application of this ratio method to the determination of the SPF and UVA/UVB ratio of titanium dioxide and zinc oxide dispersions (Ref. 14). The comment noted that the accuracy of this method is enhanced by good product application and that the in vitro results obtained by this method show good agreement with in vivo values.
