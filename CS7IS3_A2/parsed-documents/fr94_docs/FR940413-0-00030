FR940413-0-00030 FR940413-0-00006 DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY Customs Service 19 CFR Part 10 [T.D. 94&hyph;40] RIN 1515&hyph;AB45 Duty-Free Treatment To Be Accorded the Reimportation of Certain Articles Originally Imported Duty Free AGENCY: Customs Service, Treasury. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This document amends the Customs Regulations to implement a provision of the Trade and Tariff Act of 1984 that extends duty-free entry to the reimportation of certain articles originally imported duty free. EFFECTIVE DATE: April 13, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Burton Schlissel, Special Classification Branch, Office of Regulations and Rulings, (202) 482&hyph;6980. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background For many years U.S. law, specifically, subheading 9801.00.20 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) and its predecessor tariff provision, item 801.00 of the Tariff Schedules of the United States (TSUS), has not imposed a tariff on articles reimported into the United States if, after exportation, they were not advanced in value or improved in condition by any process of manufacture or other means while abroad. This provision, in effect, sought to avoid double taxation/duty of such articles. Subsequent to the promulgation of item 801.00, TSUS, Congress enacted two duty preference schemes_the Caribbean Basin Initiative or CBI (enacted as the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (CBERA), 19 U.S.C. 2701&hyph;2706) and the Generalized System of Preferences or GSP (19 U.S.C. 2461&hyph;2466)_that also provide duty-free treatment for certain imports from designated beneficiary developing countries (BDCs). Item 801.00, TSUS, however, was drafted in language that precluded its application to articles that were entered duty free in the first instance. Thus, item 801.00, TSUS, operates to frustrate the purpose of those preference programs of encouraging development through trade. The Trade and Tariff Act of 1984 (the Act), 19 U.S.C. 1654 note, Public Law 98&hyph;573, 98 Stat. 2948, approved October 30, 1984, and effective as provided, was enacted to change the tariff treatment accorded certain articles and for other purposes. Section 118 of the Act, entitled ``Reimportation of certain articles originally imported duty free'' and effective November 14, 1984, sought to correct the unanticipated discriminatory effects of item 801.00, TSUS, on eligible products from BDCs by amending that provision to extend duty-free treatment to goods which were previously entered free of duty pursuant to the CBI and GSP preference programs. Section 10.108 of the Customs Regulations (19 CFR 10.108) pertains to the entry of reimported articles exported under lease, but has not been amended to reflect the provisions of section 118 of the Act. Accordingly, ยง10.108 is amended to enable articles initially entered duty free under the CBI and GSP programs to be exported and reimported duty free, provided the other requirements of subheading 9801.00.20 are complied with. Inapplicability of Public Notice and Delayed Effective Date Requirements, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, and Executive Order 12866 Because this amendment merely reflects a statutory requirement that confers a benefit upon the public, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), notice and public procedure thereon are not required. Further, for the same reasons, good cause exists for dispensing with a delayed effective date under 5 U.S.C. 553(d) (1) and (3). Since this document is not subject to the notice and public procedure requirements of 5 U.S.C. 553, it is not subject to provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ). This amendment is not a significant regulatory action as specified in E.O. 12866. Drafting Information The principal author of this document was Gregory R. Vilders, Regulations Branch.
