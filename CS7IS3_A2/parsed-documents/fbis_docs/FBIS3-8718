Maglaj correspondent Hajrudin Sermic reports on the situation in the area and says that "several 120-mm howitzer shells were fired at the town center this morning, while antiaircraft machine guns and snipers are blasting away at all the residential areas of the town." Mirza Sadikovic, reporting from Bihac, says that "since 2200 last night until the time of filing this report, it seems that the fighting has abated somewhat. The Bihac town center and Cazin are being targeted less frequently. However, mortars and howitzers are still targeting the outskirts of both the Cazin and Bihac municipalities, as well as roads and the Bihac industrial zone. Although less intensely, artillery and antiaircraft weapons are still active on the defense lines. There has been an intensification of sniper activity. In the early morning hours, 10 tank and mortar shells were fired at the Grmusko-Srbljanksi plateau and Grabez. Moreover, there was some activity overnight on the (?Stotejski) and Pljesivica part of the front which is part of the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] operational zone. Provocations have also been registered last night and this morning on the confrontation lines with the remnants of the so-called para-army of the Kladusa autonomy." An unidentified correspondent from the 3d Corps Information Center reports that "the cease-fire with the HVO is mostly holding. Only single extremist soldiers have violated the cease-fire with small arms provocations in the Lasva River valley and around Gornji Vakuf." Correspondent Enes Sakic reports from the 4th Corps Press Center in Mostar and says that "in the region of the North Operative Group, the cease-fire has been observed by both sides. Only the forces of the Serbian aggressor used howitzers and mortars to shatter the calm." An unnamed correspondent from the 1st Corps Information Center says that "this morning again shows that the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army troops are the only ones who are observing the cease-fire, while the Chetniks started their activity early this morning from their positions around the city. A sniper wounded one of our (?soldiers) in the region of Stup, while another two soldiers were wounded in Dobrinja. Therefore, it is to be expected that the chetnik killers, unscrupulous yet sadly unpunished, will today continue their activities, so citizens are warned to exercise the usual caution when moving around the city."
