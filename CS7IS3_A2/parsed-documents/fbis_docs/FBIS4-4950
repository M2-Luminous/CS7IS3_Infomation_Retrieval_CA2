FBIS4-4950 "dreas066_d_94013" FBIS-EAS-94-066 Daily Report 2 Apr 1994 South Korea Tariff Increase Considered on Apparel, Footwear Tariff Increase Considered on Apparel, Footwear SK0204074394 Seoul THE KOREA HERALD in English 2 Apr 94 p 8 SK0204074394 Seoul THE KOREA HERALD English BFN [Text] The government, which is working on the tariff schedule for 1995, is considering raising the tariff rates on apparel, footwear and toys up to 15 percent from the current 8 percent level. Though it is set to accommodate tariff concessions it has committed itself to under the Uruguay Round accord, the government has room for tariff rate increases for apparel, footwear and toys, the Ministry of Finance said yesterday. Under the Uruguay Round accord concluded last December, the ministry said, Korea is set to cut the tariff rates in the years ahead, not from the current 8 percent level, but from the 20 percent level in the 1986 base year. The ministry said the government will consider industrial competitiveness in readjusting tariff rates and that tariff rates on apparel, footwear and other light industrial products are far lower than in other countries. In Japan, for example, tariff rates on apparel, footwear and toys exceed 20 percent, the ministry said. The government, it said, will be able to lower tariff rates on heavy-chemical industrial products. The 1995 tariff schedule will include yearly cuts in tariff rates that are set to decline to zero percent or to a minimum level in five to 10 years under the Uruguay Round accord, the ministry said. Those items whose tariffs are scheduled to be eliminated during the next five to 10 years include computer input and output devices, printers and semiconductors. To reduce the impact of the opening of the domestic farm market, the ministry said, the government plans to introduce specific tariff rates on certain farm products. The government will also consider applying the higher rates of the ad valorem and specific rates on certain other farm products, the ministry said. Specific rates will help curb low-priced imports as they are applied to the volume of imports in contrast with ad valorem rates applied to the value of imports, the ministry said. The government will no longer prepare a five-year tariff reduction plan, the ministry said. The second five-year tariff reduction plan ends this year. When tariffs were high, the government was forced to announce long-term tariff reduction plans. The average tariff rate, which stood at 21.9 percent, has been cut to 7.9 percent as of this year. "Even without a tariff reduction plan, Korea is set to cut tariff rates under the Uruguay Round accord," said an official from the ministry. "In addition, we do now know that will happen during the next five years." The ministry said the government will prepare a draft tariff schedule for the 1995 during the first half of this year and send it to the National Assembly for approval in September. A committee set up to work on the draft schedule, chaired by Ku Pyong-hoe, chairman of the Korea Foreign Trade Association, held its first meeting yesterday morning. Committee members include government officials, economists and business representatives.
