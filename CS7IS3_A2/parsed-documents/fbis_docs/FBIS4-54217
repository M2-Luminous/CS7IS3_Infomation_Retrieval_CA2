FBIS4-54217 "dreas102__a94001" FBIS-EAS-94-102-A Daily Report 25 May 1994 ANNEX Japan Further Reaction to Resumption of Framework Talks Further Reaction to Resumption of Framework Talks Framework Priorities Agreed OW2605095394 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 25 May 94 Evening Edition p 1--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW2605095394 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] The Japan-U.S. Economic Framework Talks are set to resume, but Japan is already facing more problems because the United States wants to add five additional areas, including "banking services" to the list of priority issues to be addressed at the talks. Japan faced a tough enough time at the talks settling the question of objective criteria in the existing agreed three priority, including automobiles and auto parts. The additions mean Japan faces difficult negotiations over more areas. If the "deregulation and competitive policy" is included, it will probably have an impact on the outline of exterior economic policy reform, which the government planned to finish by the end of June. Japan says it will discuss the issue of expanding the priority list with the United States, but it is expected to basically accept the U.S. request. "Banking services" and "deregulation and competitive policy" had been the subject of bilateral negotiations up until February, when the whole framework talks broke down. But because so little progress was made, the Japanese Government feels "this is a new start." The "deregulation and competitive policy" area is expected to command a lot of attention and the Japanese Government is at present working on details to be included in the outline of the exterior economic policy reform. If Japan-U.S. negotiations on this area begin, it is possible that the U.S. demands on deregulation will be clearly visible in the outline. Japan is very concerned about the fact that sheet glass and forestry products have been raised as areas for negotiation. Each is an area in which certain U.S. companies and pressure groups have been putting pressure on the U.S. Government. If Japan is slow to act, the United States may take sanctions under Section 301 of the 1988 Omnibus Trade Act. In the informal negotiations on resuming the framework talks, the United States may appear to have made a concession by retracting its demand for numerical targets. However, its demand that additional trade areas be discussed can be seen as a new way of shaking up Japan.
