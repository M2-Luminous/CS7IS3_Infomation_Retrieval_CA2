Full membership, which would create new rifts between the Central and East European states and the CIS republics, could not be in the interests of all involved, the foreign minister said in his annual survey of foreign policy on Friday. A fundamental decision is to be announced in Brussels, Kinkel announced. Bringing the states of Central and East Europe closer to Western institutions is a top priority of German foreign policy. After taking over the presidency of the European Union on 1 July 1994, Bonn will work hard on the early conclusion of a cooperation agreement with Russia. This would bring Moscow into increasingly close partnership.
