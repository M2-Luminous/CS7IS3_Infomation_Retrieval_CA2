FBIS4-27438 "dreas106__a94025" FBIS-EAS-94-106-A Daily Report 24 May 1994 ANNEX Japan NTT To Sell U.S. Software for `Multifaxes' NTT To Sell U.S. Software for `Multifaxes' 942A0268A Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN in Japanese 24 May 94 p 7--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 942A0268A Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN Japanese CSO [Text] Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) subsidiary NTT International [Minato ward, Tokyo; Hideaki Kamitsuma, president], which engages in the design and sales of electrical communication systems from overseas sources, on 1 June will begin domestic sales of U.S.-made software used in developing systems for processing facsimile transmissions. The software enables the building of a system to integrate processing of voice and facsimile on a personal computer with only a voice-processing board and without installation of a facsimile-processing board, enabling addition of the function at about one-half of prior costs. The subsidiary plans to capitalize on the introduction of the new software by expanding product offerings in the facsimile-processing equipment group. The product that the subsidiary will sell on an exclusive basis is "Multifax" made by communications and data-processing equipment maker Commetrex (Atlanta, Georgia; Michael Coffey, president). The software enables installation of a system with as many as 2,148 circuits. Processing speeds are set at 9,600 bits per second for transmissions and 4,800 per second for receipts. The software is used in conjunction with a voice branch exchange (VBX) voice-processing board made by U.S. Natural Micro-System (NMS) Company. The system functions on top of a digital signal processor mounted with a voice-processing board and does not affect the performance of personal computers. The subsidiary envisions development of software that will boost transmission and receiving speeds to 9,600 bits per second by this summer and is considering sales of communications modems in the future. The price is set at 400,000 yen for the installation kit and 7,500 yen for licensing of each circuit. Each additional personal computer connection will require a 12,000 yen fee for an unauthorized-software-copy prevention connector. The subsidiary has a goal for the first fiscal year of selling enough systems integrators developed through the use of NMS voice-processing boards to cover 300 circuits.
