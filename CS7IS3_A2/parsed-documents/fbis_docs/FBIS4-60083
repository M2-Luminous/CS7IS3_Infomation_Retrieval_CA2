The latest official figures show the UK's total trade with Iran in March was only pnds 54 million, a third down on the corresponding month in 1993. Predictions are that the amount could slump even further following the discovery of a bug in Iran's London Embassy. Most of the drop in business between the two countries is due to Tehran buying only pnds 32 m worth of goods from Britain during March, 40 percent less than last year. Iran's exports for the month, although pnds 4 m down, were actually the highest since May 1993. London's relations with Iran have been sour since the Islamic revolution in 1979, and trade has remained at only a fraction of what was Britain's largest market in the Middle East. In 1989, ties were finally severed by Tehran following the worldwide controversy over the publication of Salman Rushdie's blasphemous book, `The Satanic Verses,' and were not renewed until the British Government clarified its position on the issue. Subsequent expectations of relations to reach ambassadorial level have not since been fulfilled and instead, there has been renewed concern that Iran's Majles may again be led to break ties, unless the matter of bugging of Tehran's London mission is resolved.
