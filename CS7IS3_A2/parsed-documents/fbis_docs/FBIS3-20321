The office manager for the Syrian vice president overmodestly pretended to be first secretary of the embassy in Prague when he filled in the immigration card at Budapest Airport. He provided the following as the purpose of his trip: "tourism." However, Nabil Sharitah, 44, was aware that he would not have any time for the view of the Danube in room 214 of the Forum Hotel. An envoy of the Federal Intelligence Service (BND) expected him there for a conspiratorial meeting. The West German agent forced his partner in the discussion to come to Budapest by threatening to disclose various things in the Syrian's eventful life. There the BND man, who had also brought an official of the Federal Office of Criminal Investigation (BKA) with him, sharply interrogated the Arab. After a nervous breakdown, Sharitah signed a paper: "I declare that I will fly to Germany of my own free will." The interest of German authorities in the Syrian diplomat is understandable. Sharitah, who was arrested in Berlin in January after he had entered the country, is the key figure in spectacular proceedings concerning international terrorism in Berlin. And he is better aware than most people of his government's cordial relations with a man who is hunted all over the world: Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, called "Carlos." Top terrorist Carlos, 44, whose bloody trail leads from the attack on the Vienna OPEC conference in 1975 (three deaths) to the bomb attack on the Marseilles central station in 1983 (four deaths), also pulled the strings for an attack on the French cultural center Maison de France in Berlin on 25 August 1983. German Johannes Weinrich, 46, Carlos' right-hand man, had delivered the material for the bomb, nitropenta plastic explosive, to East Berlin. And the gray gentlemen from the Stasi also participated. First, they took the explosive consignment away from Weinrich, but they returned it to him after some hesitation. Stasi Lieutenant Colonel Helmut Voigt, who is today 51 years old and is charged with aiding and abetting murder by a grand criminal division of the Berlin Land Court, was responsible for it. Last week, the public prosecutor demanded four and a half years' imprisonment; the sentence is expected before Easter. Shahritah, who was the third secretary of the Syrian Embassy in East Berlin at that time, also provided assistance for the terrorist attack. Weinrich first stored his bomb materiel in Sharitah's workroom. A cache from Carlos' group -- with Italian submachine guns, electrical fuzes, and 6,100 rounds of ammunition for 9 mm self-loading weapons -- had been there for years. The diplomat had been instructed by a very high official that he should be at the service of Carlos' gang. The intelligence service of the Syrian Air Force had ordered through official channels via the Foreign Ministry in Damascus that the desperados "be helped in any way possible." Embassy Councillor Sharitah's support for Carlos has gotten him charged with having aided and abetted murder and caused a bomb explosion. However, more than 10 years after the deed, the legal assessment of the bloody attack is in danger of being lost in a tangle of agents' games and diplomatic tactics. Syria, which has been notorious as a godfather of international terrorism for years, is playing a key role in the peaceful solution being pursued in the Middle East. Last week, during a visit to Bonn, Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' stated ambiguously that German-Syrian relations must not be clouded by the Berlin lawsuit. However, FRG Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel (Free Democratic Party of Germany) gave the Syrians the brush-off: Lawsuits are "exclusively the courts' business in the rule-of-law state of Germany." It has not yet been finally clarified how and why Sharitah, for whom a German arrest warrant was issued only in the autumn of 1993, gave himself up to the Berlin judiciary at all. There are many indications of dilletantism and questionable forgery practices by German services during the operation. According to the most plausible version, an Arab BND member got in touch with Sharitah by telephone from southern Europe. It was the BND's priority interest to investigate Carlos and Weinrich's habitat. The two terrorists were granted asylum in Damascus. Since October 1992, Bonn has been demanding their extradition from Syria through verbal note 549. Now, pressure that is more common in this line of business was supposed to help. The German security authorities evaluated comprehensive documents that had been accumulated on Sharitah; among them were details on possible compromising contacts. Apparently the material was enough to force Sharitah to participate in the meeting in Budapest. However, he claims that he came voluntarily, "for private reasons," to the Hungarian capital. As an investigator reported, the Syrian's interrogation, which took hours, ended in dissent between the police and the agent. The BKA official wanted to transfer the accused to Germany, while the BND agent advocated a "professional" solution: Sharitah should spy for the Germans from Damascus. According to the investigator, another idea only took shape when Sharitah had been "completely broken down" in the interrogation: The Syrian should travel to Germany and give himself up there. First of all, however, the papers necessary to do this were lacking. Sharitah only had a diplomatic visa (15305005) for a visit to the FRG, which was not yet stamped "invalid," but had expired on 17 May 1993. In the hotel room the last figure was removed "with a razor blade" and replaced with a 4, an investigator reported. However, the controllers at Budapest Airport became suspicious. Therefore, the conspiratorial trio did not fly, as planned, to Berlin right away. Only then, this time with the help of the local BKA resident responsible for drug searches, and the embassy, did they procure a regular visa. It was issued on 7 January 1994. The BKA refuses to provide any information on that. However, last Friday [25 March] the Foreign Ministry in Bonn confirmed to DER SPIEGEL, which has a copy of the relevant visa, that the visa had actually become invalid in 1993. The Berlin judiciary is currently holding onto the doctored diplomatic passport. Berlin Senior Public Prosecutor Detlev Mehlis ("Nobody dragged him here in a box") feared that the lives of Sharitah and his family were in "serious danger." Therefore, seven weeks ago, the principal witness in the lawsuit dealing with the attack on the Maison de France was only permitted to give evidence hidden behind a screen and the courtroom in Moabit resembled a fortress. While Sharitah initially feared for his life, a surprising change -- mysterious Orient -- has now occurred. After a visit to his cell by the Syrian ambassador, principal witness Sharitah pretends to know nothing about the Syrians' terrorist connection. Now he is expressing his latest insight to judges and public prosecutors: "Syria is combating terrorism." At any rate, he never saw Carlos and Weinrich again in Damascus, he said. This fits in with the official version that the Syrian foreign minister presented to his Bonn counterpart Kinkel the week before last. Accordingly, the two terrorists left the country long ago -- for Aden in Yemen or Tripoli in Libya. However, according to the BKA files of the investigations, Carlos and his German companion are still very well-known in Damascus -- even in the German Embassy. According to these documents, Weinrich, who has a fleet of eight Mercedes limousines in the Syrian capital, always tries to be near his compatriots. In 1991 he still made merry at the Lufthansa Oktoberfest in the Sheraton and he appeared almost daily in the hotel's pub. A Mercedes major account manager also invited Weinrich, who called himself "Peter Schmidt" at that time, to his home -- diplomats made merry together with them. A witness said: "I have to proceed on the assumption that Schmidt is also very well-known to German Embassy personnel." Reportedly, bon vivant Weinrich, who, according to the witness, always carries a gun in a "hip holster on his right side," even presented comrade-in-arms Carlos a Mercedes and introduced him with the following words: "This is my boss." German businessmen also spotted the two top terrorists again and again at the Sheraton bar. In the summer of 1991, two BKA officers traveled to Damascus to finally find out for certain. A Mercedes employee was to procure Weinrich's fingerprints. The attempt was successful. "In order to comply with my duty as a citizen," the businessmen recovered an empty pack of Lucky Strike cigarettes that the terrorist had thrown into the wastepaper basket. "Peter Schmidt's" fingerprints removed the last doubts: They were those of Johannes Weinrich. The evidence on Mr. Schmidt's life is also piling up with the Berlin police. Last July, Weinrich was still seen in Damascus. There he went about his daily business undisturbed, although Kinkel's Foreign Ministry had briefed the Syrians on the contents of the BKA reports long ago. Public Prosecutor Mehlis passed the findings on to the land court. In his accompanying letter, he announced resignedly that, in addition, he would make them accessible to the Foreign Ministry, "in order to gain support for the local request for Weinrich's deportation" -- "although it seems to me that the result is a foregone conclusion."
