Bogomolov, director of the Institute of International Economic and Political Research of the Russian Academy of Sciences; Academician G.A. Arbatov, director of the Russian Academy of Sciences U.S. and Canada Institute; A.O. Chubaryan, director of the Russian Academy of Sciences Institute of Universal History; Kirill, Metropolitan of Smolensk and Kaliningrad and chairman of the foreign affairs department of the Moscow Patriarchy of the Russian Orthodox Church; S.B. Stankevich, political adviser to the president of Russia; A.M. Vasilyev, director of the Russian Academy of Sciences Africa Institute; E.I. Pain, member of the Presidential Council and the director of the Center for Ethnopolitical and Regional Research; V.K. Volkov, director of the Russian Academy of Sciences Institute of Slavic and Balkan Research; and A.A. Iskenderov, editor in chief of the VOPROSY ISTORII magazine. The comments of the participants in the discussion are published below in abridged form. O.T. Bogomolov: It was good to hear today from the minister's mouth that the region of East, Central, and Southeast Europe (for brevity we will use East Europe) should have priority in our policy and that we should pay more attention to it and direct more effort into the development of relations with the countries in that region. The facts bear witness that until recently this region held, unfortunately, a place far from honor in our policy; a number of circumstances--perhaps objective--distracted our attention to somewhat different areas, and we underestimated East Europe from the standpoint of its geopolitical location and its significance for the security of Russia and our trade and economic interests. I agree with the minister's very correct remark that for us this region serves as a bridge to Europe--moreover, to the world. East European countries are closer to West Europe and they have more experience in establishing relations; besides, our communications--both transportation and other kinds--with the West and the world go through this region. It was also correctly noted that we have common problems of postcommunist development. It is true that East European countries are somewhat ahead of us, and their experience--both political and economic--is very valuable. Had we paid more attention to what is happening in Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary instead of looking only at models of American liberal economics, perhaps we could have avoided many extremely grave consequences of the "shock therapy," which generally is not working in our country. It is precisely among the specialists in East European countries that we frequently find understanding of our difficulties. They do in-depth research of many sides of this transition period. We, on the other hand, frequently deal with very superficial, shallow judgments of specialists from the International Monetary Fund and other Western scholars. Speaking about this region, I would like to emphasize not only the communality of problems but also the not-yet-lost personal ties, the experience in contacts. We should not forget that, for instance, in the eastern part of Germany there are probably at least several hundred thousand people who speak Russian and know our reality well, not to mention the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary, where many people know us well, speak Russian, and are easy to communicate with. It seems to me that East Europe is also seriously underestimated from the standpoint of its importance as a market for our industry, for our economy, and from the standpoint of being a supplier of many products. These ties have been disrupted, which is fraught with serious difficulties, if not more than that, for a number of sectors of our economy, especially in transportation, since half of our means of transportation, especially rail transport, came in the form of rolling stock and locomotives made in Germany, the Czech Republic, and Poland. The disintegration of these ties jeopardizes the operation of our transportation sector. In this respect it should be noted that we are aware of moral liability to these countries--both on the part of the former USSR and perhaps our own. It is a fact, after all, that hundreds of thousands of workers are finding themselves laid-off at enterprises in the Czech Republic and eastern part of Germany because we cut off the economic specialization ties set up by the former Soviet Union. We can no longer afford to buy electric locomotives which used to be the specialty of Czech factories--we cannot pay for them because the price of each electric locomotive is now up to 2 billion rubles. We should also keep in mind that we are seeing a more active policy on the part of the United States of America, the countries of the European Community, and especially Germany, in the East European region, aimed at bringing it into their sphere of influence, which creates a certain danger of our isolation. There are many comments by Western public figures regarding the way they see this region from the standpoint of their interests and how much they would like to prevent the restoration of Russian influence in East Europe. We at the institute draw the following conclusion from the above: Russia must considerably energize its policy in the direction of East Europe with the aim of restoring disrupted neighborly relations, strengthening mutual trust, and finding new forms for cooperation and security guarantees. I am very glad to see what the government and the Russian Federation MFA are doing in this direction; this includes visits by the Russian Federation president, and other initiatives; of course, this is all useful. However, in our opinion, we are still facing a score of unresolved issues both in the area of East European security and in the area of development of regional economic cooperation. The leadership, the diplomatic community, the mass media, and the Russian public must show not only in words but prove in deed that we are interested in the success of free market and democratic reforms in East European countries, that we are interested in studying this experience. We also have to show that we will not be a source of threat to their independence and freedom. Now about the new mechanisms and institutes guaranteeing security in the region. I think that the all-European process--which, according to Western propaganda, is allegedly being moved increasingly more to the back burner, and perhaps interest in it is waning--must nevertheless be promoted by us as one of the most important priorities, because resolution of the issues of our own security and security guarantees for East Europe is linked with the further development of the all-European process. We also have to admit the fairness of Western criticism which maintains that documents on the all-European process do not have any institutional support. Yes, in this respect perhaps NATO has a number of advantages. Still, in my opinion, initiatives in the area of common European security are necessary, and we have to have our own position. Perhaps it would be more advantageous for us now to place a certain emphasis on improvement of all-European institutions within the framework of the Helsinki Agreements, or put forward our idea of a certain transformation of NATO stemming from the fact that the alliance is posed to expand its membership. In my opinion, the most important aspect of our relations with East Europe is economic. The East European market is very valuable for us, because both the Czechs and the Poles are willing to buy many items we produce. And vice versa, we also need what they produce very much--I already mentioned means of transportation; if our transportation sector grinds to a halt, it will mean the collapse of our economy. Therefore, we have to look for a solution. To think that such solutions have already been found on the basis of intergovernment agreements would probably be an overestimation of their significance, since these agreements do not entail any specific obligation. In our country obligations are now the province of enterprises--they deliver the product, and they buy it. For the past two to three years our institute has been attempting to explain to the government the possibility of setting up a special mechanism for settling accounts with East European countries, because the clearing method of the past had a number of shortcomings. We proposed a system of combining in one large mechanism both trade and clearing functions on the basis of multilateral barter. It appeared to gain support, but it turned out to be very difficult to see this idea through to the end. There used to be Comecon, which in good time, and probably for good reason, was disbanded. Still, the need for regional ties remains. We have attempted to create such a body on the basis of private business--the International Organization for Promotion of Regional Cooperation. The institute made space and some money available to launch this organization. We recently conducted a meeting of representatives of central banks from near abroad and East European countries in order to boost these contacts and exchange information. It would be desirable to have the government's assistance in creating--perhaps, no longer at the government but rather the public level, or with the participation of businessmen--such organizations as could pick up where we left off after the elimination of Comecon. We have to look for new forms--not the kind that have discredited themselves, such as Comecon or the Warsaw Pact--but different ones that would facilitate the development of this regionalism with our participation. A.O. Chubaryan: I think that bringing the issue of East Europe to the consideration of the council is extremely useful. In my opinion, Russia's position with respect to East Europe has a bearing on a more general problem--the concept of Russian foreign policy, on one hand, and on the other--the new configuration in Europe as we approach the 21st century. I agree with Andrey Vladimirovich's opinion that we have passed the first stage with respect to East Europe--clearing the debris; but as always, there is still something left. We are now entering the most difficult stage: defining new relations. There exists--although many would deny it--a certain resistance on the part of the West against restoring our positions in East Europe. I think that the next stage will be a protracted and hard one for us. The first direction, as I see it, is bilateral relations. Signing agreements, and the very useful visits by the president of the Russian Federation, have created a foundation, but it seems to me that this layer is very thin and only the upper one. The entire infrastructure of Russia's ties with East Europe, destroyed as a result of the collapse of the regimes that we all had, resulted in the destruction of the old, but the new is not yet in place. We have to a large extent practically lost the ties we had with them along social lines. In this respect the minister remarked correctly on the human factor--the old generation is leaving the scene, and we are not establishing any ties with the new generation. Therefore, I think, the first task is to restore the infrastructure along all lines: cultural, scientific, and social. This task is not limited to the MFA--it applies to all organizations and structures. But the MFA should act as a coordinating organization in this regard. The representatives of our new party are weak. The growing parties are eager to establish contacts within the framework of association of liberal parties and social democrats. But I have not heard or seen them establishing active contacts with the respective East European Christian or federal social-democratic parties. Something that is closer to home for me--science, for instance; in this respect contacts are extremely limited. This is a result of lack of money and, of course, a certain apprehension that exists in East European countries. Therefore, in my belief, this is a global direction that we should persistently pursue; we need to establish a new infrastructure of Russian-Polish, Russian-Czech, Russian-Bulgarian, Russian-Romanian, and other ties using all sorts of levers. The second point, the second direction, is regionalism. Currently all Europe is gripped by a very active renaissance of regional ideas. Why would Russian diplomacy not advance new initiatives in this direction? I agree with the idea already put forward here that we need to use East European countries in order to give a boost to our ties with the West. I am convinced that restoration of the status of Russia as a great power will depend to a great extent on the place and influence we restore--or retain--in East European countries, not to mention CIS countries. We are not talking about the restoration of old, even allied relations, but it is quite obvious that we need to work in this direction. In this we need to use historic and many other traditions. Especially considering that, as we know, and as already emphasized today, the main hurdles have been cleared. I think we need some kind of initiative line with respect to our "presence" in the resolution of various problems. We could probably use various political levers associated, among other things, with the security system. I also believe that the all-European process is skidding because ideas sink into the sand. We probably should advance new ideas for the institutionalization of potential regional and common European security projects. In this respect I believe that the already mentioned "Balladur Plan" is interesting. But I will say frankly, Andrey Vladimirovich, that Russia already today, while it is getting to its feet, is capable of claiming its own plan of vision from Moscow. In the past we played a great role in creating an all-European system; perhaps now we should bring experts and politicians into this and propose our concept of Europe at the threshold of the 21st century. Our initiatives in these matters will increase both the general importance and significance of Russia in these matters. And, finally and lastly: I think we should restore and expand some of the forms of cooperation with East European countries that existed in the past. I have in mind historical science. We, Russian historians, have already traveled our part of the road with respect to East European countries in the sense of admitting our mistakes. I believe that we could now return to the idea of reactivating certain joint projects with them involving historical traditions, summarizing the experience of cooperation with this countries. We are open to this; we are ready. I want to inform you that in the historical sciences alone we have already restored, at the initiative of Bucharest, a Romanian-Russian commission of historians, and at the initiative of Prague--a Czech-Russian commission of historians. We take a rather flexible position in our relations with them; we are agreeable to include in the research the issues they are interested in. We should help East European historians make use of our archives. This would be extremely useful. Metropolitan Kirill: I would like to express gratitude for the opportunity for the Russian Orthodox Church to participate in the Foreign Policy Council, and for the new style of relations that has been established with the Russian Orthodox Church. I would like to start from a perhaps unexpected premise. First, from the general tone of the document distributed to us entitled "Theses for Discussion." A certain axiom that is not questioned is built a priori into the basis of this document; this axiom may be described as follows. There is a strategic goal in Russia's foreign policy, which is formulated as the integration of Russia into the so-called civilized world, or Western world. Following that, everything we find in this document is tied to this goal. East Europe and Central Europe are seen through the prism of the extent to which our relations with East and Central Europe will further or hamper this integration. I thank Andrey Vladimirovich for his introductory comments, which helped me to understand that at least in the MFA leadership, too, there are synonyms to the notion of "integration." I would like to insist that in terms of our domestic policy, in terms of the popular attitude to foreign policy activities of the government, it would be more correct, more psychologically correct, more politically appropriate, instead of the notion of integration to use those synonyms the minister suggested today in speaking of partnership, cooperation, and allied relations. And in this sense there is nothing new in Russian policy. The point is that all of us, being the children of the recent Soviet past, have been shaped by the foreign policy of the Soviet Union, whether we like it or not. And for us the notion of "allied relations with Russia" is something strange, is some kind of discovery, and for a very considerable spectrum of our social forces it is a betrayal of our national interests, because people still act on the premise of this short historic context delimited by the 75-plus years of Soviet power. But Russia is not 70 years old. It is almost more than 1,000 years old. Let us work on the basis of this historical context. In this respect Russia has always had allied relations with the West (France, Austria, Germany), but nobody in Petersburg ever seriously entertained the thought that these allied relations assume Russia's integration into Germany, Austria, France, or West Europe. Therefore, I think, we need to understand the following. Sometimes terms we use rather frivolously--and this also may be the result of our Soviet education--are not meant to convey any particular ideas, but those who listen to us often interpret these terms in a way detrimental to us. I am deeply convinced that Russia's foreign policy today does not assume such integration into West Europe that could jeopardize the value of Russia in its own right as a great Eurasian state. But the use of the term "integration," especially in the context of integration into the civilized world--it is very hard to understand what exactly this means. As if Russia with its 1,000-year culture is not part of the civilized world. Well, it is better to avoid this phraseology. I would like you to understand me correctly: This comment is linguistic, not political, in nature, but since terminology in politics is a matter of some importance, I would like to insist that we use correct terminology in putting together the documents coming from our foreign policy agency. Now on substance. Can we seriously speak of integrating Russia into West Europe--let us agree that for the moment we are using this term in the good sense of the word, in the sense that Belgium, Holland, Luxembourg, Italy, France, and Germany are integrated into Europe? I think we should ask a serious question: To what extent is it justifiable at all to speak of such a goal? Whether we like it not, Russia is a fait accompli; it is the result of 1,000 years of historical development. It is not merely a country--it is the immense Eurasian continent with a colossal, unprecedented potential in both material and intellectual resources. It is another matter that Russia currently is in a position of extreme hardship, and that we may speak of some degeneration of our potential. But a lot of time will have to pass before Russia degenerates. And I am convinced that this will never happen. So we are indeed talking about a colossal potential. The question arises as to whether this colossal potential can be integrated into the Western economic and political system in such a way that it would be first acceptable for the Western system, and permissible in substance for Russia. I think not. Russia will never be integrated in the Western system the way other countries are integrated in it because Russia is Russia; because Russia stretches from Kaliningrad practically to Chukotka; because Russia is an immense Eurasian community. In the same sense one cannot speak seriously of integrating the United States into West Europe. Such integration also will never happen, despite the existence of a communality of political interests, but with respect to economic interests I do not think there is any particular communality, although economists would be in a better position to comment on this. And that is not to mention cultural antagonisms. Speaking of Russia's relations with the Western world, we need to speak of cooperation, partnership, and even allied relations, although every time we should think through very carefully what exactly we mean by allied relations. Nevertheless, the arguments presented by Andrey Vladimirovich greatly impressed me. That is, we do not know what would be happening now in the geographic regions of the CIS had we not registered at this stage our allied relations with Western countries. This is a very strong argument. This does not mean at all that we should be allies always and under any circumstances. Politics is a dynamic and flexible business; at some point we may be allies, at some point our views may diverge and relations cool. But most importantly, Russia must remain a geopolitical center, which it always will be. Moreover, the world needs it. In the context of this line of thinking let me touch on Central and East Europe. First, it has been correctly noted here that we have neglected East Europe. This has been a terrible hypocrisy. On one hand we kept saying that they were our brothers and allies, that this was the socialist camp. But let us put it straight: In reality Soviet foreign policy's attitude to East Europe was contemptuous. Soviet policy divided the world into first- and second-class countries, and the tragedy, lies, and ambiguity of our position were that the USSR's allies were in reality considered second-class countries. I must confess the church's sin as well. This imprint, this pressure of political ideals was reflected in church affairs as well. We worked on building relations with the United States, with Greece, but we forgot that there were Bulgarians. We believed that they, our brothers, would always be there. If one takes the calendar of foreign relations activities of the Russian church for those years, unfortunately, events along the line of relations with East Europe took last place, even after Africa and Asia. It was put quite correctly here that what happened in East Europe is our moral liability, sin, and fault. Now it is necessary if not to set East Europe apart as a special priority then at least to place it at the same level in our relations that we have placed West European countries, the United States, and Japan. In this connection I wanted to mention that we, in our church activities, are planning a number of substantive actions. As is known, during his visit to our country the president of Hungary invited the Holy Patriarch to visit. There are invitations from Catholic Poland. In addition to the Holy Patriarch's visit to Hungary, we plan trips to Poland, as well as Yugoslavia and Bulgaria. We want very much to correct the imbalance that has existed in our church's policy with respect to East European countries. I would also like to note that if Russia becomes attractive to East Europe, all the problems in our relations will be resolved. What would make us attractive? Domestic political stability, and the resolution first and foremost of economic problems. We will not be attractive today by selling them cheap raw materials. Then they will say that Russians remain, as they always have been, poor politicians. We must maintain a dignified position in both the economic and political spheres. S.B. Stankevich: What is Central, East, and Southeast Europe for Russia now? So far there is no sound and consistent vision or systematically formulated answer to this question. The "Brezhnev Doctrine," which was mentioned here, is a thing of the past; what do we have to replace it? Apparently not the "Monroe Doctrine," as the press has been writing and the corresponding suspicions voiced, including by the Western press. Apparently, something else. And perhaps, in continuation of the philological research proposed here by Metropolitan Kirill, we should resurrect such a term--not at all bad--as "vital interests." Truly, this is a sphere of vital interests of Russia; there is no better word for it, and hardly anyone will argue with this, because we are linked with this region by a thousand economic, spiritual, and cultural threads; the well-being of Russia or lack thereof depends if not 100 percent then to a considerable extent on what will happen here, and it is indeed a sphere of our vital interests. The fact that we postulate our vital interests in connection with East Europe does not give us any special rights in this region. It means only one thing: In allocating our attention, cadres, resources, and efforts, including diplomatic ones, it is substantially more important than the esteemed and respected but far more removed countries. Although all of us here seem to agree that this is a priority for us, this priority for us must be expressed in a quite obvious and visible way. For instance, key issues--diplomatic cadres, resources, including those supporting the activities of diplomatic representations; time spent on it; the frequency and level of visits in both directions; the agreement-legal base that exists in relations--these are the visible expression of this priority standing which has been, quite appropriately, noted here. We are about to close--I cannot say that we have already closed--a whole era of relations with this region. And it seems that we should close it in a dignified and significant manner. There is a dearth of program statements in this respect, essentially of doctrinal nature. Some sort of statement closing the entire era in relations with East Europe apparently is needed, in which we would summarize the past and define Russia's position as it enters a new era in relations. Russia's responsibility for what was happening to East European countries during this nearly past era has already been mentioned here. But there are quite persistent attempts to turn this responsibility into a political and legal one. This we can hardly accept and agree with. It was not democratic Russia that invaded the Baltics in 1939, or sent troops into Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968. In my opinion, it would be completely incorrect to mechanically transfer the liability for what happened in the preceding era onto the current, democratic Russia. Yes, without any doubt in a moral sense we still have certain feelings and obligations. All this, however, should not grow into a complex of national and historic fault, which multiplies in daily politics. For this, by the way, we need to close certain pages of history, specific episodes. The problem of historical episodes, concrete memorials, burial grounds, and cultural legacy is very important; it has considerable repercussions, is played out constantly in politics, and influences it. Therefore any incidents involving violation of military memorials or some or other artifacts of material and spiritual culture in some ways related to Russia--in such instances, I think, Russia's reaction should be sufficiently sensitive and diplomatic, but there must be a reaction, there cannot be none, for we are rapidly losing the status of a great power to be reckoned with. As to various geopolitical combinations that are currently emerging, we can probably agree with the contention that it is not associations or blocs per se that are bad--it is, of course, their content. Regarding the question of integration. I do not think that the word "integration" should scare us that much. It is another matter that integration into the civilized world sounds absolutely absurd and unacceptable. But integration, if we understand by it entry into a certain system of existing international relations--yes. Not integration with Germany, not integration with France, but integration into a certain system of interrelations. For this, however, Russia must become itself, become a state; clearly and firmly define its new role, its place, its interests; formulate them, because only such qualitative definitiveness can be integrated into something without dissolving in it. And Russia itself must decide with whom and to what extent, on what terms and in what forms it will integrate, meaning integration into the system of existing interrelations. Then in principle we can agree with the term itself; I do not think it should sound so threatening. Now regarding NATO. Over the past few years, in trying to adapt NATO to currently existing realities in Europe and in the world, the NATO leadership has of course done a lot in the direction of changing the nature of this bloc, but its qualitative definition so far remains the same, despite recently adopted documents. It remains a military-political bloc, with the emphasis on the first part--military; it was formed and continues to exist on the premise that there exists a certain threat from the east, more or less real in some or other eras, but it exists, this constant threat from the east, for the sake of which this bloc must exist and function. There are thousands of different-level documents, not necessarily doctrinal ones, and various sorts of instructions, up to military regulations, that reflect the existence of this threat and in accordance to which NATO structures conduct their life, which have not been revised. And in this connection, since it is a dynamic process, it is important who is ahead. We can probably formulate this principle--that the restructuring of NATO's internal structure, the change in the internal content of NATO, should proceed ahead of the process of its geographic expansion. Most likely Russia will be unable to stop any East European state from joining NATO if it seriously wants to. The "Brezhnev Doctrine" should be left behind, but if anyone is interested in Russia's opinion, our position in this respect should be quite clear: We do not encourage this process; we do not wish to accelerate it; we urge caution and prudence in any change of balance. And it probably makes sense to insist that internal restructuring of NATO should precede the process of geographic expansion of this bloc. Another point of substance in the discussion is our economic relations with East European countries. Yes, indeed, we need to restore what was destroyed by ignorance. But it hardly makes sense to limit ourselves to simple restoration of these technological chains that have been broken, now that workers are being laid off at factories that used to work for Russia. It probably makes sense to look a little beyond that. Principally new conditions have already come into play; the free market is not in place yet, but market relations have emerged in all East European countries, including Russia, and we need to make use of these relations. It would be quite logical to bring up the question that Russia can stimulate the movement of capital and goods to both near abroad countries and the states of East, Southeast, and Central Europe. On cooperation between political forces. The paradox is that it is the left-wing and postcommunist forces that are pro-Russian in East European countries, while the greatest anti-Russian attitudes are most often noted among the democratic forces, which maintain that Russia should be left in the past altogether, since it brought them only grief and misfortune, and that they need to unilaterally orientate themselves toward the West. This sort of anti-Russian prejudice, common among democratic forces in East European countries, is to a large extent the fault of Russian democratic forces, which are not establishing direct contacts with them, not conducting intensive enough interparty exchanges with these countries, preferring to visit other places. Hence the complex of not understanding the new Russia, once again by inertia perceiving it as an imperial threat. Therefore, it is quite important to break this situation, to establish normal contacts with parties and organizations of democratic spectrum in East Europe, and this task may be encouraged and supported by the MFA. A.M. Vasilyev: I would like to try to build a hierarchy of priorities and compare the significance of the East European region to other regions that are closer to me--the southern regions. I would build this kind of structure: In the first place, of course, are the near abroad countries; in the second--the West as a whole, including the United States; I would not put East Europe even in third place--I think more likely it should be China and the Far East; when we come to the fourth and fifth place--here we may have a certain competition: After all, East Europe is already separated from us by hundreds of kilometers of borders of several independent states. At the same time, right next to us there are states--I mean the Transcaucasus and Central Asia--which are practically turning into the Near East, and their problems are overlapping our borders. Russia's relations with these southern regions may compete with East Europe in importance and significance for Russia. And not only that. The Near East is inside us if we take into account that Russia is home to 8-9 million Muslims with their political, social, and other value orientations that are the same as the "Third World." These regions to a certain extent are also linked to our relations with East Europe. Russia exports oil and gas, but in practical terms an increasingly greater part of that oil and gas is what we will be buying there, in the East, reselling ours to the West. That is, we are playing the role of a transit territory. And it is impossible to define our relations with one region without taking the other into account. Russia's destiny is not to oppose the West, not to march against it, not be in confrontation with it; but we cannot become an integral part of the West even if we wanted to, because we are different, and Russia's historic destiny is different. In this connection I, as a person whose field is the "Third World," believe categorically that identification of our policy with the policy of the West could hurt Russia's interests in the "Third World." Concluding my brief interference into the discussion of specialists on Europe, I would like to emphasize that we should not separate our relations with East Europe from the problems we face on our southern borders because of the special position of Russia--a gigantic country spanning two continents. Separating one from the other may lead to certain mistakes and miscalculations in Russian policy. V.K. Volkov: I believe that in our discussion of the problems of East Europe and Russian policy there exists a general acute conceptual deficiency not on a regional but on a global level. Before we speak of a region, we should first look at the future, look not only at the way we and the world are today, but also imagine what the world will be in three to five years. We will not be able to peer too far into the future, but we could perhaps look at a span of 15 years. Perhaps then we will have a clearer idea regarding East Europe. I think that today's world creates confusion in many heads. The bipolar arrangement has disappeared, but will the currently prevalent unipolar one survive? Unlikely. International relations are a self-regulating system, and it does not tolerate unipolar situations. One way or another it will begin to differentiate. And I will permit myself to suggest that in the near future we will witness a new disposition of international forces or, in short, several years from now the world will be very different from what it is today. And then we will indeed be able to define the place of East Europe in the system of priorities of Russia's policy. In Russian history, the Central European direction--to be specific, Poland and Czechoslovakia, as well as the Balkans--has always been at the center of our diplomacy. Therefore, if we now look at this all in a new way, distancing ourselves somewhat from history and emotions, we will simply see that the role of Russia and its policy in East Europe is a litmus test that shows the real place of the Russian Federation in the world arena. I think we need to see our potential strong points, bases in East Europe. Among the countries here that already now clearly lean toward political cooperation with Russia one can name the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Yugoslavia, and Greece. This is not only a legacy of the former socialist camp, but also restoration of certain traditional contacts. As to our economic ties, they do indeed have their specificity. But at the same time we should not lose sight of the fact that the former Soviet Union has managed to build economic relations with East European countries in such a way that it has become an agrarian and raw material appendix to its own "satellites." I completely agree with those who advocated here an active policy with respect to East European countries. This activism may be of very different varieties, but we probably should indeed push aside all fears and not be afraid to say loudly that we have interests in East Europe. I believe that the conduct of an active Russian policy should begin with deciding where there are grounds for it. I do not see a problem more important for Russia than halting economic sanctions with respect to Yugoslavia. They have turned into a complete absurdity.
