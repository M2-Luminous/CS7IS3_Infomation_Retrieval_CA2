The willingness of Pak Harto [President Suharto] to extend the term as NAM chairman applies only if NAM countries face difficulties in finding a new leader, Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said, as reported from New Delhi yesterday by BISNIS correspondent Tarman Azzam. Accompanied by Minister of State and State Secretary Murdiono, Ali Alatas reported the results of a meeting between President Suharto and Indian Prime Minister Narasimha Rao in New Delhi Monday night [28 March]. In his meeting with Rao, President Suharto explained Indonesia's view, namely that NAM chairmanship succession should be conducted in an orderly way so that more members will hold the position for leading the developing nations. The Indian prime minister was told of the NAM chairman's views on the importance of the World Population Conference in Cairo, Egypt, from 1 to 4 June, when it is hoped that a decision will be made on NAM leadership. The meeting in Cairo will be preceded by a meeting of NAM foreign ministers on 30-31 May, Ali Alatas said. Murdiono said that Indonesia's term of office as NAM chairman will end in 1995. Indonesia's willingness to extend the term is only to permit the next candidate for the NAM chairmanship to prepare itself in the best possible way. The subject of extending Indonesia's term of office as NAM chairman surfaced because several member countries asked Indonesia to hold the office for another term. According to Murdiono, Indonesia's basic position is that it is not good for a person to be NAM chairman for two successive terms. In this case, Pak Harto wants the NAM fully to uphold the basic principles of the NAM organization.
