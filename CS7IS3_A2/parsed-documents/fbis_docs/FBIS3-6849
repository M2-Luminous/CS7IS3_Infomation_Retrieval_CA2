The call has come from the Cook Islands high commissioner to Australia, Vincent Ingram, who has warned the allegations could severly affect the country. Mr. Ingram has returned to Rarotonga to advise Sir Geoffrey on the issue. He said he has told the prime minister to take a more interventionist approach to the matter. The allegations were made earlier this week by the New Zealand parliamentarian, Winston Peters. Mr. Peters told the New Zealand parliament that Cook Islands Government was operating financial scams worth millions of dollars. He tabled documents he said supported his claims. Reports from Rarotonga say that today, Sir Geoffrey has said he will not look at the documents and he has denied any wrongdoing.
