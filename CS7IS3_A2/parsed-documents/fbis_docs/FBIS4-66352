A large electric power construction army numbering tens of thousands in Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Xinjiang now has the attitude of a decisive battle and is fighting in the barren and dangerous valleys in the upper reaches of the Huang He, the "Black Belt" of Guanzhong [central Shaanxi plain], and other construction sites as an unceasing high tide of construction appears in each project. At the large Lijia Gorge hydropower station, where they plan to install the four biggest Chinese-made generators with unit capacities of 400MW, after impounding the river and completing excavation of the foundation for the key facility and making progress with other important construction tasks, they entered the key construction phase for pouring the concrete for the 165-meter-tall dam and main plant buildings between April and July 1993. This 3,110MW power generation facility now under construction will go into operation and begin generating power at the end of 1993. At the end of 1992, northwest China's installed generating capacity was 14,417MW and its annual power output was 60.093 billion kWh, with hydropower accounting for nearly one-half of this amount. Development of its hydropower resources is northwest China's first step in electric power construction. While developing Ankang, Shiquan, Bikou, and other hydropower stations on the Han Jiang and Bailong Jiang, Shaanxi and Gansu have also joined with Qinghai and Ningxia to concentrate their superior forces in the main attack on one of China's biggest hydropower "motherlodes" on the upper reaches of the Huang He by completing five cascade hydropower stations represented by the two big hydropower stations at Longyang Gorge and Liujia Gorge and including Yanguo Gorge, Bapan Gorge, Qingtong Gorge with a total installed generating capacity of 3,268MW. Statistics show that between the time the first generator began generating electricity in 1961 and the end of September 1993, these five hydropower stations generated a total of 21.13 million kWh. The five large reservoirs associated with these power stations also irrigate more than 16 million mu of farmland along both banks of the river. Moreover, they have used their excellent regulation properties to basically resolve flooding, freezing, and other disasters along the banks of the middle and upper reaches of the Huang He, which has significantly improved the ecology and environment of the northwest China plateau. The area around the reservoirs, where not a blade of grass had grown for a long time, is now shaded by green trees. According to the newest development program by the Northwest China Electric Power Industry Management Bureau and Northwest China Hydropower Survey and Design Academy that was revised in 1993, besides the six power stations already built or now under construction on the upper reaches of the Huang He, they have also decided to build seven large cascade hydropower stations at Gongbai Gorge, Laxiwa, and other locations and 12 medium-sized cascade hydropower stations at Da Gorge and other locations which can increase the total installed generating capacity to 15,740MW with annual power output of 57 billion kWh. Evidently, the timetable for the 19 new cascade hydropower stations to be built on the upper reaches of the Huang He has now been arranged and it is expected that they can all be developed by the early part of the next century. Embodying the new idea of "changing from transporting coal to transmitting electricity," thermal power construction has accelerated the pace of construction of the new Pucheng power plant and other new construction and expansion projects in addition to speeding up preparatory work for construction of Baoji No. 2 power plant, Hancheng No. 2 power plant, and Shenmu, Huangling, and other large pit-mouth power plants. According to information provided by officials in the Northwest China Electric Power Industry Management Bureau, after these electric power projects are gradually implemented, annual power output in the northwest China region will reach 69 billion kWh in 1995. At that time, besides satisfying the needs of industrial and agricultural production and the masses' lives in these five provinces and autonomous regions, these abundant power sources will also transmit power to east China, central China, southwest China, and other regions.
