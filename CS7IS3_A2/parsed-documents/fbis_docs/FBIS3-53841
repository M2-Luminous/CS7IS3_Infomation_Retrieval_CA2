[passage omitted] A senior aide to PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat, who was in Cairo on Thursday, warned the peace process could run out of steam if there was no breakthrough within weeks. "I believe we have a few weeks in front of us and if these problems are not resolved in weeks I think the whole Declaration of Principles and the process will be in danger," Yasir 'Abdrabbuh told reporters in the capital. "I don't think they have the luxury of time in order to wait for months. They need a quick solution as we do," he said, referring to Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres who said Wednesday that his country could afford to wait. The chief PLO negotiator, Nabil Sha'th, said the Taba meetings had produced "some opening." Although a security deal is proving elusive, he has reported progress on the hand-over of civilian powers to the Palestinians. [passage omitted]
