In Halhul, residents rioted in protest over the 16 February killing of a local resident by soldiers. The man, a student by the name of Marwan Sa'ada, was 19 years old. Two Halhul residents sustained slight injuries yesterday. Army sources said the locals threw stones at soldiers, who opened fire in response. One of the injured is 19-year-old 'Abid Muhammad Sa'id. Palestinian sources said the second casualty, Ayub Milhim, was shot in the head by settlers traveling in a car that came under a barrage of stones. The two wounded men were transferred to the 'Aliya and al-Wahali Hospitals in Hebron. Four locals were wounded -- two in Rafah and two in the Jabalyah refugee camp -- in clashes with soldiers in the Gaza Strip yesterday. Two soldiers were slightly injured by stones in Gaza. They received medical treatment on the spot and were sent back to their units. A resident of the al-Mughazi refugee camp in the central Strip was murdered yesterday because he was suspected of collaboration. The man, 'Abdallah Abad, was abducted from his home by Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] activists. His wife was seriously wounded. Military sources have stated that a rise has been noted in incidents in the territories inspired by Hamas and the Islamic Jihad. The security forces are still in pursuit of the terrorist squad that murdered Shin Bet squad operator No'am Kohen near Ramallah. Yesterday, the terrorists who murdered No'am Kohen this week called on Palestinian collaborators to turn on those who recruited them and promised protection and pardon to anyone who murders his operator. Declaring a war on the Shin Bet, the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam squad pledged to put an end to the phenomenon of Palestinian collaboration with Israel. "We will regard every collaborator who kills his operator and brings us his weapon and identity card as a convert," said a leaflet disseminated by a group calling itself the "al-Qassam Psychological Warfare Department." Squad members said they will arm the converted collaborators and find them asylum. An approximately 50-year-old resident of Bethlehem was found battered and tied up in a cave in Jerusalem yesterday. A preliminary investigation revealed that the man had been kidnapped from his home by three masked men who accused him of collaboration with Israel. [passage omitted]
