Our correspondent Eldad Beck reports from Paris: Both the Israeli and the Palestinian delegations realized last night that the fundamental discrepancies between their stands on the main unresolved problem -- import regime and customs -- are unbridgeable. The sides failed to reach compromise despite the vigilant participation in the discussions of the two chief delegates, who are again meeting tete-a-tete at this very moment. We have learned from the Israeli delegation that the negotiating teams are treading water and that the positive atmosphere, which prevailed past week, has changed noticeably. In view of the difficulties, and since both sides realize they will be unable to reach an agreement this week, the current round of talks is expected to end tomorrow as planned. The issue of the import regime and customs got stuck over the question of whether the sides should reach a basic agreement on this matter, working out the details on the basis of this, or whether they should start immediately discussing the list of products to which import regulations and customs rates will apply. The Palestinians are insisting on deciding on their own customs for numerous items of equipment for the industrial and agricultural development of the territories. [passage omitted]
