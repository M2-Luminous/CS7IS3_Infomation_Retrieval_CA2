On the list are Sukhoi Su-30K and MiG-31 fighters, air defense missile systems, and so on. Russia-mainland China military cooperation has attracted great attention. In the face of great concern, Russia's General Staff Headquarters, Ministry for Foreign Economic Relations, and other departments concerned broke the silence by proposing plans and guidelines for arms sales at a congressional hearing on China issues. Antonchev [an dong xue ke fu 1344 2639 7185 0668 1133), representative from the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, said: "According to the latest statistics, Russia owes $1.5 billion to mainland China, of which $1 billion is loans and $500 million results from the change in the form of clearing foreign exchange. The Russian Government offered to 'pay off the debts with weapons.' Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin will discuss the matter with the mainland hierarchy during his visit to Beijing in late May." As disclosed by the Russian General Staff Headquarters, following Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev's visit to the mainland in October last year, the two countries signed an agreement on long- term military cooperation. It is certain that over the next two years, the two countries will have frequent exchange visits by military delegations and intensify their cooperation in military and high-tech fields. The Russian General Staff Headquarters also said that after selling 26 Sukhoi Su-27 fighters to mainland China last year, the Russian military has recently sent a list of 44 advanced weapons to mainland China for its reference in purchasing weapons, adding that among the main items on the list are five kinds of new fighters: The Sukhoi Su-27 and Su-30K, the MiG-29 and MiG-31, and the TY-22M3 [preceding term published in Roman letters and Arabic numbers]; and the "Arrow"-10M [preceding three-character term published in Roman letter and Arabic numbers] and "Needle" air defense missile systems. However, the General Staff Headquarters stressed that the weapons sold to the mainland are mainly defensive. Strategic weapons such as rockets and nuclear weapons are not on the arms sales list, they added.
