On this and other information, Reporter Susan Soils talks to us from the Chiapas capital. [Begin Solis recording] Although a reply is expected today on the possible release of the 32 people arrested during the armed conflict, the Human Rights Commission and the Commission for the Federal Amnesty Process continue investigating the cases. Meanwhile, Jose Naro Robles, technical secretary of the Commission for Federal Amnesty Process, announced a reply will be issued on their release soon; no date was given however. The Indian State Council will also request the release of 2,800 inmates, detained in various Chiapas jails, among them 191 Indians, accused of common crimes, although these have no links to the armed conflict. Meanwhile, the State Congress decided to audit 16 municipalities in Chiapas. They acknowledge that six municipalities currently have problems with municipal headquarters take-over and sit-down strikes. The municipalities in conflict are Huehuetan, Tuzantlan, Pueblo Nuevo, [name indistinct], Copainala, (?Yopisca), and Mapastepec. The problems have been resolved in Cacahuatan, while a sit-down strike continues at the Civic Plaza of Tuxtla Gutierrez. After state police dispersed members of the Citizens Civic Front in Mapastepec, who were maintaining blockades on the coastal road headling to the Guatemalan border, the protesters burned the municipal palace in Mapastepec. The protesters are demanding the current municipal council, appointed a few days ago by the State Congress after Mayor Lucho (?Puon) Aguilar was discharged, be dismissed. At 1430, state police dislodged the demonstrators, who were maintaining blockades on the Chiapas coastal road, with tear gas. Virgilio Sanchez Roa, leader of the Party of the Democratic Revolution in Mapastepec, reported that a person who was attempting to flee was run over by a trailer, which then also tried to flee. At 1800, some members of the Civic Front moved to the municipal palace, which had been occupied for several days, and set fire to the building, thereby destroying all the furniture, equipment, and archives. In Matastepec, the situations remains tense and uncertain, given events that are taking place. Up to now, five people have been arrested as part of the operation to clear the road. The demonstrators oppose the appointment of Luz Maria Cruz Ibarra as president of the Municipal Council. Cruz Ibarra assumed the post, replacing Lucho Puon Aguilar. [end recording]
