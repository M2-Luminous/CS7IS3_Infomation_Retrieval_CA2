At the headquarters of the employers' federation in Rome's exhibition center area Chairman Luigi Abete was presiding over a meeting of the Council, Confindustria's parliament. Berlusconi should have been there, too, being a member. But Forza Italia's leader was busy with his election campaign. Almost deliberately, he happened to be just a few kilometers away, on a visit to another professional organization, Confartigianato [General Confederation of Italian Artisans and Craftsmen], which is often in dispute with big industry. On via dell' Astronomia industrialists discussed the delicate political situation and the prospects of economic recovery. On via San Giovanni in Laterano Berlusconi snubbed them, and attacked them. "I do not often visit Confindustria," he told artisans, whose vote he is seeking. "I am a member of the Council, but I do not go there gladly because I do not like to sit down with people I do not like. They breathe a rarefied air there, not that of the trenches, of work. Furthermore, I have always had the impression that the people sent to work for Confindustria are the ones better not left to work in the factories. Those fine people often have other things to do...." After the Council meeting finished Abete gave a press conference. Reports of Berlusconi's remarks had not yet arrived. Asked to make a statement about Fininvest's legal troubles, the chairman replied diplomatically: "We must ask magistrates to abide by the rules and we must have confidence in the quality of their conduct. Citizens' rights must be protected in a modern society that does not want to be medieval and that wants to have confidence in justice." Abete also sought a complex equilibrium in connection with political issues: Confindustria is not siding with any of the alignments, and is indeed "disappointed" with an election campaign that everyone is conducting by dint of slogans, completely ignoring matters of policy. If no clear majority emerges from the elections, better a transitional government that will complete the electoral law than the labored continuation of the legislature. The press conference was over. But a few minutes later the news agencies reported the remarks just made by Forza Italia's leader. Abete was surprised and resentful: Berlusconi's statements seemed offensive to Confindustria and are doubly serious coming from a member. The chairman paused for a moment to prepare a reply -- angry but detached. It took only a few lines: "Confindustria states that it does not intend to allow itself to be manipulated in the conduct of a party election campaign, nor to allow itself to become involved in a coarse political rivalry. Just as in the recent past it has ignored provocations from other party representatives, so Confindustria does not intend to respond to this latest one, either." Chairman of the young industrialists, Aldo Fumagalli, took issue directly with Berlusconi, however: "Let Berlusconi remember that Confindustria is a voluntary organization comprised of 110,000 enterprises, which evidently think differently from him. If Berlusconi had attended the Council's proceedings more assiduously, his assessment would now probably be more balanced." Former Confindustria Chairman Ernesto Gismondi, a candidate for the progressive forces in Milan, reminded the Forza Italia leader and Fininvest boss provocatively of "the enormous benefit that his group, with its huge debts, was able to enjoy from the reduction in the cost of money, which was the result of one of the many battles waged by Confindustria." There has never been much fellowship between Berlusconi and the employers' federation. At the beginning of his career Berlusconi felt snubbed by the major potentates of Italian capitalism. He probably now wants to take his revenge and to exploit this front too. Furthermore, Berlusconi's chief enemy is one of Confindustria's top men -- Carlo de Benedetti, president of Olivetti and owner of the L'ESPRESSO-LA REPUBBLICA publishing group. He is almost certainly one of the "people I do not like" cited by Forza Italia's leader in his attack on Confindustria. Last, there is certainly no love lost between Berlusconi and the present Confindustria chairman. Abete is a committed supporter of an active role for the organization, has little sympathy for uncommitted associates, and is certainly not among Forza Italia's supporters. Furthermore, Berlusconi does not know what to do about Confindustria's position on the elections: The organization has not expressed a preference for any of the alignments, nor can it do so, in view of the fact that within it there are such opposing viewpoints as those of Berlusconi and de Benedetti, for instance. Berlusconi's aim with yesterday's rupture -- which has been in the air for some time -- is probably to gain more support from small entrepreneurs, professionals, and the self-employed, which groups have always been critical of the predominant role played by Confindustria.
