According to the publication, the religious leaders were threatened because they favor the disarmament of the group of former rebels organized in the 3-80 Northern Front, which surrendered its weapons and returned to civilian society. The bishop of Esteli, a city located more than 100 km north of Managua, said the armed groups "have been telling the peasants they are going to kill us because we helped El Chacal (Jose Angel Talavera, who was the leader of the 3-80 Northern Front) to demobilize." The armed groups are being pursued by Army and police troops following an order by Nicaraguan President Violeta Chamorro to eradicate the armed gangs that have committed murders, robberies, and kidnappings. Esteli Bishop Mata received death threats last year from the pro-Sandinist Peasant-Worker Revolutionary Front (FROC).
