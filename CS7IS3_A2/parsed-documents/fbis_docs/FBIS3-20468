To commemorate the event, this article examines some of the issues relating to the northeast volunteer army in Xinjiang. 1. Entry Of Northeast Volunteer Army Into Xinjiang: How It Happened After the 18 September incident, the Nanjing government adopted a "zero resistance" policy and ordered Chinese troops in the northeast to retreat to behind Shanhaiguan. It was not long before our beloved motherland between Bai Shan and Heilongjiang fell into the hands of Japanese imperialism. Disregarding Chiang Kai-shek's [Jiang Jieshi] strict order and unafraid of sacrifice, the masses in the northeast and some patriotic officers and men in the northeast volunteer army were determined to resist the aggression of Japanese bandits. At one point volunteer forces across the land numbered in the hundreds of thousands, even as many as one million, hitting the Japanese imperialists hard. However, the anti-Japanese units each fought on their own and received no tangible aid from the Nanjing government. By the winter of 1992, therefore, some had been annihilated by the enemy. Others, reeling from heavy losses and short on arms and food, found themselves in dire straits. Subsequently, a small number of volunteers joined the allied forces fighting Japan under the leadership of the CPC and firmly continued the war of resistance in the northeast under the most difficult conditions. Some volunteers overcame the enemy's successive lines of blockade and made their way to the Great Wall where they continued to defy the Japanese. Volunteer forces under Su Bingwen [5685 3521 2429] (a former Hulun Buir garrison commander and a former Hai-man railway protection commander who subsequently became commander-in-chief of the northeast people's save-the-nation army) and Ma Zhanshan [7456 0594 1472] (formerly Heilongjiang garrison commander, later acting chairman of Heilongjiang Province and concurrently deputy commander of northeast frontier forces stationed in Heilongjiang), which were the backbone of the volunteer army, ran out of ammunition and food supplies and retreated into Soviet territory on 4 December 1932. (Footnote 1: There have always been conflicting claims that Su Bingwen and others retreated into the Soviet Union on 3, 4, 5, or 7 December 1932. A telegram sent by Zheng Runcheng [6774 3387 1004] and Su Guo [5685 0948] to Chairman Lin Sen [2651 2773], Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek, and Deputy Commander-in-Chief Zhang Xueliang [1728 1331 5328] of the Nanjing government on 9 April 1933 read, "Having finally run out of ammunition and with no aid in sight, we retreated into Soviet territory in the evening on 4 December in Year 21, enduring humiliation in order to survive." We can conclude that "4" was the right date. The telegram is now stored in the archives of the autonomous region.) The units under Li Du [2621 2629] (formerly Yilan garrison commander and subsequently Jilin self-defense army commander in chief) retreated into Soviet territory near Hulin in January 1933. After retreating into Soviet territory, the northeast volunteer army immediately turned over its weapons and equipment to the Soviet authorities in accordance with international practice. Following negotiations between the Nanjing government and the Soviet Union, the latter agreed to let the northeast volunteer army cross Siberia and enter Chinese territory at the Tacheng border checkpoint. It would then be handed over to the Xinjiang government. After working out this deal with the Soviet authorities, the Nanjing government immediately sent a telegram to the Xinjiang provincial government ordering it to prepare to take over the volunteer forces. Jin Shuren [6855 2885 0088], then chairman of Xinjiang provincial government and superintendent of border defense, appointed Lu Xiaozu [7627 2400 4371], a former secretary general of the provincial government, as Tacheng administrative director and named two attaches, Sun Guohua [1327 0948 5478] (an assistant director at the meteorological observatory) and Han Xun [7281 8113], a former county chief. On 3 January 1933 they were despatched to Tacheng to take charge of the hand-over of the northeast volunteer army. The Nanjing government also ordered Guang Lu [1639 4389], its consul in Zaisang in the Soviet Union, to take part in this operation by facilitating contacts with the Soviet authorities. Concerned that the northeast volunteer army would be hard to control, Jin Shuren only took over the rank-and-file officers and men while keeping senior officers out of Xinjiang. As a result, high-ranking officers like Su Bingwen, Ma Zhanshan, and Wu Delin [0702 1795 2651] (commander of the 2d Infantry Regiment under Su Bingwen) had no choice but to leave their forces and return to China by boat via Europe. Instead, Zheng Runcheng, commander of the 9th Brigade of the 2d Infantry Regiment, became acting regimental commander and led the forces into Xinjiang along with Su Guo, chief of staff of the 2d Infantry Regiment. On 14 February 1933, the northeast volunteer army left its camp at Tuomusike [phonetic] and boarded a train on the Trans-Siberian Railway. It got off at the Ayagusi [phonetic] station and headed for Tacheng on foot. In the evening on 25 February, the first batch of northeast volunteers entered Tacheng under the command of Zhao Zhuxun [6392 2885 8113] to the warm welcome of the local people of all nationalities. They were followed by a steady stream of other volunteers entering Xinjiang through the Tacheng checkpoint. They stayed at Tacheng briefly for rest and reorganization before moving in groups onto Urumqi and other sites where troops were stationed. The first batch led by Zheng Runcheng arrived in Urumqi on 27 March. (Footnote 2: According to the telegram sent by Lu Xiaozu, Tacheng administrative director, to Jin Shuren on 26 February 1933, "The first batch of 500 men arrived at Tacheng in the evening on 25th." Most of the more recent accounts suggest that the first batch of northeast volunteers entered Xinjiang in the latter half of March 1933, a discrepancy probably caused by confusing the time they arrived in Urumqi with the time they entered Xinjiang.) Reception points had been set up along the way between Tacheng and Urumqi to provide lodging and food for the volunteers. Some locals even prepared sumptuous meals for the soldiers on their own initiative. People of all nationalities welcomed the volunteers most warmly. Many shops put up posters offering special treatments for them. Both officers and men were deeply moved. How many northeast volunteers entered Xinjiang from the Soviet Union? Widely divergent figures were given by a host of historical accounts. Most put the number at more than 30,000, a report submitted on 17 August 1945 to Wu Zhongxin [0702 1813 0207], then chairman of the provincial government, by the social department of Xinjiang Province said, "Anti-Japanese northeast volunteer forces retreated into Xinjiang on order from the central government in Years 22 and 23 of the Republic. A count conducted at the time yielded more than 20,000 people, including officers, men, and their families." On 4 December 1945, a telegram from the finance department of Xinjiang provincial government to the Executive Yuan of the KMT regime read, "Anti-Japanese northeast forces entered Xinjiang between Year 22 and Year 23 of the Republic after taking a roundabout route on order from the central government. At the time we counted over 20,000 officers, men, and their families." While these two documents were less than detailed, they were reliable since they were based on some kind of "count." Documents currently in the archives of the autonomous region give the sizes of the five batches of northeast volunteers in the regiment under Zheng Runcheng's command who entered Xinjiang as follows: 500, 476, 532, 449, and 457, for a total of 2,414. These numbers should be quite accurate. Unfortunately, we have no way of determining how many people were in the other units of the northeast army which also entered Xinjiang. But one thing is sure, namely that suggestions that 30,000 and 40,000 northeast volunteers entered Xinjiang are less than reliable. As the anti-Japanese northeast volunteer army headed for Xinjiang by way of the Soviet Union, their plan was to return to the front to fight the Japanese. But the Nanjing government then sent a telegram to the Xinjiang provincial government ordering it to "settle the northeast volunteers where they are." Because the telegram was not made public for a long time, the volunteers at the time and even a number of researchers after the revolution thought that Sheng Shicai [4141 0013 2088] did not allow them to enter Shanhaiguan, a perception that was not in line with historical facts. The route mapped out by the Nanjing government for the re-entry into China of the volunteer army indicated that the Nanjing government never wanted the volunteers to return to the front of the war of resistance against Japan. For the northeast volunteers who had retreated to the Soviet Union, the shortest and most convenient way to return to the interior would be to go by ship from Vladivostok, which was how the one thousand plus injured volunteers and their families who had retreated into the Soviet Union with Su Bingwen found their way back to China. To cross Siberia and come home by boat via Europe covered a vast distance and was time-consuming, but at least the land and shipping routes were clear. In comparison, the most inconvenient route was to re-enter China through Xinjiang. Tacheng and Gansu are separated by the Gobi Desert stretching thousands of li. Crossing the sparsely populated desert on foot posed enormous difficulties. The Nanjing government picked this route precisely because it wanted the volunteers to settle down in Xinjiang so that they would not "make any more trouble." In July 1933 the Nanjing government despatched Wang Ziyao [3769 1311 5069], aide-de-camp to Li Du, formerly commander-in-chief of the Jilin self-defense army, to Urumqi by air and issued an order under which all northeast volunteers, officers and men, who had entered Xinjiang would be reorganized as Xinjiang units. With that the hopes of the northeast volunteers that they would return to the anti-Japanese front were completely dashed. 2. Major Activities of Northeast Volunteers in Xinjiang While they were in Xinjiang, the northeast volunteers took part in many local political and military activities, notably the following: a. Participated in fighting to defend Urumqi. The entry of the northeast volunteer army into Xinjiang coincided with the siege of Urumqi by the forces of Ma Shiming [7456 0013 2494], who was under the command of Ma Zhongying [7456 0112 5391], a Gansu warlord. The provincial forces under Jin Shuren received "absolutely no training in peacetime and are utterly useless in battle. Martial discipline have broken down and bad habits are deeply entrenched. The troops are an uneven mix, some old, some strong. They are dressed in rags, so the people of Xinjiang call them a `beggar army.'" These forces were simply incapable of putting up any resistance to the advancing Ma Zhongying forces. The fall of Urumqi appeared imminent. After the northeast volunteers entered Tacheng, Jin Shuren pasted notices all over town announcing that the Nanjing government had "sent 15,000 crack troops to Xinjiang by way of Russia equipped with big runs, tanks, and airplanes" in order to calm the people. At the same time, he sent an emergency telegram to Lu Xiaozu ordering the northeast army to rush to the province to save the day. The northeast volunteers arrived in Urumqi, reluctant to participate in the civil war. So the various leaders sent a letter to Ma Shiming tactfully asking him to agree to stop fighting. (Footnote 3: A History of the Development of the Western Regions by China, by Ceng Wenwu [258 0795 0710], p 604) Figuring that Urumqi was about to fall any minute, the Ma Shiming forces ignored the diplomatic gesture, giving the volunteer army no choice but to join the battle in defense of the city. The northeast volunteers in Zheng Runcheng's brigade were well-trained regular troops. In no time they defeated the Ma Shiming forces and forced them to raise the siege. b. Participated in Xinjiang's 12 April coup d'etat. On 12 April 1933, Chen Zhong [7115 0022], Tao Mingyue [7118 2494 2887], and Li Xiaotian [2621 4562 1131], known as the "three young Turks" of Xinjiang, staged a coup d'etat, largely relying upon the "converted army" headed by Bapinggute [1572 1627 0657 3676] and the northeast volunteer army under the command of Zheng Runcheng. In the early afternoon on 12 April, the "converted army" launched a surprise attack on the provincial government of Xinjiang. Jin Shuren fled. In the evening on the same day the provincial army unleashed an all-out counteroffensive. Outnumbered, the "converted army" was ready to evacuate Urumqi with the soldiers' families. At this critical juncture the northeast volunteers joined the fighting and instantly turned the military tide. Seeing that the situation was beyond salvage, Jin Shuren fled to Changji on 14 April and published an open telegram in Tacheng on 24 April announcing his decision to give up power. At a meeting of the provisional maintenance committee in the evening on the day of the coup, Liu Wenlong [0491 2429 7893], director of the department of education, was elected chairman of the provisional provincial government. A decision was made to abolish the supervised office system and set up a provisional military committee headed by Zheng Runcheng, one of the generals of the northeast volunteer army. Zheng Runcheng was still with the volunteer army outside the city and did not attend the meeting. When informed of this decision by someone despatched by the organizers of the meeting, Zheng Runcheng said that the northeast army was only passing through Xinjiang on its way to fight the Japanese and had no interest in involving itself in Xinjiang politics. Only after repeatedly turning down the position did he agree to be the chairman temporarily. When the provisional maintenance committee next met on 14 April, however, Bapinggute, leader of the converted army, proposed that the governor system be retained and that Sheng Shicai be the new governor. Zheng Runcheng, the only person in a position to oppose the proposal, felt that it was beyond his power to sort out the mess in Xinjiang, on the one hand, and still harbored some unrealistic dreams about Sheng Shicai, a fellow provincial (Sheng Shicai was from Liaoning), on the other. The lack of strong opposition from Zheng Runcheng enabled Sheng Shicai to successfully ascend the throne of governor. c. Helped Sheng Shicai destroy miscellaneous political enemies. In the summer of 1933, Ma Zhongying again marched into Xinjiang from Gansu with his troops. After capturing Hami and three other towns (Mulei, Jitai, and Fuyuan), he was practically knocking on the door of Fukang, barely 60 kilometers from the provincial capital of Urumqi. Sheng Shicai put himself at the head of the northeast volunteers and the converted army under the command of Zheng Runcheng and Bapinggute, respectively, and arrived at Fukang to meet the approaching enemy head on. In mid-June, fierce fighting broke out between the two armies at Zineiquan 40 kilometers to the east of Fukang. At the beginning the Ma Zhongying forces had the edge and Sheng Shicai was almost taken prisoner. Fortunately, valiant fighting by the northeast volunteers and the converted army turned the situation around. In July the same year, with Ma Zhongying closing in on Urumqi from the south, the northeast volunteers led by divisional commander Liu Wankui [0491 8001 7608] again took on the enemy. Liu Wankui was seriously wounded in the battle of Shuixigou and died. The office of the governor of Xinjiang organized a solemn memorial service for Liu Wankui and promoted him to lieutenant general in the army posthumously . To attack Urumqi jointly with Ma Zhongying, Zhang Peiyuan [1728 1014 0337], who headed the unit in Ili responsible for putting soldiers to work to develop wasteland and concurrently commander of the 8th Division of Xinjiang, sent Yang Zhengzhong [2799 2973 0022], a regimental commander, to advance to the east in the winter of 1933. He promptly captured Jinghe and Wusu and was closing in on Suilai (now Manasi). Liu Bin [0491 2430], chairman of the joint chiefs of staff at the governor's office and a general in the northeast volunteer army, led troops to take on the enemy. He wiped out Yang Zhengzhong at one fell swoop at Sandahezi, thus ending the vulnerability of the province to enemy attack from both front and rear. With the siege of Urumqi broken, the northeast army along with the converted army and other troops from the province again headed south in March 1934 in pursuit of Ma Zhongying. Meanwhile Liu Bin crossed Tianshan from Ili and directly made for the key town of Akesu in southern Xinjiang. After capturing Akesu in late March 1934, Liu Bin linked up with the main forces and continued their southerly push. By then Ma Zhongying's forces were in utter disarray and he fled to the Soviet Union on 14 July. Deputy divisional commander Ma Hushan [7456 5706 1472], who was married to Ma Zhongying's older sister, took over the remnants of his forces and retreated to Hetian where he pledged allegiance to the provincial government. Only then was Sheng Shicai able to consolidate his rule over the whole province. 3. Sheng Shicai Broke Up, Massacred Northeast Volunteers in Xinjiang In the summer of 1934, his military campaign against Ma Zhongying largely over, Sheng Shicai set up the "Xinjiang army reorganization committee" as part of the governor's office. Under the guidance of Soviet advisers, the committee proceeded to reorganize all the armed forces in the province. As a result of this exercise, the northeast volunteer army was disbanded as a separate unit, its officers and men being incorporated into newly organized military units and stationed all over the province under the watchful eye of Sheng Shicai himself. The training unit stationed in Urumqi consisted mostly of northeast volunteers who had entered Xinjiang but was headed by Wang Hongzao [3076 7703 5679], an in-law of Sheng Shicai's. Northeast volunteers also made up a majority of the officers and men in the unit in Ili responsible for wasteland development and at Ili garrison headquarters as well. Yet the officer in charge of the wasteland development unit and commander of the Ili garrison headquarters was Qiu Zongjun [6726 1350 3182], Sheng Shicai's father-in-law. A number of senior and middle-ranking officers in the northeast volunteer army who had received formal military education were stripped of military power and sent to military schools as instructors. After regaining control over Xinjiang in 1944, the KMT carried out yet another round of reorganization in the northeast volunteer army in Xinjiang, redistributing them among the 2d Cavalry Division, the 12th Cavalry Division, the 1st Division, and the 128th Division. Divisional commanders and some regimental commanders were appointed separately by KMT military authorities. Most former members of the northeast volunteer army, both officers and men, found themselves excluded. After the victory of the war of resistance against Japan, the KMT regime sent 1,500 volunteer officers and men and their families back to their native villages. Because of transportation breakdowns and poor organization, some personnel ended up wandering about destitute in places like Lanzhou and Xian, while others returned to a northeast plagued by fighting, could not find any means of livelihood there, and were forced to return to Xinjiang. Although the northeast volunteer army did much to bring about and consolidate the regime of Sheng Shicai after it entered Xinjiang, many of its officers and men were massacred brutally by him. There are varying accounts of many of the issues involved. Here we will look at some of them. In the past, a number of people have written that the northeast volunteer army "fled on the eve" of a battle with Ma Zhongying at Dabancheng and secretly corresponded with the enemy. This, it was said, left Sheng Shicai no choice but to have some northeast volunteers arrested and killed. But was this really what happened? According to trial records at the time, Sheng Shicai had Zheng Runcheng, Su Guo, Yang Yaojun [2799 5069 6874], Ying Zhanbin [2019 0594 2430], Xu Guoguang [1776 0948 0342], and Li Zhi [2621 1807] arrested in the evening on 20 November 1933. The next day Yan Lian [7346 1670] (formerly commander of the 20th Regiment of the Jilin save-the-nation army and leader of the corps of bodyguards of the provincial government at the time) was arrested, so were Gao Lingyun [7559 0407 0061], chief of staff of the 4th Brigade of the Jilin save-the-nation army, and Wang Xiaozhi [3769 1321 0037], a former commander of the 673d Regiment of the 26th Division of the Jilin self-defense army and, after coming to Xinjiang, chief of staff of the Ili unit in charge of putting soldiers to work to open up wasteland, on 9 May 1934. The charges cooked up by Sheng Shicai against them were: Plotting to overthrow the existing regime and murder the governor. According to Sheng Shicai, this was the elaborate plot they had hatched: Externally, Ma Zhongying and Zhang Peiyuan were to attack Urumqi simultaneously from two sides and, internally, the northeast army and the converted army were to join forces and stage an uprising, with the bodyguards of the governor's mansion led by Yan Lian trying to assassinate Sheng Shicai. Liu Wenlong [0491 2429 7893] was allegedly the mastermind of this plot, yet Sheng Shicai did not have him arrested, merely putting him under house arrest. (Footnote 4: See archives of the autonomous region, under Police Chapter 1-2-103) Let us now go back to the defeat at Dabancheng and try to set the record straight and pinpoint responsibility. After their arrest, leaders of the northeast volunteer army, including Zheng Runcheng, were "unanimous in their emphasis on Sheng Shicai's errors as a commander, noting that he issued the wrong orders. Not for a second did they admit that they deserted or were engaged in conspiratorial activities." (Footnote 5: "Seven Decades of Turmoil in Xinjiang," by Zhang Dajun [1728 1129 6511], p 3349) Their assertions were consistent with what Jin Guozhen [6855 0948 3791] remembered. Jin Guozhen, who took part in the fighting as deputy commander of the 1st Cavalry Regiment of the mixed brigade under Sheng Shicai's direct command, said, "The day after the assault on Dabancheng, just as we were making headway, we suddenly received an order to withdraw. Taking advantage of the opportunity, over 100 mounted troops from the forces of Ma Zhongying came in hot pursuit of us. Their frontal attack on the provincial forces sent the latter into total disarray. However, when Ma Zhongying's troops saw that the cavalry units of the province were retreating on both flanks, they assumed, wrongly, that they had fallen into an ambush and immediately fled to their base. After retreating a dozen li, Jin Guozhen ran into Sheng Shicai who there and then personally ordered the 1st Cavalry Regiment to take in the skirmishers and await order to return to Urumqi. Only a little over 100 mounted troops charged head on toward us and, wrongly believing that they had fallen into an ambush, soon withdrew in panic. For these reasons, they could not possibly have inflicted extensive losses on the provincial forces." (Only four soldiers from the 1st Cavalry Regiment were killed in this battle.) Judging from the fact that Sheng Shicai calmly and unhurriedly ordered the 1st Cavalry Regiment to take in the skirmishers and return to Urumqi, not only did Sheng Shicai realize that his forces did not suffer heavy casualties but he also calculated that Ma Zhongying was not about to launch a major offensive. In the same article of recollections, Jin Guozhen also touched upon the real reason why the battle of Dabancheng was lost. Ma Zhongying had written a confidential letter to each of the four generals of the northeast volunteer army--Zheng Runcheng, Guo Yingkui [6753 2019 1145], Ying Zhanbin [2019 0594 2430], and Yang Yaojun, but the messenger was captured by Sheng Shicai's forces. Sheng Shicai got suspicious after reading the letters and immediately ordered a withdrawal. According to Sheng Shicai's aide-de-camp, Zhao Jianfeng [6392 0494 6912], this was the gist of the letters: You are all heroes of the war of resisting the Japanese and saving the nation. To preserve your reputation, you should return to the interior and continue to fight the Japanese, instead of getting involved in local wars in Xinjiang. Since these four confidential letters were never delivered into the hands of Zheng Runcheng and other leaders of the northeast volunteer army, we have no way of determining what their attitude to them would have been. Perhaps this was a ploy by Ma Zhongying to drive a wedge between Sheng Shicai and the northeast volunteers. Perhaps this was precisely the pretext Sheng Shicai had prayed for. (Footnote 6: "The True Story of the Several Battles I Took Part In," by Jin Guozhen, in "Selected Readings in Xinjiang Literature and History," Volume 14, Xinjiang Renmin Chubanshe, 1983) What then made Sheng Shicai murder the leaders of the northeast volunteer army so brutally? To establish separatist rule in Xinjiang, Sheng Shicai must first gain control over the armed forces in the province. There were three armies in Xinjiang at the time: the provincial army, the northeast volunteer army, and the converted army. The converted army consisted mostly of veteran soldiers who had taken part in World War I and were opposed to the October Revolution. They had a wealth of combat experience but there were not too many of them, just 2,000 or so. The provincial army was large in size but corrupt, with absolutely no combat capability. Moreover, it was scattered throughout north and south Xinjiang. Then there was the northeast volunteer army. Not only did it have a formidable combat capability, but it also outnumbered the other two armies. To subjugate Xinjiang, Sheng Shicai must first control the northeast volunteer army. To control the northeast volunteer army, he must get rid of its leaders. Sheng Shicai might make use of the leaders of the northeast army but there always came a point when he had to have them killed. As soon as he entered Ili, Liu Bin, a former commander of the 5th Army of the northeast people save-the-nation army, was appointed Ili garrison headquarters commander by Sheng Shicai. After leading troops into south Xinjiang, he was named Kashi garrison headquarters commander by Sheng Shicai in June 1934. In Xinjiang, Ili and Kashi are the most important strategic points after Urumqi. In 1937 Sheng Shicai stripped Liu Bin of all his military positions and put him in charge of gold mines. Soon afterwards he accused him of "plotting a rebellion" and had him murdered along with Ha Yuliang [0761 3768 5328] (acting chief of staff at the headquarters of the Jilin self-defense army) and Niu Yuting [6873 3768 1656], (deputy commander of the regiment of officers of the 2d Brigade under the northeast people save-the-nation army). Jiang Youfen [5592 2589 5358], who succeeded Liu Bin as commander of Kashi garrison headquarters, was subsequently killed as well. When the northeast volunteer army entered Xinjiang, it included a company of military recruits made up of young students. Upon the completion of training in August 1933, the trainees were distributed among the units and were quickly promoted to positions at the brigade and battalion levels, becoming the backbone of the Xinjiang armed forces. And the prime targets of Sheng Shicai's assassination squads. Of the 97 people in the company of military trainees who actually entered Xinjiang, 44 were massacred by Sheng Shicai. (Footnote 7: From Bai Shan and Heilongjiang to the Foot of Tianshan, by Gu Menglin [6253 1125 2651], see Selected Readings in Urumqi Literature and History, Volume 5, Xinjiang Qingnian Chubanshe, 1983) Cui Rongchang [1508 2837 2490], a platoon leader in the company of recruits, held a number of positions after entering Xinjiang, including leader of the military officers' school and commander of Kashi garrison headquarters. In March 1941 he was arrested by Sheng Shicai for involvement in the "conspiratorial clique" case. By October the same year as many as 124 people had been arrested in connection with the Cui Rongchang case, most of them young military officers from the northeast volunteer army. (Footnote 8: "Statistical Table on Convicts in the Cui Rongchang Case," Xinjiang Provincial Public Security Management Department, 18 October 1941) After their arrest, some were executed in secret, while others died from a variety of cruel tortures. There were few survivors. There has never been a formal count of the number of officers and men from the northeast volunteer army killed by Sheng Shicai. Most of the figures now available are exaggerations. For instance, Zhang Fengyi [1728 7685 0308], a northeast volunteer army leader who entered Xinjiang in the latter period, said, "After the northeast volunteer army entered Xinjiang, only 5,000 men were killed in fighting with Ma Zhongying or did from diseases or old age. In contrast, over 10,000 of them were arrested and massacred by Sheng Shicai in the past decade." (Footnote 9: "The Experiences of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Army In the Decade After It Entered Xinjiang," by Zhang Fengyi, in Selected Readings in Urumqi Literature and History, Volume 23, Xinjiang Renmin Chubanshe, 1991) After Sheng Shicai was transferred to Chongqing as minister of agriculture and forestry in 1944, the chief justice of the local court in Urumqi, Liu E [0491 6948], and others made the following charge before the special tribunal sent to Xinjiang by the military commission of the KMT specifically to sort out long-standing criminal cases: "The most tragic case involved the 20,000 people and more in the northeast army... For over 10 years they were brutally murdered until they were almost completely wiped out. A mere 10 officers or so and fewer than 1,000 old and weak soldiers survived." (Footnote 10: Seven Decades of Turmoil in Xinjiang, pp 6035-6036) Let us analyze this matter. After the reorganization of 1934, Xinjiang's armed forces were reduced to 12,000 people. Of the 18 units above the regimental level, the three garrison commands of Hami, Ashan (now Aletai), and Yan Qi, the 9th Cavalry Regiment, the 7th Infantry Division, and other units were all composed either mainly or entirely of minority officers and men. The 6th Cavalry Regiment, on the other hand, resulted from the reorganization of the converted army. Only in nine units did northeast volunteers who had entered Xinjiang make up a majority. Based on these data, officers and men from the northeast volunteer army who had entered Xinjiang should make up about half or so of the reorganized Xinjiang armed forces, that is, about 6,000 people. After entering Xinjiang, many of the volunteers switched to other fields one after another. In the 1930's and 1940's, you could find a former northeast volunteer in just about every organization, institution, or enterprise in Xinjiang. Of the 97 people in the third squadron of the company of military trainees, 60 people were assigned to various military units while 37 switched to other sectors: banks, transportation, and posts and telecommunications. If over 38 percent of the people in the military training company, the cradle of the leadership of the armed forces, switched to other fields, the job-change rate among other officers and men could not have been lower. Using this percentage as a base, the number of northeast volunteers who left the forces for other occupations must have been at least 8,000. Also, of the 60 military trainees who remained in the military after the military training company was abolished, 39, or 65 percent, were massacred by Sheng Shicai. In contrast, of the 37 who switched to local work, five people, or 13.5 percent, died in the hands of Sheng Shicai. This shows that one's chances of being murdered by Sheng Shicai wee far smaller if one switched to local work than if one stayed in the military. Moreover, there were other volunteers who for a variety of reasons voluntarily left the units in the thousands in search of other means of livelihood. According to these calculations, of the northeast volunteers who entered Xinjiang, about 5,000 were killed on the battlefield or died because of illness. About 5,000 remained in the units and close to 10,000 changed jobs or branched out on their own. At most 2,000 to 3,000 were murdered by Sheng Shicai. Needless to say, these computations were not accurate, but we can say with certainty they are closer to facts that the assertions that Sheng Shicai murdered over 10,000 volunteers or that he practically wiped out 20,000 volunteers. As far as the northeast volunteers were concerned, the bottom line for Sheng Shicai was to control and make use of them, not eliminate them. Specifically, his overriding policy toward high-ranking officers was to kill them off; some he made use of for a time but in the end even these generals were murdered. In the case of middle-ranking officers, his principal policy was to divide and exploit, supplemented by murder, in order to ensure control. As for low-ranking officers and the rank-and-file, his main objective was exploitation. If all 20,000 northeast volunteers were wiped out, what else could he depend on to continue his rule in Xinjiang? The main reason Sheng Shicai was able to exploit and divide the northeast volunteer army who entered Xinjiang was the absence of a strong leadership core. The northeast army entered Xinjiang without its high-ranking leaders like Su Bingwen, Ma Zhanshan, and Li Du, in other words, its most prestigious leaders. Zheng Runcheng and others were not in a position to hold together the entire army. Zheng Runcheng was commander of the 9th Regiment of the 2d Infantry Brigade in the northeast people save-the-nation army and later served as acting brigade commander. At the time the army entered Xinjiang, he was both regiment commander and brigade commander. The northeast volunteer army which entered Xinjiang had a surfeit of military officers at the army, division, and regiment levels. (In the Jilin self-defense army and save-the-nation army, for instance, Xing Zhanqing [0438 0594 3237] was divisional commander; Yang Yaojun, zhonglu commander-in-chief; Ha Yuliang, headquarters chief of staff; Yang Bingsen [0761 3768 5328], artillery commander; and Liu Wankui [0491 8001 7608], Guo Yingkui, Ying Zhanbin, Dan Chunlin [0830 2504 7207], Li Zhi [2621 1807], Xu Guoguang [1776 0948 0342], and Yu Deyi [0060 1795 0001], brigade commanders. Why did Su Bingwen and others put Zheng Runcheng instead of somebody else in charge of the army? Mainly because the 2d Infantry Brigade used to be the northeast army's regular forces with a strong capability which still boasted two fairly intact regiments consisting of 2,500 officers and men even as it was withdrawing from the northeast. As for other generals, some did not make their way into the Soviet Union until later and therefore could not have joined the greater part of the forces as they retreated into Xinjiang, while others had become commanders without a following. (One example was Liu Bin [0491 2430], commander of the 5th Army of the northeast save-the-nation army.) Zheng Runcheng was not qualified to command the entire army in terms of experience, prestige, or ability. That he was made chairman of the provisional military committee after the 12 April coup shows that all quarters in Xinjiang had high hopes in the northeast volunteer army. But it turned out that Zheng Runcheng did not live up to the important job and was quickly stripped of his military power by Sheng Shicai. The volunteer army was ridden with factions, each having nothing to do with the others, even back when it was in the northeast. This was a major reason why it lost the war of resistance against the Japanese. Although it was nominally under the unified command of Zheng Runcheng after entering Xinjiang, in reality it was its same old factious self. For instance, Li Du put divisional commander Xing Zhanqing in charge of the Jilin self-defense army. Because the army was stationed at two places in Xinjiang, namely Ili and Urumqi, which made centralized command difficult, Xing Zhanqing (stationed at Ili) decided that Yang Yaojun should be responsible for the volunteers from Jilin now stationed at Urumqi. Needless to say, this undermined the unified command of Zheng Runcheng. Subsequently Sheng Shicai dared to have Zheng Runcheng and others arrested and murdered precisely because he perceived, correctly this particular weakness on the part of the army of volunteers and had gone to great lengths to divide and rule beforehand. After Zheng Runcheng and other leaders of the northeast volunteer army were arrested, Sheng Shicai immediately promoted a number of middle-ranking officers in the same army, thereby readily consolidating his grip on the northeast army of volunteers. Moreover, there was a host of officers, motivated by self-interests, who threw in their lot with Sheng Shicai and turned around to sell out and murder their former comrades-in-arms. This is another reason why the northeast army disintegrated. Typical of these officers were Li Pulin [2621 3302 7207] and Li Yingqi [2621 5391 1142]. An adopted son of Li Du, commander-in-chief of the Jilin self-defense army, Li Pulin was named to important jobs such as chairmanship of the secret tribunal by Sheng Shicai because of his diligence in providing the latter with inside intelligence about the northeast volunteer army. He had a hand in a majority of the several "plotting to rebel" cases fabricated by Sheng Shicai and fled with the latter to Taiwan on the eve of liberation. A former major and aide-de-camp in the northeast people save-the-nation army, Li Yingqi zealously offered to serve Sheng Shicai and was quickly promoted to such positions as section chief in the office of the aide-de-camp in the governor's office and head of the office of political instruction. After his appointment as director of the provincial public security management department in 1933, he proceeded to have many people murdered in accordance with Sheng Shicai's wishes. For instance, he took part in cooking up the Cui Rongchang case, whose primary goal was to murder young military officers in the northeast army of volunteers. He also carried out Sheng Shicai's plot to kill Chen Tanqiu [7115 3389 4428] and Mao Zemin [3029 3419 3046]. After the liberation, Li Yingqi was arrested and executed by a firing squad. 4. Some Northeast Volunteers Contributed to Economic Construction and Democratic Revolution in Xinjiang As a result of the reorganization of 1934, many officers and men from the northeast army of volunteers were demobilized and assigned to all kinds of positions. At the time such people could be found in countless organizations, enterprises, and educational and cultural institutions all over Xinjiang. Because they were fairly well-educated, many became the leaders and backbone of their units. Zhang Mingpan [1728 7686 3879], for instance, who headed the aide-de-camp's office of the northeast save-the-nation army, led demobilized officers and men in an arduous enterprise on the sands of Gobi Desert, building oil refineries and turning out kerosene, gasoline, and lubricating oil. Or take Wang Qixun [3769 7871 8113], a battalion commander in the northeast volunteer army. After leaving the military, he became chairman of the engineering commission in charge of putting up several of the most well-known buildings in Urumqi at the time. In his book, Xinjiang: The Inside Story, Xu Lingfeng [1776 7227 7685] described the west building of the governor's mansion, one of the commission's works, as the "best equipped conference hall in the rear in China" and called the "big bank" the "greatest piece of architecture" in Urumqi. In the mid-1930's, many northeast volunteers took part in building the 1,400-kilometer Ili-Urumqi Xingxing gap highway. Completed and opened to traffic in early July 1937, it became one of the key arteries of transportation in the world during the war of resistance against Japan and played a critical role in aiding the war effort. Most of the instructors at the Xinjiang military officers academy were members of the northeast volunteer army who had entered Xinjiang, while many of the political instructors were members of the CPC and CPSU. A good number of the officers and men at the CPC-led recruiting camp were graduates of the academy and went on to become the backbone of the drive to modernize the Chinese military. Whether they stayed in the military or were demobilized and assigned to the localities, many former members of the northeast volunteer army were staunchly patriotic and steadfastly progressive and participated in the democratic revolution in and peaceful liberation of Xinjiang. Zhang Fengyi [1728 7685 0308], a former middle-ranking officer in the northeast army, became actively involved in the war of resistance against Japan in the northeast after the September 18 incident. Once in Xinjiang, he held a succession of jobs, including brigade commander, regiment commander, and Kashi garrison commander. After the victory of the war of resistance against Japan, he became a lieutenant general at the northwest field headquarters. On the eve of liberation, he was the province's deputy commander of public security. (Provincial chairman Bao Erhan [0545 1422 3352] was concurrently commander of public security.) To go with the way events were unfolding, General Tao Zhiyue [7118 1492 1471], then commander in chief at provincial garrison headquarters, was preparing to stage an uprising. Yet he had few troops under his direct control. Both Ma Chengxiang [7456 0701 4382], commander of the 5th Cavalry Army, and Ye Cheng [0673 2052], commander of the 78th Division, were resolutely anti-communist and firmly opposed to rising up in rebellion. Accordingly, the five regiments with close ties to and under the control of General Zhang Fengyi (which essentially were part of the former northeast volunteer army) became the forces Tao Zhiyue and Bao Erhan relied on as they made preparations for an uprising. After the liberation, Zhang Fengyi was chief of staff for the Xinjiang military region and deputy director of the autonomous region's department of heavy industry, among other things, making fresh contributions to Xinjiang's military and economic construction. Luo Zhi [5012 1807], a native of Guangdong, went to the northeast as a child. After the September 18 incident, he joined the anti-Japanese volunteer army. In 1938 he graduated from Xinjiang College and became deeply involved in democratic revolutionary activities and was one of the top leaders of the underground organization "Combat Society." In August 1948 Luo Zhi and four three-region revolutionary leaders, including Ahemaitijiang [7093 0678 6314 2251 3068] and Yisihakebaike [0122 2448 0761 0344 0130 0344] were killed in a plane crash en route to Beijing by way of the Soviet Union to take part in a CPPCC meeting. Zhao Jianfeng served as an aide-de-camp to Sheng Shicai for a while and enjoyed the latter's confidence. Later he became increasingly progressive and did many good deeds for the people of Xinjiang, constantly on the move on behalf of the peaceful liberation of Xinjiang. After liberation, he held a string of positions, including deputy director of the office of the Xinjiang provincial people's government. After the peaceful liberation of Xinjiang in September 1949, some former northeast volunteers and officers still in the units were reassigned to the PLA while others transferred into the Xinjiang production and construction corps to defend the border and help build up Xinjiang. People of all nationalities will forever cherish the memory of former officers and men from the northeast army who contributed to the economic construction and democratic revolution of Xinjiang.
