Its failure was expected by major Algerian parties and forces, especially the FIS, whose spokesman abroad, Rabeh Kebir, says that since the dialogue has failed, a serious, deep-rooted solution must be sought. This should begin by releasing all detainees and entering serious negotiations with the FIS preparatory to handing over power to the real representative of the Algerian people. Here is Rabeh Kebir: [Kebir] The failure of the dialogue committee was expected. We were not surprised. Everybody knows the FIS won the elections, in addition to other two parties, the National Liberation Front and the Socialist Forces Party. But since that time, the putschists have refused to deal seriously with the winning parties. They tried to create a counter-front against the FIS. They did not succeed. Then they resorted to lies, because before and after the dialogue conference there were rumors that the FIS would participate. The aim was clearly to confuse the people and pressure the parties. Now that the dialogue has failed, and its failure was expected, a deep-rooted, serious solution must be sought. I believe those in power now cannot go on because the country's resources are wasted everyday. Their own interests are threatened in Algeria. They cannot do what they want. I believe that the wise ones should seek a serious solution. This begins by releasing all detainees and entering serious negotiations with the FIS preparatory to handing over power to the real representative of the Algerian people. [Badawi] Do you consider the failure of the national dialogue conference to be a victory for the FIS? [Kebir] Absolutely. Because the FIS is working in a clear way and on correct principles, it is moving from one victory to another despite the fact that it sometimes seems to fall into troubles, that it has been exposed to injustice. But, I believe this is only logical in the lives of great movements that demand deep-rooted changes. [passage omitted] [Badawi] Concerning the future, you spoke of the need for deep-rooted changes. How do you view these changes and are you prepared to share power, first on the legislative level, with the other political parties and sides in Algeria preparatory to crystallizing a future picture of the government? [Kebir] The demands of the FIS have been clear from the beginning. It was expressed in its charters and in its election campaign. It wants to build an Islamic state based on Islamic principles as stipulated in the November statement. This is not an invention. This is a demand of the early martyrs. Since this is the demand of the martyrs and mujahdin in November, this means that those who are present in the political arena... [pauses] it is supposed to be the demand of everyone. By God, we will work with those who accept this demand, the demand of establishing an Algerian state within the framework of Islamic principles. [Badawi] Otherwise? [Kebir] By God, our demands are clear. We cannot concede this principle. [Badawi] Does this mean that there is no place for the other parties that do not call for establishing an Islamic state in Algeria? [Kebir] I do not say this. The issue of the establishment of parties or our (?nonacceptance) is connected with the Algerian people. The election explained this. We certainly welcome the parties that were elected by the people. But those who lead the country, as is known in all world countries, are the party that gets the majority. The other parties may participate in power with ministerial portfolios and other things. This is logical but always within the planning of the majority party. [passage omitted]
