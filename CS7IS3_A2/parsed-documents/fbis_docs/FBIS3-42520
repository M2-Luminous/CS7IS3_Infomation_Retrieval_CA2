Curious End to Discredited Offspring of the Cold War Era"] [Text] Five years have elapsed since the day of the first Buran flight. And the last: all work on the ill-fated shuttle has ceased and one of its three copies has been delivered to Gorkiy Culture Park where in the spring of the coming year the presentation of a new space attraction should occur. This mind-boggling stunt puts an end to 20 years of efforts of several hundred enterprises of the military-industrial complex in creating an aerospace complex costing the state over 20 million rubles in the old preinflation prices. There's no doubt about it: the Buran, as the world's most expensive attraction, was guaranteed entry into the Guinness Book of Records. It appears that it is but a single step from cosmic to comical... Is such a curious end legitimate? How could it happen that the work of hundreds of thousands of highly skilled designers, engineers and workers was necessary to no one and will go only to please the unexacting tastes of latter-day multimillionaires seeking "nonterrestrial sensations?" Many responsible leaders of our rocket-space industry even today assert that the Energiya-Buran complex is a major scientific-technical achievement and the discontinuation of its further development was caused only by financial difficulties arising with the onset of the changeover to a market economy in the country. But if the Buran is so good as it has been made out to be, why was it impossible for it to replace the Soyuz ship already created in the 1960's? It is time to acknowledge that the Buran, only once flying into space in an automatic mode on 15 November 1988, is a discredited offspring of the cold war era when the Soviet government allocated the lion's share of the state budget to direct and indirect military expenditures, being guided by the principle: "We will spare no cost..." This same principle was naturally followed by the creators of our first aerospace complex supposedly with multiple reusability. By order of the Ministry of Defense they designed and constructed an orbital glider (on the Buran there is no propulsion engine, in contrast to the Shuttle -- the American orbital aircraft). But a glider, as is well known, cannot take off by itself. And then it was decided that the putting of the Buran into orbit would be delegated to the superpowerful and ultraexpensive Energiya booster, both stages of which tumble to the ground in heaps of scrap metal several minutes after the launch. The result was astounding: the cost of one flight of the multireusable shuttle was ten times greater than the expenditures on launching of the single-use Soyuz. Moreover, even prior to the Buran flight it had become clear that in the foreseeable future there would be no call for its 30- ton payload capacity. For regular communications with the Mir station and even for the construction of an orbital station of a new generation it is entirely adequate to have a ship with a load-carrying capacity not greater than 10 tons. In the history of national cosmonautics the undertaking with the Buran enters as a very important engineering blunder -- the second after the failure with the sorrowfully remembered N-1 lunar rocket, all four experimental launches of which ended with enormous explosions. It is important not to allow new miscalculations in the stage of conceptual designing of aerospace systems of the future. Unfortunately, the prerequisites for such miscalculations are already in place. The MAKS project was developed at the very same NPO Molniya where the Buran was constructed: it is proposed that this sort of "Little Buran" orbital aircraft, three times smaller in size and mass, be sent into space from aboard the giant Mriya transport aircraft. One has to ask: is the game worth the candle? Indeed, the speed to which the Mriya will be able to propel the orbital aircraft does not exceed 3% of first cosmic velocity. Whereas the MAKS is oriented on the use of a two-stage complex, which although low velocity is an already existing entity, as the first stage, in a number of other projects reliance is on accelerating aircraft, which for the time being still remain mythical. From time to time even completely irresponsible calls are made to proceed to the technical designing and construction of an experimental copy of a single-stage spaceplane not having any parts separable in flight. In such projects, whose first variants were proposed about 30 years ago, provision is made for a too light-weight approach to the problem of creating highly efficient and reliable hypersonic air-jet engines, involving primarily the development of adjustable hypersonic air intakes and ensuring a stable process of hydrogen combustion in a supersonic air flow. For the time being it has not been possible to solve this problem fully, even theoretically. But from the practical point of view it must be admitted that air-jet engines, capable of reliably operating under the enormous thermal and mechanical loads of hypersonic flight, can be created only on the basis of 21st-century materials and technologies. As indicated by experience in aircraft construction in our country and abroad, from 8 to 15 years will be spent on the designing, construction and testing of an aircraft engine -- two or three times greater than on the development of a new aircraft. Therefore, one should not think in terms of realization of projects for a two-stage (much less a single-stage) spaceplane in the years immediately ahead. The multiply reusable aerospace system most promising with respect to the possibilities of its embodiment in metal with the use of already mastered technologies must be considered a two-stage complex whose first stage is a rocket plane, that is an aircraft carrier with liquid-propellant jet engines. In such a system a vertically launched rocket plane carrying an orbital aircraft (second stage) is propelled to estimated hypersonic velocity, after which it descends in a gliding flight and makes a landing like an aircraft at a stipulated airfield, whereas an orbital aircraft outfitted like the Shuttle has its own liquid-propellant jet engine and is prepropelled to first cosmic velocity. Performing its assigned task in orbit, the orbital aircraft returns to the place of landing of the rocket plane for preparation for a repeated flight. A reasonable question may arise: do we have to be concerned at all with aerospace systems during such difficult times? We will not delve into profound reasonings on the subject of the irreversibility of scientific-technical progress. We will simply recall how the cosmonauts returning from a regular expedition to the Mir station were retrieved from the Soyuz ship. Over the landed ship the search team set up a step ladder with a block and tackle, by means of which the cosmonauts were extracted through the narrow hatch. Debilitated in the course of the Soyuz descent by the operation of 8-g acceleration after prolonged exposure to weightlessness, with forced smiles on their faces they sat down in the seats prepared for them... But now the astronauts flying in the Shuttles in all flight stages need not experience accelerations greater than 3 g. And it must be surmised that they leave their ship after landing almost with the same ease with which passengers of a modern airliner descend along the stairs. They are to be envied!
