Today he visited the Royal Palace on Wawel Hill in Krakow and then met the representatives of the Slovak community in Poland. During the flight home, Michal Michalcik interviewed the president on his visit. [Begin recording] [Michalcik] [passage omitted] To what extent do you feel that the intentions with which you went on your first visit to Poland were fulfilled? [Kovac] I think that, in some aspects, the visit was succesful beyond my expectations. [passage omitted] It would certainly have been more effective if agreements could have been signed on this occasion and if [Economics] Minister Ducky had also taken part in the visit, particularly because the Polish side expected it. In spite of this, I think that this changed nothing regarding the overall results of the visit, taking into consideration what can generally be expected from a presidential visit. [Michalcik] The affair concerning Milan Panic's letter started in Bratislava on the day you left [25 January]. Do you think the choice of date was deliberate? [Kovac] I cannot say anything for certain. I only know that the letter was dispatched from the Presidential Office to the Office of the Government on 17 or 18 January and that it was lying there for quite a long time. This means that there was an opportunity to react to it in some way by 19 or 20 January. I cannot say whether the prime minister received the letter from his clerks only later, or whether something else happened. In any case, as regards this visit, the date it was made public was not well chosen. [Michalcik] During your talks with Polish President Walesa and other officials, a number of interesting proposals and projects emerged--namely, a total opening of our borders and a systematic dialogue within the Partnership for Peace project. Speaking at a news conference, you said that this is no longer just a shared wish but an inevitable course of action brought about by circumstances. [passage omitted] [Kovak] We have come to realize that our nations are very close to each other, we are neighbors sharing a border almost 600 km in length, and we have the same problems, common interests, and internal and foreign policies. Therefore, it would be very irresponsible not to make use of this chance. This conclusion has been reached not only on the level of presidents but, in my view, also on the level of the Polish Government as well as the Sejm and Senate. Therefore, I feel entitled to expect that the next meeting between the [Slovak and Polish] prime ministers, perhaps also between the Polish and Slovak Cabinets, will really mean a significant turning point, because at these meetings issues will be specified and a number of agreements prepared for signing. We are fully aware of the fact that, without a proper basis formed by agreements, it is not really possible at present to develop our relations on various levels. [end recording]
