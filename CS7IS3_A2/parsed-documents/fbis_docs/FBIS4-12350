Dhar] [Text] NEW DELHI, 1 April-- U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, who is arriving here on 6 April, will be clearly told that even though India is interested in knowing the Clinton Administration's views on resolving Indo-Pak differences, linking of F-16 supply to Pakistan with a grand design of nonproliferation in South Asia is unacceptable to it. India feels that the issue of Pakistan's nuclear capability and its capping is a bilateral matter between Islamabad and Washington. It cannot be expected to make a matching commitment to a proposition which strikes at the root of nonproliferation and legitimises Pakistan's clandestine nuclear weapons programme. Mr. Talbott, who is expected to meet Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao and other Union Ministers and have discussions with Foreign Secretary K. Srinivasan and External Affairs Ministry officials, is likely to unfold his package to establish a verifiable, comprehensive non-proliferation regime in the subcontinent by capping nuclear capabilities of both India and Pakistan and also suggesting a multilateral dialogue on arms control. The incentives he has to offer to India to comply with the Clinton Administration's requirements are not known, but what is talked about privately refers to raising the threshold on technologies that have so far been denied to it. The suggestion for a U.S.-sponsored West Asia Type Indo-Pak dialogue on Kashmir and other issues has been informally mooted but the Indian reaction will be known only when Mr. Talbott spells out his proposals in detail. At present, India is unwilling to commit itself to any such negotiations without knowing their scope and usefulness. It will not accept anything which amounts to compromising its principles because on issues, such as, non-proliferation and Kashmir it is not easy to reconcile the views held by India and Pakistan, which has found a supporter in the Clinton Administration for its nuclear adventurist role in South Asia. The Assistant Secretary of State Ms. Robin Raphel, who spent five days here, has already tested the temperature and seen the disposition of New Delhi, will brief Mr. Talbott on her discussions with the Indian leaders and also accompany him on his tour of India and Pakistan. Though Ms. Raphel kept a low profile during her discussions in New Delhi and avoided raking up fresh controversies, she did not yield ground on any aspect of the policies that have been laid down for the Clinton Administration in relation to India and Pakistan. It is, therefore, unlikely that any further pressures from the U.S. over the nonproliferation issue will work so long as India's legitimate security requirements are not met and its concept of complete and universal disarmament is not accepted. The Indian Government believe that the Clinton administration has already taken the decision to supply 36 F-16 aircraft and an unspecified number of P-3 Orion antisubmarine warfare planes through one-time exception of the Pressler Amendment which currently bars U.S. military aid to Pakistan. In order to get the support of the Congress to the move, the administration is linking it with a broader South Asia initiative on non-proliferation including capping of the nuclear capabilities of both India and Pakistan. But, in effect, Washington is back-sliding on its accepted policy of non-proliferation in South Asia. It is pre-empting the whole purpose of the bilateral dialogue between India and Pakistan by proposing a barter. F-16s, as India has pointed out, can be easily modified to deliver nuclear weapons as Pakistan had done in the case of the aircraft it received prior to the Pressler ban. Mr. Talbott will surely be told that India is the biggest victim of proliferation in the region and the U.S. has condoned acquisition of nuclear capability by Pakistan and is trying to formalise it so that Islamabad can indulge in the game of adventurism and blackmail. Therefore, the concept of forcing India and Pakistan to comply with U.S. non-proliferation goals while adding to Islamabad's offensive capability through the supply of F-16 and other aircraft, is totally unacceptable to India. The supply of F-16s will decisively shift the military balance in the region in Pakistan's favour, India does not accept the argument that because of its superior ground forces it is not facing a real threat from Pakistan as there are limitations to deploying forces on a single front. While Pakistan will have, in addition to the F16s, M-11 and other missiles supplied to it by China deployed against India, New Delhi is being strongly advised against deploying the Prithvi missiles along its borders. Though Pakistan is theoretically under sanctions over the issue of missile supplies from China, it is widely known that Beijing has maintained supplies of components of M-11 missiles with a range of more than 300 km. Therefore, there are no takers for the argument that resumption of American arms supply to Pakistan will not change the strategic balance in the subcontinent.
