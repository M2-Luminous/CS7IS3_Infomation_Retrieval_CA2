Introducing the monthly economic report, Rexrodt said in Bonn today that the economic revival is strengthening in western Germany. With growth of 2.1 percent, the GDP in the first quarter of 1994 has for the first time in a year surpassed last year's figure. Around half the loss in overall production which occured during the preceding recession was made up as a result of the latest increase. In general, a further strengthening of the upward trend in the west can be expected. The rate of recovery in the eastern states is particularly strong in industry. Thus, incoming orders in the manufacturing industry in the first quarter are nearly 20 percent higher than last year. The construction industry is also expanding rapidly. According to the ministry, orders in the construction industry exceeded last year's results by 31 percent in the first quarter of 1994. The consequences of the recession on the labor market in the west are still in evidence. In general, however, unemployment seems to have bottomed out, said Rexrodt. Seasonally adjusted, the decline in employment and rise in unemployment has slowed down noticeably.
