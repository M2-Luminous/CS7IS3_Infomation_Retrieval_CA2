The government has given no details on these negotiations, which were held in closed sessions. However, the UGTA has given the government until 15 January to respond favorably to its demands, according to a statement released by the trade union. It seems that as far as these demands are concerned Abdelhak Benhamouda [UGTA secretary general] has not obtained satisfaction. This is at least what can be inferred from the tone of the statement released by the UGTA, which says that the negotiations have not given any results. Over to Rachid Ould Mohand with a summary of the statement: [Ould Mohand] In its statement, the UGTA says that the meeting between the government and the trade union has not given any results and that both sides stuck to their positions. The points of disagreement are the refusal of the government to increase the basic wage to 4,000 Algerian dinars in all sectors of activity in 1994. The trade union stressed its position by demanding an increase in wages if prices of consumer goods were to rise. The government expressed its readiness to create a national unemployment fund and examine other problems such as partial retirement [as heard], which is one of the trade union's demands. The trade union has set 15 January as a deadline for the government to meet all its demands. According to the UGTA statement, the government has also pledged to set up a joint commission between the trade union and the Education Ministry next week to reexamine the law concerning teachers. The government also promised to pay 147 billion centimes to the Federation of Education Workers to cover the cost of social services and to open financial posts [as heard] for teachers suffering from work-related illnesses until these illnesses are included in the national list of work-related illnesses. Finally, the government has also pledged to pay teachers for the days they went on strike or to pay them back if their pay had been docked.
