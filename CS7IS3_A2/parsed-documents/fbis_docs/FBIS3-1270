The chairman of the ANC in southern Natal, Mr. Jeff Radebe, said in Johannesburg that the time had come for the TEC to take charge so that free and fair elections could take place. The ANC's candidate for the Natal premiership, Mr. Jacob Zuma, said at the same news conference that the ANC did not want to prescribe to the TEC, but that it had to act. Mr. Zuma also said that there were signs that people in kwaZulu were tired of Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi's rule, which he described as autocratic.
