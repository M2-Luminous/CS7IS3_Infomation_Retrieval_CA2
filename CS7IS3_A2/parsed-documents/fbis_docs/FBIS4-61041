Velikoselskiy; from the "Vesti" newscast] [Text] St. Petersburg remains the Russian leader in the illegal production of synthetic narcotics. Another underground laboratory was eliminated here a few days ago. A promising chemist and a capable manager combined their skills and prepared for sale a very rare and extremely effective drug. Its value on the narcotics market exceeds four billion rubles, and the number of single portions produced may be over a million. The state has confiscated from those arrested a large quantity of chemical reagents, laboratory equipment, and notes describing an original procedure for synthesizing narcotics, which the authors do not want to patent for the time being.
