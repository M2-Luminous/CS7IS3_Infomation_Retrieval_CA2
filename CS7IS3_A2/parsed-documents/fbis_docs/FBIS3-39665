Craxi comes down to a meeting room. The teleprinters are spewing out heated declarations from [Democratic Party of the Left headquarters in Via delle] Botteghe Oscure: a conspiracy, a disgrace, a traitor. He lights a Salem, a menthol cigarette. [Negri] D'Alema is in trouble. They say that you are the one who put him on the spot. [Craxi] Whatever next! I have been saying for ages that I would take care of the liars. It is true, I am working on them. But I can tell you that in the next few days I shall also be turning my attention to the extraterrestrials. [Negri] Extraterrestrials? [Craxi] Yes, those who now pretend that they have been living on the moon for 20 years, that they do not know how things worked. There are lots of extraterrestrials, I even had some in my government. They are worse than the liars, who at least assume responsibility for the lies that they tell. [Negri] Amato, La Malfa, who do you mean? [Craxi] Pardon me, is there anything else you want to know? [Negri] Yes. Whereas you are paying visits on the public prosecutors' offices, PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] deputy Correnti is now saying that "justice is too serious a matter to be left to the examining magistrates." A reversal of roles? [Craxi] It is politics that cannot be left to the magistrates. As to the rest, to date four prosecutors' offices have summoned me to elucidate on my speech to the lower house: Venice, Turin, Rome, and Milan. I gave the magistrates a few examples to back up my denunciation. I cited one case in a hundred. Of course, it is not a good thing for the election campaign to be run by the prosecutors' offices, but this is what has been happening for two years. [Negri] Let us come back to the point: The PDS general staff is describing the D'Alema affair as a slanderous attack on your part. [Craxi] The leaders of the PDS, who have opted from the outset for lies rather than for ascertaining the truth, are using these epithets and talking in these terms in an attempt to shore up their own position. This is why I have decided to make one of the chapters of my report public by giving it at least to those who undertake to pass it on. It is the third of the 18 chapters that I have handed over: It demonstrates how a perfectly true account of an episode was described by L'UNITA as a "farce." [Negri] Do you know anything about this Morandina, who has claimed responsibility for the accounts in Switzerland and was the PDS's key man in the Veneto region until just now, its delegate in the negotiations as to who is to stand for the progressive alliance? [Craxi] No, nothing. But he is a technical man, is he not? He must be a highly skilled technician if he has done consultancy work for Fiat. [Negri] However, Formica has asked why he gave the money back if he earned it by providing professional services. [Craxi] Ah, that is something you must ask him; as a technician, he will know why he gave it back. [Negri] How do you see politics nowadays, after what has happened to you? [Craxi] My expectations are being confirmed. What I thought would happen is happening. We shall assess matters up in a few months, but meanwhile there is a tragic economic balance sheet. The talk is of everything but employment, bankruptcies, shutdowns. This is what happens when violence is used. Things can only get worse, because you reap what you sow. I hear no talk of the real problems in this media-dominated world; it looks almost as if there is a real reality and a media reality. [Negri] What do you think of Berlusconi in politics? [Craxi] It is a phenomenon that requires analysis, one that is also present is societies that are even more media-oriented than our own, such as the United States or even Latin America. When I think that from 1976 to 1983 I worked to gain two percentage points [for his party], I cannot but ask myself how great the change has been. [Negri] Did you give him any advice? [Craxi] He has done it all on his own. He realized that there was a lack of leadership, a worrying situation, and he has brought the full weight of media to bear. Be that as it may, he has his own credentials, with their pros and cons. He has demonstrated that he is a good businessman, although the transition from business to politics is undoubtedly a leap into the unknown. [Negri] How do you see Occhetto getting on in the midst of media domination? [Craxi] He has a large part of state television at his disposal, but the television screen is also a mirror of truth. The more people watch him on television, the more they will be able to notice that he is a great liar and that he is not a leader capable of running the country. [Negri] Any nostalgia for the old parties? [Craxi] Much of the blame for the collapse of the system can be laid at its own door, it had aged badly, but we cannot pretend not to see what is replacing it. Notwithstanding its degeneration, the party regime was a channel, but now we are facing the unknown. Suffice it to say that there are only three days to go before the deadline for submitting the lists of candidates, but no one knows yet who they will be. Who knows through what centralized filters the winning names have to pass. It will soon become clear that we are moving out of the party regime into an oligarchy.
