Rosati was to have filled the posts after his predecessor, Marek Borowski resigned a few weeks ago, but President Lech Walesa refused to accept him. In a letter addressed to Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak and leader of the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) Aleksander Kwasniewski Rosati wrote that "another candidate should be sought urgently, one that would win support of the coalition and the president." Rosati firmly rejected the arguments raised against his candidature by "the president and his representatives," but is of the opinion that the course of political developments in Poland over the past month indicates ever more clearly that the coalition is unable to persuade Walesa to approve him as a candidate for the posts of deputy prime minister and finance minister. Efficient performance of these functions would be "very difficult in the conditions of a lack of approval on the part of the Belvedere." Rosati thinks that it is in the interest of the country to urgently seek another candidate for the vacant posts. "Energetic actions to this end are necessary in face of ever more visible symptoms that the economic and social situation in the country is getting destabilised," Rosati wrote.
