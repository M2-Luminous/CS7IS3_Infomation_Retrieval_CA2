His wish to expand economic relations has met with "great interest" and "great openness," Diepgen told journalists yesterday. It is important that German exports to China are increased and that the Berlin area gets a bigger share in this. Businessmen accompanying him were also content with the results achieved so far. In securing orders from China, transport and environment policies play a special role, Diepgen said. Also, old contacts established during the GDR era should be used and given a central role. The new partnership agreement between the German capital and Beijing will apply to contacts in the fields of culture and science, as well as industry, such as joint activities at trade fairs. Furthermore, it has been agreed that contact persons shall be appointed to organize companies' activities. Asked whether he has voiced concern about the arrest of dissidents -- including the most prominent human rights activist Wei Jingsheng -- either personally or on behalf of the Federal Government, Diepgen said he had addressed "all issues" that are relevant between the FRG and China, "including human rights." He did, however, not say what form this had taken. Diepgen will travel to Shanghai today; from there he will go on to the special economic area of Shenzhen.
