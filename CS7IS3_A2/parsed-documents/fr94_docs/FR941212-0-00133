FR941212-0-00133 FR941212-0-00019 (2) Payment from $100&hyph;$1,999. For POV claims paid for any amount between $100 and $1,999, and if there is evidence of ocean carrier liability, the entire claim file will be forwarded to Military Sealift Command, Atlantic, by transmittal letter prepared in the format shown in DA Pam 27&hyph;162, figure 3&hyph;18. However, if there is evidence of liability attributable to the inland shipment of POVs in Europe, the entire claim file will instead be forwarded to the U.S. Army Claims Service, Europe, ATTN: AEUTN&hyph;PCR, APO AE 09166&hyph;5346. (3) Payment $2,000 or more. (i) Non-European claims offices. If the amount paid on a POV shipment claim is $2,000 or more, or if it appears that the POV was dropped or was mishandled severely in shipment, claims personnel will prioritize recovery action and handle the larger claims first. Claims personnel will_ (A) Assert a demand against the responsible contractor if an outport contractor, stevedore, or inland transporter damaged the vehicle; or (B) Forward the claim to USACSEUR for recovery if the damage occurred while the POV was in the custody of a European outport, stevedore, or inland shipment contractor; or (C) Close the file and forward it for retirement if the POV was damaged while in the custody of government personnel; or (D) Forward the claim to the Military Sealift Command if the damage occurred while the vehicle was in the custody of the ocean carrier (ship) or if claims personnel cannot determine where the damage occurred. (ii) European claims offices. If the amount paid on a POV shipment claim is $2,000 or more, claims personnel will prioritize assembly of the file and will forward it to USACSEUR for recovery action 21 days after the claim is paid. (b) Personal property other than vehicles (for example, household goods). After payment of a claim involving personal property other than POV's, the entire claim file will be forwarded, in duplicate, directly to the Commander, USARCS, for recovery action as appropriate. §536.196 Centralized recovery program procedures. After settlement of a claim under this subpart (including direct procurement method (DPM) or intra-theater shipments (only if private insurance is involved), and all mobile home claims), requiring centralized recovery processing as determined by the Commander, USARCS, the office paying the claim will forward the file to USARCS within 30 days. (See also §536.184(a).) All such claims where recovery action is anticipated will include legible documentation and will be assembled as described below. (a) The following documents will be affixed to the left inside cover (opposite the side bearing complete name and file number of claimant) in descending order: (1) First.

(See DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 3&hyph;26.) (b) Offset actions against NTS contractors. When an NTS contractor is liable and a satisfactory settlement cannot be reached, the claims office will forward the file to the Regional Storage Management Office (RSMO) responsible for administering the Basic Ordering Agreements for storage in that geographic area. (See DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 3&hyph;26.) (c) Offset against packing and containerization contractors. When any claims office determines that a packing and crating contractor is liable and a satisfactory settlement cannot be made, a copy of the complete claim file will be forwarded by letter to the local contracting office administering the contract, requesting offset action. The contracting officer will conduct a careful review of the claim file and will make a determination on the issue of contractual liability on the information contained in the file and on personal findings of fact in accordance with the contract involved. (Also see DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 3&hyph;26.) (d) Title 4 CFR 102.3(b)(2) affords a carrier or contractor certain procedural rights prior to offset. A JA/claims attorney will certify to the contracting office that the Army has complied with 4 CFR 102.3 if requested to do so. The JA/claims attorney will give the carrier/contractor: (1) Written notice of the nature and amount of the debt, and the agency's intention to collect by offset if the debt isn't paid. The DD Form 1843 or demand letter provides this notice. (2) The opportunity to inspect and copy agency records pertaining to the debt if requested. (3) The opportunity to obtain review within the agency if the carrier/contractor requests this. If requested, the JA/claims attorney will review the file prior to offset. No oral hearing is required. (4) The opportunity to enter into a written agreement with the agency to repay the debt. A carrier/contractor will normally be allowed 45 days to follow up a settlement offer with a check. If a satisfactory check is not received within the 45 days, the JA/claims attorney should offset the carrier/contractor without delay. (e) In accordance with 4 CFR 102.3(b)(5), the head of an area claims office or claims processing office may effect offset prior to completion of any or all of the procedures in paragraph (d) above if failure to promptly offset would substantially prejudice the Government's ability to collect the debt. §536.198 Compromise or termination of recovery actions. Subject to the limitations contained in this subpart, the Commander, USARCS, is delegated authority to compromise or determine collection action on claims against third parties in accordance with the provisions of 31 U.S.C. 3711. §536.199 Terms and abbreviations. Definitions of terms and a glossary of abbreviations frequently used in recovery actions are in DOD 4500.34&hyph;R, in the definitions section, beginning at page XXXIV. §536.200 Required references. Each claim office will maintain copies of the following references for recovery purposes: (a) DA Pam 27&hyph;162. (b) Personal Property Traffic Management Regulation (DOD 4500.34&hyph;R).
