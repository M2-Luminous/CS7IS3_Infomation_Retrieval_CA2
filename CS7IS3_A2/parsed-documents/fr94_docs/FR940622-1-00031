FR940622-1-00031 FR940622-1-00010 Having reviewed the SEC's actions, the Department has determined to propose changes to its capital rule, which, for the most part, parallel the SEC's modifications. The following text explains the Department's rationale supporting its amendments, with particular emphasis on the differences between the Department's and the SEC's changes. 8 8 Explanations of the SEC's reasons for the changes to its capital rule are found in the releases accompanying their proposed and final rules. See Supra notes 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. II. Analysis A. Minimum Capital Requirements The SEC has either increased or proposed increasing the minimum net capital requirements for most brokers and dealers subject to Rule 15c3&hyph;1 to an amount ranging up to $250,000, depending on the type of business conducted by the broker or dealer. The previous minimum requirements had been unchanged for at least 16 years, and, in the case of the $5,000 level applicable to introducing brokers, for 26 years. 9 Inflation over this period has reduced the level of protection that the current minimum standards provide. 9 54 FR 40395, 40396 n. 14 (October 2, 1989). The Department, in developing its existing capital rule, modified the SEC minimum capital levels prior to incorporating them into the Treasury rule. The modifications reflected the different structure of the Treasury capital requirement whereby securities haircuts are not deducted but instead act as a benchmark with which liquid capital is compared in determining capital adequacy. Nonetheless, the minimum dollar capital levels are based on liquid capital after deducting haircuts, which is comparable to the SEC's calculation of net capital. The Treasury rule currently has a $5,000 minimum liquid capital requirement for introducing brokers 10 and a $25,000 minimum liquid capital requirement for all other government securities brokers and dealers 11 subject to the rule. 12 These levels are equivalent to SEC requirements applicable to brokers and dealers operating under the aggregate indebtedness capital computation prior to the amendments. The Department believes that increasing the minimum levels is appropriate in order to provide better protection to investors in the event of a government securities broker's or dealer's insolvency and to reflect the current realities of the government securities market. Accordingly, the Department is proposing to increase the minimum capital requirements for all government securities brokers and dealers subject to the provisions of ยง402.2. The other capital requirement_that liquid capital be at least equal to 120% of haircuts_would be unaffected by this proposal. 10 17 CFR ยง402.2(c). 11 17 CFR ยง402.2(b). 12 The Treasury capital rule requires that a government securities broker or dealer maintain a capital level of the greater of (i) 120% of total haircuts; or (ii) the minimum dollar capital amounts, computed by deducting total haircuts from liquid capital, applicable to its business. The increases would be effected by creating four minimum capital standards from the two current requirements, reflecting a better differentiation of the risks related to a government securities broker's or dealer's operations based on the type of government securities business it conducts. The four proposed minimum capital requirements would be as follows: (1) government securities brokers and dealers that carry customer or broker-dealer accounts would be subject to a minimum level of $250,000; (2) government securities brokers and dealers that carry customer accounts but that operate under the exemption provided by Rule 15c3&hyph;3(k)(2)(i) 13 would have a minimum requirement of $100,000; (3) government securities brokers that introduce accounts on a fully disclosed basis and receive but do not hold customer securities would be subject to a minimum requirement of $50,000; and (4) introducing firms that never handle customer funds or securities would be subject to a minimum requirement of $25,000. 13 17 CFR ยง240.15c3&hyph;3(k)(2)(i).
