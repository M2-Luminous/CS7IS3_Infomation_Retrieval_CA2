This is what Comrade Wang Qun set forth at the regional forum on setting up the rural and pastoral social service system. The regional forum on setting up the rural and pastoral social service system was held in Ulanqab League on 26-27 February. Wang Qun, secretary of the regional party committee; and Wu Liji, deputy secretary of the regional party committee and chairman of the regional government, attended and addressed the forum. The forum was chaired by Bai Enpei, deputy secretary of the regional party committee and head of the regional leading group in charge of the rural and pastoral work; and Yun Bulong, vice chairman of the regional government. Present at the forum were over 60 persons, including responsible persons of leagues and cities in charge of agricultural and livestock work, regional departments concerned, and some banners and counties. The comrades participating in the forum heard the introductions of the experiences in promoting organizational reform, developing "leading economy," and setting up the socialist service system, gained by Qahar Right Wing Rear Banner, Wuchuan County, Tongliao city, Ningcheng County, Linhe city, Xi Ujimqin Banner, and three townships and villages of Qahar Right Wing Rear Banner and Liangcheng County; and also proceeded from reality to deeply discuss the issues of deepening reform and accelerating the setup of the overall service system. Comrade Wang Qun prominently stressed the important significance of setting up and perfecting the rural and pastoral social service system. He pointed out: Accelerating the setup of the rural and pastoral social service system is an important measure for implementing the guidelines of the third session of the 14th party Central Committee and the central policy on grasping favorable opportunities to deepen reform, expand the scale of opening up, promote development, and maintain stability; a priority to deepening the rural and pastoral reform; a reliable way for speeding up economic development and making the people, towns, townships, sumu, banners, and counties rich; an urgent demand for promoting organizational reform, the change of government functions, and the transfer of personnel, alleviating the financial difficulties of banners and counties, and maintaining social stability; and the necessary way for introducing agriculture, animal husbandry, and the rural and pastoral economy to markets, accelerating the setup of the socialist market economic system, promoting the combination of urban and rural areas, coordinating development, and making the peasants and herdsmen become fairly well-off as soon as possible. Setting up a perfect social service system is deepening the rural and pastoral reform and accelerating the pace of development. This will gigantically promote the region's reform, development, and stability. Comrade Wang Qun stressed: Accelerating the setup of the rural and pastoral social service system is a hard job. Whether or not we win a victory in this battle is a grim test for the cadres at various levels. The leaders at various levels should be promoters of progress, foster a sense of high responsibility and a sense of high urgency, foster the idea that development can be accelerated and stability can be maintained only by accelerating reform, firmly grasp the current favorable opportunity which is conducive to agricultural and livestock development, conscientiously conduct study and make arrangements, organize forces to boldly engage in practice, and strive to make achievements as soon as possible. Comrade Wang Qun urged: The party committees and governments at various levels should realistically strengthen the leadership over the setup of the rural and pastoral social service system. We should persistently streamline superstructure, strengthen the grass roots, change functions, intensify service, and mobilize a large number of young cadres and science professionals and technicians to bring into play their wisdom and intelligence at the service organizations. According to the "three-conducive" principles and in line with actual conditions, we should formulate appropriate policies, conscientiously provide service organizations with production bases, and create necessary conditions for setting up and developing the service system. Leagues, cities, banners, and counties should mobilize their leading bodies; organize and send, in a well-planned manner, cadres to towns, townships, and sumu; help conduct specific study and solve their working problems; and grasp the work of townships one after another. Comrade Wu Liji said in his speech: At present, our region is entering a new key stage of rural and pastoral reform. The broad masses of peasants and herdsmen are advancing from having sufficient foods and clothing to being fairly well-off. Therefore, we should grasp the current favorable opportunities to accelerate the pace of conducting organizational reform and setting up an overall service system. It is urgent to vigorously develop the "dragon-shaped economy" characterized by having peasant households become shareholders of companies, linking enterprises with production bases, combining production and processing with marketing, and making trade, industry, agriculture, animal husbandry, and science a coordinate process. The governments at various levels should positively change functions and work style, intensify service, and bring into full play their functions for serving the rural and pastoral areas, the peasants, and the herdsmen. Comrade Wu Liji set forth specific opinions on working out necessarily relaxed policies to encourage office cadres, science professionals, and technicians to positively make contributions at overall service organizations.
