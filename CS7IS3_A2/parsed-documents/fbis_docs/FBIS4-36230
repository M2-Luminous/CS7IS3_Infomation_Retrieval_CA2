[Peres] Good morning. [Zissowitz] Why did you conceal the existence of this letter? [Peres] Excuse me, why do you say that I concealed anything? [Zissowitz] In any event, you did not reveal it. [Peres] Excuse me, I would like to explain things first. In a speech in Johannesburg, 'Arafat said he had received a letter from us in Cairo containing a commitment regarding Jerusalem. Utter nonsense! To begin with, he did not receive any letter from us in Cairo with regard to Jerusalem. What is more, he did not receive any letter whatsoever from us. Second, the letter was sent to Norwegian Foreign Minister Holst after the agreement was signed, and, in my opinion, its contents are identical to what I said in the Knesset. In my opinion, this is an attempt to concoct a totally unfounded slander. I would like to read to you an excerpt of my remarks in the Knesset: to uphold its cultural heritage and its social, religious, and other institutions -- that is what I said in the Knesset. I also said that coexistence in Jerusalem is a matter of mutual respect between all the residents and the normal functioning of the relevant institutions and systems -- I repeat -- the relevant institutions and systems. My letter does not contain any commitment regarding Orient House or any PLO institutions. The papers write that Peres agreed to Orient House. Where did I agree to Orient House? If Orient House existed during the Likud's tenure and it is legal, then this can be put in writing. If it is illegal, then it can be closed down today. This entire attempt to slander and attribute things that are totally unfounded.... [pauses] The truth is that Holst was involved in the negotiations. I think that what we did this year on the issue of Jerusalem is unprecedented in the history of the State of Israel. On the one hand, we reached an agreement....[pauses] One must look at the whole picture. Again, what we are witnessing here borders on character assassination. [Zissowitz] Perhaps this could have been averted if you had made the letter public, perhaps.... [Peres, interrupting] Excuse me, hold on a second. We reached an agreement this year with the Vatican in Jerusalem -- in Jerusalem as it is: united, under Israeli sovereignty. This year, for the first time, we set Jerusalem aside from the autonomy. True, we promised to uphold the status quo, but the status quo existed even without the letter. [Zissowitz] With your permission, Mr. Foreign Minister, we will soon touch upon the status of Jerusalem and your position on the issue, but first I would like to ask you: Why did you fail to make the existence of the letter public for eight months, even after Yasir 'Arafat announced the existence of such a letter? [Peres] I may have been wrong from a journalistic point of view, but I do not act according to journalistic considerations alone. I cannot start making public correspondence with fellow ministers without asking them first.... [Zissowitz, interrupting] But you wrote the letter. [Peres] Wait a minute; you asked me a question, and I will answer you. I returned to Israel the evening of Friday, 3 June, shortly before the beginning of the Sabbath. The issue began unfolding on Saturday, and I had been abroad for two weeks. Sunday is a day off abroad, and on Monday I coordinated matters with the person I thought I should. I had no reason to conceal the letter. The letter is not stamped top secret, confidential, or anything of the sort. Whoever reads the letter and reads it in good faith, without trying to slander, smear, humiliate, or degrade -- as people in our midst tend to do these days -- will see that it does not contain anything other than a reference to the existing situation in Jerusalem. [Zissowitz] In retrospect, when you read the papers this morning and see that even commentators who usually support you are writing that your credibility has been tainted, do you not think you made a mistake? [Peres] No. It is very easy for them to talk. Why not? After all, they were not the ones who conducted the negotiations. You cannot attribute all the negative things to me. Who achieved all the positive things? When you look at the entire picture of the negotiations and what happened to Jerusalem, I believe that Jerusalem received an unprecedented international boost, both from Christians and Muslims. [Zissowitz] You sent a distinguished cabinet minister like Moshe Shahal to the Knesset podium to declare that those who claim they are in the possession of such a letter...[pauses] that the whole letter is merely the figment of a wild imagination. [Peres] Which letter? [Zissowitz] The same letter that Yasir 'Arafat claimed he had in his possession. [Peres] No, excuse me, we are not talking about the same letter. My dear friend, please be accurate. I was not in Israel when Minister Shahal made the speech. He did not ask me, and I did not send him to the Knesset. Shahal was asked about a letter to 'Arafat, and no such letter exists. To repeat, all the stories that 'Arafat took part in the formulation of the letter or that he insisted that the word Christians appear before the word Muslims are the figment of a wild imagination. It makes absolutely no sense! All these are fanciful stories. In his speech in the Knesset, Moshe Shahal referred to 'Arafat's speech in Johannesburg. What did 'Arafat try to do in Johannesburg? He alleged that he had received a letter from us in Cairo -- and he did not receive a letter from us in Cairo -- and that the letter contained some promises about Jerusalem -- and these do not exist in reality; there are no such promises. In my opinion, Shahal's denial really and truly corresponded to the situation. We left the status quo unchanged. Why did we do that? In order not to change it for the worse. Why did we agree to Jericho? So that the relevant institutions could be located in Jericho. [Zissowitz] Let us talk about the relevant institutions, which, as you said in your letter, are very important. If the Palestinians really choose to conduct all the activities pertaining to the autonomy from Orient House.... [Peres, interrupting] They have no permission to do that. [Zissowitz] Will the status of this building also be upheld in such an event? [Peres] Which building? [Zissowitz] Orient House. [Peres] Where does it say Orient House? [Zissowitz] It says other institutions. [Peres] Who says Orient House has been recognized? Listen, it is either one of two things: If it is legitimate and existed during the Likud's tenure, then it will continue to exist in the future. If it is not legitimate, then it must be closed down. This letter does not give any legitimization whatsoever to something that is illegitimate. [Zissowitz] I would like you to clarify this point. If the Palestinians conduct their autonomy affairs from Orient House.... [Peres, interrupting] We will close the place down. This would be in contravention of the agreement. Jerusalem is outside the autonomy agreement. It does not contain any permission whatsoever....[pauses] This whole thing looks like a bunch of Indians dancing around an imaginary bonfire. The whole purpose of the letter was to clarify that the autonomy institutions would be located in Jericho and that whatever existed in Jerusalem prior to the autonomy -- not during the autonomy -- would remain unchanged. [Zissowitz] Generally speaking, will you agree to any compromise with the Palestinians with regard to the status of the Palestinian institutions operating in the city and the status of Jerusalem when these issues are discussed in the negotiations on the permanent arrangement? [Peres] No, there will be no compromise where matters of government are concerned. My mind is made up, and I will not change it. All those who attack me are actually weakening Jerusalem; you know, in a bid to lash out at the government, they are weakening Jerusalem. My position is clear-cut and unequivocal: Jerusalem and no other city is the capital of Israel. Jerusalem will not be Berlin and will not be divided in two; it will remain a united city under Israeli sovereignty. I have said on more than one occasion, and I will repeat it now: Jerusalem is closed politically but open from the religious point of view. Seeing that we are talking seriously, let me tell you something else. At times, a more relaxed and smarter style saves me arguments. What does the letter contain, after all? A promise to uphold the status quo. It contains no reference whatsoever to Orient House. I believe Orient House is Faysal al-Husayni's property. There were times when it was open and times when it was closed down. The letter does not contain any commitment whatsoever either to open it or to close it down. [Zissowitz] Are there any other letters appended to the agreement? [Peres] Not that I know of. I reiterate, all these alleged lies are totally unfounded. What lies? Did we send even one letter to 'Arafat? Was this letter sent before the agreement? Was it part of the agreement? And even after you read it, what does it contain? Only a reference to the existing situation, and that is all. [Zissowitz] Finally, Foreign Minister Peres, did you mishandle the entire issue? [Peres] No, I did not. I know some issues are bound to cause anger and aggravation, but I am determined. I think we have scored huge achievements. I think all we have done surpasses what the Likud had committed itself to many times over. I would like to tell you that if any forgery was ever committed, it was when the Likud signed an agreement citing the words Palestinian people [previous two words in English] and translated it into Hebrew as the Arabs of Eretz Yisra'el. At the time, everybody kept mum about it. Any schoolchild will tell you that Palestinian people [previous two words in English] means the Palestinian people. [Zissowitz] But this is altogether a different issue. [Peres] That is right. Nevertheless, we said we did not give a letter to 'Arafat, and we did not give a letter to 'Arafat. There has been no change in the status and the situation of Jerusalem as it existed until the autonomy. There has been no such change. [Zissowitz] Thank you very much, Foreign Minister Peres. [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 0500 GMT on 7 June carries a similar live telephone interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by Mikha Friedman and Ya'el Dan. Asked what was the reason for sending such a letter a few days after the agreement was signed in Oslo, Peres replies: "The answer is quite clear. On the eve of the signing of the agreement in Oslo, a deep crisis emerged between us and the Palestinians which almost blew up the entire negotiations, because they wanted the autonomy institutions to be outside Jericho -- say, in Jerusalem. We said that they must be located only in Jericho and nowhere else or else there will be no agreement. They said: What about existing institutions, such as hospitals and schools? I said: We will not change the existing situation in Jerusalem. Holst asked me whether I would be prepared to put this in writing some day, and I replied: Yes, I have no problem with that. That is the whole story." [Asked whether the future of Jerusalem will be discussed in the framework of the negotiations on the permanent arrangement or on the autonomy, the foreign minister replies: "In the framework of the permanent arrangement." [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0600 GMT on 7 June carries a summary of the interview with Foreign Minister Peres, adding that "correspondent Moti Amir points out that the text of the letter the Palestinians have in their possession is dated 9 September, more than one month before the date written on Foreign Minister Peres' letter to Norwegian Foreign Minister Holst."]
