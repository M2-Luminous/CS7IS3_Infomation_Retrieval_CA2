While the FOGADE [Deposit Guarantee and Banking Protection Law] president announced that payments to depositors in these banks will commence next week and that the timetable for payments will be disclosed this week, Cadenas indicated that the payments can be made only if Congress approves the use of 250 billion bolivars based on the Law of Public Credit. Once again official spokespersons are contradicting each other by not providing the same information to depositors, thereby increasing uneasiness. Cadenas said the goal is for all accounts to be paid equally, that is, not only savings accounts, but also checking, time deposits, cash, and others. With regard to the banks that the government has intervened in, he said that these could not sustain the large withdrawals of capital by the public resulting from a lack of trust. The people, he noted, should not listen to rumors. [Begin Cadenas recording] I hope the public will react positively to this situation. I am making a sincere appeal to people to use good sense and not to be led astray by rumors. If the public is led astray by rumors, anything can happen. There is no valid reason for [word indistinct] bank can do that. There is no reason for this, unless the public loses trust. If the public starts to make massive withdrawals, it would be impossible...that is, there is no institution that can support this, as Paul Volcker, former chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve, said. [end recording] With regard to the differences between the banks and the associations to which they belong, such as the Banking Association and the Banking Board, Cadenas emphasized that this is not encouraging, given the nation's current situation. Meanwhile, contrary to the decision by the Banking Superintendency and FOGADE, the national government has decided to guarantee that these banks will open their doors on Monday to pay savings accounts up to 4 million bolivars. This was stated by Guillermo Alvarez, Central Information Office [OCI] minister, when reporting on issues discussed at the ministerial cabinet meeting held this Thursday at the Miraflores Palace. Alvarez explained that the depositors will be protected; however, he said that the fact that an answer has been given to the depositors does not mean that the Venezuelan justice system and the government itself, through the corresponding mechanisms, cannot act at a given time, in an attempt to guarantee the assets that were wrongly managed. The OCI chief said that there are legal mechanisms to take action in this regard, although he did not specify whether the state is willing to sue the bankers that illegally used the resources provided by FOGADE in order to rescue the lost funds. [Begin Alvarez recording ] FOGADE has guaranteed a large proportion of bank assets. I cannot say right now what the proportion is; I cannot give you the exact percentage. Nevertheless, the proportion is large, because those banks have [word indistinct] properties and they have securities, negotiable documents that can guarantee a substantial part of the monies fraudulently managed. This money has not been donated by FOGADE; this money was granted as a loan for a specific period, as a guarantee to the depositors, as we have mentioned. [end recording]
