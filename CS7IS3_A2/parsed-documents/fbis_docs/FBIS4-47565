Kirpichnikova, Uralsk Forestry Engineering Institute; UDC 630.425] [Abstract] A comparative analysis of the effect of air pollution young pine (Pinus silvestris L.) and spruce (Picea obovata L.) trees of the Central Urals focused on releases from the primary source of pollution of the Revdinsk- Pervouralsk Industrial Center -- the Sreduralmedzavod, a copper- processing plant. The principal components of the pollution over the past 50 years have been compounds of sulfur, nitrogen, copper, arsenic, and lead. The study involved six sectors -- three with stands of the pine, three with stands of the spruce. The sectors were 4, 15, and 25 km from the plant. Biometric characteristics of the stands fell the closer the study was to the plant. The atmospheric pollution was found to have a greater effect on the growth processes of the spruce. Electrophysiological studies indicated that the conductive properties of the trees were reduced and that the membrane system for the transport of water and ions in the tree trunks (the site of placement of the electrodes) was poorly developed. Overall, the spruce appeared to be more sensitive to the pollution than did the pine. References 12: 9 Russian, 3 Western.
