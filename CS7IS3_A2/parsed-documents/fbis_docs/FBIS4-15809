He emphasized that the Rukh must join with the national democratic forces and people who did not call for an empire and whose activities were aimed at strengthening Ukraine's statehood. Chornovil said two people had very much wanted to gain from these elections. Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk would gain if the elections failed and former Supreme Soviet speaker Ivan Plyushch could have extended the powers of former deputies if the elections failed. Everything was arranged in order that the elections be invalid, Chornovil suggested. He added that these plans had been broken by the Ukrainian people. When asked whether he will run for president, Chornovil pointed out that it could not be discussed since the president's powers had not as yet been defined. Meanwhile, a member of the former Supreme Soviet's presidium, Les Tanyuk, said at a press conference in Kiev that the Communist majority in the new parliament did not mean their complete victory. Tanyuk believes that leftist politicians, most of who are about 60 years old, will not be capable of influencing decisionmaking in the parliament. "The victory of Communists does not signify a victory of the Communist idea," Tanyuk stressed. When commenting on the early results of the parliamentary elections, a leader of the Inter-Regional Reform Bloc, former deputy chairman of the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet, Vladimir Grinev, emphasized that nothing unexpected had happened. "Certainly, it will be difficult with the Communists. However, we have lived with them for all our life, we can live with them a little more," he said. Grinev said his movement could join with the left in the parliament on some issues. Grinev told INTERFAX-Ukraine that he had not as yet decided whether he would run for the coming presidential elections in Ukraine. He remarked that it was necessary to analyze the results of the elections to the Supreme Soviet. Grinev said he could decide on his participation in the presidential elections on 12 April after his meeting with ex-premier Leonid Kuchma in Kiev. Kuchma is also leader of the Inter-Regional Reform Bloc.
