FR940819-2-00016 FR940819-2-00007 Agency Form Under Review by the Office of Management and Budget DOC has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for clearance the following proposal for collection of information under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. chapter 35). Agency: Bureau of the Census. Title: Feature and Address Reference Source Assessment Survey (FARSAS). Form Number(s): GEO&hyph;MAF&hyph;1. Agency Approval Number: None. Type of Request: New collection. Burden: 2,656 hours. Number of Respondents: 7,967. Avg Hours Per Response: 20 minutes. Needs and Uses: For the 2000 decennial census, as well as other census programs, the Census Bureau is building on its 1990 census address list to create a permanent and continuously maintained Master Address File (MAF). We will link this national inventory of living quarters to the Census Bureau's Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (TIGER) data base. The existence of such a linked address/geographic file for the nation will provide important opportunities for the Census Bureau's research and demographic programs. The Census Bureau currently solicits the participation of local governments and metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) in a cooperative arrangement to determine the locations of missing addresses and streets to assist us in maintaining the TIGER data base. For those not wishing to participate we will conduct the FARSAS to help us determine both the availability and usefulness of reference materials we can use to update the TIGER data base for those areas. On the basis of information collected during FARSAS we will be able to resolve non&hyph;matching cases from the geocoding process. Affected Public: State or local governments. Frequency: One time only. Respondent's Obligation: Voluntary. OMB Desk Officer: Maria Gonzalez, (202) 395&hyph;7313. Copies of the above information collection proposal can be obtained by calling or writing Gerald Taché, DOC Forms Clearance Officer, (202) 482&hyph;3271, Department of Commerce, room 5312, 14th and Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20230. Written comments and recommendations for the proposed information collection should be sent to Maria Gonzalez, OMB Desk Officer, room 3208, New Executive Office Building, Washington, DC 20503. Dated: August 15, 1994. Gerald Taché, Departmental Forms Clearance Officer, Office of Management and Organization.
