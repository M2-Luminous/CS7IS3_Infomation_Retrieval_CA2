Ya. Oboimov and S. A. Derevyanko; UDC 621.396.93] [Text] The appearance of cellular mobile radio communication (SPR) networks in Russia's Interlinked Communication Network (VSS) revealed some additional vulnerable places in the organization of the electric communication sector, and posed new problems of network control before science. The problems of the sector's development are aggravated by the difficulties in the economy, and in particular: - the higher cost of raw materials, supplies, energy resources, and construction and installation work; - the practical absence of Russian-made communication equipment satisfying modern requirements; - the unfavorable exchange rate of the ruble, which makes major purchases of imported equipment impossible with the existing financing volumes; - unfinished processes of the sector's management and privatization; - obsolete standards and guidelines. Broad sections of the radio spectrum continue to be inaccessible to new communication services. At the same time there are factors which are acting in favor of the development of new communication services, systems and resources: relatively low cost of microelectronic equipment per telephone number, especially of digital transmission and switching systems, in comparison with traditional systems; the prospects for allocating sufficient frequency bands making it possible to develop the network not by laying cable lines but by organizing radio systems of various configuration, both in cities and in the countryside. Such radio systems have enjoyed wide application abroad, and are beginning to be introduced in our country. Thus, two cellular mobile radio communication networks have been operating since 1992--in Moscow and in St. Petersburg. In that same year two standards were adopted in the Russian Federation for cellular mobile radio communication systems--NMT and GSM. Adoption of still other standards is possible--PCN, DECT etc. In addition, creation of regional networks in the 830-890 MHz band on the basis of the DAMPS standard has been permitted. A competition was conducted for the right of designing and operating SPR networks on the basis of the GSM standard in different regions of Russia. However, the process of creating public SPR is far from smooth. In order that the correct decisions could be made, let us analyze some of the problems that have arisen during development of mobile communication networks in Russia. Interaction of SPR With the VSS Owing to the disintegration of the USSR, the Interlinked Communication Network, or the Unified Automated National Communication Network (YeASS) is undergoing a deep crisis brought about by upgrading of interrepublican networks to the international level, displacement of financing sources locally, and elimination of centralized leadership. On this backdrop, greater interest in establishing SPR networks, the status of which had been until recently at the level of the status of departmental communication networks, adds to the overall chaos. In fact, neither the Main Directions for Development of the YeASS [1] nor the guidelines on the General State System of Automated Telephone Communication (OGSTfS) [2] contains a definition of public mobile radio communication, of which SPR is a variant, and of its role in the YeASS (VSS). Document [2] is obsolete regarding mobile radio communication and conflicts with [1]; even so, it has not been rescinded. It is because of this in particular that uncertainty exists in the means of connecting mobile radio communication networks to the OGSTfS. Connection of SPR with the rights of a hundreds and a thousands group and with the rights of regional dial telephone systems and local telephone networks with a 90 code is permitted. The terms of the competitions carried out for the best plan for organizing cellular networks clearly require connection to the AMTS [automatic long distance telephone exchange] with a 90 code. This is possible only for one cellular net in a region. But considering the future, we need to foresee a series of codes for local networks, for example on the basis of the NMT or GSM or PSN standard. In the initial stage, when the network is servicing a small number of subscribers, the number capacity is used wastefully (one code of the local net representing 100,000 numbers). In addition, assigning such codes to the SPR involves technical difficulties in a number of regions due to the lack of AMTS equipment, the need for laying new connecting lines, and in Moscow, moreover, exhaustion of the number capacity. These and other problems of developing public mobile radio communication are in my opinion the consequences of unanswered questions involving interaction of mobile radio communication networks with the VSS. The main question is this: What is public mobile radio communication--individual networks existing as foreign appendages to the OGSTfS, a system of electric communication not having independent significance, a statewide system like the OGSTfS, or something else? And the problem lies not in the difficulty of the definition but in the unpreparedness and reluctance of specialists to tackle the problem head-on. As a result the debate rages over the question as to whether to connect the mobile radio communication net to the OGSTfS at the local or the transit level, and the corresponding recommendations have already been adopted and are being distributed through the country. But great difficulties arise in fulfilling these recommendations, because we still don't have any answers to the more general questions, such as: Will a unified national mobile radio communication network be created, and on what principles; what should be the mutual relations between this network and the OGSTfS? A well-coordinated solution can be found if we recognize the obvious: Public mobile radio communication is a more general communication system than the OGSTfS. In fact, under this condition we do away with the questions as to the independence or dependence of mobile radio communication, and as to a unified network, because SPR should doubtlessly be united into a unified national network integrated with the OGSTfS. The number system needs to be common with the OGSTfS, as should the signaling system. On the other hand questions regarding connection of networks should be resolved only with regard for technical feasibility, on the basis of the general principles of creating and developing SPR networks and the OGSTfS. Adoption of the concept of unity of SPR and the OGSTfS means creating a new supermonopolistic electric communications structure. And so, unity of the systems would mean the following: - common principles of network organization; - standardization of requirements on equipment interfacing parameters; - common number and signaling systems; - common requirements on subscriber services. Now a few words about the last item. The monopoly in electric communications has important significance. In order to break it up, we need to have as many independent companies as possible participating in providing communication services. In this case, as a rule, territories and subscribers are divided among different service companies in accordance with a permit to operate (a license). No special problems arise in servicing ordinary subscribers. But mobile subscribers who are not associated with any particular territory must be serviced anywhere. This is very important, and companies operating mobile communication networks must service all SPR subscribers with the same quality, without differentiating between ``ours'' and ``theirs.'' This requires coordination of the actions of the companies. Unified standards need to be adopted for each band, equality of access to acquisition of licenses must be ensured, and legislative acts protecting the rights of subscribers must be written and adopted. These functions may be carried out by the Ministry of Communications, but on the condition that it does not act as an economic agent. The System of Mutual Settlements With the disintegration of the old centralized communication system into a number of independent organizations, problems arise associated with fair distribution of rate income. Several structurally, financially and legally independent organizations may participate in the acquisition of the end product (communication services), for example: a mobile radio communication network; a local telephone network (city or rural); an intercity telephone station; a trunk line communication network. When intercity connections are made between mobile subscribers, the number of independent organizations participating in this may reach up to seven. They all have a rightful claim upon part of the funds collected from subscribers for the communication services rendered. The soil for acute conflicts between the indicated organizations is created. This is manifesting itself especially clearly in the creation of new SPR networks. In such a situation there is an extremely great need for working out the principles of mutual settlements and developing the corresponding standards. Three variants are possible: 1) adoption of a general agreement between interested parties regarding the share of participation in providing communication services, and the distribution of rate income corresponding to this order; 2) adoption of an agreement on distributing rate income on the basis of arriving at identical profitability; 3) distribution of rate income in proportion to the service load. The first two variants are technically simple, because they do not require additional solutions, but they are very complex in terms of reaching agreement between the agreeing parties. In addition once an agreement has been reached, it may be put into question after a while, because the conditions of interaction are constantly changing. The third variant requires that we solve a number of technical problems, the main one being installation of devices by which to register the load. But this variant is the fairest, because it permits an objective assessment of the share of the participation of each of the parties in providing communication services. The share of income enjoyed by each organization participating in providing communication services must be proportional to its investment. The following approach can be proposed as a means of determining the latter. We conditionally divide all rate income into three categories. In the first, we include income from services provided only to ``one's own'' subscribers--for example, assigning a subscriber's number, installing and moving subscriber equipment, and so on; in the second--income from services provided to any subscribers regardless of membership to the network (different additional forms of services); in the third--income from services which are provided with the participation of different organizations, for example connections between subscribers of different networks. Payment for the services of the first and second categories should go to the networks and organizations providing these services, while payment for services in the third category should be distributed between the organizations that participate in the process of providing them. In this case the share of income received by telephone stations, SPR networks and intercity stations must be proportional to the service load, while the share of income of trunk line communication networks must be proportional to the number of channels used to organize the connections, their length and the time they are used. The statement of communication services rendered that is received by a subscriber must be drawn up with regard for all of these components, but there must be only one; otherwise the subscriber would receive several statements for each call or other service, which is inconvenient. Unfortunately the requirement of having a single statement is not easily fulfilled. The fact is that with introduction of cellular networks and time-based payment for telephone calls in city and rural networks, the problem of establishing accounting centers to collect charges from subscribers arises. Such centers exist today only under the AMTS, and they service subscribers using intercity communication. In the meantime establishing accounting centers for each network could hardly be considered to be the optimum solution. From my point of view the best variant is to create an independent accounting center that would service all networks of its regions having a need to maintain accounts with subscribers and mutual settlements with other networks. Such a center would draw up and send the subscriber an integral statement of services rendered on the basis of information on connection rates, and conduct mutual settlements among the communication networks on the basis of information on the service load or the share of participation in providing communication services. The center could be established on the basis of the accounting center of the AMTS, to be separated out as an independent organization later on. Management of the Frequency Spectrum The purposes of managing the frequency spectrum are to distribute and redistribute it among users in order to achieve its optimum, economically effective use. The system currently existing in the country, the functions of which include distributing the spectrum and monitoring it (the State Commission on Frequency Distribution under the Russian Federation Ministry of Communication, the State Inspection Office of Electric Communication of the Russian Ministry of Communication, the network of territorial agencies of the State Inspection Office of Electric Communication (oblast, kray, republican), the technical monitoring stations, and city radio monitoring points, does not unfortunately have a criterion for the effectiveness of the spectrum's use, owing to which it is still being distributed out of some ``higher'' rather than economic considerations. This is doing a great deal of harm. An example of this is mobile radio communication. It hasn't developed much at all in the last 10-15 years because of the refusal to allocate legal sections of the spectrum foreseen by the Regulations on Radio Communication for priority use by mobile radio communication. The ``powerful'' sectors have enjoyed the most favored treatment in the spectrum's distribution: defense, state security, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and the Ministry of Communication, insofar as this aids in reaching ideological objectives. The resulting situation was unable to stimulate economy of the spectrum, or progress of communication resources in general. Another significant shortcoming of the existing system of the spectrum's management is subordination of the indicated agencies to the Ministry of Communication. And this means that distribution and monitoring functions are concentrated for practical purposes in the same hands, which doesn't do anything to raise the level of management. Thus economical approaches never existed, and they don't exist today. There are many examples of this. Despite some changes, bands are allocated as before, on the basis of the residual principle, for mobile radio communication. Thus, only small sections of the 800-900 MHz band have been allocated, which will not be able to satisfy the needs of SPR when communication systems working on the GSM standard are introduced on a wide scale. International bands allocated for GSM equipment in all of Europe, and foreseen by the Radio Communication Regulations, are to be closed indefinitely in our country. We are once again laying our on ``rut,'' different from the general European track. Need we remind ourselves that the spectrum is as much a part of our national wealth as are oil, gas, coal etc.? And we'll deplete it as well. Incorrect distribution of the spectrum would be analogous to its plunder: It brings no income to the state, and besides that, the consequences are hard to correct, because the sector accumulates a large mass of equipment that cannot be simply shifted to another frequency band. The need for managing the spectrum by economic methods has been around a long time. The spectrum must have value; it must be fought for with the ruble. Significant changes are needed in the work of agencies responsible for the spectrum's distribution, and namely: 1) The State Commission on Frequency Distribution must not be a part of any ministry. It must be an independent agency, for example under the Government or the Supreme Soviet; 2) when the spectrum is distributed among users, the effectiveness with which the allocated frequency bands are used must be accounted for mandatorily. This requires development and approval of the procedure for determining it; 3) electric communication inspection offices and technical radio monitoring stations must be taken out of the organization of the Ministry of Communication, and they should become independent agencies; 4) the right to use a portion of the spectrum to operate equipment within a certain territory must be granted on a competitive basis to local electric communication inspection agencies under the oversight of the State Inspection Office; 5) licenses must be issued for a limited term. The value of the license must be determined by auction. Conclusion These questions are only a small part of the problem of organizing mobile communication networks. The sector is presently on the threshold of great changes. Integration of communication services on a single digital basis is beginning, and the status of a mobile subscriber is being extended to ordinary telephone network subscribers with the introduction of personal radio communication. In this case the latter is significantly more important than may appear at first glance. Owing to sharp growth of prices of cable products and of construction and installation work, and growth of operating expenses, some telephone networks are already trying to set up telephone services by introducing radio systems, without waiting for the appearance of personal radio communication systems. In this situation we need to resolve the questions of interaction between old and new networks, of frequency regulation, and of introducing an effective system of mutual settlements as quickly as possible.
