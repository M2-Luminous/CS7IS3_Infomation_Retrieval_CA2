Deputy Prime Minsiter Yi said the above on 26 May in his written answer to Democratic Liberal Party lawmaker Namgung chin, member of the Foreign Affairs and Unification Committee of the National Assembly, who asked at the National Assembly that day "If North Korea possesses nuclear weapons, which policy would it choose, the Indian or the Pakistani-style?" Deputy Prime Minister Yi said: "India openly confirms its nuclear tests and possession of nuclear weapons, while Pakistan does not." He then said: "I think North Korea will adhere to a not- confirm and not-opening policy." He added: "This is because North Korea still believes that it can use such a policy as an advantageous card in talks with the United States, Japan, and South Korea."
