"Palestinians are suspicious of the new Cairo agreement, especially with the Israeli occupation forces' closure of the city of Jerusalem and the military constraints Israelis are exercising on Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip," Mr. Ra'fat told the JORDAN TIMES on Wednesday [4 May]. PLO chairman Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin Wednesday signed the agreement on self-rule in Gaza and Jericho in Cairo. The agreement, which was under negotiation for the last six months, will clear the way for the first Israeli withdrawal from the Palestinian areas it seized in the 1967 war. Palestinians are divided in the way they look at the peace talks. There are those who fully support the talks and back the negotiators. Then there are those who back the principle of peace but want a tougher stand in negotiations. And last there are those who oppose the principle of making peace with Israel altogether. Ibrahim Qub'ah, also a member of th Palestine Central Council, told the JORDAN TIMES that he saw the signing of the Cairo agreement as a coup which is bound to shock and confuse the Palestinians no matter how prepared they though they wee. "While Nayif Hawatimah says that Wednesday was a black day in the history of the Palestinian people, I consider it to be a milestone that marks the beginning of the ushering in of an independent Palestinian entity," said Mr. Qub'ah. Nayif Hawatimah, the leader of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP), and George Habash, the leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) lead a 10-faction coalition that includes the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas. The coalition operates from Damascus, and has followers in the occupied territories. Mr. Qub'ah urged Mr. Hawatimah to show courage and stop talkinig about nothing but the "humiliating submission of the PLO." Mr. Ra'fat, a member of the DFLP faction that supports the peace talks accused Palestinian negotiators of submitting to humiliating conditions in the Cairo agreement which, he said, contradicts the clauses of the Oslo agreement. He said that while the Oslo agreement gave Israelis the right to secure order only within Israeli settlements, the Cairo agreement sitpulates that Israeli forces will continue to operate in Jericho and the Gaza Strip. Ibrahim Abu 'Ayyash, also a member of the Palestine Central Council, urged all Palestinians to join forces to make successful the implementation of the Cairo agreement, which, he said, fell short of addressing major issues. Mr. Abu 'Ayyash added that one cannot but fear the consequences of the autonomy accord as it failed to attain major achievements. "While we are signing peace agreements, Israelis are establishing more settlements in different areas of the occupied territories, and that is very worrying," Mr. Abu 'Ayyash said. Mr. Ra'fat, however, said that he hoped for the establishment of a "real" Palestinian authority in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in order to reclaim Jerusalem and end all forms of Israeli occupation. Mr. Qub'ah criticized the Palestinian negotiators for what he called their failure to coordinate with the Jordanian government where the peace talks are concerned. "Palestinians and Jordanians are one body, and this lack of coordination will reflect negatively on the future Palestinian entity if the situation is not corrected," Mr. Qub'ah said.
