Pedro Vallarino Cox, president of the National Renewal Movement (Morena), has invited Ruben Blades, presidential candidate for the Papa Egoro Movement, to support the presidential candidacy of Ruben Dario Carles. When asked if Morena has been set aside now that the Nationalist Liberal Republican Movement (Molirena) has decided to name Carles as its presidential candidate, Vallarino Cox replied: "Carles is the Morena candidate, and I welcome the decision by other parties to support Carles." Presidential candidate Carles has visited David, Chiriqui Province, in the company of Molirena and Morena sympathizers. Carles told his supporters: "I am offering a government that will resolve problems with actions."
