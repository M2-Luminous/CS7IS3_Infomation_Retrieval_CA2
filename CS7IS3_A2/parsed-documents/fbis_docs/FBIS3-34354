Meanwhile Sudanese opposition sources have said that the gunmen, two of whom were killed and a third wounded, are "Arab Afghans" [Arabs who fought alongside Afghan mojahedin against Soviet forces]. [passage omitted] Mubarak al-Mahdi, official in charge of external action in the opposition Ummah Party and former interior minister, has said that the mosque incident was carried out by a Sudanese group whose members' features indicate that they are either from western or southern Sudan, according to the testimonies of some eyewitnesses. They were wearing Sudanese costumes. Their faces were veiled. [passage omitted] In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT yesterday, Mubarak al-Mahdi said yesterday that the al-Riyadh district incident differs from the Shaykh Abu-Zayd Mosque incident. It can be said that the former (the al-Riyadh incident) is linked to a process of settling accounts and disputes within the "Arab Afghans" groups present in Sudan, which are armed. He said that linking the al-Riyadh incident group and the al-Thawrah incident group "is an attempt to conceal the operation carried out by security services to terrorize citizens and oppositionists, especially as mosques have become platforms for the opposition." He added that "the government is responsible for the two incidents, because it allowed these elements to enter Sudan. And its attempt to lay the responsibility on foreigners is unacceptable. It opened the door to foreigners, the Arab Afghans, and others, granting residence, citizenship, and the right to carry firearms." [passage omitted]
