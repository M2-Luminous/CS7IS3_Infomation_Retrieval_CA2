The fact of the matter is that, after receiving permission from higher authority, the command of Tallinn naval base agreed in February 1993 to hand over two redundant minesweepers for scrapping and subsequent sale to the Estonian (Bankir) company. The terms of the agreement have been observed by both sides. There were no sources of radioactive radiation on the minesweepers. Moreover, ships of the type in question are not designed to carry such installations.
