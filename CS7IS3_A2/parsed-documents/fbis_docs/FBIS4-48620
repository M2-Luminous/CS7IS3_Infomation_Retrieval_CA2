The minister announced the closure of the embassy in Maputo and the opening of a new mission in Cairo, and the closure of the High Commission in Nairobi, and the opening of a new one in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The Mozambican mission was opened at the time when Lesotho needed a sea outlet, when relations between Lesotho and South Africa were unfavorable. It had now served its purpose. Mr. Qhobela said the High Commission in Kenya had been established for political reasons and had also served its purpose. This mission will be transferred to Addis Ababa, which is the headquarters of the Organization of African Unity, and several specialized agencies of the United Nations. The relocation of the Nairobi mission will benefit Lesotho in many ways because of the importance of Addis Ababa as a center of African diplomacy and international relations through the United Nations system. On relations with Taiwan, the minister said the Government of Lesotho was compelled to sever relations with the country after a visiting Taiwanese Government mission offered bribes to four Lesotho cabinet ministers. The mission was also requested to leave Lesotho. Mr. Qhobela announced that Lesotho had established diplomatic ties with the People's Republic of China during his visit to Beijing last month. Agreement was arranged between the governments of Lesotho and China for financial and technical assistance for Lesotho. The minister also announced that major changes in the diplomatic service will take place soon when officials of the Lesotho missions abroad will be recalled at the end of their service abroad. This was a routine exercise in the diplomatic service. Mr. Qhobela said much money would be required to effect the transfers of the diplomatic staff concerned.
