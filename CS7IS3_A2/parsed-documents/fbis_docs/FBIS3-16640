The Maritime Kray court endorses the application of this criminal procedural measure. Viktor Ivanovich Cherepkov is charged with accepting extensive bribes from citizen Volkov. Kray administration decree No. 108, issued on 16 March, nominated Konstantin Borisovich Tolstoshein as the acting head of Vladivostok city administration for the duration of criminal investigation of Viktor Cherepkov. When a Maritime Radio correspondent asked Tolstoshein where he would begin, this is what he said. [Tolstoshein] We are taking all the necessary measures so as to attend not to politics but to practical matters, to the most serious questions of survival of the city of Vladivostok. In this connection, I issued a decree nominating my deputies at 2000 hours yesterday [1000 GMT 16 March]. I have also issued a statement on reorganization of the structure of the city administration, and on nomination of heads of rayon administrations. When we gathered, we all reached a consensus: The first task of the Vladivostok city authorities is to begin cleaning up the city immediately, beginning tomorrow. To be more precise, it is already night time, so the cleaning will begin today. [sentence as heard] Our second task: I believe that we should pay the utmost attention to transportation problems, which includes buses, trolley buses, and trams, and of course the railroad. The dacha season will begin very soon, and it will simply not do if the trains do not run. They are very expensive, but how will the pensioners and people who do not have their own transportation commute to their dachas? Therefore we all think that this is one of the main problems. We plan to open as many stores as necessary for the handicapped, World War II veterans, victims of Chernobyl, and veterans of Afghanistan. Therefore, the emphasis will be on people. We have agreed that the dominant factor in our work will be the person. Naturally, one of the most important questions in our activities from the very beginning will be the issue of preparing for the winter of 1994-1995. We are beginning our work, and we call all residents of Vladivostok to respond to our requests. We call on all leaders of enterprises, commercial structures and the various forms of property: Let us all drop confrontation, political intrigue, and other activities that do not grace either us or our life. Let us make Vladivostok a city which will be pleasant to come to, which will be pleasant for our relatives or foreigners -- it does not matter who -- to come to. We must tidy our city up, improve its appearance. After all, we have to live in this city. [Reporter] Konstantin Borisovich, it is 0300 in the night [1700 GMT] now. Is it necessary for you to be here? [Tolstoshein] Of course it is. We started serious work from the very first minutes. I have already told you that we are trying to solve the problems of reducing the city administration. The city administration has been bloated out of all proportion, and understandably, this has consequences: Every person working here gets a salary, and a fairly large one. However, I have to tell you that three people are responsible for the same sphere of activity, and only their job titles are different. And each of them gets a pretty wild salary. We are sitting here working on this problem this very moment. I have to tell the city residents that probably the staff bloated by the previous administration could not handle its job because there were too many people harnessed to specific jobs. We are going to review all of this. In our administration, each person will earn his pay by being responsible for a concrete sphere of activity. [Reporter] If this is not a military secret, could you tell us who will head the rayon administrations? I think that everyone is concerned about this. [Tolstoshein] Of course this is not a secret. I signed a decree nominating the heads of rayon administrations yesterday at 2000 hours. Pervomayskiy Rayon: Viktor Gennadiyevich Pletnev; Leninskiy Rayon: Sergey Semenovich Zhurmilov; Frunzenskiy Rayon: Viktor Andreyevich Goncharov; Pervorechenskiy Rayon: Aleksandr Vladimirovich Avdeyev; and Tamara Borisovna Vadilyeva will be the acting head of Sovetskiy Rayon. We shall see what happens next. [end recording]
