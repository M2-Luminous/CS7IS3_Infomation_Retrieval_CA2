The challenge can no longer be ignored. The youth brigade, egged on by more adult leaders, plans to march tomorrow on Shell House, headquarters of the African National Congress, in the heart of Johannesburg. Its leaders say they will defy a police ban to do so. They also plan a week of rolling mass action to bring the country, or at least its leading metropolis, to a halt. Their attitude is defiant and confrontational, and their aim is to stop or disrupt the country's first free elections. They are willing to risk bloodshed and to precipitate civil war to do so. They cannot be allowed to succeed. The birth of South African democracy cannot be made hostage to violence. Inkatha has ceased to be a mere political problem; it has become a problem of basic law and order. The police are deploying massive resources to stop the march on Shell House. That is proper, but it is important for the future to combine firmness with restraint. It is especially important to prevent wild shooting or mass killings such as occurred in Johannesburg a fortnight ago. The march must not give martyrs to the future. At the same time, it is not sufficient simply to break up concentrations of marchers or demonstrators with tear gas, and allow them to reassemble elsewhere, or to make the notorious hostels a base for future raids and sallies. It is necessary for the police to disarm as many people as they can, and to arrest those who break the law. But police action alone will not end this incipient insurrection. The power of the Inkatha Freedom Party to sow mayhem in the Transvaal derives in very large part from the immense flow of public money -- more than R4-billion [rand] a year -- from the government to the Zulu bantustan. That flow of money should have been cut off months ago. The tasks of paying pensions and salaries, and especially of controlling the kwaZulu Police, should have been taken over by the central government months ago. Our progress towards democracy, not to speak of our lives and property, is now threatened because President de Klerk tried as long as he could to preserve Chief Buthelezi as a future political ally against the ANC. That endeavour has proved vain. Even that expedient reason for keeping Chief Buthelezi afloat has fallen away. In about a fortnight's time the new government will begin to take control of kwaZulu from Ulundi. There is no need to wait. President de Klerk owes it to the nation, and to its hopes of free and democratic elections, to cut off all state support for Chief Buthelezi's regime: money, personnel and facilities, and access to credit. He owes it to the nation to do so immediately. Only when Chief Buthelezi's reign of terror in Ulundi is brought to an end will we know how many Zulu people truly support him. Only when his administration is allowed to collapse will the Zulu people be able to join the rest of South Africa in their march to freedom. Until then we shall depend on an over-worked police force, and an army spread thin, to hold the line against the mayhem which, clearly, it is Inkatha's intention to sow. Until then, we shall depend on the fortitude of the people of Johannesburg to keep this economy ticking over, and this country functioning. All these people have a right to expect President de Klerk to stop fiddling while Rome burns.
