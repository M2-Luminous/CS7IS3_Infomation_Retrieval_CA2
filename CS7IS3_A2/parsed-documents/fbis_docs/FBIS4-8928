Moslems will keep the name Gornji Vakuf for their part of the town, while the Croats will change the name to Uskoplje. Gornji Vakuf will be the third town that has been carved up by the Moslems and Croats. Mostar, the biggest town and the administrative seat of the region of Herzegovina in the southwest of the republic, and Vitez, in the central part, have already been divided. These towns were the sites of the heaviest one-year Moslem-Croat clashes in the central and southern parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina when they were fighting for territories. The ceasefire agreement and division of territories followed the signing of an agreement on a Moslem-Croat federation in Washington on March 18 under strong U.S. pressure. The federation should eventually form a confederation with neighbouring Croatia.
