FBIS4-21388 "jpten009___94054" JPRS-TEN-94-009 JPRS Environmental Issues 25 March 1994 CENTRAL EURASIA RUSSIA Maritime Region Unauthorized To Allow Nuclear Waste Dumping Maritime Region Unauthorized To Allow Nuclear Waste Dumping LD2503134194 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1220 GMT 25 Mar 94 LD2503134194 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [Text] The Maritime region's administration has no right to authorize the dumping of radioactive liquid into the Sea of Japan since only Russia's government is entitled to make such a decision. This was told to Interfax by Nikolay Shapovalenko, the head of the atomic supervision committee's department for overseeing radiation safety at defence facilities. The Chairman of the Maritime Region's Committee for Natural Resources Evgeniy Stomatyuk announced in Vladivostok on Thursday that next week the local administration may adopt a decision on the dumping of radioactive waste because the Pacific Fleet's TNT-5 and TNT-27 waste storage vessels were in dangerous condition. According to Shapovalenko, Russia abstained from signing an amendment to the International Convention on Waste Utilization, which completely prohibits the dumping of any radioactive waste. "Thereby, Russia reserved the right to decide on radiation safety issues in handling waste as it finds fit for its national interests," Shaposhnikov said and stressed that "no local leader is authorized to allow the dumping of radioactive pollutants." He reported that the government had approved a plan for putting a nuclear waste processing plant into operation within three months. However, he declined to say when the project would start to be implemented since the government had not decided who would fund it. His organization believes that the Maritime Region's Governor Evgeniy Nazdratenko favors a Japanese waste processing facility and rejects for some reasons "the actually existing and effective blue-prints designed by various organizations in the Far East and elsewhere." According to the nuclear supervision committee, the Japanese nuclear waste purification technology is far better than the Russian project. "If Japan's offer is accepted, an electric station will have to be build next to the waste processing plant," Shapovalenko said. Meanwhile, as a senior Russian navy officer told Interfax the situation with the storage of radioactive contaminants in the Far East "is appalling and calls for urgent measures." "If the local environmental protection agency approves the regional administration's decision, theoretically I admit the possibility of nuclear waste dumping into the Sea of Japan," he said. In his opinion, the local authorities "simply have to act in such a manner since the government fails to allocate any resources to solve the problem of storing radioactive pollutants."
