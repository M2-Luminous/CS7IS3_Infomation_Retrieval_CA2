FBIS3-43600 "drafr006_a_94001" FBIS-AFR-94-006 Document Type:Daily Report 10 January 1994 CENTRAL AFRICA Burundi Arrest Warrants Issued for Opposition Leaders AB0701203094 Paris AFP in English 1801 GMT 7 Jan 94 AB0701203094 Paris AFP Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Bujumbura, Jan 7 (AFP) -- Burundi authorities issued warrants for the arrest of 14 opposition leaders on Friday [7 January], the day after demonstrations against the deployment of foreign troops left five dead, officials said. Business activities resumed here, though the capital remained tense after thosands of young protesters, mainly students from the Tutsi ethnic majority, brought the city to a standstill by barring main roads on Thursday, while security forces stood by. In one incident, five Tutsis were killed by a Hutu neighbourhood leader in the northwestern Bujumbura suburb of Cibitoke late Thursday, police said, but they gave no details. Among those declared wanted Friday were the president of the Rally for Economic and Social Development (RADDES), Joseph Nzeyimana, several other leaders of that party, and the head of a seven-party opposition coalition, Salvator Nzigamasabo. All 14 had left their homes and gone into hiding, informed sources said. Their arrests could lead to serious clashes, observers said. The demonstrations were staged to protest against the arrival of some 200 peacekeepers from the Organization of African Unity (OAU), requested by the government following the October 21 attempted military coup. The aborted coup, during which Burundi's first ethnic Hutu president Melchior Ndadaye and several other government officials were killed, sparked tribal massacres that left an estimated 100,000 people dead. The government accused the army and the police, who are mostly Tutsis, of "complicity" in Thursday's shutdown of the capital, which it feared could be related to a possible second coup attempt. The protestors had originally planned to continue their demonstrations for three days, according to Employment Minister Leonard Nyangoma. In another development Friday, three opposition parties chose a joint candidate for the presidency, Jean Ndeberi, an academic who teaches biology at the Burundi university and is president of the Burundo-African Alliance for Salvation (ABASA). The late Ndadaye's party, the Front for Democracy in Burundi (FRODEBU), has put up Agricultural Minister Cyprien Ntaryamira as its candidate. The government and the opposition have not yet reached agreement as to how the new president should be elected by parliament, a measure which would need a constitutional amendment. Elections are not currently possible in Burundi, still at risk from ethnic massacres. Some 700,000 people have fled to neighbouring countries.
