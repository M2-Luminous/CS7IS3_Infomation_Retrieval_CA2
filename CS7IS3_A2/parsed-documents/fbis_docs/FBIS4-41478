The Sejm passed the law "in defiance of numerous protests by the international public and without reckoning with the recommendations of the CSCE, the Council of Europe, and a number of international experts", the address pointed out. Thereby, the Latvian authorities "ignored the universally recognised standards in the field of human rights," the Council stated. The Russian parliamentarians, the address said, cannot remain indifferent to the position of the members of national minorities restricted in their right to receive Latvian citizenship. In this connection they believe that Latvia's further destiny, the ensurance of its genuine, not imaginary, national security and the possibility of the creation of a democratic law-governed state will in many respects depend on the world community's and, first of all, CSCE states' and parliaments' stand on the issue, the address pointed out. The Federation Council called on them "to uphold the principles of humanism that are being asserted in Europe and to prevent Latvia from slipping down to an aggressive nationalism and the emergence of a seat of tension in the Baltic region".
