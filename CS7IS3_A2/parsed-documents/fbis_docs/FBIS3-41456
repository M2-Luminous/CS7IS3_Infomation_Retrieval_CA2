These worries are understandable. An accident whose probability is assessed as ``one incident in 10,000 years'' occurred at the initial phase of the mass operation of powerful nuclear reactors. Should we be surprised at the demonstrations by ``greens'' at AES [nuclear electric power station] units in operation, and the bans and all kinds of restrictions which have swept across the whole world? However, it is easier to impose a ban than to build a safe AES. Scientists from many countries have continued to struggle over the problem. These include employees of our High Energy Physics Institute. And today we can say: A safe method of producing nuclear power has been found. For those who have forgotten their school physics course, we will remind you: A conventional nuclear reactor works on the principle of a self-propagating chain reaction. The operating regime has been selected to ensure that the number of neutrons is constant all the time and is strictly monitored. The balance is utterly precise, otherwise an explosion would ensue. However, even the most complex multiple backup systems for monitoring and automatic protection control only reduce the risk of an accident. But we have elaborated a fundamentally different method of producing nuclear energy which rules out the very possibility of a disaster. The essence of it is that the subcritical reactor -- that is, one that is not operating of its own accord -- is illuminated by a beam of particles dispersed in an accelerator. Splitting the nuclei they meet in their path, they generate a powerful, rapidly expanding cascade of secondary particles. These in their turn split a large number of target nuclei. There takes place a complex multistage process of the birth and capture of the gradually decelerating particles, at the end of which the division of the nuclei occurs, as in a conventional reactor, accompanied by the release of an enormous quantity of energy. In other words, the process only operates when the accelerator is working. The idea of the new energy producing system is attractive not just because it means that repetitions of disasters on the scale of Chernobyl are impossible. The likelihood of smaller accidents at AES's, caused by a leakage of the cooling agent in the active zone, is also decreased. Special requirements for the construction materials in the subcritical reactors also enhances its [as published] safety. Furthermore, nonenriched uranium can be used in them, which decreases both the cost of the energy obtained and the risk of the uncontrolled use of enriched uranium. We should add that the subcritical reactor produces not only energy but also the additional nuclear fuel by which it operates. We have spoken several times about our discovery in scientific publications. Announcements have been made in the open press too. And suddenly there are ``sensational reports'' that in Switzerland the physicist Carlo Rubia has developed a new ``direction in nuclear power engineering.'' As it turned out, the essence of this direction coincides with what we have described. Truly, there is no prophet in his own land. However, we are prepared to argue about who should bear the palm. But for us, something else is far more important at the moment: Why has a safe reactor not yet been built? The answer is simple: There is no money. All the research on this topic in our institute has been done by a group of specialists on the basis of enthusiasm alone. The money allocated is not even enough to operate the unique accelerator. It is standing idle, while the construction of an accelerator-accumulator complex has essentially been frozen. The following question begs to be asked: What is more advantageous -- to find money to build safe AES's today, or to seek out money tomorrow to eliminate new Chernobyls?
