In talks with the garrisons' commanders, Colonel Zlatko Radisavljevic of the Raska garrison and Lieutenant Colonel Milutin Petronijevic of the Novi Pazar garrison, VOJSKA was informed that the two garrisons cover a large area of the Raska region with an overall Muslim majority (52 percent), though the percentage varies from place to place. For example, VOJSKA states, in Tutin the population is only 2 percent Serbian, and the sitution is similar in the villages of Dunisici, Fijulje, Mitrova, and Dubovo. It should be stressed, VOJSKA adds, that until recently all these places had Serbian majorities. "This is a region that has been known for draft-dodging and boycotting of the former Yugoslav People's Army and the present Yugoslav Army. Even the small number of recruits called up encounters the strong disapproval of the locality. During the war one could feel increased nationalism and intolerance toward Serbia and everything that is Serbian. Disrespect of the government and creation of a parallel government, purchase of weapons and forming of paramilitary units is just a small part of the `green [Muslim] transversal' that crosses this region. A large number of recruits, in order to avoid mobilization, left with their families for Bosnia before the war, where they later became active in the Muslim units, and sent their families back to Serbia where they are now treated as refugees," Commander Radisavljevic said to VOJSKA. The situation in Raska is now different, VOJSKA states, and the "green transversal" has been broken in several places, among others at the Rogozna plateau, where intensive work is being carried out to revive poor Serbian villages. A new police station has been set up, and the army is building roads. Budjevo village in Pesterska plateau, where Muslims slaughtered about 100 Serbs during World War II, has been given priority. The action is called "Budjenje Budjeva" [The awakening of Budjevo] in which all well-intentioned inhabitants, including quite a few Muslims, are participating, VOJSKA states, adding that everyone agrees that the army is a great factor of security in this region.
