The sources, with whom AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT spoke in European capitals, say that Iraq has sent secret missions to South Africa to achieve the following five main objectives: 1. Purchase of blueprints of a new type of artillery shells not yet produced worldwide. They are the 210-mm giant shells. Dr. Gerald Paul (who was later assassinated) drew up the main design of the shell and the Iraqi branch of Dr. Paul's company coordinated with the company's branch in South Africa for that purpose. 2. Reach agreement with an arms establishment in South Africa to act as intermediary between Iraq and world companies (mainly American and British) for the procurement of extremely advanced equipment for checking missiles after they are filled with explosives. Such missiles include the Scud missiles and heavy artillery shells. British, American, and other companies were not permitted to export such sophisticated devices to a state like Iraq. It should be noted that the effectiveness of missiles and projectiles depends basically on the use of that kind of device. The sources said that Iraq did in fact get some offers through South Africa for the purchase of missile testing equipment. 3. The third aim of the Iraqi contacts with South Africa has been fully achieved. Baghdad has been able to purchase a complete factory for the manufacture of 130-155 mm artillery shells. 4. The sources told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the fourth aim has been the training of technicians and engineers. The sources said that quite a few Iraqis have received training in South Africa. Travel from Iraq to Johannesburg via Frankfurt and London was under assumed names. According to the sources, the visas were issued for "the crescent state," the expression used in official correspondence. 5. The fifth aim has been exploratory research on uranium in South Africa [as published]. The sources said that Baghdad had indeed received some offers in this connection.
