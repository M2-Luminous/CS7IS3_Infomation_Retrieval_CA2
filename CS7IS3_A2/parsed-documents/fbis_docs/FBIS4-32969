The main topic discussed was the 21 August elections. Tello said Mexico is not harmed in any way by the arrival of representatives from other countries or international organizations to learn how the Federal Electoral Institute is organizing the elections. He added the presence of observers from the United Nations and other international organizations helps to dispel any doubt that may exist about the elections. The official noted Mexico has nothing to hide. It is quite the contrary, he said, since we must not only convince the public here but our friends abroad. The foreign secretary was confident the elections will be conducted in total peace because the people of Mexico do not want violence and do not advocate violence as a way to settle disputes. To conclude, he added that one cannot rule out irregularities in the 21 August elections, but he said he was confident any irregularities would be minimal and would not undermine in any way the whole electoral process. During the meeting that lasted a little over two hours, Manuel Tello commented on the purchase of crowd control equipment. He said the Mexican government purchased it to replace the existing equipment that was acquired in 1972 or 1973 but was never used. He indicated this may not have been the best time to purchase the crowd control equipment considering the controversy over the purchase. He noted, however, any responsible government has to have this sort of equipment. Commenting on the visit by U.S. Democratic Congressman Robert Torricelli, who arrived on Friday in Mexico City, the foreign secretary said he is fully convinced the visitor will be highly impressed by the great effort Mexican society has made through its organizations and political parties to guarantee honest elections. He added Torricelli will go to Chiapas State where he may meet with Subcommander Marcos. On another matter, Tello said the Mexican Government is holding talks with the Cuban Government to agree on the date in which President Carlos Salinas de Gortari will visit the Caribbean island, but he declined to comment further.
