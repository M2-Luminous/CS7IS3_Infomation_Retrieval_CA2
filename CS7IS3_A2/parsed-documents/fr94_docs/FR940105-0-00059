FR940105-0-00059 FR940105-0-00011 By letter dated November 8, 1993 (Administrative Record No. AAML&hyph;24), the U.S. Bureau of Land Management responded with a recommendation that Arkansas be required to revise ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;401(c) so that it would read as follows: In determining which sites to reclaim pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, the Director shall follow the priorities stated in paragraphs (1) and (2) of 15&hyph;58&hyph;402. The Director shall ensure that priority is given to those sites which are in the immediate vicinity of a residential area or which have an adverse economic impact upon a community [once coal mining sites and toxic mining material sites on federal or state surface tracts have been reclaimed]. BLM proposed the addition of the bracketed language and stated that its intent was to protect the public interest as a whole, particularly in the Ouachita National Forest, prior to focusing in on individual communities. Referenced ``paragraph (b) of this section'' in ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;401, as revised by the amendment that is the subject of this notice, allows the reclamation under Arkansas' plan of certain surface coal mining operations that operated on or after August 7, 1977, and were abandoned or left in an inadequate reclamation status. Referenced ``paragraphs (1) and (2) of 15&hyph;58&hyph;402'' require that the expenditure of AML funds reflect the priorities of (1) the protection of public health, safety, general welfare, and property from extreme danger of adverse effects of coal mining practices and (2) the protection of public health, safety, and general welfare from adverse effects of coal mining practices. These State provisions are substantively identical to sections 403(a) (1) and (2) of SMCRA. ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;401(c) is substantively identical to section 402(g)(4)(C) of SMCRA. In addition, section 411 of SMCRA provides for the use of AML funds for lands affected by noncoal mining only after a State has certified that all abandoned coal mines have been reclaimed. Arkansas has not yet made this certification. OSM cannot, as requested by BLM, require that Arkansas give higher priority to the reclamation of coal mining sites and toxic mining material sites on federal or state surface tracts because sections 403(a), 402(g)(4)(C), and 411 of SMCRA do not do so. V. Director's Decision Based on the above finding, the Director approves Arkansas' proposed plan amendment, as submitted on October 6, 1993. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR part 904, codifying decisions concerning the Arkansas plan, are being amended to implement this decision. This final rule is being made effective immediately to expedite the State plan amendment process and to encourage States to bring their plans into conformity with the Federal standards without undue delay. Consistency of State and Federal standards is required by SMCRA. VI. Procedural Determinations 1. Executive Order 12866 This final rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review). 2. Executive Order 12778 The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice Reform) and has determined that this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section. However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State abandoned mine land reclamation plans and revisions thereof since each such plan is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Decisions on proposed State AML reclamation plans and revisions thereof submitted by a State are based on a determination of whether the submittal meets the requirements of Title IV of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1231&hyph;1243) and the applicable Federal regulations at 30 CFR parts 884 and 888. 3. National Environmental Policy Act No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since agency decisions on proposed State abandoned mine land reclamation plans and revisions thereof are categorically excluded from compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332) by the Manual of the Department of the Interior (516 DM 6, appendix 8, paragraph 8.4B(29)). 4. Paperwork Reduction Act This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507 et seq. ). 5. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ). The State submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon Federal regulations for which an economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements established by SMCRA or previously promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule would have a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions in the analyses for the corresponding Federal regulations.
