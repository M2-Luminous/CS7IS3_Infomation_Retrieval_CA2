For more than one year now, these employees have been awaiting the implementation of an arbitration ruling signed as the result of a situation similar to the one the judicial branch is now experiencing. According to Judiciary Council President (Beli Estaba), the executive was asked on Tuesday to review the situation and to approve the necessary credit immediately to comply with the ruling which has not yet been put into force because of a lack of funds. [Begin recording] [Estaba] We cannot blame this situation on this or that person. What we must do is resolve the problem. On 2 February, we requested the additional credit to comply with the terms of the arbitration ruling issued by the Velasquez administration. We have proof that Ocepre [Central Budget Office] received the request on 3 February at 0213. [Unidentified reporter] What happened? Have you received any information from the executive? [Estaba] We have not, although we have met with the minister of the Secretariat of the Presidency and the deputy minister of finance. We have not heard anything about this credit. [Reporter] [words indistinct] say the Judiciary Council magistrates have blocked granting other socioeconomic benefits that were included in last year's arbitration ruling? [Estaba] That is not true. We have complied with the ruling to the extent that our resources permit. [end recording] The representative of the court employees said the strike will stop only if their demands are accepted, including the exact date in which they will be paid the social benefits they have not yet received. [Begin recording of unidentified labor leader] The strike will end when the minimal conditions are met, as we just informed the Judiciary Council during the plenary meeting. Those conditions include: the immediate approval of the salary we are requesting, based on the proper implementation of the arbitration ruling; the exact date we will be paid; a general revision of the budget to request additional credit in line with the true needs of the arbitration ruling; approval of the income and overtime regulations; approval of the labor law privileges, which they are ignoring; reinstatement of dismissed employees; and acknowledgement of our rights to concessions. Clearly, these are minimal conditions, and had such rights not existed, we would not have had an arbitration ruling in our favor. We are prepared to negotiate the other points of disagreement--points which do exist--without a strike. [end recording] Court activities are paralyzed nationwide. Only a few penal courts are working in Caracas, such as the 26th Penal Court. Although it has not held hearings or conducted secretarial work, this court took the statements of those people indicted in the case of financial assistance funds, including (Jose Luis Rovenga) and (Luis Guanone), FIDEC [expansion unknown] president and board member, respectively.
