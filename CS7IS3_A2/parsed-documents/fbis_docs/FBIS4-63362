France was the only EU [European Union] country at a session of the EU Council on May 16 not to back the agreements reached by Russian Vice-Premier Aleksandr Shokhin and the EU Commission's Vice- Chairman Leon Brittan in Moscow on May 2, thereby putting the signing of the Agreement on Partnership and Cooperation between the EU and the Russian Federation in June or July this year under question. Shokhin and Brittan agreed that general trading standards would apply to uranium and other fissile substances, but with some exceptions. France objected to the formula, but was unable to provide any serious arguments to back its objections, offering only abstract fears that the European market could become inundated by Russian uranium some time in the future. The sides did manage to untie the knot in Moscow, Medvedkov said, agreeing on minor technical adjustments to the formula. Now, he said, practically all obstacles to the signing of the agreement between Russia and the EU in June or July had been removed, but he could not be absolutely certain until the draft agreement had been approved by the EU Council on June 13.
