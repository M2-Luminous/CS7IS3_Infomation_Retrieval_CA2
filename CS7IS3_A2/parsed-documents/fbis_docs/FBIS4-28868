He said: "China is not in favor of imposing sanctions because that is useless for the settlement of the problem. On the contrary, it would aggravate the escalation of the situation and lead to a serious consequence that all parties concerned do not want to see. "It is my view that persevering in dialogue and consultations is an effective and fundamental way to solve the problem". "We urge all parties concerned to exercise restraint and act with caution," he said, and added: "The goal for the settlement of the issue is finally to safeguard peace and stability on the Korean peninsula and realize denuclearization. "No matter what temporary difficulties may appear, it is possible to find a proper solution to this problem as long as these two major objectives are not departed from." Noting that the door for negotiation is not completely closed and that there still exist possibilities of holding dialogue, he urged all parties concerned to take positive measures so as to avoid acceleration of the crisis.
