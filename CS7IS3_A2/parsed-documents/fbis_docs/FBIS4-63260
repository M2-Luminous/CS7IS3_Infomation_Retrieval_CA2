During four years of work in the previous composition of the supreme soviet, Aleksandr Moroz was taking an active position in the parliament, had his own point of view on political, economic and legal problems of current life and upheld them quietly and with good reasoning, the president noted. "I do not remember a case when he offended someone in the heat of a debate or showed haste in making decisions. By having elected Aleksandr Moroz deputies hope that he will be able to unite all of them for constructive work," Leonid Kravchuk pointed out. "For me this is also a determining factor. We may have unlike and even quite different viewpoints on processes of social life but the main thing for us is Ukraine with its 52 million population. We will be guided by these considerations in the future," the Ukrainian president stressed. Leonid Kravchuk expressed the hope for fruitful cooperation with the new head of the parliament. "If a man has no vanity but has self-control, his own stand and appropriate culture, it is always possible to find common ground with him," the Ukrainian president noted.
