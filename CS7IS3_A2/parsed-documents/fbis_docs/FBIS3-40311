[w dwa ognie, referring to a children's popular ball game]. [Geremek] The geography has not changed--the Germans are still on one side, Russia is on the other. On the other hand, the geopolitical situation has changed considerably, and, regardless of the uneasiness that is the result of the developments of the past several months, one cannot forget the fact that Poland, for the first time, finds itself in a situation in which it does not have to fear outside aggression. This does not mean, however, that one should underestimate the dangers that are manifesting themselves in the East. Anarchy in the post-Soviet expanses is a threatening phenomenon. Equally threatening is the appearance of tendencies that indicate the resurgence of an imperial domination by Russia. I do not think, however, that Poland will find itself in the position of being the solitary sacrifice. [WPROST] In Bonn and Moscow, one hears talk lately of a so-called friendly axis between the two countries. A German-Russian accord over our heads, however, awakens certain uneasy historical associations. [Geremek] When [Foreign] Minister Kozyrev spoke on the subject of the German-Russian axis, his German colleague Minister Kinkel made no protest. This in itself is reason enough to feel apprehension. Poland should watch these talks with care. I do not hide the fact that these talks awaken apprehension in me as well, but it is necessary to contrast them with other statements of German public opinion. Such careful observation allows one to assume that the policy of building Russian-German relationships over the heads of other partners will not find support in the German political structure. Such a temptation exists, however--we recognize it from history and we know what the results were. Therefore, the guiding principle of Polish foreign policy should be the perception of a threat, counteracting it and, at the same time, maintaining a feeling of realism in the evaluation of an actual threat. [WPROST] In light of this, can we assure security for ourselves other than through seeking an alliance with NATO? [Geremek] The fundamental orientation of Polish foreign policy is determined by Poland's ties to the West. One cannot imagine that an eventual conflict that would engulf a nation of 40 million people in the center of Europe would be a regional conflict, capable of staying limited in scope. However, what is threatening is the fact that NATO has refused the acceptance of Poland. The West is repeating old mistakes and is giving in to political blackmail, in treating the problem of Russia as a priority problem to which everything else must be subordinated. [WPROST] Shouldn't one also detect this problem in Polish foreign policy? In the opinion of Jerzy Giedroyc, "a threat on the part of Russia was belittled by the governments of the so-called Third Republic, which proved unable to formulate an eastern policy." [Geremek] We achieved one basic thing in Poland's eastern policy: We freed ourselves from dependence on the Soviet Union, and we did not fall into dependency on Russia. I also view the withdrawal of Russian troops from Poland as a success of our Eastern policy. On the other hand, there is no doubt that Poland needs to find a friendly partner in Russia, and not a foe. But this is dependent on the development of democracy in Russia. Our support of the development of democracy in Russia is in the interest of Polish raison d'etat. [WPROST] Relationships with our other Eastern neighbors also leave much to be desired. [Geremek] Unfortunately, we have been unable to establish an active policy of a Polish presence in the East. It is necessary, however, to take into consideration that this is also due to the economic situation. If Poland were now able to sell its exports on credit in Eastern markets, we would have no problem with attaining these markets. The lack of the necessary financial sources means that Polish activity in this arena is limited. Treaties alone will not solve this problem. Poland should perform its role as a large state in this region of Europe, but it should not entertain a world-power fantasy. We must acquire political imagination, which we tend to lack from time to time. Poland is also active on behalf of the interests of the Visegrad Group, but successes here are less than we expected. [WPROST] Perhaps such initiatives no longer fulfill the hopes associated with them? [Geremek] I think that the Visegrad Group has a future. It is a reality inasmuch as a free-trade zone will emerge, in which all four countries are interested; there is also a mutual orientation to enter the European Union. I also place a lot of hope in Baltic cooperation; Poland should play a more active role in this arena than it has thus far. [WPROST] In the meantime, however, we find ourselves in a situation that is hardly optimistic. In vain we knock on the West's door, while we have nothing to offer to the East. [Geremek] I am categorically opposed to conclusions of hopelessness. I say this as a historian and not as a politician. It would be difficult to envision a political situation in which Poland's prospects would be better than they are at the present moment. There exists a real chance that Poland will enter into all of the agreements that integrate Europe, so that neither Germany nor Russia would be a threat to Poland. In glancing at the history of the last one thousand years, this is indeed an exceptional situation. At the moment, I do not believe that Poland, in case of an outside threat, could be left alone to deal with it. An international arrangement already exists in which aggression against Poland would result in allies coming to our defense. [WPROST] Similar confidences prevailed before the World War II.... [Geremek] At that time we found ourselves between two powers and both attacked us. I think that now one of them is so sick that it is in no condition to attack anyone, and the other one is not interested in doing so. Even so, I recognize both threats--both German economic hegemony and Russian imperialist policy. [WPROST] What will remain for us should decisions that are unfavorable to us be made at the January NATO summit in Brussels? [Geremek] One should talk less about NATO and not attach such central importance to it. I am convinced that Poland will enter NATO, or NATO will cease to exist. It is only a matter of time. We should not only concentrate our attention on the problem of NATO, but also aim to create conditions of cooperation in the framework of Europe and concern ourselves with various security systems. For the present, the only functioning security system on European terrain is NATO, and that is why we are interested in it. At any rate, the pact has to change its character; it must secure European stability. For the time being, it is not prepared to do so. Despite the wave of criticism aimed at Poland's foreign policy, Poland has never been so close to entering the alliance as it is now. The problem is not if Poland is to enter NATO, but when. [WPROST] Isn't this conviction merely a manifestation of "wishful thinking?" [Geremek] Attaining membership in NATO is not only a privilege but also carries with it the necessity of fulfilling certain conditions, such as, for example, the stabilization of democracy in the country, which broke away from communism in an unequivocal manner. A disordered country, without a program for systemic transformation, is a country that has no chance of entering NATO. Entry into NATO also means obligations, far-reaching economic and military obligations. Only after their fulfillment can we realistically think of participating in the pact. Poles are unable to forget their past; every "whirlwind" that appears in the East or in the West provokes feelings of a lack of security. For that reason, membership in NATO has become so important for us. More and more politicians from various NATO countries are supporting us in this effort. [WPROST] There are opinions in the West--not isolated opinions--that are apt to treat the left-wing electoral victory in Poland as a serious warning for NATO. [Geremek] I hope that these fears are not justified, but it is difficult to say that there are not grounds for them. The question remains whether the result of the September 1993 Polish elections should be viewed as a sign that the former political forces have returned to power or as testimony to the fact that Poland is sufficiently democratic that the opposition forces can come to power by means of an election. I favor the optimistic version: Poland will not return to communism and will remain a democratic country. I understand, however, the fears of Western public opinion. [WPROST] Many Polish politicians refrain from commenting on the "Zhirinovskiy phenomenon." In your opinion, can this be seen as an indication of political wisdom or, rather, overconfidence? [Geremek] I belong to that group of people that does not make light of Zhirinovskiy. I believe that those who reduce him to a mere element of political folklore, minimizing his significance, act foolishly. This is a phenomenon of great importance. After all, it is a problem not of the person but of policy. One can already see what kind of influence this policy exerts on the present political administration of Russia. We should show interest in this phenomenon, but we must not be guided by hysteria. The opinions now emerging in the West that the major goal is order in Russia and not the processes of democratic transformation are becoming dangerous. Poland's voice may have a certain influence in the manner of thinking about Russia. To date, however, it is not heard loudly enough. [WPROST] The Russian minister of foreign affairs recently claimed that Zhirinovskiy's election success reduces the chances of the Central European states entering NATO. [Geremek] I think Minister Kozyrev is mistaken in his diagnosis. The election results in Russia rather increase the chances of Poland's getting into NATO. Let us not fool ourselves, however. What Poland will be in the future does not depend on the North Atlantic Pact. The situation in Europe and the world is preparing various surprises for us, and one should look after one's own army and military potential. There is an old saying that if one does not spend money on one's own army, one spends money on a foreign army stationed on one's own soil. The success of Polish foreign policy depends on the success of its economy as well as on the competent assurances of its military potential. Poland was a leading country in the process of transformation and the elimination of communism. One cannot present a bill for this or expect gratitude. It is, however, a chance for Poland because Poland can play an active role in organizing the process of transformation in other countries. Visualizing different scenarios does not depend on how many tanks one has or on what kind of budget deficit one has. It depends on one's imagination. This can become the chance for Polish foreign policy.
