In both word and deed, the organization has demonstrated that it does not merely want to remain on the political scene, but also that it has a role to play. To be sure, this year there have also been such turbulent political developments on the North European continent that it is difficult to keep up as both observer and actor. The elections in the Baltics and Poland, the attempted coup and elections in Russia, the complicated process involved in concluding the Maastricht treaty, and the repeated postponement of the EEA [European Economic Area] agreement have dominated the political agenda and demanded great attention from the politicians and the press. The most important task of the Nordic Council for now is to serve as an arena for the strong forces that are seeking a uniform Nordic position toward the EC. A solid majority in the council, with the exception of the Norwegian opposition group, wants full membership for Finland, Sweden, and Norway. It is just as clear that the overwhelming majority would not like to see each country go its own way. As a result, simultaneous referendums in all three countries would be an absurdity or even a catastrophe and could increase the risk of a permanent rift among the Nordic countries, unless the combined results would be decisive for all three countries. That might be considered genuine Nordic solidarity, but it is not particularly realistic. What, then, has the Nordic Council accomplished this year? Because the prime ministers decided a year ago to take greater responsibility for promoting cooperation--a decision long called for by parliamentarians--we now have clearer priorities for the areas of cooperation that are to be on the agenda. The governments decided to concentrate on cultural issues, environmental cooperation, and trade policy. This is reflected in the Nordic Council's 1994 budget, which was adopted at the session in Mariehamn last fall. The prioritizing of cultural cooperation in the budget is both correct and important, but it must not allow us to overlook the other important aspects of Nordic cooperation today. Foreign policy issues have given the council new vitality, even though these issues have no impact on the budget. Environmental issues in and around the Nordic countries are of vital significance, as demonstrated by the Nordic Council's major international conference on the Arctic, held in Reykjavik last fall. The council has also taken the initiative with respect to the Sosnoviy Bor power plant in St. Petersburg. New initiatives will also be taken in these areas. At the Mariehamn session, the council held a broad debate over what we in the Nordic countries can do together to stimulate new growth, thereby creating new jobs and more faith in the future among individuals. The finance ministers will propose concrete measures well before the next session (this March in Stockholm). Then, in April, the council will bring together representatives of the governments, parliamentarians, researchers, and labor market representatives to continue this work. A successful campaign against unemployment is a prerequisite for maintaining confidence in our democratic and social systems and for stopping the racism that is beginning to develop in our countries. The Nordic Council became a pillar of support for the liberation of the Baltic nations at a very early stage. We have received grateful recognition of this from Baltic politicians. Now the three Baltic nations are developing a system of cooperation similar to that of the Nordic Council. The center of this cooperation is an advisory parliamentary assembly, the Baltic Assembly, but it has now been decided that the governments will be drawn into this organization, which will be given the name Baltic Council. The parallels to our own organization are striking. From the very beginning, we have had a cooperative agreement with the Baltic Assembly. I have personally participated in all three sessions held so far by the Baltic Assembly. There is reason to be impressed and happy over the way in which it is approaching its work. It is a victory for democracy. But there are still Russian troops in Estonia and Latvia, and the Nordic Council is strongly pressuring Russia to withdraw them quickly. The outcome of the elections in Russia merely emphasizes how important this is. Our involvement in northwestern Russia also increased during the past year. The environmental threat gives us particular cause to direct our attention at these areas, but we must also utilize the opportunity to stimulate a better and more coordinated development of trade. Of course, the main thrust of our non-Nordic activities is aimed at the EC and the EEA. The council is in contact with the European Parliament at many levels, forming a valuable compliment to the direct, bilateral contacts between countries. It is interesting, by the way, that in our contacts with politicians from other European organizations we have found that they are placing more and more emphasis on the significance the Nordic Council can and should have as an actor in Northern Europe and the Baltic region. These are relatively new signals that are a clear result of the regionalization and decentralization that we are seeing in the EC, for example. I believe that this application of the principle of geographic and functional proximity in European cooperation will become more prevalent in the months and years to come. In this case, it will become increasingly important to have an established forum for the exchange of political opinions on European issues that are related to the Nordic countries. We of the Nordic Council Presidium have taken up this challenge this year. Clearly, this "foreign policy" activity by the council cannot occur in a political vacuum. Obviously, it is guided by the main principles set forth by the Nordic governments and national assemblies, but it is also dependent on the changed international climate in Europe. In this connection, I would like to mention the situation that has arisen in Russia following the parliamentary elections. Although Boris Yeltsin still has executive power and expanded authority through the new Constitution, the political landscape of our powerful neighbor has changed. This affects us, as well. As German Count Lambsdorff so aptly put it, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy of the so-called Liberal Democratic Party is neither liberal nor democratic. He has ambitions and views that must give rise to reflection and caution in the West. The Iron Curtain is gone, but the uncertainty remains. We in the north must realize that close cooperation not only with one another, but with the rest of West Europe, is the key to future security in a changing Europe. While the situation in East Europe is as unstable as it unfortunately is, we must at least make sure we stabilize the factors we can control. EC membership is one such factor we can make use of if we want and dare to do so. If we miss this opportunity, then isolation and insecurity here in the north could increase considerably, particularly if Norway is the only Nordic country (apart from Iceland) left outside the EC. Nordic cooperation, particularly in the economic field, cannot be genuine cooperation because we are so similar. Quite simply, the Nordic nations do not compliment one another. This is also why there was no Nordec [as published]. Together, in the EC, we could be a significant factor that could complement and enrich the rest of Europe. This applies to the security, economic, and cultural spheres. My vision, which I share with many in the Nordic Council, is a strong Nordic region within Europe. As I have said so often before, albeit in another context, we must hang together, or we will hang separately. In conclusion, let me add that the Maastricht treaty states that regional councils shall exist within the framework of EC cooperation. Here in the Nordic region, we already have such a council: the Nordic Council. Consequently, the Nordic Council will not cease to exist if we join the EC. On the contrary, it will be a forum that can prosper in cooperation with other, similar councils within what has been called the "Europe of regions." Based on the examples mentioned here and as a general evaluation of the Nordic Council's work, I can state with satisfaction that Nordic cooperation is in a period of revitalization.
