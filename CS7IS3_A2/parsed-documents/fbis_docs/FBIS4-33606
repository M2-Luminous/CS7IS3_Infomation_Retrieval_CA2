A delegation of five specialists, headed by Ricardo Vicuna, will go to Washington tomorrow to begin the first technical analysis with experts from the U.S. Department of Commerce. For four or five days, they will discuss Chapter 11 of the NAFTA agreement regarding investments, the content of the agreements proposed by the United States, and the Chilean foreign investments system -- particularly Decree Law 600. [passage omitted] During yesterday's news conference, the ministers announced the names of the 21 permanent advisers and foreign consultants who will head the NAFTA negotiations. The following are the close advisers of Aninat who belong to the team: Andrea Butelmann, Jorge Kaufmann, Joaquin Vial, Maria E. Wagner, and Ricardo Vicuna, who heads the mission to Washington for technical consultations. Liselott Kana of the Foreign Investments Committee, Oscar Landerretche of the Economy Ministry, and Gloria Pena of the Central Bank are also members of the team. The foreign advisers are: Vittorio Corbo, Andres Velasco, Ricardo Katz, Felipe Larrain, Antonia Silva, Blas Tomic, Esteban Tomic, Jaime Undurraga, Augusto Aninat, Juan Gabriel Valdes, Lia Venezian, Josefina Vial, and Maximiliano Cox. As the various stages in the negotiations are reached, experts of the Foreign, Agriculture, and Labor Ministries and the secretary general of the Presidency will join the team. [passage omitted] Minister Aninat admitted having made a mistake when he estimated that a draft agreement regarding NAFTA or a bilateral agreement would be ready by late March 1995: "I would say it was an erroneous estimate, a bit tight, but you must admit one thing: All sectors started discussing the meaning of NAFTA and we believe, in our capacity as government, that it was necessary for all sectors to open their eyes and start to learn about such an important issue." Aninat refused to predict a date for a final agreement although he said he thought it would take less than the two and a half years it took Mexico, Canada, and the United States. [passage omitted]
