The heads of the two states made speeches at the dinner. The visit by the Finnish president to Russia soon after his election to the supreme state post confirms that our northwestern neighbor is making Russia a priority in its foreign policy, Boris Yeltsin said. We greatly appreciate this and highly value goodneighborly relations between our countries. He said that his conversation with Martti Ahtisaari showed the existence of a high degree of trust and mutual respect. "I am confident that in the future, we shall also be able to conduct a productive dialogue, especially where questions of security and urgent issues of Russian-Finnish cooperation are involved" he said. The Russian president paid special attention to the importance of trade and the economic partnership, saying that "as before, we attach primary importance to developing our relations with Finland in this sphere." "The situation seems most favorable for the interaction of business circles in the adjacent border regions of Russia and Finland," Boris Yeltsin said. "Modern forms of cooperation, such as production cooperation, compensation deals, and joint ventures have already been tested." He noted that "an important place in regional cooperation is occupied by cooperation in environmental protection. The serious ecological situation that is developing in the Baltic basin and on the Kola Peninsula requires constant, coordinated action." Our scientific, cultural, and humanitarian cooperation also has room for expansion. "In general, we have a lot to do, but we look to the future with optimism," Boris Yeltsin said, wishing the people of the friendly land of Suomi success and prosperity. "We certainly wish to preserve everything positive that has been achieved over the decades in our relations and make efforts toward the further development of our cooperation," Marrti Ahtisaari said. He noted that the Russo-Finnish bilateral agreements had been put together in such a way that they corresponded to the new situation that had arisen since the disintegration of the Soviet Union, when Russia took its place as Finland's eastern neighbor. Difficulties had arisen in economic cooperation between the two countries at that time, but events had taken an abrupt turn for the better last year, the Finnish president said. The agreements that had already been concluded and about which talks were still in progress would assist in the creation of stability in this development, he noted. The Finnish president noted the need to make every effort to further develop and strengthen international cooperation and disarmament, which promote world security. Finland will continue to make its contribution toward strengthening the structures of cooperation in Europe and settling conflicts that have deteriorated to the point of armed clashes, he assured his listeners. The head of the Finnish state voiced the hope that relations between Russia and the new independent Baltic states will soon become stable and good. The Finnish president expressed his sincere gratitude to the Russian president for the hospitality shown him in Moscow. He proposed a toast to good relations between Finland and Russia and to the happiness of the people of Russia.
