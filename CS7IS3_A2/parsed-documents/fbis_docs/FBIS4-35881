With this second indigenously built submarine, India has joined the list of countries that manufacture submarines. The first indigenously built submarine was handed over in February. India named the submarine Shankul. It was manufactured with German technical assistance. India currently has the largest navy in South Asia and the fifth largest in the world. India also possesses Russian-made submarines that can launch nuclear weapons. With the exception of China, there is no other country in this part of the world that can match India's military might. India does not face a military threat from Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, or any other country, but it is constantly increasing its war preparedness as well as the power of its air, sea, and ground forces. The objective of this military buildup is nothing short of asserting regional hegemony, keeping the small countries under pressure, and maintaining an aggressive military occupation in Kashmir. Because Pakistan lends moral, political, and diplomatic support to the Kashmiri demand for the right to self-determination, India has directed the bulk of its might against Pakistan. According to press reports, India has dispatched its 3rd Tank Division, which has expertise in desert warfare, to the desert regions of Rajasthan to conduct military exercises in the acute heat near the border with Pakistan's Sindh Province. Two corps of Indian troops are already deployed on the Indian side of the Sindh border, and the deployment of the (?3rd) Tank Division tremendously enhances India's military strength in the area. This is a matter of great concern for Pakistan. There is another report that along with assembling a mechanized division, India has commenced work on installing Prithvi missiles in the area. About 100 Prithvi missiles are expected to be installed in the area. Defense analysts have expressed apprehensions that a frenzy toward a "decisive war" with Pakistan is gaining intensity in India. General B.C. Joshi, chief of the Indian armed forces, is regarded as a supporter of a decisive war with Pakistan. India can launch a drive against Pakistan to divert the attention of its people as well as the world from the conditions it faces in occupied Kashmir.
