"The absence of an ambassador (from Washington in San Jose) troubles us," but "we are going to work very closely (with the Clinton administration)" to solve the problems that have developed in the relations between both countries, Naranjo said during a news conference, which President-elect Jose Maria Figueres also attended. Naranjo, who will take charge of the Foreign Ministry on 8 May when the new government assumes control, admitted a number of conflicts "unnecessarily" cooled relations between both countries during the administration of Social Christian President Rafael Angel Calderon, which is about to conclude. Washington recently threatened to block several loans to Costa Rica, because the Costa Rican Government has not compensated a group of U.S. citizens whose lands were expropriated, and this triggered a harsh confrontation between U.S. and Costa Rican authorities. The United States had also previously threatened to suspend Costa Rica's preferential custom tariffs, because the influential U.S. union AFL-CIO presented charges of union persecution against the Costa Rican Government. Naranjo said the next administration will frankly broach the issues that have tarnished relations with the United States and expect the vacant position at Washington's embassy in San Jose, vacant for more than a year, to be filled in the coming months. The designated foreign minister accompanied Figueres on a tour to Mexico, the United States, and Canada last week. During their trip, the Costa Rican officials met with top officials of those governments and with the hierarchy of international financial organizations.
