(Tirana ATA in English 1000 GMT 30 Apr 94) FARMERS BUY MACHINES: Farmers in the Has district, a mountainous area in northeast Albania, bought 145 mechanized agricultural implements last year. This was made possible by loans provided by the state to this area, which is one of the poorest in the country. Among various types of machinery, we can mention 50 belarus tractors and cultivators. Has was previously part of the Kukes district, but with the new administrative realignments carried out two years ago, Has became a separate district. Despite great difficulties during the transition period, particularly those related to the distribution of land to private farmers, agricultural production has increased due to the hard work of the farmers and the credits made available by the state. (Tirana ATA in English 1004 GMT 30 Apr 94) EXPORTS INCREASE: According to data from the Statistics Institute, Albanian exports reached an amount of 28,208,000 leks in the first quarter of 1994. During the same period last year, exports were only worth 1,469,000 leks. Among the principal commodities exported were minerals such as ferro-chromium, copper, and items manufactured using aluminum and chromium. A large number of medical herbs was also exported. Some commodities, such as oranges, lemons, fish, cognac, and kerosene, are both exported and imported. Reports from the Statistical Institute confirm that exports to Italy make up 67.9 percent of the total, those to the United States 8.56 percent, and those to Greece 7.19 percent.

(Tirana ATA in English 1006 GMT 30 Apr 94) BUILDING SITES BOUGHT: In a recent article, the LAJMI I DITES newspaper considered the activity of companies acquiring construction sites directly from private owners to be an encouraging economic indicator. Data on state properties and those whose ownership needs to be juridically determined are still missing. With title deeds of so much land still uncertain, construction firms are hard pressed to find economically viable projects. A number of real estate companies have been opened in Tirana to assist investors in finding sites to establish their businesses. The companies assist with sales, purchases, and rentals of real estate. (Tirana ATA in English 1201 GMT 30 Apr 94) ASSISTANCE FOR MEDICAL SERVICE: The Dorkas Association, which has been working in Korce district for two and a half years, hopes to assist 185 medical centers in Korce, Pogradec, Kolonje, and Devoll through its project.

(Tirana ATA in English 1022 GMT 2 May 94) BANK'S OPERATIONS: The Fier Commerce Bank last year provided credits to buy 170 autotractors of different types, without including here the agriculture machinery that was provided by the Aggro Commerce Bank.

(Tirana ATA in English 1004 GMT 3 May 94) PRIVATIZATION IN KUKES: Out of 120 trade units, only 46 so far are considered to be privatized in Kukes district. The units, which are not privatized yet, have been forcibly occupied by the former land owners, who are using them without being registered in the tax office. The storehouses of the state trade enterprise, worth 1.1 million leks, are not yet privatized, although all the necessary documents are ready. No one dares to buy them because they fear a possible conflict with the former land owners.

(Tirana ATA in English 1012 GMT 3 May 94) TRADE UNITS INCREASE: Data from the Statistical Institute shows that in December 1993, Tirana had 15,000 trade units, compared to 900 in 1992 and 400 trade units and 230 instant trade services in 1991.

(Tirana ATA in English 1012 GMT 10 May 94) PLANT TO CLOSE: The Agency for the Restructuring of Enterprises is going to initiate procedures to close down the Nickel-Cobalt Plant in Elbasan. Albanian and World Bank specialists have reached the conclusion that the plant is inefficient, with no possibility of being restructured in the future. In its 4 May meeting, the government granted permission to start the procedures. The Nickel- Cobalt Plant, known as the 12th plant of the Steelworks Combine in Elbasan, has continuously been inefficient and has had many problems since its inauguration in 1979, which was clamorously appraised by the propaganda of the time. Specialists say that its technological byproducts have always been dangerous for the workers' health and that its products were of low quality. The state has made annual investments in the plant ranging from 20-70 million leks. The plant interrupted its production only at the end of 1990 when the state did not subsidize it and when its efficiency faced the market economy. A negative consequence of the plant's work has been the environmental pollution caused by failures in the dust purification system and the leakage of poisonous liquids and gas. The smog created by the plant polluted the environment of Elbasan city and the Shkumbini River, which sometimes pushed the polluted water above the set norms. A group of Chinese specialists offered to help rebuild the plant, but an agreement was not reached because of its non-profitable nature. (Tirana ATA in English 1022 GMT 10 May 94) TELECOM AFFILIATE RESTRUCTURING: Sokol Zotaj, acting director of the Tirana Telecom affiliate, told ATA that the restructuring of the Telecom affiliate in Tirana will consist in purchasing and operating computers, computerizing the process of preparing the bills, and changing the practice of sending invoices to telephone subscribers from the telephone paying offices to their homes. The new organization is expected to be able to solve the conflicts created between the Tirana affiliate and telephone subscribers, which have sometimes been sent to court. Subscribers do not pay their bills because they say the number of impulses has been manipulated. There are two alternatives that cannot be sorted out until everything is computerized, as there is a possibility of tapping onto others' telephone lines or irregularities in defining the number of impulses by Telecom. (Tirana ATA in English 1027 GMT 10 May 94) BANK DEPOSITS: Artan Santo, deputy general director of the Savings Bank, told ATA that deposits by Albanians amount to 13 billion leks since 1991. In 1991, deposits were 3.4 billion leks, while in 1992 they amounted to 5.6 billion leks. Although interest rates have been reduced from 33 to 24 percent, the number of depositors has been on the rise. Their number has now reached 600,000 people. In order to create facilities for depositing money, the Savings Bank plans to open 10 service centers in June. Installed mainly at customs points in Albania, the centers will also exchange other currencies. (Tirana ATA in English 1207 GMT 10 May 94) TELECOM PLAN: Sokol Zotaj, director of the Tirana affiliate of Telecom, states that "Telecom is now getting down to business." Zotaj pointed out that by installing new phone numbers, priority will be attached to businessmen, officials, sick people, and former political persecutees. Based on a master plan that was prepared in early 1993, it is expected that there will be 12,000 phone numbers in 1996 and 33,000 in 2002. A commission with representatives from the Tirana affiliate and the Tirana municipality has been established because the affiliate is not able to meet all the citizens' demands for phone numbers. (Tirana ATA in English 1010 GMT 11 May 94) LICENSES: According to the General Department of Minerals, very few companies so far have requested a license to use mineral resources. Meanwhile, there are several construction companies which, together with Italian partners, have set up equipment for producing inert materials. The law that was approved two months ago regards these materials as mineral resources, so those who do not have a license are obliged to pay a fine that varies from $3,500- 350,000 in conformity with the law. The construction companies have claimed that they are still "in the phase of preparing documents." (Tirana ATA in English 1012 GMT 11 May) AIRLINE PLANS START: Arberia Airways, an airline company founded in December 1992, based in Tirana, and with an initial capital worth $1.5 million, is now ready to start flights from Tirana to Zurich, Geneva, Brussels, Hamburg, Dusseldorf, and Skopje, RILINDJA writes, citing a statement by Selaudin Sinani, the company's director. Some 40 tourist agencies that operate in Albania signed contracts for cooperation with Arberia Airways at the Makedonia Hotel in Tetova, having at the same time the opportunity to buy shares in the company. Another meeting to sign contracts was held in Germany and Switzerland one week ago, in which the participants agreed to cooperate.

(Tirana ATA in English 1030 GMT 13 May 94) PLANT CLOSES: The Albanian Government recently authorized the Agency for Restructuring of Enterprises to close down the Soda Plant in Vlore. Its production was suspended three years ago due to a serious situation in the plant. The studies by the World Bank and the Institute of Studies and Projects of Chemical Technology in Tirana confirm that the plant has turned out to be ineffective and with no possibility for restructuring. During the last three years, the plant has recorded losses amounting to millions of leks. The Soda Plant was built in 1967 and its technology is Chinese. The plant was becoming a source of pollution for the environment of the Vlore coastal area, which is ranked as one of the best tourist locations in Albania.

Construction, trade, and agriculture will be granted increase, too. The education budget for the whole district will be 22 times higher compared to a year ago. The rise will mean an increase in teachers' salaries. At the same time, the expenses for the medical service will be 45 times higher compared to last year. The council has set up another fund for the cultural sector, amounting to 870,000 leks. The funds for the Construction Ministry will be mainly used for cleaning, greening, maintenance of roads, drainage, and public fountains. The council has also foreseen a rise in funds for fisheries. (Tirana ATA in English 1010 GMT 14 May 94) LICENSES FOR COMMERCIAL BANKS: The leading board of the Albanian National Bank approved new procedures to issue licenses to open commercial banks, which will include private banks with local and foreign capital, joint capital, and shareholding banks. The package of new regulations, which has been compiled by Albanian bankers in cooperation with foreign experts, complies with the key monetary principles in the present banking world. One of the fundamental requests for issuing the license is the existence of an initial minimum capital of $500,000. Also required for the license is the governing capability of bank initiators -- so that at least one of its main leaders has long-term banking experience and a good reputation -- as well as the introduction of a reliable business plan. (Tirana ATA in English 1030 GMT 14 May 94) SHKODER AQUEDUCT: From this year's budget, the government has allocated $127,000 to restructure the Shkoder aqueduct. That will considerably improve the situation in the existing network of aqueducts so as to ensure greater supplies of drinking water to Shkoder inhabitants.

Albanian Radio-Television cited the foundation managers as saying that the creation of the agricultural equipment base has a human character because, with the tractors, the farmers will carry out agricultural services at lower tariffs than those carried out by private tractor drivers. They also said that during September, the Albiran Foundation will invest another $1 million to improve the irrigation system in the Vore region, near Tirana. They will establish an agricultural repair shop and training center.

Out of four foreign companies, the Albkrom Corporation chose the German group BSE to continue final negotiations for the establishment of a joint venture. The selection was based on a cooperation platform, the estimation of Albkrom resources, and the investments the German group offered.
