[Walesa] No, I think that my actions have yielded some results because I think the outcome could have been even worse. However, I want to say that in my opinion we could have achieved more. In my opinion we could have gone further, but the great powers of this world have decided otherwise and we have to conform to this. [Miecugow] Do you mean that although more could have been achieved, the current situation is no fault of ours? [Walesa] There is no fault on our part, because this was beyond our reach. I did all I could to make this step somewhat longer. As a practicing politician, I believe that European geography should be changed, that European direction and development should be prejudged now, that uncertainties should be confronted with visions and concepts. This would be a better way of dealing with things. Why bet on the unknown? If European geography expands, it would become clear that a zone of uncertainty is becoming smaller. But as I have said -- this was not to be. We will have to do much more. We will have to work more, and we will reach the same objective but much more slowly, not by leaps but by crawling. [Miecugow] Have you got a plan for further actions? How do you want to lead Poland to NATO? [Walesa] I think that after what I and we have done, the pressure by nations will be greater. I believe that at the same time we will have to go back to the past and speak about international agreements, that they have their consequences. We did not do this after the year 1939 and this is bad because you forget about these things today. You tend to remember our agreements, even the financial ones. Some even have grievances against us, saying that we are not a solid partner. But I want to say that those partners were not honest toward us; we also counted on a different course of events in 1939, but agreements were broken, commitments were not met, and these are just consequences. You have to talk about this, because on an international scale greater morality is required as far as all these commitments are concerned. If we fail to do this, then there will continue to exist temptations to break or to depart from great agreements. [passage omitted]
