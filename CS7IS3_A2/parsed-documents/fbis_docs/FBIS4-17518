For a long time this problem remained overshadowed by the real nuclear threats to the world posed by the superpowers. But now that a relative lull has ensued in the years-long arms race between the United States and the USSR, readers have been swamped by a wave of information about North Korea's hush-hush nuclear program from the pages of many countries' respectable publications. Grandfather Kim Il-song, whose "chuche" ideas elicited only a wry smile, was instantly transformed by journalists' pens into a maniac capable of pressing the nuclear button at any moment. The current surge of interest, mixed with fear, in North Korea's nuclear affairs has also been occasioned by the proximity of this "preserve of socialism" to Japan, the only country to have experienced the nightmare of nuclear bombing raids. Recently all the arguments have boiled down to one question -- does Kim Il-song have a bomb, with whose help he could smash to smithereens a very strong mainstay of the world economy? [passage omitted] Hand of Moscow An unprecedented scandal, connected with the improvement of missiles and of the DPRK nuclear program as a whole, erupted in October 1992. Security Ministry staffers detained 36 Russian scientists at Sheremetyevo-2 Airport. They had been intending to fly to Pyongyang along with their families. It later came to light that prominent representatives of the Russian military-industrial complex had wanted to get jobs in the DPRK and had already drawn up contracts: Professor Arkadiy Bakhmutov, specialist in rocket engine building and winner of the Komsomol [All-Union Lenin Communist Youth League] Prize; Doctor of Sciences Valeriy Strakhov, department head at the Scientific Research Institute of Special Machine Building in Bochkovo; Yuriy Bessarabov, one of the creators of the Zyb rocket and a Komsomol Prize winner; and other specialists in the sphere of rocket building. The organizer of this work landing force on the Russian side was Anatoliy Rubtsov, a specialist in the sphere of solid state physics well known in the circles of scientists working for the military-industrial complex. The organizer on the DPRK side was Major General Nam Chae-uk, who was declared persona non grata by the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Security. Anatoliy Rubtsov told journalists that a plan had existed to send 200 Russian scientists to the DPRK to create the scientific base of North Korean rocket building. "I did not initiate it," Rubtsov maintained. "In August 1992 Stepanov, chief of the Russian Federation Industry Ministry Machine Building Administration, visited North Korea and signed a general agreement in this regard. It was proposed that I form a group. But South Korea promised Russia aid of $1 billion, and the Russian Government abruptly changed the state policy and agreed to restrictions in relations with the DPRK." At the same time Rubtsov said that the North Koreans had "approached" him back in April 1991, when he was lecturing in Beijing: "I was made a suitable offer of permanent work, and I accepted it. I was elected a member of the North Korean Academy of Sciences and appointed director of a scientific research institute. My younger sister passed dollars to someone at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and in exchange obtained from the First Consular Section clean passports for 200 people to travel abroad. The money had been passed to me by a representative of the North Korean Embassy in Moscow, and my receipt was sent to Pyongyang." Almost all the scientists detained at Sheremetyevo-2 told journalists the same thing: "It is all the same to us for which political purposes our knowledge might be used; we only wanted to carry on doing our favorite thing." According to data in some respectable publications, more than 20 Russian scientists nonetheless managed to get work in the DPRK (mainly through China). They live there under aliases, make $3,000-4,000 a month, and want for nothing. According to press allegations, however, some of our scientists no longer need to risk and negotiate border checkpoints in order to work on the North Korean nuclear program. They sit at home and send their calculations to Pyongyang by computer mail, which it is not yet possible to monitor. Patriot Games Strange though it may seem, the noisy and protracted scandal surrounding North Korea's nuclear program is advantageous to almost all the political forces involved in it. Kim Il-song, by ambiguously denying the existence of the bomb and not admitting International Atomic Energy Agency experts to certain nuclear installations, is attracting universal attention to his rotten regime and probably hoping in the future to secure some financial injections for the paralyzed economy. Russia is getting a strong argument in its dialogue with Japan over the transfer of the northern territories: Forget about the Kurils for the time that it takes to neutralize all our scientists, without whom the DPRK nuclear program will simply collapse. Incidentally, Russia, which is still lagging behind the grand international politics of the United States, is in the worst position in this game -- there is a great risk of losing for a very long time its former influence in this region, as well as any hope of recovering the multibillion [currency not specified] debt from the DPRK. China, remaining neutral in respect of Pyongyang's semimythical nuclear threat, awaits an easing of the U.S. economic sanctions. The Japanese military is acquiring authority and influence in its own state, increasingly insistently demanding that the government increase defense appropriations. Finally, the United States and NATO, successfully prompting Japan to create -- with their participation, naturally -- a costly ABM "umbrella," are cherishing the hope of securing not only military orders worth billions [currency not specified] but also access to unique Japanese technologies, which, as a result, will enable the Americans to weaken their main economic rival. Seoul with its 10 million residents, keeping calm, as usual, when targeted by North Korea's 8,400 howitzers and 2,400 missile launchers, is more concerned about rice prices at present. All this resembles a cynically conceived conspiracy, in which all are at one, but the leading role is, of course, played by the United States. Only it is of very great concern that in such games the situation frequently gets out of control.
