FR940525-2-00114 FR940525-2-00064 Shutdown Risk The changes proposed to Technical Specifications 3.1.1.3, 3.1.2.1, 3.1.2.3, 3.5.3, 4.1.1.3, 4.1.2.3, 4.5.3.2 and 4.9.8.1 have been optimized to take into account shutdown risk concerns. Lower shutdown cooling flow rates are allowed to minimize the potential of a loss of shutdown cooling due to vortexing during RCS mid-loop operation. The availability of injection sources in the shutdown modes have been optimized while still meeting the cold overpressurization requirements. To address shutdown risk issues, the method to secure an inoperable HPSI pump has been modified. Previously, disconnecting the motor circuit breaker from its electrical power circuit was the only acceptable method of isolating this pump. Additional methods of isolating the pump have been added with the key locking of a discharge valve downstream of the HPSI pump and the tagging the valve. These actions from the control room will allow the operator the ability to quickly restore water flow and reduce the risk associated with having equipment out of service while shutdown. Inadvertent actuation is prevented by requiring the operator to obtain the key to open this discharge valve from the shift supervisor. The opening of this valve would, therefore, require the actions of two knowledgeable individuals, the operator, and the shift supervisor. The limitation on the amount of pumps available is as a direct result of LTOP concerns. This provides assurance that the LTOP requirements are met while maintaining the maximum available equipment to mitigate shutdown risk concerns. 2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed. The proposed changes to Technical Specifications 3.1.1.3, 3.1.2.1, 3.1.2.2, 3.1.2.4, 3.1.2.8, 3.4.1.4, 3.4.2.1, 3.4.9.1, 4.1.1.3, 4.1.2.4, and 4.9.8.1 do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed. The proposed changes provide clarification or additional restrictions for plant personnel concerning the operation of charging pumps, HPSI pumps, PORVs, blocking valves, and the SDC, boron dilution, and LTOP systems. The proposed technical specification changes do not introduce significant changes in the manner in which the plant is being operated. Therefore, no new failure modes are being introduced, and the potential for an unanalyzed accident is not created. The proposed changes to Technical Specifications 3.4.3 do not create the possibility of an accident of a different type than previously evaluated, since there is no change to the design of the plant. In addition, plant operations are only being altered enough to allow a block valve and PORV to be placed in conditions which allow them to better perform their safety functions. The proposed changes to Technical Specification 3.4.9.3 do not create the possibility of an accident of a different type than previously evaluated, since there is no change to the design of the plant and the way the plant is operated. The proposed changes to Technical Specification 3.1.2.3 and 3.5.3 allow for the isolation of an inoperable HPSI pump by the key lock closing of a valve at the discharge of the HPSI pump and the safety tagging in the closed position. This isolation is required so that a LTOP condition does not occur. This method of isolation is required so that a LTOP condition does not occur. This method of isolation is acceptable and will not create a new or different kind of accident since it is not possible to inadvertently open this valve. A deliberate action is required by the operator, with the concurrence of the shift supervisor, to obtain the key and open the valve. 3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The proposed changes will not have an adverse impact on the protection boundaries. With regard to the GL 90&hyph;06 modifications, there is no degradation in the operability and surveillance requirements for the PORVs and block valves and the LTOP systems. There will be no change in actual practice for, or resulting performance of, these systems. All other changes are proposed mainly to clarify each requirement. For Modes 1, 2, and 3, safety-related overpressure protection is provided by the pressurizer code safety relief valves. Therefore, there will be no adverse impact on the margin of safety as defined in the bases of any technical specification. Although any two charging pumps are allowed to be operable in a shutdown condition, the flow of these pumps is consistent with the assumptions of the boron dilution analysis. Additional pumping capability is being provided to address shutdown risk concerns, however, the limitation on pumping is tied to the vent path that is available. This will ensure that the margin of safety is not impacted. The combined effects of reducing SDC flow, tagging out a charging pump, and increasing shutdown margin is that the required operator response times of 15 minutes in Modes 4 and 5, and 30 minutes in Mode 6 are maintained. By reducing the allowed SDC flow rate to less than that where vortexing can occur, the potential for a loss of SDC event is being reduced. Therefore, there is no decrease in the margin of safety for the boron dilution and shutdown cooling events. The proposed changes associated with the cold overpressure mitigation system will ensure the appropriate margin of safety is maintained by limiting RCP operation in Mode 5 and limit RCS cooldown rates. These actions will ensure an LTOP condition does not occur. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Pennsylvania Power and Light Company, Docket Nos. 50&hyph;387 and 50&hyph;388 Susquehanna Steam Electric Station, Units 1 and 2, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania Date of amendment request: April 5, 1994. Description of amendment request: This amendment will delete the frequency requirements for a number of audits listed under Technical Specification (TS) 6.5.2.8 for each unit. The proposed change also includes removing the audit requirements for the Emergency Plan and the Security Plan from the TS and relocating these requirements to each of the respective plans. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: I. This proposal does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The proposed Technical Specification changes to delete prescribed audit frequencies and remove the Emergency Plan and Security Plan from Technical Specifications are administrative in nature and neither directly increase or decrease the likelihood that an accident will occur. The Technical Specification changes will not impact the function or method of operation of plant systems, structures, or components. Thus, the consequences of a malfunction of equipment important to safety previously evaluated in the FSAR is not increased by the changes. Therefore, it is concluded that the proposed changes do not increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. II. This proposal does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident or from any accident previously evaluated.
