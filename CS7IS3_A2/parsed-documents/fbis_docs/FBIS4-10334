The elections also show the resounding fall of the Radicals [Radical Civic Union -- UCR], the consolidation of MODIN [Movement for Independence and Dignity], and the notable growth of the center-left coalition Grand Front, which won in the Federal Capital and in Neuquen Province. The Peronists have thus been able to maintain their supremacy, although they were not able to obtain a majority of members in the Constituent Assembly in order to guarantee, without any ups or downs, the reform that was agreed upon in the Olivos Pact. They must now seek alliances with other parties. For the anti-pact forces the election results proved to be much better than estimated, with the absolute victory of Carlos "Chacho" Alvares (Grand Front) in the federal capital, the victory of the Liberal Autonomist Pact in Corrientes Province, the excellent showing of the Popular Jujeno Movement in Jujuy Province, the Democratic Party in Mendoza Province, and the Grand Front's win in Neuquen Province, where it obtained a surprise victory with the candidacy of Bishop Emeritus Jaime de Nevares. According to observers, the biggest winners in the elections were Buenos Aires Governor Eduardo Duhalde and Cordoba Governor Eduardo Angeloz, who raised their stature with ample victories over their rivals. In Angeloz' case the winner was his protege, Ramon Mestre. Duhalde is now placed in a strategic political position, and Angeloz seems to have consolidated his aspirations to be the UCR candidate in 1995. The victories of Ruben Marin in La Pampa Province, Carlos Reutemann in Santa Fe Province, Radical Horacio Massaccesi (Rio Negro Province), and Radical Carlos Maestro (Chubut Province) must also be highlighted. The victory of General Antonio Domingo Bussi, retired, over Governor Ramon "Palito" Ortega in Tucuman also came as a surprise. This time around information on the results of the elections ran into a lot of problems, and official figures only began to come in during the evening, although many of the candidates acknowledged their defeats through the exit polls. According to the most recent data the Justicialist Party lost some 5 percent when compared with the October 1993 elections, and the UCR lost 10 percent, while the MODIN preserved its third place at the national level. In Buenos Aires Province the UCR suffered the worst results of its history, and its fall in the federal capital was catastrophic, as it came in third place with 15 percent of the votes.
