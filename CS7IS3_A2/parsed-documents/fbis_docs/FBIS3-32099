The stores selling luxury goods, located mainly in the area between Bonne Foi and Pavee Streets, adhered to the strike, whereas most of the stores specializing in the sale of electronic parts, fabrics, and shoes conducted business as usual. For the informal businesses and open-air marketplaces too, it was business as usual; the grocery stores and banks, which adhered to the spirit of the movement, respected the new work schedule that had been set. One of the nation's principal employers associations, the Haitian Manufacturers Association, ADIH, publicly dissociated itself from the Haitian Chamber of Commerce and Industry's movement, explaining that the movement did not have precise objectives -- or alternatives in case of failure. In Les Cayes, Haiti's third biggest city, stores conducted business as usual. A Les Cayes businessman told the HAITI PRESS AGENCY that he was not at all involved in the events that led to the imposition of the strike.
