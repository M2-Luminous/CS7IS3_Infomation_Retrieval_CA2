The new minister should perceive the problems of such an important ministry as a whole, Klaus added. Pilip, 30, was appointed to the post on May 2, replacing Petr Pitha who resigned on April 27 for health reasons. Both of them are members of the coalition Christian Democratic Party (KDS, 10 deputies in the 200-member Czech Parliament). Pilip has been the party's chairman since December 1993. The problems of education should be taken into account in the drafting of a law on powers of higher administrative units, Klaus said. The relevant document, which will devolve powers in the educational area from the center to the regions, will be compiled by the end of May, he reported. During the ceremony, a letter from Pitha sharing his experience with the ministerial work was read.
