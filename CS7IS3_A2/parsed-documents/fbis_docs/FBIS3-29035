Japan's tax rate for direct tax is still low. The main point of tax system reform should be placed on increasing the rate of income tax which is captured, which up till now was merely a dream. What we need for that purpose is introduction of a system of taxpayer ID numbers. Japan's Income Tax Rates Are Still Low In the tax system debate that is currently going on, it is taken as a premise that increasing the consumption tax is obvious as a long-term reform of the tax system. What has been used as grounds for this is the concept "correcting the direct-indirect ratio." The direct-indirect ratio is low in developing countries and highest in the most advanced countries, such as Japan and the United States. This means they seek to lower Japan's direct-indirect ratio to a level equal to that of Europe, which is in the middle. Everyone thinks that if there is no margin for raising income tax above what it is now, an increase in the consumption tax may be unavoidable. But what is helpful in judging whether the rate of income tax is too high is not the direct-indirect ratio; it is international comparison of the income tax rate, itself. Let us assume that Japan's rate of income tax is the highest from the viewpoint of international comparison. Even in such a case, it would not mean that the view that there is no margin for raising the income tax rate higher than this would have great persuasive force, but it would at least be necessary to listen attentively to that view. Conversely, if Japan's income tax rate is low compared with foreign countries, one could say that, from the viewpoint of international comparison there is margin for raising it, however high the direct-indirect ratio might be. The graph [not reproduced] shows the ratio of personal income tax to GDP [gross domestic product] for the advanced countries of the OECD. As is clear from the graph, Japan's tax rate is strikingly low. It is second from the bottom after France. Japan's tax rate is 7.6 percent; Denmark's is 26 percent. Consequently, Japan's income tax rate is still very low, so there is margin for raising it greatly in the future. The doubt may arise that, although this is the case on average, Japan's income tax rate for workers is high when their income exceeds 10 million yen. But, in contrast to Japan's effective tax rate of 14 percent on income of 10 million yen, it is 23 percent in the United States, and in England it is about 27 percent. Actually, compared with the United States, Japan's tax rate for incomes of 19 million yen and below is lower (calculated at a rate of 107 yen to the dollar). Compared with England, Japan's effective tax rate is lower on incomes up to about 25 million yen. Japan's income tax rate is this low even when compared with the United States and England, where flattening out of income tax by Reagan and Thatcher was carried out. When debating whether Japan's income tax rate can be raised above this, let us decide soon to stop fraudulently substituting the direct-indirect ratio for the problem, and grasp the fact that the income tax that we are paying is uncommonly low. Progressive Income Tax Is an "Insurance System" The object of taxes is not just to pay for government finances. The income-redistribution function is also important. People are getting different incomes based on effort, talentm and luck. Many people are making a living by their own efforts, but their incomes differ greatly depending on talent and luck. If we compare persons, now 50 years old, who are employed in steel companies with those employed in banks, the salary of one is probably about twice that of the other. About 30 years ago, when they got their jobs, the dynamic persons who were the cream of the cream joined the steel company. Nevertheless, now their incomes amount to only one-half that of the bank employees, whose only merit is steadiness. In this way, people's lifetime incomes end up differing greatly because of the success or failure of the industry in which they happened to obtain employment. Even within the same industry, for instance even in the case of newspaper companies, one hears that there are some examples in which salaries differ by 100 percent depending on a company's good or bad luck. An important role performed by a progressive income tax is that, in such a case, fortunate persons, who happened to obtain employment in an industry or company that continues to expand, share part of their good fortune with persons whose luck was bad. Furthermore, of course, such persons as author Jiro Akagawa, baseball's Hiromitsu Ochiai and Joji Tokoro strive hard, but they are getting high incomes more because they happened to be born overflowing with talent. It is also thanks to the progressive income tax that persons who were born blessed with talent pay part of their high incomes as tax, so that it is possible to lower by that much the tax rate of us ordinary people, who are working hard night and day but are not blessed with talent. We do not know what kind of talent and luck our children and grandchildren will have at birth. We can consider that the progressive income tax by which they are forced to pay high tax when everything goes well and they are born with talent, and they gain employment in a fortunate company and have reached the point of being able to have an affluent life, is insurance for a time when things did not go well. There are all sorts of risks in living in a liberal society. However astute one may be, there is a limit to judging the future of one's own company or industry. One can consider a progressive income tax to be an insurance system for that purpose. Opponents of a System of Taxpayer ID Numbers Japan's income tax rate is uncommonly low compared with all countries. Why did the authorities decide, nevertheless, that, unlike foreign countries, Japan alone must be satisfied with a low income tax rate? Furthermore, what was the occasion which decided the course of raising the rate on the consumption tax, which does not have the function of income redistribution, and lowering the income tax rate? It was when the green card system collapsed. After that, the Ministry of Finance quickly revised the orbit, the direction of which, up till now, had been the taxing of assets, and shifted its positon to a policy of seriously carrying out introduction of a large indirect tax, which ultimately came to fruition as the consumption tax. There is much which escapes taxation with the income tax, and it has reached a situation in which government throws up its hands in defeat, and because of the failure of the green card system it was probably judged to be politically impossible to correct this situation. It worked out that if they could not correct the escape of taxes which should be obtained, they would introduce a consumption tax which everyone would pay without escape. There are two types of escape from taxation. The first is escape in asset income tax and asset tax. The system of taxpayer ID numbers which is employed in such places as the United States, Canada, Australia, and the countries of northern Europe is indispensible for the purpose of preventing this escape. The second, called 9-6-4, is the low rate of capture for the income of farmers and the self-employed. But this, too, can be improved greatly by an accurate grasp of assets. If assets increase it is also clear that there existed income that was its source. Moreover, if, as in the United States, transactions are done mainly by check rather than by cash, a number is registered on the checking account, so it becomes difficult to hide the income itself. Consequently, at the stage before introducing an income tax, the authorities had to select one of these two options as a measure against income escaping taxation. One of them was to introduce a system of taxpayer ID numbers, grasp income accurately, and change to a tax system centered on income tax. The other was to choose "defeatism." In other words, it was to give up on grasping income and switch to a tax system centered on consumption tax, which does not have the function of redistributing income. But introduction of a system of taxpayer ID numbers means exposing clearly to the eyes of tax authorities the financial asset transactions of all persons. This was a troublesome matter to conservative party politicians. Firstly, the holding of financial assets by the politicians, themselves, would end up becoming clear to the tax authorities. If that happened, it would become very difficult to conceal it if they had bribery-type income that they wanted to keep secret. Second, it would become easy to discover the state of stock trading by politicians using the government's inside information. Because if there were a person who was always profiting abnormally by stock to the extent that it could not be explained as a coincidence when viewed in terms of mathematical statistics, one would discover it by collecting information for each taxpayer ID number, and the investigation of insider trading would begin from there. Third, if we ban making political contributions by cash, and arrange it so that they are made only by check, it will become impossible for contributors to invent expenditures which are unaccounted for. A number is registered on the checking account, so it means one cannot have an account in a false name. Political contributions will end up being in full view of the public. This was something that ruling party politicians wanted to avoid by all means. This is symbolized by the fact that the one who urged destruction of the green card system was none other than Shin Kanemaru. Michio Watanabe, who was minister of finance when the consumption tax debate began, stated that "those who advocate introducing a system of taxpayer ID numbers have schoolgirlish tastes." The feeling of conservative party politicians toward taxpayer numbers is also expressed well in that statement. In other words, the choice between a consumption tax and a system of taxpayer ID numbers was also a matter of judging whether or not one could eradicate politicians' corruption. Under the political conditions at the time, the government and the ruling party decided to preserve corruption as something natural, so under Prime Minister Takeshita the consumption tax was introduced. Why Is a Number System Necessary? The real reason why the conservative government feared a system of taxpayer ID numbers has now become clear to everyone's eyes. Most of Japan's governors are afraid of being arrested for bribery by general contractors, and the actual situation that contributions through the covernors flowed from the provinces and were collected by leading politicians of the central government is also becoming clear. The decisively important system for changing this structure of money-government corruption is the introduction of taxpayer ID numbers. Unless we introduce this system, it will be impossible to make politicians' financial assets and transactions clear to the public no matter what kind of election system reforms are carried out. Introduction of an ID number system would also protect Japan's income tax-centered tax system. Introduction of an ID number system would also improve the tax system in the following points in addition to those listed up till now. First, it would make it easier to levy a tax on profit from transfer of stocks and bonds. In Japan, transfer profit obtained from the purchase or sale of stocks and bonds is practically tax exempt. A tax is levied on presumed profit from transfer, but this is about the same as a transaction tax. How unfair it is that the profit from transfer of stocks or bonds obtained by a millionaire is not taxed, in spite of the fact that the interest of persons with savings accounts are taxed, however small the account. It is necessary to newly establish a tax on profit from transfer of stocks and bonds, and to levy it at the same rate as the tax on savings-account interest. Second, introduction of taxpayer ID numbers is indispensible in order to eliminate avoidance of inheritance tax. Inheritance tax is the most important tax system for the purpose of maintaining fairness of distribution. But in the present situation, one does not know accurately who has how much stock, so it is judged that there is considerable tax evasion in the inheritance of stock. If a list is made of all financial assets by means of a number, it will be possible to prevent this kind of evasion of inheritance tax. The third concerns taxing of pensions. When one considers government financing of pensions, it is wasteful for wealthy people to receive pensions exempt from taxes. Yet if one levies a tax on pensions, a new injustice occurs. Because in the present situation, in which the assets income of old people is not accurately known, there appear many old people who, although they really have a high asset income, escape being taxed, as persons whose total income, including pension, is below the tax-exempt point. An accurate knowledge of asset income by taxpayer ID numbers would also be helpful from this point. An ID number system is also necessary for redistribution in the aspect of annual expenditure. For example, it has been pointed out for a long time that scholarships from scholarship societies go to the children of farmers and the self-employed, who ride around in foreign cars, but that children of salaried workers cannot get them. It is said that also among the residents of Osaka's public housing designed for low-income persons, there are few salaried workers and many persons who are self-employed. These phenomena have arisen because it has become impossible to judge who really has a low income, because 90 percent of salaried income is known, but only 60 percent of self-employed income and 40 percent of agricultural income. By being able to more accurately account for the entire income of each individual, it will become clear who really has a low income, so by this means the income-limit conditions for such things as social security and scholarships will function effectively, and sufficient redistribution of income will be made to the necessary people. Keep Income Tax Reduction to a Minimum The biggest criticism of taxpayer ID numbers is that they violate privacy. There are two types of argument, the natures of which are completely different. The first is a criticism that conservative party politicians like to make: "It will be troublesome if the tax authorities stick their hands in taxpayers' wallets." But an income tax system cannot be realized if taxpayers can hide the content of their income from the tax authorities on the grounds of privacy. Anyhow, the income of salaried employees is already known completely. The kind of argument given above is no different from saying "We would like you to protect preferential tax treatment for wealthy persons, and refrain from investigating whether politicians have violated the law." The second criticism of violating privacy is that there is a possibility that administrative authorities would use for a political objective information about a taxpayer's asset income which was obtained by introduction of the ID number system. This criticism is valid. Actually, unless there are clear preventive measures, there is a very strong danger that administrative authorities would use tax information for the purpose of entrapping critics and persons who became political obstacles. Information related to collection of taxes is, by nature, a sword that administrative authorities, potentially, can misuse, regardless of whether there is an ID number. We, too, must adopt the misuse-prevention measures employed by countries that use taxpayer ID numbers, such as the United States, Sweden, Australia, and Canada. The policy to lower the income tax rate and raise the consumption tax rate in Japan, where the income tax rate is strikingly low among advanced countries, is a phenomenon which is inseparable from the fact that it was impossible to introduce a system of taxpayer ID numbers because of government corruption. Therefore, introduction of taxpayer ID numbers is also an indispensible device for eliminating government corruption. It will at the same time bring to fruition a tax system centered on income tax and without a consumption tax. Now, when the combination of introduction of taxpayer ID numbers and a tax system centered on income tax is in sight, income tax reduction as a measure for stimulating the economy should be kept to a minimum. In particular, we should not lower the highest tax rate. This is a trump card which we must save carefully for now as payment for introduction of a system of ID numbers.
