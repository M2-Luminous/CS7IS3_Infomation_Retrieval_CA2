A Russian participant in the meeting told Interfax that Egon Klepsch had asked Gaydar about the role of the State Duma's committee for international affairs in making foreign-policy decisions. Gaydar believes that it would be expedient to use part of the European Community's aid for creating efficient economic legislation and developing a system of economic education. He also emphasized the importance of promoting the development of the democratic institutions and supporting the regional democratic press which, he said, experiences serious economic problems and suffers from financial dependence on the local authorities. Gaydar assured Klepsch that the Russia's Choice faction would support Russia's joining the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Commenting on the State Duma's position, he said that it was unpredictable.
