FR940413-2-00145 FR940413-2-00070 Some state officials and politicians have advocated or introduced legislation aimed at abuses resulting from political contributions and have made attempts to reform the municipal securities underwriter selection process. 39 Voluntary industry efforts also are underway to reduce the presence of inappropriate political influence peddling. On October 18, 1993, seventeen municipal securities dealers agreed to adopt a ``Statement of Initiative,'' providing the political contributions made, in any manner, for the purpose of influencing the awarding of municipal finance business should be prohibited. To date, over 50 firms have agreed to adhere to the Statement of Initiative. 40 39 E.g. , House No. 1824, The Commonwealth of Massachusetts (a recently introduced bill to prohibit political contributions by investment bankers and bond counsel); The Commonwealth of Massachusetts Joint Statement on Debt Policy (issued to ``[r]eaffirm and extend the statutory presumption that all Commonwealth Debt *␣*␣* shall be issued on a competitive, sealed-bid (lowest true interest cost) basis, and establish standards for rebutting that presumption *␣*␣*; [e]stablish a basic framework for the establishment of procurement processes for the selection of underwriters, financial advisors and attorneys *␣*␣*; [and] [f]urther the practice of requiring disclosure by underwriters, financial advisors and attorneys which fosters the elimination of conflicts of interest among those which serve the Commonwealth *␣*␣* in *␣*␣* issuances of debt.'').

The Florida Association of Counties, for example, called for its members to boycott seventeen securities firms that have voluntarily banned political contributions citing these firms' endorsement of ``public policy damaging rules.'' See ``Politicians are Mobilizing to Derail Ban on Muni Underwriters' Campaign Gifts,'' The Wall Street Journal, (December 27, 1993), at C16. While the Commission views the voluntary efforts of those firms adhering to the Statement of Initiative as laudable, these actions represent only a first step. The MSRB's proposed rule change marks a second step: industry-wide reform intended to respond to the detrimental effects of conflicts of interest. III. Description The proposed rule change would establish industry-wide restrictions and requirements aimed at preventing fraudulent and manipulative practices, promoting just and equitable principles of trade, removing impediments to free and open trade, and protecting investors and the public interest. The MSRB's proposal is intended to address the real as well as perceived abuses resulting from ``pay to play'' practices in the municipal securities market. The proposal is a comprehensive scheme composed of several separated requirements affecting municipal securities dealers, including limitations on business activities triggered by political contributions, limitations on solicitation and coordination of political contributions, and dealer recordkeeping and disclosure.
