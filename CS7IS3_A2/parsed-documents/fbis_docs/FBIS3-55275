At the moment all parties and associations are declaring their positions and suggesting ways of making the work of the legislative body more constructive before the day the Federal Assembly holds its first sitting. We share these hopes too. This is what was discussed today at a press conference held by the leaders of the Party of Russian Unity and Accord. The press conference was attended by Olga Vasilenko. She will tell us about the position held by this party, whose leader is Sergey Shakhray. Over to you. [Vasilenko] The aim of this party's deputies is to revive confidence in parliament, in the law, and to prevent a repetition of the confrontation between the legislative and executive branches. The State Duma's work must be based on equality of all its deputies, regardless of how they were elected -- from party lists or single- seat constituencies. In this connection, the representatives of the Party of Russian Unity and Accord believe that one of the speaker's deputies -- of whom there should be no more than two -- must definitely be nominated from deputies who were elected from single- seat constituencies. Furthermore, there should be a separate vote on each candidate, not on a package as is being proposed at the moment -- and the votes must be secret. The party announces that it is urgently requesting all deputies to agree that there should be no live relays from sessions of the State Duma. This is because there is a tendency for certain personalities to show off before the country whenever they are at the microphone and this undermines the parliament's professional reputation. All these points are made in the party's statement. Journalists were also given a list of certain legislative initiatives which the Party of Russian Unity and Accord, as this party is known for short, is proposing. I wish to draw your attention to the fact that this party proposes that there should be a law on state support for the periodical press. As you know, this has now become a very pressing subject. It is also proposing a draft treaty on a confederation of states belonging to the CIS. Among the answers to questions raised by journalists I think it would interesting to hear what Shakhray, who is currently a member of the government, had to say about his personal future and about his relationship with the president in this respect. Here is what he said. [Begin recording] [Shakhray] However the question is decided, I consider the question of Shakhray's personal membership or non- membership of the government as a political side issue. Irrespective of how this question is decided, I shall not get hysterical or start shouting anything against the president or the government. Unfortunately I know this kitchen too well to behave in such a childish way. [Vasilenko] Sergey Mikhaylovich, what do you think the Duma's first day will be like? [Shakhray] I think the first day will be quite a calm one. [Vasilenko] In spite of the pronouncements by certain politicians and deputies who are saying that all sorts of commissions of inquiry should be set up? [Shakhray] Commissions will be set up. However, one should remember that the new Constitution does not allocate parliament any supervisory functions. So, these will be commissions for the preparation of parliamentary hearings on various questions, on parliament's rights. I have no doubt that there will be very many of these commissions on parliamentary hearings. [Vasilenko] You spoke of your intention to stand for the Duma chairmanship. [Shakhray] I rated my chances as 50-50. Remember that seven of the eight leaders of political associations -- Zhirinovskiy, Gaydar, Yavlinskiy and the others [chuckles] -- have agreed that Shakhray should not be allowed to become speaker. This reduces my chances, of course, but I don't think it ends them altogether, because work is continuing. I am ready to discuss this question, the question of my speakership, as a package with all deputies' associations, including political, territorial, and independent ones, and to seek a solution. [end recording] There was a question about criticism of Shakhray for running a separate election campaign from Russia's Choice. Here is what Sergey Mikhaylovich thinks about this. [Begin Shakhray recording] There are two reasons for the percentage won by Russia's Choice. The first reason is the shock economic policy which created the social base for Zhirinovskiy and his ilk. The second reason is the unprofessional work with the mass media during the preparatory campaign. All other political associations -- those of Shakhray, Yavlinskiy, and some others -- were denied access. Only three of them -- Russia's Choice, the Communists, and Zhirinovskiy -- were allowed screen time. Furthermore, they tried to use the Communists and Zhirinovskiy as a means of intimidating the electorate, by showing them how bad the alternative to themselves would be. But this attempt to discredit them did not work. It only succeeded in giving them more publicity. [end recording] Naturally the journalists asked how the votes would be apportioned in the State Duma. [Begin Shakhray recording] I think all coalitions in the Duma will be formed in accordance with each specific question being debated. For better or for worse, there won't be any formally organized, block-voting coalitions in the Duma. But, whenever these questions have come up, I have always called on people to make a comparison between the present corps of deputies, with all its shortcomings, and the corps of deputies in the former Russian Supreme Soviet. According to Vorotnikov, who was leader of the Russian Federation during that period, democrats had 22 percent of the seats in that parliament. Now there are more of them, although they are still less than half. [chuckles] In other words, some progress has been made, in spite of everything. [end recording] To conclude, let me say that Sergey Shakhray was, as always, calm, confident, laconic and -- judging by everything -- very constructively disposed towards his return to legislative work.
