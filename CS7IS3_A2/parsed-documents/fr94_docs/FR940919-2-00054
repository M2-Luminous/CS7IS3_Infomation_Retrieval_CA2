FR940919-2-00054 FR940919-2-00033 FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION [FCC 94&hyph;227] International Call-Back Services AGENCY: Federal Communications Commission. ACTION: Notice of solicitation of public comments. SUMMARY: The Federal Communications Commission has expanded the scope of the issues to be reconsidered in its grant of three applications for authority to resell international switched services of other carriers using a ``call-back'' configuration. The comments supporting an AT&T petition for reconsideration in this proceeding raised issues involving complex questions of international law, international comity and the law of foreign countries, including the allegation that call-back services employing an uncompleted call signaling configuration violate international law. Therefore, the Commission is seeking additional comments from the parties and members of the public on all of the issues raised in the comments supporting AT&T's petition. The Commission also is seeking the advice of the Department of State regarding the issues of international law, international comity, and the laws of foreign countries. Further, in order to augment the record with respect to AT&T's assertion that uncompleted call signalling violates the Federal wire fraud statute, the Commission will seek the advice of the Department of Justice on this issue. DATES: Comments are due October 14, 1994 and Reply Comments November 14, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Troy F. Tanner, Attorney, Common Carrier Bureau, (202) 418&hyph;1470. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In the matter of: VIA USA, Ltd. Telegroup, Inc.; Applications for Authority Under Section 214 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, to operate as International Resale Carriers. [File Nos. I&hyph;T&hyph;C&hyph;93&hyph;031 I&hyph;T&hyph;C&hyph;93&hyph;050] Discount Call International Co.; Application for Authority Under Section 214 of the Communications Act, as amended. [File No. I&hyph;T&hyph;C&hyph;93&hyph;054] Order Adopted: September 2, 1994. Released: September 12, 1994. By the Commission: 1. On May 11, 1994, the Commission granted the above-referenced Section 214 applications of VIA USA, Ltd., Telegroup, Inc., and Discount Call International Co. to resell international switched services of other carriers using a ``call-back'' configuration. 1 This service allows a customer in a foreign country to use foreign facilities to dial a telephone number in the United States and receive dial tone at a switch at the reseller's U.S. location, which the customer can then use to place a call via an outbound switched service of a U.S. carrier. The calls originating at U.S. locations are billed at U.S.-tariffed rates. 1 VIA USA, Ltd et al. , 9 FCC Rcd 2288 (1994). 2. AT&T petitioned to deny these applications alleging that this service constitutes an unreasonable practice under Section 201 of the Communications Act (``the Act'') and may constitute wire fraud. We denied AT&T's petition. 2 On June 10, 1994, AT&T filed a petition for reconsideration asking us to find that uncompleted call signalling is an unreasonable practice under Section 201(b) of the Act, is contrary to the public interest standard of Section 214 of the Act, violates Section 202(a) of the Act, and violates the Federal wire fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. 1343. 3 2 See id. 3 In order to develop a complete record on the issues raised by AT&T's petition, we extended on our own motion for 30 days the time for the filing of comments. ``Pleading Cycle Extended for Comments on AT&T's Petition for Reconsideration of Commission Order Authorizing Three International Resale Carriers Proposing to Provide `Call-Back' Services,'' FCC Report No. I&hyph;6991 (released June 22, 1994) (hereinafter referred to as ``June 22 Public Notice''). 3. We received comments in support of AT&T's petition from MCI Telecommunications Corporation (MCI), Sprint Communication Company L.P. (Sprint), and The Regional Technical Commission on Telecommunications of Central America (COMTELCA) and the National Telecommunications Institute of Panama (INTEL) (collectively referred to as COMTELCA/INTEL). Oppositions to AT&T's petition were filed by VIA USA, Ltd. (VIA USA), Telegroup, Inc. (Telegroup) and the Telecommunication Resellers Association (TRA).
