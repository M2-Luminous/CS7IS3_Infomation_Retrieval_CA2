The announcement was made by Dr. German Quiroga Gomez, minister of government, in an exclusive interview with LOS TIEMPOS in La Paz. He said that the new role to be played by the new Ministry of Government (formerly the Ministry of the Interior) is essentially aimed at ensuring the effective and continuing defense of society as a whole. In that sense he pointed out that the struggle against corruption is now of fundamental importance, not only for the government but for the Bolivian people as a whole. For this reason it has been decided to take appropriate action, in an organized and systematic way, to fight more effectively against this endemic evil of society. Quiroga stated that the Ministry of Government will provide this new, anticorruption office with the whole structure and resources of the state intelligence and security organizations to undertake investigations of corruption in the different departments of government and in other areas of national life. For this purpose he indicated that letter boxes will be set up in the most heavily populated places in the principal cities of the country so that citizens can deposit their complaints about corrupt actions. These complaints should contain basic information which might assist investigations and could make suggestions which would contribute to the success of this effort. The minister explained that the anticorruption office will not in any way be turned into an organization dedicated to "witch hunts or a search for ghosts." He said that the work to be done will use advanced methods of investigation and will be handled in a responsible and serious way, so that it will generate confidence and credibility in the eyes of public opinion. He stated that the work to be undertaken by this office will be essentially investigative in character. Once the appropriate investigations are completed and concrete evidence is available on clearly criminal cases of corruption, the evidence will be turned over to the appropriate courts for action in coordination with the Ministry of Justice.
