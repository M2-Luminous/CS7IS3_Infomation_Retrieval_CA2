FR940127-1-00008 FR940127-1-00004 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;167&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives; British Aerospace Model BAC 1&hyph;11&hyph;200 and &hyph;400 Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to all British Aerospace Model BAC 1&hyph;11&hyph;200 and &hyph;400 series airplanes. This proposal would require that certain landing gear brakes be inspected for wear and replaced if the wear limits prescribed in this proposal are not met, and that the specified wear limits be incorporated into the FAA-approved maintenance inspection program. This proposal is prompted by an accident in which a transport category airplane executed a rejected takeoff (RTO) and was unable to stop on the runway due to worn brakes; and the subsequent review of allowable brake wear limits for all transport category airplanes. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent the loss of brake effectiveness during a high energy RTO. DATES: Comments must be received by March 23, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;167&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. Comments may be inspected at this location between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Comments Invited Interested persons are invited to participate in the making of the proposed rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified above. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments, specified above, will be considered before taking action on the proposed rule. The proposals contained in this notice may be changed in light of the comments received. Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the proposed rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report summarizing each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this proposal will be filed in the Rules Docket. Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 93&hyph;NM&hyph;167&hyph;AD.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. Availability of NPRMs Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;167&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. Discussion In 1988, a McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;10 series airplane was involved in an aborted takeoff accident in which eight of the ten brakes failed and the airplane ran off the end of the runway. Investigation revealed that there were failed pistons on each of the eight brakes, with O-rings damaged by over-extension due to extensive wear. Fluid leaking from the damaged pistons caused the hydraulic fuses to close, releasing all brake pressure. This accident prompted a review of allowable wear limits for all brakes installed on transport category airplanes. The FAA and the Aerospace Industries Association (AIA) jointly developed a set of dynamometer test guidelines that could be used to validate appropriate wear limits for all airplane brakes. It should be noted that this worn brake accountability determination validates brake wear limits with respect to brake energy capacity only and is not meant to account for any reduction in brake force due solely to the wear state of the brake. The guidelines for validating brake wear limits allow credit for use of reverse thrust with a critical engine inoperative to determine the energy level absorbed by the brake during the dynamometer test. The FAA has requested that airframe manufacturers of transport category airplanes: (1) Determine required adjustments in allowable wear limits for all of its brakes in use; (2) schedule dynamometer testing to validate wear limits as necessary; and (3) submit information from items (1) and (2) to the FAA so that appropriate rulemaking action(s) can be initiated. British Aerospace has conducted worn brake rejected takeoff (RTO) dynamometer testing and analyses on various brakes installed on Model BAC 1&hyph;11&hyph;200 and &hyph;400 series airplanes. Based on the results of that testing and analyses, the FAA has determined that the maximum brake wear limits currently recommended in the Component Maintenance Manual for Model BAC 1&hyph;11&hyph;200 series airplanes equipped with brakes manufactured by Allied Signal Aerospace Company (Bendix) are acceptable as they relate to the effectiveness of the brakes during a high energy RTO. The FAA also finds that the maximum brake wear limits currently recommended in the Component Maintenance Manual for Model BAC 1&hyph;11&hyph;400 series airplanes equipped with Bendix brakes are not acceptable as they relate to the effectiveness of the brakes during a high energy RTO. Consequently, the FAA has determined that the brake wear limits for Model BAC 1&hyph;11&hyph;200 series airplanes and the new brake wear limits for Model BAC 1&hyph;11&hyph;400 series airplanes must be incorporated into the FAA-approved maintenance inspection program. The FAA has determined that, in order to prevent loss of brake effectiveness during a high energy RTO, the following maximum brake wear limits are necessary for Model BAC 1&hyph;11&hyph;200 and &hyph;400 series airplanes equipped with Bendix brakes: British Aerospace Model Bac 1&hyph;11&hyph;200 and &hyph;400 Series Airplanes Equipped With Bendix Brakes 1Airplane Model 1Brake part No. 1Maximum brake wear limit (inch/mm) BAC 1&hyph;11&hyph;200 2601225&hyph;1 0.75 inch (19.1 mm). BAC 1&hyph;11&hyph;400 2601240&hyph;1 1.0 inch (25.4 mm). This airplane model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of Section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. The FAA has determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.
