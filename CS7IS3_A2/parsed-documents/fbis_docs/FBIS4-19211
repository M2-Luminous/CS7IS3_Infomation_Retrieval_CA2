That comment was made by Italian Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta on being given the latest news from Bosnia concerning action against the blue helmets. Answering journalists' questions in Venice after the meeting of the CSCE troika, Andreatta said that the fact that "the Pale government has decided to break with the international organizations attempting to separate the sides and, more especially, to deliver food and supplies," is very serious. "Some 4 million Bosnians, Serbs, Muslims, and Croats have benefited from food and supplies throughout the winter," he added. Andreatta went on to speak of Serbian threats against Italy, pointing out that "the government has been instructed to reject Belgrade's note protesting over the use of Italian bases by NATO aircraft." "It is a well-known fact," Andreatta added, "that making the bases available is part to our commitment to the Atlantic alliance, and that the UN resolutions provide for the use of force to defend UN troops deployed on the ground and in the so-called safe areas." "There is nothing to criticize in the Russian Government's behavior" where Serbia is concerned, Andreatta said. "The Moscow government," he stressed, "has hitherto acted in the interests of peace, offering its services and putting pressure on the Serbian Government to adopt a more prudent conduct."
