Serhiy Nikulin says this began with "the Crimean presidential administration and government moving away from the political forces that ensured Yuriy Meshkov's victory in the presidential election." He doubts whether the president intends to carry out his pre-election program. The Russia bloc, Serhiy Nikulin underlines, "opposes this Crimean government's unlimited power only in order to be able on behalf of the people to supervise its actions."
