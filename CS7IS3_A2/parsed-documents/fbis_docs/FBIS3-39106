And, in a chilling message, he placed the blame for the lack of progress since the mid-December Downing Street declaration on the Government for refusing to clarify its contents. "If John Major refuses to give clarifications then it's impossible for us to give a definitive response," he stressed. "Unless the British Government makes that small step forward then, I think, that Government cannot say that it is interested in peace. That would be a terrible tragedy for the people of this island." The overall impression left by Mr Adams's appearance on the London Weekend Television Walden programme was that Sinn Fein is unlikely to accept the declaration. And Mr Major has made it equally clear that the declaration requires no clarification and is not negotiable. The Government has also repeatedly challenged Mr Adams's attempts to lay the blame at the door of the Government, saying all that needs to be done is for the IRA to end violence -- for ever. Then Sinn Fein, after some three months of peace, would be considered for inclusion as a constitutional Northern Ireland political party in the talks on the future of the province. In a bleak warning today, however, Mr Adams said there would be conflict if the British Government continued to behave "in the way that we have had in the past." Mr Adams, whose words were reproduced by an actor's voice, said: "We have asked the British Government to clarify to our party and to those we represent the same clarification and elaborations they have given to every other party. The British Government have stalled and delayed and refused to do that. So it is impossible for us to give a definitive answer to that Declaration when we don't have all the information about it." Mr Adams described the Declaration as "a masterpiece of ambiguity, about which both governments have different interpretations." And he accused the British Government of having "stalled, delayed and almost, if you like, are trying to evaporate the thrust forward for peace." Mr Adams said there would be a massive dividend for the British people if peace was restored. "It is British money which is being pumped in here, it's British reputations being tarnished in a whole range of international tribunals, in human rights bodies. The British people have to realise that there is a unique opportunity for peace at this time and that the Republicans seek to engage with their Government and the Government is refusing to engage with us." Mr Adams said the opportunity for peace was there before and after the Declaration. "Are we going to allow the London Government to squander this opportunity for peace?" All the evidence suggested the British Government did not want to join the persuaders, he said. "There is the exclusion order against me, the insulting language used by Mr Major, his own difficulties within his own party and his own right wing; all indicate that at this time the British Government may not want to join the persuaders." So, he said, the Government had to be pressed to go the extra mile. He claimed: "I am not trying to put the onus on the British Government. I am trying to get it to fulfil its responsibility in these issues."
