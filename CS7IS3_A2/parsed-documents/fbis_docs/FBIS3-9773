FBIS3-9773 "dreeu061__a94013" FBIS-EEU-94-061-A Document Type:Daily Report 28 Mar 1994 ANNEX Bulgaria Cooperation Agreement Signed AU2803182594 Sofia BTA in English 1729 GMT 28 Mar 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU2803182594 Sofia BTA Language: English Article Type:BFN [Report by Andrey Sharkov] [Text] Sofia, March 28 (BTA) -- "We are the country to open the doors of all Western institutions for Bulgaria," German Federal Minister of Defense Volker Ruehe today told journalists on the first day of his three-day formal visit to this country. Mr. Ruehe is here at the invitation of his Bulgarian counterpart Valentin Aleksandrov. This is the first visit by a German defense minister to this country for the past 70 years. Valentin Aleksandrov and Volker Ruehe today signed an agreement on cooperation between the German and Bulgarian defense ministries. "This is the third document on bilateral cooperation in the military sphere but I am deeply convinced that its contribution to cooperation will be greater than that of the conventions with the central powers and the Tripartite Pact," the Bulgarian Defense Minister said after the signing of the agreement. During World War One and Two, and until the monarchy's downfall in 1944, Bulgaria was allied to Germany. Germany can do much more for Bulgaria than just give it the military equipment of the former East Germany, Defense Minister Ruehe said, answering a question. According to him, material and technical aid would not be in the spirit and letter of the agreement signed today. Germany, however, might deliver spare parts to this country. The outdated military equipment of the Bundeswehr, including that of the ex-East German Army, was either donated or sold to other countries under agreements effective in the Warsaw-Pact times, Mr. Ruehe said. Investing in material things is now outdated. Investing in people -- in the exchange of trainees and expertise -- this is the investment of the future, the investment of friendship," the German Defense Minister said, commenting on the agreement the two ministries signed today. The document envisages the extending of technical and economic assistance to Bulgaria. The newly signed agreement is more or less identical with those Bulgaria has signed with the other NATO member-states, Valentin Aleksandrov told journalists. It provides for exchange of information pertaining to the political and legal aspects of defence, the Armed Forces management and cooperation in some specific military sub-sectors, including officers training. The goals set forth in this agreement will be accomplished through visits by delegations and working groups to exchange information and through exchange of trainees. The sides also exchanged views on the Yugocrisis during talks between the top officials of the two defense ministries. The meeting, however, did not discuss the UN decision to sent Turkish "blue helmets" on a peacekeeping mission in former Yugoslavia. "The agreement between Muslims and Croats is already yielding results. I hope the sides will find a just solution to this issue," Mr. Ruehe also told journalists. In their recent history, the two countries started exchanging delegation in 1991 when a group of Bulgarian officers visited the NATO Academy in Oberammergau, Germany. According to a statement made by President Zhelev, this marked the beginning of a closer Bulgaria-NATO cooperation. A Bulgarian delegation led by Valentin Aleksandrov last autumn paid a visit to Germany, the first one after half a century's break. During that visit, the two countries reached specific agreements for a closer cooperation, including the training of Bulgarian officers at the Bundeswehr academy in Hamburg and at the military school in Muenster. And the exchange of military delegation tends to get busier.
