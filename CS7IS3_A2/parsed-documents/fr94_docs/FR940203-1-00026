FR940203-1-00026 FR940203-1-00005 We also propose to add a sentence at the end of §11.6(i) to clarify that bills for annual charges can be paid under protest and subject to refund in the event that an application for an exemption from payment is pending when the bill becomes payable. This provision would codify the Commission's current practice. V. Regulatory Flexibility Certification The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) 32 generally requires a description and analysis of proposed regulations that will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 33 Pursuant to section 605(b) of the RFA, the Commission hereby certifies that the regulations proposed herein will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 32 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612. 33 Section 601(c) of the RFA defines a ``small entity'' as a small business, a small not-for-profit enterprise, or a small governmental jurisdiction. A ``small business'' is defined by reference to section 3 of the Small Business Act as an enterprise which is ``independently owned and operated and which is not dominant in its field of operation.'' 15 U.S.C. 632(a). VI. Environmental Statement Issuance of this notice of proposed rulemaking does not constitute a major federal action having a significant adverse impact on the quality of the human environment under the Commission's regulations implementing the National Environmental Policy Act. 34 The regulations proposed herein are procedural in nature and therefore fall within the categorical exemptions provided in the Commission's regulations. Consequently, neither an environmental impact statement nor an environmental assessment is required. 35 34 See Order No. 486, 52 FR 47897 (Dec. 17, 1987), FERC Stats. & Regs. (Regulations Preambles 1986&hyph;1990) ¶ 30,783 (Dec. 10, 1987) (codified at 18 CFR Part 380). 35 See 18 CFR 380.4(a)(1). VII. Information Collection Statement The Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) regulations at 5 CFR 1320.13 require that OMB approve certain information and recordkeeping requirements imposed by an agency. The information collection requirements that would be deleted by this proposed rule are contained in FERC&hyph;583 ``Annual Kilowatt Generating Report (Annual Charges)'' (1902&hyph;0136). The Commission's Financial Services Division uses the data for determination of the amount of annual charges to be assessed licensees for reimbursable government administrative costs. If the amendments proposed herein are adopted, the Commission would submit to the OMB a notification that these collections of information have been modified. Interested persons may obtain information on these reporting requirements by contacting the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 941 North Capitol Street NE., Washington, DC 20426 [Attention: Michael Miller, Information Services Division, (202) 208&hyph;1415]. Comments on the requirements of this rule can be sent to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of OMB [Attention: Desk Officer for Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]. VIII. Public Comment Procedures The Commission invites all interested persons to submit written comments on the matters discussed in this notice of proposed rulemaking. An original and 14 copies of the written comments must be filed with the Commission April 4, 1994. Comments should be submitted to the Office of the Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street NE., Washington, DC 20426, during regular business hours, and should refer to Docket No. RM93&hyph;7&hyph;000. All written comments will be placed in the Commission's public files and will be available for inspection in the Commission's Public Reference Room, room 3104, 941 North Capitol Street North East, Washington, DC 20426 during regular business hours.
