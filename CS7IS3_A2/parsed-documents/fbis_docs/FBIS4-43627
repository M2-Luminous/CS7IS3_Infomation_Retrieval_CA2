We asked French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, who was in Cote d'Ivoire and Senegal to raise the issue of African support for this intervention, to comment on the issue: [Begin Juppe recording] We have good arguments to convince the RPF. What are we planning to do in this operation? For example -- and I would say that this is the main aim of the operation -- we plan to go in to protect Tutsi civilians who are under threat of extermination in areas held by Rwandan [government] forces and militias. How can the RPF be hostile to such an operation, which aims to protect civilians? We have to explain what we plan to do. Perhaps there have been misunderstandings, perhaps what we planned was poorly understood. I am convinced that we can explain things and understand each other better. [end recording]
