In the statement, Chairman Nakajima said: During the latest Japan-U.S. summit talks which were held in a friendly atmosphere, leaders of the two countries had a very sober exchange of their views and we would like to highly rate that. They affirmed the need for the two countries to maintain good relations in the future despite their failure to bridge their differences. We think their affirmation indicates that the Japan-U.S. relations are about to enter a new mature stage. Commenting on the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, Chairman Nakajima said: It is important for the two nations to have a cooling-off period and the governments of the two countries should discuss without haste ways to find areas of agreement. The Social Democratic Party of Japan issued a statement in the name of Nobuyuki Sekiyama, chairman of the Policy Board. In the statement, Chairman Sekiyama said: We regret that the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, which were high on the agenda of the latest Japan-U.S. summit talks, failed to hammer out an accord. Nonetheless, leaders of both Japan and the United States agreed to build a new relationship between the two countries under which the two countries frankly discuss what they can do and cannot do on the basis of their unwavering trust. We would like to highly rate that.
