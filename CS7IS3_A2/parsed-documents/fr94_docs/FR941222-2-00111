The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public Reference Branch. Applicant Representations 1. Applicant, a California corporation and an open-end management investment company, registered under the Act on September 7, 1983. On September 30, 1993, applicant filed a registration statement to register its shares under the Securities Act of 1933. The registration statement became effective on September 30, 1983, and the initial public offering of its shares commenced promptly thereafter. 2. On October 12, 1994, subject to shareholder approval, applicant's board of directors unanimously determined that it was in the best interest of the shareholders to liquidate. The decision of the board was based primarily on the small size of the applicant; the resulting high ratio of expenses to average net assets and the difficulty in achieving the diversification and investment objectives. Accordingly, on or about October 24, 1994, proxy materials were distributed to shareholders. On November 1, 1994, the holders of a majority of the shares voted to take all necessary and advisable actions to effect the winding-up and dissolution of applicant's business. On November 18, 1994, all of applicants' outstanding shares were redeemed and payments were made at applicant's net asset value. 3. Distributions to all securityholders in complete liquidation of their interests have been made. Applicant incurred $894 in total brokerage commissions with respect to sales of its portfolio securities. 4. On October 24, 1994, there were issued and outstanding 196,764 shares of common stock having a net asset value of $9.08 per share and $1,786,617 in the aggregate. 5. Liquidation expenses of approximately $6,800 for transfer agency, accounting, custody, tax reporting and legal fees will be borne by Wood Island Associates, Inc., applicant's investment adviser. 6. As of the date of this application, applicant has no debts or liabilities and is not a party to any litigation or administrative proceeding. Applicant is neither engaged in, nor does it propose to engage in, any business activities other than those necessary for the winding-up of its affairs. 7. Applicant has filed all documents required to terminate its existence as a California corporation. For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority.
