Amman Radio Jordan Network in Arabic at 0900 GMT on 4 March carries a live broadcast of Friday prayers from al-Husayni Mosque in central Amman. The broadcast includes a 36-minute "religious lesson" by Dr. Dawud al-Fa'uri of the University of Jordan's Islamic Sharia college. Al-Fa'uri begins by hailing those who died in the Hebron massacre on 25 February. The preacher questions the behavior of those who claim to be "the chosen people of God, and the sons and beloved of God, only to appear in their true colors in front of the whole world as enemies of God, humanity, and peace." He says: "How can they describe as extremism the behavior of the innocent child who hurls a stone at the man who attacked him and took all of his possessions, and fail to call extremism the flagrant shooting of those who are prostrated before God in prayer at the Khalil al-Rahman [Abraham] Mosque?" Al-Fa'uri adds: "The first party responsible for the kind of extremism and murder that has taken place is the Israeli Government, which fights extremism elsewhere while nurturing it at home. It gave weapons to the settlers and has watched the extremism of Jewish religious groups such as the Kakh Movement, the Kahane Movement, and Shas. The least the Israeli Government should have done was to withdraw weapons from the settlers and the extremist religious organization, at least during the peace talks. The least it should have done is to execute all those who carried out the murders in front of the whole world, as it does when it brings down homes on the heads of their residents based on a suspicion or for throwing a stone." Al-Fa'uri blames Arabs and Muslims for their disunity, despite factors of similarity among them. He blames the international community for closing its eyes to anti-Arab and anti-Islamic crimes. He congratulates those who are steadfastly defending "their brothers, honor, and property" in the occupied territory and calls on believers to help them in every possible way. He urges the people to follow the example of King Husayn in contributing to their Palestinian brothers and praised the Jordanian people's stand in support of the Palestinian people. Al-Fa'uri devotes the remainder of his "lesson" to the merits of the fasting month of Ramadan and al-Qadr night, during which the Koran was revealed to the Prophet Muhammad. Amman radio also carries another a 23-minute "sermon" on obedience to God's teachings. The unidentified preacher laments the poor condition of Muslims, which he attributes to their failure to follow their true religion, and praises ancient Islamic tradition. The preacher refers to massacres and injustice committed against Muslims in the world, including the Hebron massacre committed by "the Zionists". He praises the Hebron victims, who will have their "reward in the hereafter." He asks the people to contribute to the support of the families of the victims. Amman Jordan Television Network in Arabic at 0945 GMT carries a live broadcast from King 'Abdallah Mosque in Amman that includes a 24-minute sermon on religious values and the merits of the holy month of Ramadan.
