In his opinion, such a decision would be a violation of the international acts on human rights whose legitimate character is confirmed by the authorities in Kiev." Meshkov believes that "the Russian State Duma in its present composition will react to such violations of human rights very tough putting Russia's state administration in an embarrassing situation." "It (the Russian administration -- Interfax's note) will have to either agree with the State Duma and extremely heighten tensions between Ukraine and Russia, or oppose to the Duma's decision and bring closer early presidential elections," Meshkov stated. The candidate pointed out that "neither this, nor that variant is desirable for Ukraine" hoping for that "Leonid Makarovich Kravchuk, being a sophisticated and clever politician, will avoid making wrong decisions." Meshkov met with the Black Sea Fleet commander, Admiral Eduard Baltin, in Sevastopol on January 21. The fleet's press service said the parties "discussed the results of the first round of presidential elections in the Crimea and the prospects for the developments in the region." At the Crimean presidential elections on January 16, Meshkov canvassed a majority of votes and left behind his closest rival, current Crimean Speaker Nikolai Bagrov. The two candidates will race for presidency at the second round of the elections scheduled for January 30. During the meeting, Baltin said that the fleet's command was ready to maintain a constructive dialogue with any party or movement which understand the fleet's problems and take them close to heart, the press service pointed out.
