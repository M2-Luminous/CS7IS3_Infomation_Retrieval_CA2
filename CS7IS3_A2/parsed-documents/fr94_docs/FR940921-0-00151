FR940921-0-00151 FR940921-0-00016 (iii) For diesel engines: K H = 1/[1&hyph;0.0026 (H&hyph;75)] (or for SI units = 1/[1&hyph;0.0182 (H&hyph;10.71)]). Where: (d)(8)(iv) through (d)(9)(x) [Reserved]. For guidance see §86.1342&hyph;90. (d)(10)(i) NMHC conc = HC conc &hyph;CH4 conc (ii) Density NMHC = The density of non-methane hydrocarbon, is 1.1771(12.011 + H/C (1.008)) g/ft3-carbon atom (0.04157(12.011 + H/C (1.008))kg/m3-carbon atom), where H/C is the hydrogen to carbon ratio of the non-methane hydrocarbon components of the test fuel, at 68 ○F (20 ○C) and 760 mm Hg (101.3 kPa) pressure. (iii)(A) CH 4conc = Methane concentration of the dilute exhaust sample corrected for background, in ppm carbon equivalent. (B) CH 4conc = r CH4 × (CH 4e &hyph;CH 4d (1&hyph;1/DF)) Where: ( 1 ) CH 4e = Methane exhaust bag concentration in ppm carbon equivalent. ( 2 ) CH 4d = Methane concentration of the dilution air in ppm carbon equivalent. ( 3 ) r CH4 = HC FID response to methane for natural gas-fueled vehicles as measured in §86.1321 (d). (e) through (h)(2)(vii) [Reserved]. For guidance see §86.1342&hyph;90. 114. A new section 86.1344&hyph;94 is added to subpart N to read as follows: §86.1344&hyph;94 Required information. (a) The required test data shall be grouped into the following three general categories: (1) Engine set up and descriptive data. These data must be provided to the EPA supervisor of engine testing for each engine sent to the Administrator for confirmatory testing prior to the initiation of engine set-up. These data are necessary to ensure that EPA test personnel have the correct data in order to set up and test the engine in a timely and proper manner. These data are not required for tests performed by the manufacturers. (2) Pre-test data. These data are general test data that must be recorded for each test. The data are of a more descriptive nature such as identification of the test engine, test site number, etc. As such, these data can be recorded at any time within 24 hours of the test. (3) Test data. These data are physical test data that must be recorded at the time of testing. (b) When requested, data shall be supplied in the format specified by the Administrator. (c) Engine set-up data. Because specific test facilities may change with time, the specific data parameters and number of items may vary. The Application Format for Certification for the applicable model year will specify the exact requirements. In general, the following types of data will be required: (1) Engine manufacturer. (2) Engine system combination. (3) Engine code and CID. (4) Engine identification number. (5) Applicable engine model year. (6) Engine fuel type. (7) Recommended oil type. (8) Exhaust pipe configuration, pipe sizes, etc. (9) Curb or low idle speed. (10) Dynamometer idle speed (automatic transmission engines only). (11) Engine parameter specifications such as spark timing, operating temperature, advance curves, etc. (12) Engine performance data, such as maximum BHP, previously measured rated rpm, fuel consumption, governed speed, etc. (13) Recommended start-up procedure. (14) Maximum safe engine operating speed. (15) Number of hours of operation accumulated on engine. (16) Manufacturer's recommended inlet depression limit and typical in-use inlet depression level. (17) Exhaust system: (i) Diesel engines: (A) Header pipe inside diameter. (B) Tailpipe inside diameter.
