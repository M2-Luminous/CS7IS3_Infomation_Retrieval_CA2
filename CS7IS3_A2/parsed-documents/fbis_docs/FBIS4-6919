The policy states: "Japan will prepare for a future emergency in line with a policy to be adopted by the United Nations." A series of discussions carried by MAINICHI SHIMBUN on 5 and 6 April focused on North Korea's suspected nuclear development and on analyzing how the issue will develop in the future. This time, we would like to discuss what implications the issue has for Japan and how Japan should deal with it. First, I would like to ask whether the UN Security Council will impose economic sanctions against North Korea. [Munekata] I believe the UN Security Council will impose economic sanctions on North Korea. In that event, the UN Security Council is expected to undertake three stages of sanctions against that country: surveillance in accordance with Articles 39 and 40 of the UN Charter, economic sanctions in accordance with Article 41, and military sanctions in accordance with Article 42. There is a high possibility that, in accordance with Article 42, the UN Security Council will impose military sanctions, including interception of vessels. There is also the possibility a naval blockade will be imposed against North Korea, thus threatening the potential use of force. Japan should prepare for these sanctions by revamping its laws and ordinances. [Nishihara] Japan should prepare itself in anticipation of economic sanctions being imposed against North Korea, but I do not think the United States will go that far. The foundation of the coalition government in Japan remains fragile, and it is still uncertain how far China will go along with sanctions. Given these facts, it is possible that, even if the United States takes the lead in imposing economic sanctions against North Korea, the sanctions would not generate the desired effect, slapping the United States in its own face. [Nogami] What concerns me is that public opinion in Japan may be divided over the handling of the issue. In reality, there is no way to resolve the issue but through moderate means. Radical sanctions are costly. The term "sanctions" was not in the presidential statement of the UN Security Council. Even if the possibility of imposing economic sanctions emerges in the future, Japan should seek a diplomatic solution. No matter what the international community says, Japan should seek a phased solution of the issue while leaving room for North Korea to alter its policy. The issue is problematic and is related to two aspects--nuclear nonproliferation and stability in the Far East, including on the Korean peninsula. From the viewpoint of nuclear nonproliferation, it is necessary to take severe measures to punish North Korea. Yet what is important for both Japan and South Korea is stability in the Far East, including on the Korean peninsula. Attaching importance to the two, the United States is trying to maintain a balance between them. In that case, it would be good for the international community to express strong concern over North Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons instead of imposing economic sanctions. [Munekata] There are two types of economic sanctions. First, economic sanctions are imposed against North Korea, with prior knowledge that it will not generate the desired effect. Second, an economic blockade is imposed to physically prevent goods from flowing into North Korea. Economic sanctions can be imposed with the knowledge they are full of loopholes, then steps can be taken to make a blockade effective. It is important to make sure North Korea receives our signal; it is necessary to make diplomatic efforts to correctly catch mutual signals. Japan should prepare for economic sanctions while taking this process into account. It required about one year for Japan to draft a bill on the Peacekeeping Cooperation Law. If Japan fails to prepare in a timely manner for economic sanctions, it will have to improperly deal with a catastrophic situation. [Nogami] The UN Security Council issued a presidential statement instead of a binding resolution, with the primary aim of getting China to heed international opinion. The council issued the presidential statement as a message that the international community wants North Korea to take the fulfillment of its obligations laid down by the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) seriously. In a bid to send a strong message to North Korea, the UN Security Council has the option of imposing loose sanctions against that country. Yet Japan cannot take the lead in imposing such sanctions, and American public opinion will not tolerate Japan's attitude. [Kawauchi] What should the international community ask North Korea to do for the time being? [Nogami] For the time being, North Korea will be asked to allow international inspections of a radiation chemical laboratory from among its seven declared nuclear facilities, the inspections having been agreed upon between the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] and North Korea. The next problem is to inspect undeclared nuclear facilities in North Korea. There is a possibility the declared nuclear facilities have greatly changed from when North Korea first declared them to the IAEA. If the declared facilities have greatly changed, they will be subject to special inspections. For the time being, efforts will be made to return the situation back to the time when North Korea announced its plan to pull out of the NPT. As for checking undeclared nuclear facilities, U.S.-North Korea high-level talks will discuss how to conduct the checks. In that sense, there is a framework to resolve the issue diplomatically. [Nishihara] North Korea is suspected of operating other nuclear facilities; the IAEA will attempt to check these suspected facilities. Japan may have to consider how it should live with a North Korea which possesses nuclear weapons. [Kawauchi] If North Korea really wants to have nuclear weapons, it will have to pull out of the NPT. However, North Korea is trying to obtain some goal by playing the nuclear card instead of pulling out of the NPT. How long should the United States and other nations continue their diplomatic game with North Korea with no prospect of resolution in sight? [Munekata] It is a struggle with time. To explain to what extent North Korea has developed nuclear weapons, the prevailing view is that North Korea has extracted enough plutonium to build one or two warheads, and has almost manufactured a detonation device. It will take one or two years before North Korea can test the warheads and build nuclear weapons. The United States and other nations are expected to refrain from taking any hardline measures that could undermine the NPT until April 1995 when the NPT is extended. The United States and other nations will begin sending strong messages to North Korea once the NPT is extended. However, even if diplomatic signals are sent to North Korean leaders, it is doubtful whether they will take the signals seriously. [Kawauchi] Japan learned a lessen from the Gulf war. I believe the Japanese people feel that "at the time Japan was unable to properly respond to the war, and thus Japan should not repeat that experience." How should Japan use that lesson in dealing with North Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons? What is the government studying now? [Nogami] During and after the Gulf war, economic sanctions were imposed against Iraq to keep goods from flowing into that country. It is legally possible for Japan to prevent goods from flowing into North Korea. Approximately 50-60 billion yen has been remitted to North Korea every year, with the money being used to pay for imports from Japan. The remittance of the money will naturally be halted once trade between Japan and North Korea is embargoed. The government can stop the remittance to North Korea of more than 5 million yen by pro-North Korean organizations in Japan in accordance with the Foreign Exchange Law. Ethnic Koreans residing in Japan have carried yen when they travel to North Korea, and I think the amount of yen they have carried has been somewhat exaggerated. [Kawauchi] Nogami, do you mean that the Foreign Ministry thinks Japan can deal with economic sanctions against North Korea under laws currently in force, and that it does not need to amend any laws to deal with sanctions? [Nogami] If the UN Security Council imposes the same economic sanctions against North Korea as against Iraq, there will be no problems with dealing with such sanctions. However, Japan will be unable to regulate travel to North Korea by ethnic Koreans residing in Japan. Approximately 250,000 pro-DPRK Koreans currently reside in Japan, and the government cannot ban their travel to North Korea. [Nishihara] Will they not be prohibited from reentering Japan? [Nogami] The government must treat pro-DPRK Koreans and pro-ROK Koreans equally. They have all been granted permanent residence. From a humanitarian point of view, the government cannot prohibit pro-DPRK Koreans from reentering Japan while allowing pro-ROK Koreans to do the same. [Kawauchi] As a means to deal with a crisis on the Korean peninsula, the government should study ways to airlift the Japanese residing in South Korea back to Japan. What do you think? [Nogami] The airlifting to Japan of its citizens residing in South Korea would require amending the Self-Defense Forces [SDF] Law, and that is a delicate issue. If the government openly discusses an airlift, it will create useless apprehension among those Japanese residing in South Korea. Recently the government has been calmly studying ways to evacuate them. The government must study such means while making it clear to the Japanese residing in South Korea that the situation on the Korean peninsula is not serious at the moment. [Munekata] Speaking from the military standpoint, the current SDF Law limits naval interception action to Japanese territorial waters. The law permits naval interception only when legitimate self-defense and emergency evacuations are required on the high seas. The law also permits SDF ships to rescue other Japanese warships on the open sea. By law, SDF vessels capable of sweeping mines can do nothing for South Korean ships in danger of being hit by mines. This indifferent action cannot be tolerated internationally. It will be necessary to pass legislation within a limited time frame. The government should consider how to deal with refugees fleeing from North Korea to Japan when economic sanctions are imposed. [Kawauchi] Munekata, do you mean the Diet needs to revamp relevant laws? [Munekata] Yes, the Diet needs to do so in order to put the SDF under civilian control. The worst situation will occur if and when procedures are not set to deal with an emergency situation, and the handling of the emergency is left to the judgment of SDF members. If politics does not make clear what to do to deal with such situations, Japan will run into trouble. [Nishihara] The SDF has no service regulation allowing it to participate in UN-endorsed naval interception. If Article 9 of the Constitution is interpreted as permitting the SDF to participate in collective self-defense, the SDF can participate in UN-endorsed naval interception. It goes without saying that the SDF can only provide lateral support for naval interceptions. [Nogami] If ships in question do not enter or leave Japanese ports, there will be no need for naval interception. The Maritime Safety Agency will deal with stowaways. [Munekata] It will take time for North Korea to shift its nuclear card from a political into a military instrument. There is no need to stir up public opinion right now. It is important to study ways to revamp laws currently in force to ready Japan for an emergency situation.
