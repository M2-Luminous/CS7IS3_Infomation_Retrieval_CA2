FR940328-2-00099 FR940328-2-00054 Future campaigns are more likely to be effective than past ones. Standard No. 213 has been amended to provide for the registration of child restraints. The purpose of the program is to increase the effectiveness of campaigns to recall child seats. It requires manufacturers to take steps that will increase their ability to inform owners of particular child restraints about problems in these restraints and that encourage owners to register their child seats. And the agency does not agree that the noncompliance is ``technical'' in nature. NHTSA also notes that the petition failed to acknowledge that the agency tested and retested the harness webbing in March 1993, and encountered a more serious test failure than the 4.3 inch burn rate presented in the petition and which reflected NHTSA's original tests. In the second series of tests, NHTSA found burn rate test and retest failures of 5.4 and 5.2 inches respectively. Thus the test and retest failures uncovered by NHTSA average 4.85 inches and 4.75 inches respectively, a margin of failure of 20%, and hardly inconsequential or of a ``technical'' nature in the agency's opinion. Finally, NHTSA believes flammability requirements for child restraints should be stringently adhered to for the following reasons. The test requirement of not more than 4 inches a minute was justified by the need ``to prevent injury to occupants from rapidly spreading interior fires, to allow sufficient time for the driver to stop the vehicle, and, if necessary, for occupants to leave it before injury occurs'' (36 FR 10817). This is even more critical in the case of child restraints as a small child is typically not capable of exiting a vehicle without assistance. Therefore, some additional time is required for another person to remove the child. Moreover, the child most often is in the rear seat and the adult is in front, also requiring additional time to reach the child. Finally, because webbing rests against the child's body, noncompliant webbing has a great potential for injuring the child if ignited. For the reasons discussed above, the agency has concluded that the petitioner has not met its burden of persuasion that the noncompliance herein described is inconsequential as it relates to safety, and its petition is denied.
