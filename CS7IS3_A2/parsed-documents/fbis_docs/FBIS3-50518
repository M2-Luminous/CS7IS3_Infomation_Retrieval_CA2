He reasons that an agreement with Mexico will favor Nicaragua because Nicaragua's labor force is cheaper that Mexico's. Aleman believes that as Mexico prospers under NAFTA, it will become more open to buying Nacaraguan products, which will not have to reach the same level of quality as they do for sale to the United States. Aleman expects that Nicaragua will continue to export goods to the United States under NAFTA. Nicaragua currently exports to the United States $17 million worth of goods. Carlos Reynaldo Lacayo, a member of the American Chamber of Commerce, explains that joining the FTA will not solve thge country's problems. He calls on the government to establish fiscal, monetary, and credit policies to allow businessmen to modernize equipment and update technology in order to be more competitive. Lacayo explains that political and social stability and a new labor code are also necessary to stimulate investment.
