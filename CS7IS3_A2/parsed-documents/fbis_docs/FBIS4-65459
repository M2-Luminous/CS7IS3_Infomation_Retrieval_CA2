Appearing as an American-style star was the prime minister, who had hitherto observed an expedient silence, having his ministers say that this European campaign is a "party matter," a "Giscard-Chirac" list, in short. Edouard Balladur, who had forbidden members of his government to be candidates in the European elections, was to make the journey with four ministers from his "inner circle:" Philippe Douste-Blazy, the Centrist responsible for health alongside Simone Veil, but also Industry Minister Gerard Longuet, who had made no secret of his preference for Jean-Francois Deniau to head the UDF-RPR union list, and [Research Minister] Francois Fillon and [Environment Minister] Michel Barnier. Similarly, the arrival in Toulouse of 19 RPR fellow list members was expected, including Helene Carrere d'Encausse, number two on the list, and 23 UDF candidates. This learned assembly's aim in this first big meeting was to encourage the city's son, the "little one" as he is nicknamed in Toulouse. He is a list leader who preferred to keep his mandate as mayor of Toulouse but resign from the National Assembly to be able to take his seat in the European Parliament and who, for his part, was to uphold once again his concept of a "strong" Europe which regains "its protective role." As for the prime minister, he was speaking yesterday for the first time in the European election campaign after saying very little in the cantonal elections. [passage omitted] The Prime Minister's Statements "The institutional reforms will change Europe's face. We must prepare for that. The French Government and the French European deputies will have to work in close cooperation on these fundamental questions. Together, we will have to strengthen France's role in Europe, defend France's interests, and assert our concept of Europe, not a federal concept but a new concept -- a union of states which pool some of their abilities, must be unanimous in their most important decisions, and also keep their sovereignty.... "Europe's situation has also changed since 1989. "In the economic sphere, the main factor is the serious crisis which all the member states have experienced, the most serious in 20 years, which has resulted in the increase in unemployment. "Europe seems weakened: While America was returning to growth, Europe was only recording mediocre results. The member states are now suffering from high public deficits. "The monetary crises have presented the threat of a dismantling of the EMS [European Monetary System] and, in some sectors, have produced distortions of competition. "We must be aware that these problems have undermined the European idea among the public. All too often, Europe has become synonymous with impotence (against unemployment and in the Bosnian tragedy) and bureaucracy, with inability to guarantee peace, with ridiculous attacks on national identity by Community regulations felt to be pointless and annoying. "Does the European idea still have a future? Yes, more than ever. We are here to bear witness to it.... "Expansion is inevitable. It is also desirable provided preparations are made for it. Of course, this move will take time. We must help the states of Central and East Europe by clarifying the future for them.... "The European nations grouped within the Union, which have become more numerous, will have to adopt a more democratic joint way of functioning. "Indeed, distrust of Europe is fueled by the feeling that decisions are not made at the political level, in other words by those who are elected and answerable to the people. We need a more democratic Europe.... "It is necessary for the citizens of each country to feel closer to the decisionmaking process. It is in this way that we will popularize the European idea, and not in any other way. The French no longer accept the fait accompli, and they are right not to do so. "In a way, it is a calling into question of 30-year old methods. The problems are new, they require new solutions.... "A more democratic Europe will be able to develop its ambitions and apply them to the spheres in which it can be useful: security, control of immigration, and the fight against organized crime, and drug trafficking. European cooperation will be focused on better security for the citizens of every country.... "We were behind a unique prevention effort, the Pact for Stability, which will be launched at a conference in Paris in 10 days. Its aim is to encourage the Central and East European countries to sign among themselves agreements on good neighborly relations. It is a difficult and huge task, but it is our duty and in our interest to do all we can to ensure that this effort succeeds. It is also a "European" task. The Community was built immediately after the war to overcome long-standing divisions and hatreds. It succeeded and consolidated peace.... "Economically, France needs the European market, provided it is organized. Its enterprises enjoy greater competitiveness. They need a market of the dimension of the one which their American or Japanese competitors enjoy.... "We must also more effectively defend ourselves against the rest of the world. The GATT negotiations in 1993 showed that, when it was united and determined, Europe could see its ideas triumph. This is an example to be followed. Our deputies will, I am sure, strive to remember this and guarantee a better protection of Europe, a defense of its interests which is not inferior to the defense of the interests of other areas in the world.... "France's problems are serious, we know the concerns of all. The French people would not forgive us for political divisions which made us lose sight of what is essential: devoting all our efforts to our country's recovery."
