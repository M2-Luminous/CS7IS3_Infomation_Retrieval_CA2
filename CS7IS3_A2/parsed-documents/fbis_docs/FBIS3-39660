In the letter, he stated that the "ultimatum set by NATO is illegal" and "that a new resolution must be adopted in the UN Security Council." If Russia did not obtain a satisfactory response on this point, then "we cannot be held responsible for the possible consequences arising from NATO air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs," the Russian president continued. Yeltsin sent this letter to the French, British and Spanish Governments. Claes said Yeltsin regretted "not having been sufficiently informed of the actions concerning Bosnia, and recalls that the ultimatum set by NATO is not covered by resolutions voted by the UN Security Council." The Russian foreign minister had declared, however, that "air strikes could be justified as a final resort." Russian opposition to air strikes is certainly not new, but it is the first time the Russian president, who generally is moderate in his relations with the West, has adopted such a stiff tone. In reaction to Yeltsin's letter, Claes recalled that the existing resolutions (836 and 844) "do constitute an adequate legal basis for air strikes." "Therefore a new UN Security Council resolution is not necessary," the Belgian minister added. "It makes no sense to claim that we want to minimalize Russia's role in the Bosnia question. On the contrary, the Europe Union [EU] wants Russia and the United States to play a more active role in seeking peace in Bosnia," Claes added. Finally the Belgian minister said he was "optimistic" about a peaceful conclusion to the Sarajevo crisis after the Russian announcement of an agreement on the withdrawal of Bosnian Serb heavy weapons. On Friday Claes will participate with his Greek and German colleagues in a meeting of the European "troika" -- the outgoing, current and future EU presidencies -- with the Russian Foreign Minister A. Kozyrev.
