In the talks, the two sides reaffirmed their previous position on the immediate resumption of the third round of the U.S.-North Korean talks if North Korea accepts additional inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Yi Kang-tok reports: [Begin Yi recording] Today, Kim Sam-hun, our side's nuclear ambassador, and his U.S. counterpart Robert Gallucci held high-level talks to deal with the nuclear issue and held the same view that the third round of the U.S.-North Korean talks would be held only after realizing additional inspections of North Korea's nuclear facilities. The two countries agreed to seek sanctions through the UN Secretary Council if North Korea fails to accept additional inspections by next month. Since the UN Secretary Council president's statement called for dialogue among countries concerned, the two sides also agreed to resume the U.S.-North Korean working-level talks in New York if North Korea first proposes contacts. They shared the same view that inter-Korean talks are necessary for the realization of the joint declaration on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. However, they agreed to set the date for resumption of the inter-Korean dialogue after watching the developments of the nuclear issue, including the resumption of U.S.- North Korean high-level talks. In particular, the two countries have decided to have close consultations on specific items to be discussed in U.S.-North Korean talks, which will take place if North Korea allows additional inspections. In today's talks, the two sides decided to resume the Team Spirit joint exercise in the event the North Korean nuclear issue continues to experience rough sailing and to map out detailed measures when U.S. Defense Secretary visits Seoul on 19 April.
