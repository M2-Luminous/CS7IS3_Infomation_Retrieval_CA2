FR941227-2-00051 FR941227-2-00042 [FRL&hyph;5128&hyph;8] Proposed Administrative Order On Consent; Petrochem Recycling Corp./Ekotek, Inc. Site, Salt Lake City, UT AGENCY: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA). ACTION: Proposed de minimis settlements. SUMMARY: In accordance with the requirements of section 122(i)(1) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, as amended (CERCLA), notice is hereby given of two proposed de minimis settlements under section 122(g) concerning the Petrochem Recycling Corp./Ekotek, Inc., Site in Salt Lake City, Utah (the Site). The first proposed Administrative Order on Consent (AOC) (Settlement # 1) requires 15 potentially responsible parties (PRP) to pay an aggregate total of $231,922.08 to resolve their liability to the EPA related to response actions taken or to be taken at the Site. The terms of the proposed AOC for these settlements are identical to that recently approved and made effective by EPA November 16, 1994 (See Federal Register notice, dated September 2, 1994). Additionally, notice is given of four settlements that have changed from EPA's previous de minimis settlement notice. The second proposed AOC (Settlement # 2) requires 22 potentially responsible parties (PRP) to pay an aggregate total of $357,111.00 to resolve their liability to the EPA related to response actions taken or to be taken at the Site. The proposed AOC for Settlement # 2 involves settlement payments adjusted in consideration of the parties' ability to pay. DATES: Comments must be submitted by no later than January 26, 1995. ADDRESSES: Comments should be addressed to Greg Phoebe (8HWM&hyph;SR), Enforcement Specialist, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region VIII, 999 18th Street, Suite 500, Denver, Colorado 80202&hyph;2405, and should refer to: In the matter of Petrochem/Ekotek De Minimis Settlement. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: James M. Stearns, Office of Regional Counsel, EPA Region VIII, at (303) 294&hyph;7197. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Notice of section 122(g) De Minimis Settlements: Settlement # 1: In accordance with section 122(i)(1) of CERCLA, notice is hereby given that the terms of an Administrative Order on Consent (AOC) have been agreed to by the following 15 parties, for the following amounts: Option A Settlements: Moser Engine Service ($772.20); The Walt Disney Company ($69,634.00); B&W Garage, Inc. ($5,384.70); Davis County School District ($30,632.96); Transmission Limited ($11,985.30); Reo Mc Murdie ($1,173.44); Merritt Chevron ($8,059.68); Guy F. Atkinson Construction Company ($26,766.20); W&K Mobile Services, Inc. ($8,260.40); Western Drive Train ($9,788.96); and Industrial Compliance (3120.81). Option B Settlements: Polyclad Laminates ($16,335.00); Gus Paulos Chevrolet ($12,753.00); Holladay Conoco (Vaughn Smith Conoco) ($7,215.65); and Standard Transportation ($20,039.78). By the terms of the proposed AOC, these PRPs will together pay $231,922.08 to the Hazardous Substance Superfund (Superfund). The $231,922.08 represents approximately 0.3% of the total anticipated costs for the Site upon which this settlement was based. In addition, the following settlements represent changes from the de minimis settlements listed in EPA's Federal Register notice of September 2, 1994, under the AOC identical to the settlement noticed herein under Settlement # 1: Option A Settlements: Allied Petroleum of Reno ($51,384.32). Option B Settlements: ASF&hyph;24 (U.S. Army) ($3,528.36); Discount Tire and Automotive, Inc. ($5,550.50); For Douglas (Transportation Motor Pool) ($20,092.05); and Parley's Way Conoco ($4,701.60). EPA has determined that it is necessary to reissue the public notice for these settlements. In exchange for payment, U.S. EPA will provide the settling parties with a covenant not to sue for liability under sections 106 and 107(a) of CERCLA, including liability for EPA past costs, the one-time cost of remedy, future EPA oversight costs, future operation and maintenance of the as-yet unselected remedy, and under section 7003 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended (also known as the Resources Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)). The amount that each individual PRP will pay, as shown above for Settlement # 1, equals $2.97 multiplied by the number of gallons of waste the party sent to the Site (Base Amount), plus a premium payment of either 30% or 120% of the Base Amount, as specified by each Respondent PRP in the AOC. The per gallon charge of $2.97 was calculated by dividing the total estimated response costs for the Site ($69,594,403) by the total estimated volume of waste disposed of at the Site (23,454,592 gallons). For parties paying a 30% premium, the ``Option A'' settlement, there is an exception to the covenant not to sue if total response costs at the Site exceed $69,594,403. If this amount were exceeded, EPA could sue these parties for all or a portion of the overage. For parties paying the 120% premium, the ``Option B'' settlement, the exception to the covenant not to sue does not apply.
