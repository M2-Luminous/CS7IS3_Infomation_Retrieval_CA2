The authors of the statement expressed utter regret and concern over the frustration of the Russo-Ukrainian talks on dividing the fleet. They believe that the "struggle for political power and the presidency of Ukraine becomes a factor which can turn the process of negotiations on the problems of the Black Sea Fleet into a military conflict." Attempts are being made to lay the blame for a possible break-up of Ukraine's statehood on the Republic of the Crimea and severely punish it for that. It is no problem by means of provocations to bring about an unstable situation in the republic and, making use of that, introduce a state-of-emergency regime, putting Russia-Ukraine relations on the brink of war, the authors of the statement maintain.
