He said this when he received four Indonesian journalists, one of whom was Nasir Tamara from REPUBLIKA, at his office in Tel Aviv, Israel last Monday evening. According to Rabin, there has been no official timetable for mutual recognition and diplomatic relations. However, he added that the two nations could first get to know each other before establishing diplomatic relations. "As Israeli prime minister, I hope that the establishment of diplomatic relations will be realized as soon as possible. However, we know that all this will be a long process and will depend on the Israeli-Palestinian peace process as well," said Rabin. Rabin believed that "the way to peace between Israel and the Arabs is also through a rapproachement between Israel and the Islamic World. Thus, support from Indonesia as a country which has the largest Islamic population in the world will be very important and crucial." Rabin said that he and President Suharto "agreed to gradually create conditions -- business relations, as an example -- to pave the way for better relations" when he visited Jakarta some time ago. Rabin once again reiterated that Israel "wants to coexist peacefully with the Palestinians." While the PLO has recognized the existence of Israel, Israel itself has refused to recognize the existence of Palestine. Khalid Mawardi, head of the Political Department of the Nahdlatul Ulama [Association of Muslim Scholars] Central Executive Committee, regarded the Israeli-PLO agreement signed in Washington last year as an initial step and said the agreement cannot strongly justify the establishment of diplomatic relations between Indonesia and Israel. According to Khalid, Israel remains a colonizer as long as the Jewish state does not quit all Arab territories -- the West Bank, Jerusalem, the Golan Heights, southern Lebanon, and the Gaza Strip -- which it occupied during and after the 1967 war. A similar reaction came from Sumargono, chairman of the Indonesian Committee for Solidarity with the Islamic World. "Israel is an aggressor as long as it continues to occupy Arab territories. As this continues, it would be improper to have diplomatic relations with Israel," he said. According to Sumargono, Indonesian Muslims are not psychologically ready for such relations. "There could be upheavals if this is done. The Muslims are deeply injured over Israel's current brutal acts against the Palestinians." Mr. Riza Sihbudi, political observer from the Indonesian Institute of Sciences and senior lecturer at the Department of International Relations at the Faculty of Social and Political Sciences of the University of Indonesia, said the establishment of diplomatic relations with Israel is a sensitive issue. "We must be careful. We must truly think about their advantages and disadvantages," said Riza, the author of a book entitled "The Middle East, Islamic World, and American Hegemony."
