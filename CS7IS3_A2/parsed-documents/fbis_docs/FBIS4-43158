[passage omitted] Edouard Balladur may have been waiting for the release of these final results before reacting. This morning, the prime minister regretted the break-up of the French delegation in Strasbourg. He was keen to add the 12 percent achieved by Philippe de Villiers's list to the 25 percent gained by the Baudis list in assessing the weight of the majority. On a visit to Lille, Edouard Balladur launched his strategy for the coming months, during a year which--although he has denied it-- will focus on the presidential elections. Jerome Cathala and Yves Barbe report: [Cathala] Whether we have European elections or not, Edouard Balladur is intent on pursuing his policies. In Lille this morning, he explained that the performance of the Baudis list was not a failure. For him, this result shows, on the contrary, that the strategy of uniting the majority is more indispensable than ever. For Edouard Balladur, this is a way of putting the European elections behind him and of thinking about what comes next: [Begin Balladur recording] The goal of the government over the next six months will be, first and foremost, to continue the recovery and to accelerate it up if need be, despite the difficulties of the moment. Second, we will call for the largest possible union, and I am convinced that this is what the French are waiting for. They are not going to spend the next year under the stress of opinion polls and the next presidential elections. [end recording] [passage omitted]
