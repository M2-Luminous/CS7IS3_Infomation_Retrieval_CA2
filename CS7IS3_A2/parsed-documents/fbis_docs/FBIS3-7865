It is headed by Gebhardt von Moltke, deputy to the NATO secretary general for political affairs. After the talks at the Slovak Republic Foreign Affairs Ministry, where they were received by State Secretary Jan Lisuch, they met journalists. Michal Berko reports: [Berko] The aim of the visit from Brussels is to specify the implementation of the Partnership for Peace program, State Secretary Jan Lisuch said and added: [Lisuch] "As to the Slovak Republic, we note that, altogether, we are prepared for participation in the Partnership for Peace program. We have been training people who will be active directly at the Coordination Center. Naturally, we consider the Partnership for Peace program a beginning of political and military cooperation with NATO, the first step toward future activities as members in NATO." [Berko] After this brief explanation, Gebhardt von Moltke took the floor. He said that Slovakia had been very intensively involved in cooperation with NATO, that the Partnership for Peace program was not the beginning of this cooperation, but that it gave it a new dimension. It was based on the interests of the Slovak Republic. He recalled the good results of cooperation within the UN peace operations. He welcomed, above all, the fast and positive reaction of the Slovak Government in signing the framework document by Prime Minister Meciar. The talks we had here were open and took place in a friendly atmosphere, he said. He expressed the hope that a presentation [as heard] document will be quickly prepared in Slovakia on a sufficiently high authoritative level that would make it possible to transform the Partnership for Peace program into an implementation form. It should express the individual approach of Slovakia toward membership, but it should be a document that will endorse Slovakia's political obligations. Membership in NATO was not a membership in a stamp-collecting club, Gebhardt von Moltke said. Asked whether NATO had an order for accepting the countries of Central Europe--the question that was brought up by former U.S. Defense Secretary Dick Cheyney when he said yesterday that one had to quickly accept Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic into NATO, while omitting Slovakia--Mr. Moltke said dryly: Mr. Cheyney was defense secretary, but then he added: [Moltke] "I want to assure you that NATO has no pecking order, that it has not made any preliminary selection for acceptance." [Berko] Answering numerous questions as to what extent the process of the Partnership for Peace program can influence the development in Russia [words indistinct], von Moltke said that we considered expanding NATO as an element of stability also for Russia. All, however, depended on the behavior of Russia. As to the address by Boris Yeltsin, Mr. Moltke said that it was motivated by the internal political development in Russia. Russia, however, was an important element of stability and European security, and we wanted to cooperate with Russia if it were willing to defend and cooperate on the basis of democratic principles. [Moltke] We do not want to create new divisions and borders in Europe.
