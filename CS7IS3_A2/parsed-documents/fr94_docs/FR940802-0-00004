Respondents favoring the lower ARP percentages noted that the U.S. needs to produce more to take advantage of export opportunities and confirmed USDA's analysis that a lower ARP level results in higher producer incomes. Advocates for a zero-percent barley ARP indicated the need for adequate supplies to aggressively implement the Export Enhancement Program for barley. Respondents favored higher ARP percentages because feed grain prices would be higher, Government costs would be lower, and the rural economy would improve. Two respondents commented on whether or not malting barley producers should be exempt from the 1994 ARP requirement for barley. One respondent favored and one respondent opposed the malting barley exemption. After considering these comments, the Secretary announced on September 30, 1993, an ARP level of 5 percent for corn, and 0 percent for grain sorghum, barley, and oats, and that malting barley producers would not be exempt from complying with the 1994 barley ARP requirements. The Secretary was authorized to make adjustments in the 1994 ARP percentages no later than November 15, 1993. On November 15, 1993, the Secretary announced that the 1994 level for corn would be lowered from 5 percent to 0 percent. A change was warranted because 1994 feed grain supplies had decreased 8 percent since the September announcement. The Secretary determined that zero-percent ARP's for corn, grain sorghum, and barley would maintain U.S. competitiveness in world markets, provide adequate supplies of quality feed and food for domestic and foreign utilization, and support farm income. The corn ARP level of 0 percent is 12.5 percentage points below the statutory maximum of 12.5 percent. The 1949 Act provides that an ARP of 0 to 12.5 percent may be implemented if the corn ending S/U ratio for the previous marketing year is equal to or less than 25 percent. The corn ending S/U for the 1993/94 marketing year was estimated to be 16.6 percent when the 1994 ARP levels were announced on September 30 and 11.4 percent when the corn ARP was lowered on November 15. In the case of grain sorghum and barley, the 1949 Act provides for ARP percentages from 0 to 20 percent. Section 1104 of the Agricultural Reconciliation Act of 1990 provides for a minimum 7.5 percent ARP for the 1994 crop unless the 1993/94 corn ending S/U ratio is less than 20 percent. Since the 1993/94 corn S/U ratios estimated on September 30 and on November 15 were below 20 percent, the 7.5-percent minimum ARP does not apply. Table 4 shows the three different 1994 feed grain ARP options that were considered when determining the final 1994 ARP percentages.
