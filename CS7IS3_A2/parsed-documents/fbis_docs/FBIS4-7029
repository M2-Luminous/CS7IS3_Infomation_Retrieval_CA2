The North side headquarters of the National Alliance for the Country's Reunification says this in a statement released today in connection with the fact that a delegation of the North side could not participate in the memorial service on the one hundredth day after the death of Rev. Mun Ik-hwan due to the obstructive moves of the South Korean authorities. The statement says: This time, the South Korean authorities proved again that they are separatists who block even a small-scale contact of fellow countrymen, let alone national reconciliation and unity and the reunification of the country. The Korean nation cannot live in peace with the anti-national group left alone, the group which lowers the check-bar before fellow countrymen going to the South for a memorial service, while rendering the situation extremely strained in league with outside forces.
