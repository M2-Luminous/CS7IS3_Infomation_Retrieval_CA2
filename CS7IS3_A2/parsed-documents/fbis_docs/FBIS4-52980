The analyst says: It was for the purpose of veiling its nuclear arms development that Japan spread the rumor that North Korea had manufactured nuclear weapons, crying for international pressure and sanctions against it. The reality clearly indicates that the nuclear threat does not comes to Japan from the DPRK but comes to the latter from the former, assuming a very serious nature. With Japan accelerating nuclear armament, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would be meaningless and the joint declaration on denuclearization signed between the North and the South of Korea would be a dead duck. Japan's concealment of plutonium was disclosed for the first time. It was from several dozen years ago that Japan put its first nuclear facilities into operation. Nobody knows how much plutonium Japan has systematically concealed in this period. The Japanese authorities have vaunted that Japan was "a model" in accepting inspections of the International Atomic Energy Agency, claiming that the inspection of the DPRK was "insufficient" and it must accept "an additional inspection." This was a crafty trick to dull the strictness of the agency's inspection of Japan and make it to keep a sharp watch on the DPRK so that the plutonium concealed by Japan systematically might not be uncovered. The more desperately Japan provokes the DPRK the more fully the latter's transparency will be proved and the clearer Japan's sinister, shameless intention be revealed.
