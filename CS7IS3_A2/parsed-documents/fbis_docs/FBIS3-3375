Yang Size, a research fellow of the Physics Institute, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and a member of the Eighth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), noted that there is a gap between China and the United States, Japan, Russia and West European countries in nuclear fusion research. Yang, also head of the Taiwan Fellow-Students Association, went in 1972 from Taiwan to the United States, where he won a doctorate in physics from the University of California, Berkeley in 1978. He came to the Chinese mainland afterwards, engaging in nuclear engineering research in the Chinese Academy of Sciences as head of a research project. "On the mainland I can do what I want to do," he said. The 47-year-old physicist and his research group won financial assistance from the state natural science fund this year. Yang is one of China's tens of thousands of returned students. A number of them have become leaders in various fields. Since 1978 China has sent over 200,000 students to study in over 100 countries and regions, including the United States, Japan, Britain, France, Germany, Canada, Australia and Russia. So far, 70,000 have returned to China. A number of them have opened new research areas, some have become internationally-known scholars and others have been recognized as leaders in their respective fields. In the Shanghai branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, 83 percent of the 6,847 returned students have made at least one research achievement or patent each. Winners of state prizes number 905, and winners of ministerial prizes, 277. In 1993, the Chinese University of Science and Technology promoted 33 returned students to the rank of professor, accounting for 65 percent of the newly promoted. Gan Zizhao, academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and chief of the National Superconductor Expert Committee, and other members of the CPPCC National Committee suggested that China further improve political and economic conditions for young scientists. In July 1985, China instituted its post-doctorate system, which has led to the establishment of 300 post-doctorate stations with 1,800 post-doctorate researchers throughout China. Dalian and other coastal cities have erected residential buildings for post-doctorate researchers. The Chinese Academy of Sciences, which sent 11,736 persons to study abroad between 1978 and 1993, has adopted flexible policies to encourage Chinese students studying abroad to contribute to China through multiple channels, including carrying out short-term research projects.
