Realising it is short on economic and financial expertise, the military leadership has wisely sought professional advice abroad. But it has proved reluctant to implement that advice in full, the analysts say. The fear, they say, is that the drastic steps that would benefit Burma in the long run would have serious short-term repercussions on an already low standard of living among the populace. "The military leaders are moving along at a snail's pace, adjusting here and twiddling there, when they should be taking some hard decisions for the country's future," a Western diplomat commented. "No one wants to be another Mikhail Gorbachev," another diplomat said, referring to the former Soviet leader whose attempts at economic reform helped bring about his downfall. A key issue is the devaluation of the kyat, which outside experts have said is essential to promote business and investment. One Rangoon-based businessman described the inflated kyat as a "tremendous barrier" to trade. (The official exchange rate is about six kyats to the US dollar, but the widely-used black market rate is 100-120 kyats to the dollar.) Lieutenant General Tun Kyi, minister for trade and a member of the ruling junta, known as the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), is among those who rule out a devaluation. In a recent interview with AFP, Tun Kyi denied the inflated exchange rate had much of an effect on external trade, and he pointed to the "side effects" such as sky-rocketing domestic prices that devaluation would bring. The real problem today, he said, is that production, which should be "the engine of our economic development," is insufficient. His priority, he said, is to boost production. Tun Kyi said the government was working to eliminate technical barriers to trade and open the country's doors to business. "We want to trade and have trade relations with any country, big or small," he stressed. Burma would also like to get credit facilities from major international financial institutions, but they are controlled by Western states which are withholding approval to underscore their disapproval of Rangoon's human rights record. Referring obliquely to the West's policy of isolation, Tun Kyi stressed Burma's independent mentality. "We have some pride," he said. "We would rather die than beg." A local businessman was more direct, asking why Burma's 42 million people should suffer "for just one person," a reference to leading dissident Aung San Suu Kyi, now in her fifth year of house arrest. A leading economist at the foreign ministry also stressed Burma's independent tradition, saying that the suspension of aid from donor countries did not worry the Burmese, who "want the economy back in their own hands." Most analysts agreed that Rangoon would not release Aung San Suu Kyi in the near future, but was banking on the hoped-for emergence of a more pragmatic approach by the West to boost the economy. A Western diplomat argued that the government should not wait too long to make the financial and economic adjustments required. After decades of isolation, "expectations are zero" among the populace, he said. But the military government, betraying its inexperience in international finance, is "paranoid about creating debt," he said.
