A ranking government official said Wednesday that the government would seek to solve the problem by accepting the Paris Club payment terms for part of the loans and receiving payment in kind for the remainder. Of the 1.47 billion U.S. dollars in loans extended to the former Soviet Union, the funds that had matured at the end of 1993 and overdue interest now total 380 million dollars. At a working-level meeting held in Seoul late last month, Russia offered to assume responsibility for repaying the loans if South Korea agreed to reschedule them according to the agreement reached with the Paris Club of Western creditor nations. South Korea countered that Russia pay part of the loans in kind, such as in aluminum and other industrial materials, opposing repayment of all of the loans under the Paris Club terms. The Paris Club terms stipulate installment repayment over five years after a two-year grace period.
