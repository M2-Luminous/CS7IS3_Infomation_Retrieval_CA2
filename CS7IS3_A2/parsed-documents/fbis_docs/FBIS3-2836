Generally, it is promising to revitalize state enterprises, CPPCC members said at a press conference here today. "Large- and medium-sized state-owned enterprises have made important contributions to the state in the past decades and served as the main pillars in the national economy. During the current reform, they have remarkable advantages, too, such as advanced equipment, strong technical force and rich experience, and state policy support," said Wan Guoquan, vice chairman of the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association. At the press conference held by the news center of the current session of the CPPCC National Committee, Wan said that the central government's reform measures have provided favorable conditions for the revitalization of the state enterprises. Li Gang, adviser to the China National Automotive Industry Corporation, said though one-third of state enterprises are losing money, the state coffers derive 67 percent of the revenues from the state enterprises. Professor Wang Yu, a well known economist, said that poor performance of state enterprises are attributed to many factors. Their burdens of debts, pension, medical care and various levies swallow a considerable part of the enterprises' income. But, the fundamental reasons are drawbacks in the management and operational system. He said that the central government has set clear target and formulated concrete measures to restructure state enterprises. The planned modern enterprise system will clearly define the property rights and responsibilities of enterprises, separate the functions of the government from those of enterprises, and put enterprise management on a scientific track. In the process of building a modern enterprise system, "state enterprises will play a role as the major impetus for growth of the national economy," he said. Asked about the consequences of resumption of China's status in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, Zhang Jusheng, chairman of the Heifei Meiling Company, said the resumption of China's status in GATT will promote China's economic development as well as producing impact on its national industry. He believes his refrigerator company is competitive in the world. Wan Guoquan said that state enterprise cannot live on government "blood transfusion" loans forever. "If an enterprise keeps losing money for a long time, the government will have to leave it and let it go bankrupt," he said. Asked whether the contradictions between enterprises and workers will become serious when more companies go bankrupt, Wan answered the Chinese Government and enterprises have always made their best to guarantee the livelihood of workers and the workers are also cooperative with the government and enterprises. He said the difficulty will be temporary. The state will continuously provide preferential policies to enterprises so as to ensure the livelihood of workers during the transition period.
