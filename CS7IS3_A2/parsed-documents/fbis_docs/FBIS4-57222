In Panama, thanks to men and women like you, the democratic consolidation process, which in other regions takes decades, has been accomplished in a very short period of time and has been built on very solid bases. This is the conclusion of an effort that has earned the praise of the foreign media and has been a surprise for some of our own fellow citizens. Disputes, recriminations, confrontations, and arguments are now behind us, and behind us are also, let's hope forever, political campaigns stained by violence and elections blemished by doubts. The country began to change beginning early Monday morning, not because one or another candidate had secured the majority of the votes of the Panamanians, but because everybody accepted unaffectedly and like a gentleman the results of the previous day. Those of us who have acquired the commitment of promoting reconciliation in the country, accept it with joy but calmly, enthusiastically but without any intention of boasting before others about this privilege from the voters. I must also say, and let this be a public tribute of respect, that our adversaries exhibited the patriotic altruism and the political generosity of closing, on the elections night, the wounds that the political confrontation could have opened. They also deserve our homage. [applause] In January 1990, taking a step that at that time was not understood, I visited President Endara to express our dissatisfaction with some measures that had been adopted. I told him that I categorically would initiate an opposition to his government. He told me that during his mandate, a democratic opposition would enjoy broad guarantees. Today I must acknowledge, very sincerely, that I opposed his government and that President Endara showed respect for the opposition. This acknowledgment is necessary today because all of us have witnessed his effort to pave the road to an orderly transfer of power. I cannot mention all the persons who made the democratic fiesta we now enjoy possible. But it would be unfair of me to fail to point out the exemplary behavior of the Public Force, yesterday arbiter of politics, and now the guarantor of constitutionality. The Justice and Peace Commission and the electoral delegates deserve the same public admiration. The respect they earned and the impartiality they exhibited were enough to quench infrequent outbreaks of violence and to guarantee to the citizens that this electoral struggle would see only three weapons: ideas, enthusiasm, and votes. Since all the citizens, regardless of age or sex, were the true heroes of this democratic event, I want to conclude my statement by paying homage of respect and admiration to the three forefathers who, to the satisfaction and pride of everybody, comprise, and let us hope, will continue to comprise, the Electoral Tribunal. [applause] They made us get used to listening to a song whose words are now a beautiful truth: We are the builders of the fatherland! Thank you! [applause]
