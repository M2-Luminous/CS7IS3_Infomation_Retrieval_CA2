Among them is a 15,000 ton cargo ship Hyoksin. Twenty years have elapsed since the cargo ship Hyoksin set sail in 1974. Since then it has come to anchor in ports of different countries in Asia, Europe, Africa and other regions. It has carried essential goods to ports in 12 countries and regions including Vietnam, China, Sri Lanka, Hong Kong, India and Indonesia in the period from late July 1993 to late March 1994. Thus, it has made more than 120 navigations across the ocean over the past 20 years, transporting several million tons of cargo to nearly 300 ports of more than 30 countries. The ship has fulfilled its annual plan at more than 112 percent, thus contributing to the development of foreign trade of the DPRK. The captain of the ship became a labour hero. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il highly appreciated the success made by the ship in the past and sent thanks to its crew in October last year.
