Many say he is Alija Izetbegovic's right hand. However, circles close to the authorities report that he is close to Izetbegovic primarily due to the fact that he is best acquainted with military technological potential and its possible applications. They say: "Izetbegovic needs Ganic, but Izetbegovic is afraid Ganic will seize power. Ganic makes many decisions on his own, without consulting with anyone." The inhabitants of Sarajevo have different opinions about Ganic. Some think he is capable and necessary, especially at a time like this, and that he must be given more authority and competence. Others recall his Sandzak origin and ekavian dialect [dialect spoken in Serbia proper], the fact that he entered the presidency as the representative of the Yugoslavs, and that he does not observe strict fasting during Ramadan. We could notice he does not fast during Ramadan when he received us in the building of the Presidency. He had coffee and juice with us at the time of the day when that is forbidden by the Koran. Ganic is a skillful diplomat. He tries to forget to give the answer to every sensitive question. Since, in the past couple of days, the most topical issue was the agreement on cessation of hostilities between the Croats and the Muslims and the negotiations in Washington on the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation, we began this interview by talking about that. * * * I Barely Managed To Stay Alive [Soldic] Mr. Ganic, this is the 14th or the 15th agreement on the cessation of hostilities between the Croats and the Muslims. What do you think are the prospects of this agreement? [Ganic] Its prospects are good. We took all political and military steps for its implementation. We are creating a climate on the ground for this agreement to be respected. A couple of minutes ago, I talked to commanding officers on the phone. They confirmed that results are excellent on the ground. [Soldic] Who took the initiative to sign the agreement? [Ganic] You see, the climate has been created by all sides. We have held many talks, made many agreements. We have always wanted to stop fighting. It was not logical to fight against the Croats. But we also knew we were not fighting the entire Croatian nation, but merely a faction of the Croats. The inhabitants of Dubrovnik, people in Dalmatia, Istria, Zagreb, Slavonia have always advocated Bosnia. Unfortunately, we could not establish a proper dialogue with the Herzegovinians. I am the first politician from Bosnia-Herzegovina who visited the Croat village of Ravno, near Trebinje, when it was destroyed, and not a single Herzegovinian politician set foot in the village for days. [Soldic] Since you mentioned Ravno, the president of the Presidency has often been reproached for not having reacted properly at the time when the village was attacked. [Ganic] I went to visit the village the day it was attacked. No one in the Croatian press will mention that. They recorded it with television cameras as well as the statement I gave in Ravno. I said: "This is terrible." The village was completely destroyed. I was stunned. I barely managed to stay alive. [Soldic] But for some three or four days, President Izetbegovic did not make any statement and a part of his territory was attacked. [Ganic] I went there and made a statement. [Soldic] Who proposed the federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina Croats and the Muslims? [Ganic] We proposed the federation several months ago in Zagreb, during the session of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency I presided over. Do you remember the session of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency in Zagreb? We kept making that proposal. And then the United States and Germany said: "That proposal is not bad at all." It was planned, first of all, to reach an agreement between the Croats and the Muslims. If the Serbs do not agree to the confederation, then we will see what they want. They cannot just take away a part of the territory. If they want to leave Bosnia-Herzegovina, then that opens a series of other problems. [Soldic] If the Bosnia-Herzegovina borders should change, will you demand the annexation of Sandzak? [Ganic] If the borders of Bosnia-Herzegovina should change, there would be another 150 countries demanding the same. And that is why Europe never allowed changing borders. If borders should nevertheless be changed, we would demand the integrity of the country. Why should we not enter the belly of the Serbs, if they are doing the same to us. However, it will not come to that. Sandzak will get the same kind of autonomy as the Serbs in Knin. [Soldic] Do you think it is realistic to expect a federation with the Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina? Is it possible to impose that on Milosevic and Karadzic? On the other hand, I do not see a political party in Serbia that could seize power and change the relation toward Bosnia-Herzegovina. [Ganic] Milosevic and Karadzic are, first of all, people who have tens of millions of dollars. You must be aware of that. On the other hand, when Milosevic feels the pressure, Karadzic is gone for a couple of hours. If the international community should simultaneously adhere to the principle which persecutes criminals of war, then Karadzic would automatically be put on trial. The Serbs can obey perfectly when they have to. The Serbs Must Be Stretched Out [Soldic] How do you interpret the change of political course of the international community toward Bosnia-Herzegovina? [Ganic] Great Britain has supported the Serbs from the start. To some extent, the French have supported Great Britain in that, so as to hinder the growing influence of Germany in this region. Actually, that is a very primitive concept: Slobodan Milosevic was found to create a chaos here, so that this part of Europe would not merge with Asia and so that Germany would not dominate over it. However, tolerating a fascist like Milosevic, with the project of greater Serbia, resulted in another fascist with the project of greater Russia. That made the French change their politics. This is a global aberration. Serbia has crossed the Drina. The Drina River has always been a border. The United States suggested Great Britain should support the change of concept toward Bosnia-Herzegovina. I expect to see better days for Bosnia. [Soldic] Lately, one often hears that, in addition to political support of the United States, Bosnia also gets substantial financial aid. [Ganic] I do not want to comment on that. After all, the United States defends the consistency of its policies in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In my opinion, they have made a good political move. They first left it up to Europe to solve the problem of Bosnia. As is now obvious, the Europeans can not or will not do that, so the United States decided to get more actively involved. You can see that from the Sarajevo ultimatum and from the support to the proposal about Bosnia-Herzegovina federation. [Soldic] Does Bosnia-Herzegovina, apart from political support, get any financial support from Islamic countries? [Ganic] We get significant financial aid. [Soldic] The NATO ultimatum about Sarajevo did not prove to be determined enough, it seems. The Serbs have not withdrawn their weapons, not everything has been put under the control of the UNPROFOR [United Nations Protection Forces], and there were no air strikes after all. [Ganic] This is nevertheless the biggest move since the beginning of the war. I am sure they will be more decisive in future, as we could see this time. [Soldic] The inhabitants of Sarajevo say the UNPROFOR is to blame for the fact that the NATO plan has not been implemented to the full. And you made a statement on Bosnia-Herzegovina Television after the ultimatum expired that you were not satisfied with the work of the UNPROFOR. [Ganic] They are to blame for having tolerated the Serbs, who did not do anything for eight days. And when they did get around to doing it, they could not manage to complete it in two days. The UNPROFOR always supports the stronger side. And they always have the same excuse -- that they do not have enough soldiers. They did not need Russian soldiers who proved in Croatia that they are not neutral. But we gave a clear message to Russian soldiers. They should think twice before they do anything next time. [Soldic] The Sarajevo model of disarming the warring factions is soon to be applied in Tuzla, Mostar, and Vitez. Can the same model be applied to those other areas as well? How "soon" will that be? [Ganic] It can be applied in some towns. However, it is not such a good solution for others. Resolution No. 836, which was adopted before, is better. It includes the withdrawal of heavy artillery and the withdrawal of the Serbian army. But they get panicky even when they must only withdraw their heavy artillery. This war of Serbia is actually the war of artillery against civilians. In Sarajevo they say: "You are safest at the front line with soldiers." And that is the weakness of that regime. That is why we must not yield to the Serbs, for no such army has ever won a war. And that is why I have always said that the Serbs must be stretched out. But the Presidency is a collective body and we must coordinate our views. We Are Opening Roads in Central Bosnia [Soldic] The Croatian media broadcast your statement which announced that you would clean central Bosnia. [Ganic] With regard to central Bosnia, your media often broadcast things that were not said. I said we would open roads in central Bosnia and seize key positions which will enable our army to function. We managed to do that. We connected Bugojno to Travnik, Travnik to Zenica. We were fighting for Vitez. In a way, it was a battle for communications. Why do we control Fojnica? Because we go to Zenica from Fojnica via Konjic. From Zenica, we go to Tuzla via Vares. We had to have that communication route. [Soldic] How come that, in a couple of months, you conquered several towns controlled by the HVO? [Ganic] Vares was besieged to the extent that it was impossible to defend it. [Soldic] Did you make any agreements with the HVO to withdraw? [Ganic] No, believe me. There were no agreements. Vares was completely surrounded. We had the 2d Corps, the forces of the 1st and 3d Corps. It was impossible to defend Vares. They managed to get out, but they were wrong in dragging the people along. We demanded that UNPROFOR enter Vares as soon as possible. We asked Monsignor Puljic to go to Vares and stop people from getting out. We kept fighting against ethnic cleansing. Boban had very little feeling for the Croats from central Bosnia. [Soldic] Why did you attack Vares? [Ganic] The Chetniks were coming into town from the hills. They came to do their shopping, and we had to pay for passage from Zenica to Tuzla. [Soldic] Fojnica? [Ganic] We had to liberate Fojnica. There was a problem regarding communications. [Soldic] Bugojno? Who began first? [Ganic] In the beginning, we fought together against the Chetniks. The Army was better organized and the HVO withdrew after a couple of days of fighting. [Soldic] Konjic, Travnik? [Ganic] We had the 17th Krajina brigade there, which is very strong. They liberated Travnik from the HVO in a flash. And commands were very strange too. Some units fought to the end and some simply withdrew. But the Croats also had the dilemma as to why they were fighting. The HVO has never had a clear program regarding their goals in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Boban wanted a state for himself. [Soldic] Was Vitez attacked because of the territory or because of the explosives factory controlled by the HVO? Military experts who are well acquainted with military technology of that factory (both the one before the war as well as today's) say that those explosives cannot be used for weapons, that those explosives can only be used in civil engineering. Can they also be used for military purposes? [Ganic] Before the war, I returned from the United States and took over the development of UNIS. UNIS was the largest manufacturer of weapons and military equipment in former Yugoslavia. I founded military and technological institute. The production has been going on for years and documentation was kept in Belgrade. I was chosen to buy technology for the factory in Vitez. I know exactly what they have. [Soldic] Then tell me, can the explosives in Vitez be used for military purposes? Can they be used for making mortars? [Ganic] There are two factories there: "Vitezit" and the "SPS." There are two possibilities. The HVO exaggerated the importance of that factory. The factory should not be destroyed for other reasons. Because there are certain standards. The story that it cannot be destroyed is a fairy tale. The way they think, they could not destroy it. [paragraph as published] Boban Made a Deal With Karadzic [Soldic] Why was there fighting in central Bosnia? [Ganic] There was fighting in central Bosnia because Boban made an agreement with Karadzic to tie our forces so as to prevent us from advancing toward the Chetniks. But, on the other hand, also because he wanted to create a state within a state. He wanted to separate a part of Bosnia. Both our and Croatian forces were involved at the wrong place. And the Serbs took advantage of that. They say that Croat-Muslim conflicts are the "sweet part of the news." That is a strategic mistake, but it is never too late. The Croats desire to return to Bosanska Posavina, central Bosnia -- all who went away are welcome back. The Croats have two countries: Croatia and Bosnia. But Bosnia does not only belong to the Croats, but also to the Bosniaks, the Muslims, and the Serbs. But it is senseless to risk the existence of both countries. If you divide Bosnia, it would be difficult to convince the Serbs in Knin not to demand the same. Realizing the concept of the federation of the Muslims and the Croats, which would include Posavina and the Drina basin, would leave the Serbs from Knin without arguments. [Soldic] In Croatia, they say that Komsic and Kljuic are just puppets in the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, that they make no decisions, and only serve Izetbegovic to show to the world that his presidency is organized on the principle of national parity. However, I have read some statements by both Komsic and Kljuic, released a couple of months ago, and they said there was no discussion nor voting about the offensive against Vares, or about the transformation of the HVO in Sarajevo. [Ganic] You see, when he became a member of the Presidency, Komsic started working very hard. Kljuic was a member of the Presidency, then he resigned, and then got back to the Presidency in a different way. They participate in making decisions, although I must admit that in the beginning, when the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army was being created, most important decisions were indeed made by President Izetbegovic and myself. Those who work are influential in the Presidency. Those who do not do any work, do not get to make any decisions. Today, I had to commit myself on the arrival of more Russian soldiers to Sarajevo. I said 400 was more than enough. I took that political risk and am responsible for that. [Soldic] Stjepan Siber is no longer deputy commander of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army. Did he resign or was he replaced? [Ganic] His wife became ill. He went to Switzerland for treatment. He asked to accompany her. He now works for our diplomatic service. [Soldic] The Bosnia-Herzegovina Army mobilizes the Sarajevo Croats to fight against the Croats in central Bosnia. I think that the Army and the Presidency ought to show some consideration for this very sensitive situation. [Ganic] I can safely claim that those units that surrounded Vitez had an insignificant percentage of the Croats. The Croats were mostly sent toward the north to Tuzla. But, believe me, some Croats advocate Bosnia, and they are first of all Bosnians and then Croats. Eighty heroes, young Croats, gave their lives for Sarajevo. That will never be forgotten. The Croats have made a significant contribution in the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army. Zelic Should Be Put on Public Trial [Soldic] During a couple of days I stayed in Sarajevo, I heard many Croats say they feel like second-rate citizens. Do they fear for their physical and existential survival? [Ganic] It is possible there were some isolated incidents, but as far as global politics is concerned, the Croats are at home here. They enjoy the same rights as other nations. Bishop Puljic is here from the beginning of the war. We must respect that. The Croats did much for development and culture both before and during the war. One should not make statistics on the basis of isolated incidents. We made an analysis of theft and murders in Sarajevo. The Muslims were killed in 90 percent of the cases. [Soldic] Why is Slavko Zelic in prison? [Ganic] They say he was doing what was forbidden. Kljuic visited him in prison. I would like his to be a public trial. Come and inform your public why Slavko Zelic is put on trial. Among other things, he wanted to act in Sarajevo following instructions from Mate Boban of Grude. [Soldic] In conclusion, can we say that you think Bosnia is not a state which is disappearing, but a state in the making? [Ganic] Bosnia is a state which is recovering.
