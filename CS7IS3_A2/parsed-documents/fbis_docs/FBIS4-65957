At his news conference in Mikkeli, Ahtisaari rejected a statement made by Defense Minister Elisabeth Rehn, according to which it would be totally mad to cover the Russian debt with arms purchases. Ossi Kervinen reports. [Begin recording] [Kervinen] The Defense Ministry announced in a press statement yesterday that the ministry has neither agreed nor negotiated on arms procurement from Russia to cover Russian debt. Today, however, the supreme commander of the defense forces, President Martti Ahtisaari, said that during his visit to Russia he had talks about possible new arms purchases, according to a list drawn up by the Defense Ministry. [Ahtisaari] I do not remember now the contents of the list because there were many such matters which did not mention any amounts. For example, there is a requirement for helicopters, but the list did not say how many helicopters. They wanted to find out what was possibly available and suitable. [Kervinen] Aimo Pajunen, chief secretary of the Defense Ministry, confirmed in the afternoon that the president has a list with him, but not a shopping list. The list, the contents of which Pajunen did not reveal either, emphasizes the high-tech areas which Finland would be willing to discuss. Generally, such familiarization will lead to procurement if the price and the quality are agreeable. Regarding the helicopters, we know that the Mi-8 helicopters of the air force are aging. New helicopters will be needed sooner or later. The procurement of helicopters was taken up during the winter when the procurement agreements, which were signed with Russia in March, were prepared. A protocol was signed with Russia in March on this year's procurements from Russia. The deal, which is worth 100 million markkas, gives us mainly ammunition and spare parts for the land forces. At the same time, a protocol was signed which liquidates accounts receivables worth 450 million markkas of the old debt of the former Soviet Union. With this money, modern, light Igla air defense missiles will be acquired together with artillery equipment and ammunition. Defense Minister Elisabeth Rehn said in a press interview yesterday that it is totally mad to cover Russia's debts by arms procurement when we do not even know whether we need such cheap arms. This statement has caused serious rancor in the defense forces and in Rehn's own ministry. The defense forces say that they have received only good and useful arms from Russia and also from Germany; a poor country cannot afford to buy bad equipment. During Defense Minister Rehn's period in office, the defense forces appear to have received a lot of positive publicity and understanding. In one press interview, which also mentioned the dispute over appointing the chief secretary of the Defense Ministry, Rehn is said to have destroyed everything. What also makes Rehn's statement odd in the case of arms procurement is that she and her ministry drew up all these lists. This aspect was also raised by President Ahtisaari when he commented on Rehn's statement. [Ahtisaari] Well, as a matter of fact all these proposals have come from Rehn's ministry, so I do not believe that anybody has proposed anything other than what has been proposed by the ministry.
