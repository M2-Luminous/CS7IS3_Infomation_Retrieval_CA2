The UK foreign secretary may, out of pity, pay lip service to that resolution; other politicians elsewhere may do the same. However, the issue, with its serious political aspects, is linked to the actual circumstances of U.S. policy. The United States is using its clout to ensure that the UN recommendation makes no mention of Resolution 425. This resolution is losing its relevance with the passage of time. Speaking in a television interview, Fadlallah called on Lebanese officials to exhibit toward the resistance the same commitment shown by President Hafiz al-Asad. Lebanon is drifting aimlessly and its political life is coming unhinged, he stated. Fadlallah said that Geneva summit has created a new atmosphere, but atmosphere alone is not enough. The summit may grease the wheels of the negotiations and cement Syrian-U.S. ties. The Arab region is in a state of flux, he remarked.
