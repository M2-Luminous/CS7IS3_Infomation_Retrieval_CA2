In assessing the executive branch's performance a little more than a month after President Eduardo Frei assumed the presidency, Arriagada said: "Either there is a spirit of constructive and loyal relationship between the government and opposition or a climate of inflexibility and confrontation will prevail in the country." The government has thus intervened for the first time in the controversy between the Coalition of Parties for Democracy and the opposition regarding the right's role. The government parties accuse the right of abandoning the policy of agreement due to the imposition of the UDI's [Independent Democratic Union] rigid viewpoints within this sector, which are not in harmony with the National Renewal Party members who uphold a more moderate stance. On 16 April, as he assessed the first 35 days of Frei's government, Arriagada said the government has shown great initiative and is leading the country toward a constructive debate that takes the country's true problems into account. He said: "We might have some style problems but that is only natural for such a complex task and for a team that has just been sworn in." He commented that three days ago the government quietly defined "an interesting privatization proposal that is pragmatic and not ideological. The upcoming sale of 12 percent of Edelnor [Northern Electricity Company] strictly complies with our electric power policy that believes that competition and separating generating activities from the transmission activities is the best policy. The state's participation in LAN [Chilean Airline] has become unnecessary, as well as limiting the private sector's participation to 35 percent of the capital of Empremar [State Maritime Enterprise], which was justified in the past. The same goes for Transcontainer." Arriagada also stated that the measures announced on 15 April by the finance minister are also in keeping with a state that promotes a greater opening of the exchange markets, the strengthening of the export sectors, and the opening of capital accounts. Arriagada also upheld the executive branch's attitude regarding [Carabinero Director General Rodolfo] Stange's case, asserting that it was the only solution compatible with the principle of probity and justice the government firmly upholds. In this regard he said that the "right focuses its criticisms on irrelevant matters, but every day fewer Chileans believe that the chief of police of a responsible state can be both guarantor of the citizenry's safety and involved in a court case. The issue was handled with respect for Stange and the Carabineros, and the government exercised restraining leadership on its political supporters, thus preventing the conflict from turning into an escalation of scandalous accusations and even the untimely discussion of constitutional matters that, although related -- such as the fact that the government does not have the authority to remove the [Carabineros] director general, could have caused uncertainty." In Arriagada's opinion, "the fact that the so-called `Stange crisis' by no means affected the unprecedented working and cooperative climate with the Armed Forces speaks well of the government." As for the constitutional reforms, "a matter that has existed since the first day of the transition," Arriagada asserted: "The government has made a positive proposal, rejecting the idea of sponsoring reforms that involve a partial viewpoint, and has chosen to invite the political parties to discuss them from a nationwide viewpoint such as deciding what sort of municipal system modernization is the best, what sort of modernization of Congress do Chileans aspire to." In this regard, Arriagada said, the government has asked the political parties to untangle a debate that was gradually reduced to "inflexible" and "weak" attitudes and mentioned that discussions regarding the electoral system's reform started on 15 April.
