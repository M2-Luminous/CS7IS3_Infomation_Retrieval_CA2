Meanwhile, over 290,000 cases which had occurred before 1993 were also solved in that year. This serves to show that the public security organs have enhanced their case-cracking capacity and have increased the intensity of their struggle against crimes. Among the 1.61 million criminal cases handled by public security organs across the country in 1993, 539,000 were major and serious ones, representing an 18-percent increase over 1992. Of all the major and serious cases, 302,000 robbery cases involved an amount of 2,000 yuan and above, a 20.2-percent increase over the 1992 figure and accounting for 60 percent of all major cases. Moreover, a 23.4- percent increase has been registered in the number of major criminal cases cracked by public security organs which occurred in the same year, bringing the number up to 370,000. The spokesman has also pointed out that the present security situation remains grim in a handful of cities and counties, where murders, robberies, and "highway and railway lootings" are happening all the time. The masses in those areas have vehemently condemned the practice. In view of such a situation, the Ministry of Public Security has called on public security organs in all localities to strike more relentless blows at crime and pay special attention to rectifying the social order of problem-ridden areas.
