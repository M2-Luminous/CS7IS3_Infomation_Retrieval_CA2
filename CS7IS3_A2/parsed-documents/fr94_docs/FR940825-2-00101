FR940825-2-00101 FR940825-2-00070 Pursuant to section 207.45(b)(2) of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (19 CFR 207.45(b)(2)), the Commission published a notice in the Federal Register requesting comments as to whether the alleged changed circumstances warranted the institution of a review investigation. 59 FR 29619 (June 8, 1994). Because the alleged changed circumstances related to the U.S. market and were not unique to Canadian imports, the Commission also sought comment on whether it should self-initiate a review regarding imports of iron construction castings from Brazil, India, and China. Comments were received both in opposition to and in favor of the petition. Summarizing the impact of the alleged changed circumstances in a supplemental comment to their petition, the petitioners estimated that only 18&hyph;38 percent of the total U.S. castings market is open to Canadian (and presumably other) import competition. Petitioners' Comments at 8. The petitioners maintain that with such a substantial portion of the United States market ``closed'' to Canadian producers, domestic producers are effectively protected from injury and would continue to be protected if the order for Canada were to be revoked. Id. at 9&hyph;10. Counsel on behalf of the Castings Panel of the Engineering Export Promotion Council of India and the exporters of castings from India urge the Commission to review not only its determination with respect to Canada but also its determination with respect to India; however, they offer no arguments for changed circumstances other than those of the petitioners. Indian Parties' Comments at 2&hyph;3. In opposition to the petition, comments were filed by counsel on behalf of the U.S. producers of the subject merchandise. The U.S. producers take issue with the petitioners regarding (1) the size of the market affected by these two Buy America provisions, claiming that there is no evidence of widespread implementation of these provisions at either the State or local level and that the share of the market so affected is on the order of 17 percent, rather than 62&hyph;82 percent; and (2) the enforcement of country-of-origin marking requirements, claiming that these were being fully enforced at least one year prior to 1986, the year Commerce's antidumping-duty order went into effect. U.S. Parties' Comments at 9&hyph;18. The domestic producers argue that section 751(b) and applicable Commission precedent preclude a review because the changed circumstances alleged by the Canadian producers are premised on inaccurate or incomplete factual assertions, exaggerated estimates of the effect of Buy America restrictions, and speculation regarding future action by states and municipalities. Id. at 18&hyph;21. After consideration of the request and the comments submitted in response to the Commission's Federal Register notice, the Commission determines that the information of record does not show changed circumstances sufficient to warrant institution of an investigation to review the Commission's affirmative determination in Iron Construction Castings from Canada, Inv. No. 731&hyph;TA&hyph;263 (Final), USITC Pub. 1811 (Feb. 1986) or its determination in Iron Construction Castings from Brazil, India, and the People's Republic of China, Inv. Nos. 701&hyph;TA&hyph;249; 731&hyph;TA&hyph;262, 264&hyph;265 (Final), USITC Pub. 1838 (April 1986). DECISION OF THE COMMISSION: Section 751(b)(1) of the Act grants to the Commission the authority to conduct an investigation to determine whether to revoke or modify an outstanding antidumping order. The Commission is required to conduct a review of a prior affirmative injury determination whenever it receives a request for such a review that shows ``changed circumstances sufficient to warrant a review.'' Congress, however, set forth ``very strict controls'' on the exercise of that authority, demonstrating that it did not want prior Commission injury determinations ``to remain in a state of flux.'' Royal Business Machines, Inc. v. United States, 507 F. Supp. 1007, 1014 n. 18 (Ct. Int'l Trade 1980), aff'd, 669 F.2d 692 (CCPA 1982). The statutory requirements for instituting Section 751 reviews clearly demonstrate the intent of Congress that the ``underlying finding of injury .␣.␣. is entitled to deference and should not be disturbed lightly.'' Avesta AB v. United States, 689 F. Supp. 1173, 1180 (Ct. Int'l Trade 1988) ( Avesta I ); see also Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. United States , 750 F.2d 927, 932 (Fed. Cir. 1984). In order for a review investigation to be instituted, the information available to the Commission, after notice and comment from all interested parties, must be sufficient to persuade the Commission: (1) That there have been significant changed circumstances from those in existence at the time of the original investigation, (2) that those changed circumstances are not the natural and direct result of the imposition of the antidumping or countervailing duty order, and (3) that the changed circumstances indicate that the domestic industry would not be materially injured should the order be revoked thereby warranting a full investigation. See A. Hirsh, Inc. v. United States , 737 F. Supp. 1186 (CIT 1990)( Hirsh II ); Avesta AB v. United States , 724 F. Supp. 974 (CIT 1989), aff'd 914 F.2d 232 (Fed. Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 111 S. Ct. 1308 (1991)( Avesta II ). Once instituted, the petitioner must persuade the Commission, after a full investigation and hearing, that the domestic industry would not be injured or threatened with injury if the order were revoked. See Citizen Watch Co. v. United States , 733 F. Supp. 383 (CIT 1990).
