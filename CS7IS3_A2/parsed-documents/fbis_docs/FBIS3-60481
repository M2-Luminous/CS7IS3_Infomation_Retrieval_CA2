It includes a series of demands regarding the medical assistance and social protection of doctors, stated to BASA Victor Benu, leader of this trade union. "There is no medicine and medical equipment in the hospitals, 50 percent of the sanitary equipment does not function, and only 40 percent of means for health protection were allocated in the October-December period," states the appeal. The trade union demands an increase of wages by 15 percent. "The medical trade union will wait a month for the president's answer, then, if it is negative, the trade union will start protest measures," stated Benu.
