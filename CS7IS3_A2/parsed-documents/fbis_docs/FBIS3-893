In a statement to the KBC, the Rift Valley provincial police officer, Francis Sang, said investigations as on the spot check at Kamara and Mau Summit showed that no clashes whatsoever occurred in the area as imagined by the reporters from THE STANDARD newspaper in an article published today. [sentence as heard] He noted that despite having checked with the Molo police chief who refuted the story, the two reporters went ahead and published their (?illusory) story. Mr. Sang also said a check with the Nyayo Bus Corporation confirmed that none of their vehicles had been hired to transport those displaced from Molo to Kisii town as reported in the press. He said appropriate machinery was already in place to ensure the authors of the story, which was obviously meant to create animosity and disrupt peace in Molo, are brought to book.
