By 8 February, six central and eastern European countries including Romania, Hungary, and Ukraine had signed the document with NATO, and thus the promotion of the "partnership for peace" program was quickly started. The so-called "partnership for peace" program was initiated by the United States and adopted by the NATO summit meeting on 10 January, with a view to not letting central and eastern European counties join NATO immediately, so as to avoid irritating Russia, but allowing them to join in stages: First, by signing the "treaty of partnership for peace" with NATO, then strengthening military and political cooperation, and finally join the organization. The issue of NATO expansion has been raised for many years. Nevertheless, as central and eastern European countries and Russia on the one hand, and NATO states on the other, have their own interests and calculations on the issue, NATO has found it difficult to pursue expansion. Central and east European countries have an urgent demand to join NATO. Since the disintegration of the Warsaw Pact, led by the Soviet Union, in 1991, NATO has become the only military bloc in Europe. To seek a security guarantee, former Warsaw Pact states, such as Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia, asked for NATO membership one after another. Particularly in recent months, the rise of the Russian nationalist forces has caused worry that the development of the Moscow situation would pose a threat to them. Therefore, they became increasingly eager to join NATO. On 5 January, Polish President Lech Walesa openly accused Western countries of taking "a passive attitude" toward the demands of such countries as Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic to join NATO and stressed that this would "cause the East to begin to pursue a policy that will not necessarily satisfy the West" and "cause a greater and greater threat to security in Europe." One important reason NATO has not boldly entered the East is Russia's firm opposition. Russian President Boris Yeltsin maintained: NATO expansion to central and eastern European countries would make Russia "feel being isolated and surrounded." He warned that if countries bordering on Russia joined NATO it would lead to military and political instability. Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev more pointedly said: "The process of NATO expanding its membership poses a certain threat to Russia." He stated: If NATO expands its sphere of influence to areas near Russia's borders, Russia will need to reconsider its defense concepts, including reorganization and redeployment of its armed forces and changes in operations planning. The Russians contend: Eastern Europe's security must be "jointly safeguarded" by Russia and NATO. In fact, NATO does not necessarily hope to immediately absorb the former Warsaw Pact member states for several reasons: First, the current social and political situation of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic is not stable and national conflicts continue to emerge, and NATO is worried that if these countries become its members, its member states will surely be involved in state-to-state conflicts. Second, NATO is a collective organization rather than an organization providing aid to other countries. A NATO state will be given membership only after having assumed necessary economic responsibility. But at present, the central and eastern European countries which have asked to join NATO have not been able to rid themselves of their economic crises and are still unable to shoulder economic responsibility, and none of the 16 NATO member states is willing to pay the amount of money required for their poor brothers. Third, NATO is a military bloc. Eastern European countries are far, far behind NATO states in terms of military equipment, logistics, telecommunications, training, and command systems. According to specialists' estimates, it will take 10 years for central and eastern European countries to reach the NATO armed forces' levels. It can thus be seen that NATO is not well prepared for accepting those countries as new members, both militarily and financially. The United States is taking a prudent attitude toward NATO expansion. One of the three pillars of U.S. foreign policy is expanding the camp of "democratic" countries. Adhering to this principle, naturally, it hopes that eastern European countries and the former Soviet republics will join NATO. However, it worries that this will give Russia a sense of isolation and irritate Russia's "ultra-Right forces." In order not to offend Russia, and at the same time, not disappoint the central and eastern European countries wishing to joint NATO, the United States initiated a compromise "partnership for peace" program, which opens doors for the former Warsaw Pact states to join NATO and at the same time, pointed out that NATO expansion "is a long process of gradual advance." Of course, the "partnership for peace" program includes two obvious U.S. intentions, namely, continuing to control Europe while reducing its own defense responsibility on the continent. The developed countries of the world are mostly concentrated in Europe. At the present stage and for a considerably long period of time to come, Europe is and will still be the center of international struggle. Moreover, the United States' allies are chiefly in Europe. For the United States to become the leader of the West and the world, first of all, it must maintain its leading position in Europe. Therefore, after the end of the Cold War, the United States still intends to have 100,000 troops stationed in Europe. While putting forth the "partnership for peace" program, the United States also supports NATO and former Warsaw Pact member states in establishing "a multinational task force" which is able to maintain peacekeeping operations in the European region without U.S. participation. Apparently, this program will help lighten the United States' burdens and drop the idea of some European countries favoring an armed force outside NATO, thus maintaining U.S. influence in Europe. If NATO expands to Russia's borders overnight, it will be directly exposed to Russia's forward position and the United States will thus lose a buffer zone. Moreover, eastern Europe and Russia are instable areas. As such, the United States will be easily involved in these areas. This is what the United States is doing its utmost to avoid.
