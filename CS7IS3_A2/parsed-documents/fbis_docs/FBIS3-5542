The results show that 62 percent of respondents said tax increases were "inevitable" to ensure adequate public services for the aging population. Asked if consumption tax should be raised to secure revenue for welfare programs, 45 percent approved and 42 percent disapproved. After the controversy surrounding the prime minister's proposal for a public welfare tax, the public is beginning to understand that taxes must rise in preparation for the aging of society; however, they also showed a high degree of frustration with unfair taxation practices. On consumption tax, the largest number of complaints were about the "tax profits" of retail stores -- not all tax money paid by consumers goes into the public purse. Changes in the public attitude to taxes were observed in people's moderate responses to the 3-percent consumption tax proposal, and the drop in the number of those who believe taxes are too heavy. In previous surveys in March 1988 and September 1989, those who saw tax increases as "inevitable" if the country was to ensure adequate services for its aging society accounted for 46 percent and 54 percent, respectively. However, this group rose to 62 percent in the latest survey. The public is gradually showing a positive attitude toward tax increases. Similarly, 30 percent opposed any tax increases this time, down 9 percentage-points from the September 1989 survey. Public opinion is still divided on the issue of increasing consumption tax to boost revenue resources for welfare programs. Yet, in a September 1993 survey, 70 percent disapproved of the idea of a consumption tax hike in exchange for a cut in income tax. As the public becomes aware of the problems of an aging society, it is beginning to take a more positive attitude toward the idea of a consumption tax increase to fund welfare programs. Among supporters of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], Komeito, and the Japan New Party, more than 50 percent supported a consumption tax rise, while 30 percent were against the idea. By contrast, more than 50 percent disapproved of the tax increase and about 30 percent supported the idea among supporters of the Social Democratic Party of Japan and the Japan Communist Party. Opinions among supporters of Sakigake [Harbinger] and the Liberal Democratic Party were split. Asked to indicate, from five possible answers, the worst aspect of a rise in consumption tax, the largest group, amounting to 39 percent, chose "tax profits" because, they said, "it is hard to see if tax money is really going into the public purse." The figure of 73 percent said the current taxation system is "unfair." Settling public frustration with the current tax system is probably a prerequisite before any tax increases are imposed in preparing for the aging of society. On the current 3 percent consumption tax, which is about five years old, 35 percent said the tax burden was "too heavy," but 57 percent said it was "not important." In the April 1989 survey held immediately after the introduction of the consumption tax, 71 percent said the tax rate was "too heavy." It appears the public's ill feelings toward the tax have eased over the last five years. Asked for the general feelings about taxes, 48 percent said "taxes are too heavy," and 44 percent said they are at "an acceptable level." The percentage of those who think taxes are too heavy has dropped drastically from the 60 percent figure in the March 1988 survey, and is the lowest since the survey started in September 1970. Compared with results of the previous survey, those who said taxes were too heavy dropped from 70 to 53 percent among industrial workers, and from 68 to 52 percent among administrative workers. In general, the decline in complaints about the tax burden was more obvious among white-collar workers. As far as their thoughts about taxation in the future are concerned, 39 percent supported a further increase in indirect taxation, while 48 percent were opposed.
