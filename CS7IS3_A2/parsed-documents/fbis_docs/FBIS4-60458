Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz clarified that the complaint does not yet request the Security Council to convene. He noted that Lebanon reserves the right to ask the Security Council to convene when necessary. Minister Buwayz described the kidnapping as an act of piracy that violates human rights and Lebanon's sovereignty, and attacks its security and stability. REUTER cited a responsible official at the Foreign Ministry as saying that the Lebanese complaint also demands that Israel should quickly release al-Dirani and return him to Lebanon since this act is considered a violation of Lebanon's sovereignty and contradicts the trends toward peace in the region.
