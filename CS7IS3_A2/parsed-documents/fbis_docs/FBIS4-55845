[Stastny] Mr. Minister, upon her appointment as attorney general, Bohumira Kopecna set as her first task improving cooperation between the Bureau of Investigation and the State Attorney's Office. How does the Interior Ministry intend to deal with that problem? [Ruml] Even the police and frequently the courts come into conflict with the Bureau of Investigation. I believe the tension between these entities, which represent conflicting interests, is completely natural. It is important, however, that it does not go beyond a certain level of tolerability. Last week, a meeting took place on this issue that was attended by the minister of justice, the Supreme Court chairman, the attorney general, the police director, the director of the Bureau of Investigation, and I. We agreed at this meeting that the State Attorney's Office would prepare a binding instruction for its staff on how it is to deal with problems concerning criminal activities, and, at the same time, similar memoranda will be prepared for the police and the Bureau of Investigation. These bodies are often inundated with work and have the tendency to return individual cases for additional investigation just to gain time. Frequently, problems are caused by the human factor and can be solved by an accommodating approach. It is necessary that the Criminal Code amendment currently in effect meet expectations and that most of the process of obtaining a conviction take place before the courts and not with the police or the Bureau of Investigation. [Stastny] Are there similar problems in communications between the Police Presidium and lower police units? [Ruml] The problem is much more serious between the police, whether enforcing order or investigating crime, and the Bureau of Investigation, which often duplicates the work of the police. Policemen always see evidence differently from the examiner, know more than they can prove, and are assessed on the basis of solving cases. That is different from the examiner, who is responsible for establishing clear-cut crimes. These interests do not always coincide. It often is a matter of the appointment of personnel so the people involved get along together. [Stastny] Are you planning to augment the powers of the Office for the Documentation and Investigation of the Activities of the StB? [Ruml] I do not believe it necessary to augment the powers of that office. It would be more expedient to make sure that its work is more effective. It has all the powers necessary because it can collect documentation as well as investigate, so it is also a body active in investigating criminal activities. There is nothing to prevent this office from initiating criminal proceedings if it obtains the necessary evidence. We should focus on the question of whether there are the resources within the institution itself. Its powers are sufficient, and the 50 employees, I believe, provide it with the conditions needed to bring to light many things of the past. [Stastny] How do you feel about the proposed way to publish the names of StB collaborators? [Ruml] So far, only the outline of the system has been agreed upon. According to this, every citizen has the right to know what type of information has been obtained on him. In response to a citizen's question, the ministry will either report that the specific files do not exist and explain why, or the citizen will be given the opportunity to view them, copy them, etc. It is a tool for learning about our own past so we will not leave blank spots on the map of the past 40 years. It should also contribute to a relaxation in society, and every citizen should have the right to obtain information on himself. [Stastny] Has the problem of blotting out the names of other people referred to in these files been solved? [Ruml] It has not been solved in principle, and no law is in the legislative process. Apparently the government will have to make a decision on this. Personally, I believe that only the names of people who do not belong in the file and appear there by some coincidence should be blotted out. If the names of agents were blotted out, the law would lose any meaning. Let the people know who reported on them! I do not believe that it would cause a "witch hunt." We can see from the example of Germany that it has more of a purifying effect. [Stastny] How are the police equipment tenders progressing? [Ruml] Some have been closed--the one for jeeps and the one for digital fingerprinting systems, for instance. Tenders are in progress on a standard police vehicle, an FM radio system, and vehicles with speed-gauging equipment for the traffic police. The Interior Ministry is inviting its own tenders because, so far, there is no law on public orders. We are trying for the maximum objectivity and also include on the selection commissions experts from other sectors so that not even a shadow of suspicion of bribery can fall on the commission. This is a very demanding method but the only feasible one because the public sphere must be subject to control, and open public tender is the best form of control over financial spending.
