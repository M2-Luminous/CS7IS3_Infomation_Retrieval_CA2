"It is outrageous to be trying to influence the developments in Chechnya from Moscow, not knowing the actual situation and alignment of political forces here," he told Interfax. He said he was referring to Shakhray's recommendation concerning the Russian leadership's contacts with forces opposing President Dudayev. "The Chechen leaders' attitude to such recommendations is far from positive. They believe that such a position may jeopardize the recently established dialogue," he added. "I wouldn't like to think that all this is being done deliberately. I can say, however, that there is very much in common between the demands of individual Chechen opposition leaders and the recommendations of the Russian minister," Akbulatov said in conclusion.
