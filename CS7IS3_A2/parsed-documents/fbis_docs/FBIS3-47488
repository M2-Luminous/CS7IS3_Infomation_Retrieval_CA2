"The governing coalition's management of parliamentary affairs and its political stance are extremely autocratic and authoritarian, and it is undeniable that it is moving in the direction of fascist politics," the group said in a statement. "This is a crisis of democracy, and it is now an urgent political task to launch an antifascism and prodemocracy movement," it said. The group led by House of Representatives member Yoshinobu Shimamura issued the appeal after a meeting that brought together 32 LDP legislators, one former LDP lawmaker and 31 proxies of politicians. It also sought advance enactment of anticorruption measures without changing the electoral system for the lower house. The lower house election system should be amended along with the systems for House of Councillors and local government polls after ruling and opposition parties reach a consensus, the group said. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has staked his political fate on enactment of a reform package featuring electoral changes and stricter controls on campaign funding before the current extraordinary Diet session ends on January 29.
