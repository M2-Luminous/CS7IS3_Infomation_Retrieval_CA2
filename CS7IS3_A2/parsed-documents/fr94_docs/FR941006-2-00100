FR941006-2-00100 FR941006-2-00077 2. The first time Mr. Wicks is employed in NRC-licensed activities following the five-year prohibition, he shall notify the Director, Office of Enforcement, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, D.C. 20555 and the Regional Administrator, NRC Region IV, at least five days prior to the performance of licensed activities (as described in 1 above). The notice shall include the name, address, and telephone number of the NRC or Agreement State licensee and the location where the licensed activities will be performed. The notice shall be accompanied by a statement that Mr. Wicks is committed to compliance with regulatory requirements and the basis why the Commission should have confidence that he will now comply with applicable NRC requirements. 3. Mr. Wicks is permitted to conduct licensed activities only as necessary to maintain licensed material in the possession of Western Industrial X-Ray Inspection Company in safe storage and transfer the material to an authorized recipient. The Director, Office of Enforcement, may, in writing, relax or rescind any of the above conditions upon demonstration by Mr. Wicks of good cause. V In accordance with 10 CFR 2.202, Mr. Wicks must, and any other person adversely affected by this Order may, submit an answer to this Order, and may request a hearing on this Order, within 20 days of the date of this Order. The answer may consent to this Order. Unless the answer consents to this Order, the answer shall, in writing and under oath or affirmation, specifically admit or deny each allegation or charge made in this Order and shall set forth the matters of fact and law on which Mr. Wicks or other person adversely affected relies and the reasons as to why the Order should not have been issued. Any answer or request for a hearing shall be submitted to the Secretary, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Attn: Chief, Docketing and Service Section, Washington, DC 20555. Copies also shall be sent to the Director, Office of Enforcement, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, to the Assistant General Counsel for Hearings and Enforcement at the same address, to the Regional Administrator, NRC Region IV, 611 Ryan Plaza Drive, Suite 400, Arlington, Texas 76011, and to Mr. Wicks if the answer or hearing request is by a person other than Mr. Wicks. If a person other than Mr. Wicks requests a hearing, that person shall set forth with particularity the manner in which his or her interest is adversely affected by this Order and shall address the criteria set forth in 10 CFR 2.714(d). If a hearing is requested by Mr. Wicks or a person whose interest is adversely affected, the Commission will issue an Order designating the time and place of any hearing. If a hearing is held, the issue to be considered at such hearing shall be whether this Order should be sustained. Pursuant to 10 CFR 2.202(c)(2)(i), Mr. Wicks, or any other person adversely affected by this Order, may, in addition to demanding a hearing, at the time the answer is filed or sooner, move the presiding officer to set aside the immediate effectiveness of the Order on the ground that the Order, including the need for immediate effectiveness, is not based on adequate evidence but on mere suspicion, unfounded allegations, or error. In the absence of any request for hearing, the provisions specified in Section IV above shall be final 20 days from the date of this Order without further order or proceedings. AN ANSWER OR A REQUEST FOR HEARING SHALL NOT STAY THE IMMEDIATE EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS ORDER. Dated at Rockville, Maryland this 27th day of September 1994. For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Hugh L. Thompson, Jr., Deputy Executive Director for Nuclear Materials Safety, Safeguards and Operations Support.
