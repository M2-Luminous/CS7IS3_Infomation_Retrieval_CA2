FBIS4-13586 "drnes077_m_94011" FBIS-NES-94-077 Daily Report 21 Apr 1994 JORDAN Rabin Remarks, `Enemy's Allegations' Rejected Rabin Remarks, `Enemy's Allegations' Rejected JN1904161894 Amman AL-SABIL in Arabic 19-25 Apr 94 p 1 JN1904161894 Amman AL-SABIL Arabic BFN [Unattributed editorial] [Text] Jordan's voice was clear and loud while rejecting threats made by terrorist Yitzhaq Rabin, who has a black record in dealing with our kinsfolk and people in the areas to the west of the river. King Husayn's voice represented this country's position while he replied strongly to the enemy's allegations, lies, and instigations concerning Jordan's relations with so-called terrorism. Jordan and its people have been harmed the most by the Jews' terrorism, aggression, and brutal arrogance. The government did the same in its analysis of the enemy's bankruptcy and failure after the painful jihad attacks launched in retaliation for the crimes committed by the enemy's army and settlers, who shed Arab and Palestinian blood. The position of our country, whether voiced by King Husayn or the government statement, emphasized that there is no organized Hamas Movement presence on Jordanian land. Hamas, this jihad movement that was born, grew, and escalated its struggle in the occupied Palestinian territories, developed as a deep demonstration of a Palestinian jihad case that soon extended its roots deep into the popular Palestinian conscience. This Palestinian conscience felt that after long struggle under various bases and ideologies, it was in need of activating resistance against the occupation in accordance with new bases and different plans. This means Hamas is not a rootless plant, but the culmination of the results of the Palestinian people's struggle in particular, and the fruit of an Islamic renaissance plan that began to take shape throughout the Islamic world after the Islamic nation reached a unique situation of humiliation, denial of a role, and estrangement. If Hamas' jihad operations are fully planned and executed in the Palestinian territories, as the United States admitted when Israel accused Washington of providing refuge to Hamas' leaders on its land, these operations are well received by the sons of this nation--whether on the beloved land of Jordan, or elsewhere in free Arab and Islamic countries. These operations were received with a good and spontaneous response that relieves the souls of those who had suffered defeats and setbacks over the past century, during which the Jews became more monstrous and assumed a high status in the records of those who commit crimes, racism, aggression, and terrorism. Hamas, which is an indivisible and pedigreed component of the living Palestinian people in particular, and the Islamic nation in general, has embodied a particular form of jihad that is cherished by both Arabs and Muslims. It is hard for any political player in the region and the world at large to circumvent or overlook this fact, although the PLO was officially recognized by the Arabs, the world community, and Jews as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. Had the PLO itself been impressed about its status as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, it would not have opened a dialogue with Hamas and its leaders, urging them to join the PLO. Had this been the case, foreign and Arab governments would not have sought talks and meetings with Hamas and Hamas leaders. Even the enemy expedited the conclusion of the Oslo accord with the tyrannical PLO leadership because it does not want to deal with Hamas. The enemy is well aware of the role Hamas has begun to play on the Palestinian scene. Likewise, it is well aware of the prestige Hamas now enjoys within the Palestinian community. In addition to this, nobody can deny Hamas is influencing the course of negotiations. It is true Hamas is not involved in the negotiations. Nonetheless, it is influencing the negotiations. In this regard, suffice it to note the unprecedented statement terrorist Rabin made to the effect that his government is ready to dismantle settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in return for a final arrangement or solution with the Palestinians. It is no coincidence that this statement by Rabin was made in the aftermath of the Hadera and 'Afula attacks. Consequently, Hamas operations have indirectly and unintentionally contributed to promoting the Palestinian negotiating position. Who knows? Had it not been for the Palestinian opposition and their jihad operations, the Palestinian negotiating team might not have obtained half the gains they were promised. In the same vein, were the Palestinian negotiators to demonstrate a measure of patience, they would be able to force some of their conditions, something that could help them regain more Palestinian rights--the very rights that are being undermined at the negotiating tables in Cairo, Oslo, and Madrid. Given all this, we support the leadership of this beloved country that has rejected the enemy's arrogant threats, which are nourished by evil U.S. and European powers. We are opposed to the constant attempts to apply economic and political pressure on Jordan. We stand united and supportive of the efforts to confront aggression and defend Jordanian national soil and our sacred national unity, as well. We are willing to sacrifice our lives to protect the homeland. Likewise, we are ready to build a protective shield around the homeland. This is a sacred duty we must perform. As for Palestine, and the Palestinian revolution, fighting the occupation and the enemy's quest for domination, they are our first line of defense. We will be the strategic depth of this revolution when war erupts, as we have always been. This beloved homeland yesterday celebrated the completion of the third Hashemite restoration of the Dome of the Rock and the al-Aqsa Mosque, the jewel of Jerusalem, the queen among cities, the epitome of Islamic dignity, the place to which our Prophet Muhammad, may God's peace, mercy, and blessings be upon him, made his nocturnal journey, and the third holiest shrine. May Jordan always remain a sanctuary for free men and support Palestine and the Palestinians. This Hashemite restoration work conducted on the holiest shrine in Palestine, which was made possible by the donation made by His Majesty King Husayn, is a strong reflection of this constantly lofty Jordanian position.
