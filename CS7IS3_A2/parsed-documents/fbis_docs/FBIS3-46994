This was the statement made by Congressman Jose Yap. Yap said that until the identity of the killer of Martinez is known, its death should not be a destabilizing factor in the peace process. According to Yap, there is a possibility that the killer of Martinez is NPA. If the military is behind the killing, it is acting on its own. It has never been the policy of the government to kill anyone leading a rebel group.
