The latter does not have a colonialist past and now that it is entering the international arena, it is seeking a reliable partner in the Middle East. In order to resolve its economic problems, Germany uses its own distinctive policy which is not necessarily affiliated to U.S. policies. Germany is Iran's top trading partner and has assisted in the training of experts in various fields. However, there are some obstacles that, if eliminated, would clear the path for better cooperation between the two countries: 1. The balance of trade between the two countries is not equal, Germany's exports to Iran far exceed Iran's exports to Germany. In 1993, Iran experienced problems due to a drop in its foreign exchange earnings. Germany's exports fell to 4 billion marks and Iran's exports were only worth 1.5 billion marks. German officials complain of the increase in the volume of trade between Iran and the United States in their meetings with the Iranian press. Our response is that we have also complained about the increase in American exports but one must note that the balance of trade between the two countries is to Iran's benefit. This means that the sale of Iranian oil to American companies is far greater than our imports from American companies. If the Germans are complaining about this state of affairs, it would be better if they increased their purchases of Iranian oil and steered the balance of trade between the two countries toward a more equitable level. The Germans contend that the purchase of oil is in the hands of private companies and that the government has no control and no policy in this regard. If this is merely a propagandistic allegation, it is not right to make these remarks regarding such a serious matter. If this is true, then is it to be believed that European governments do not have any jurisdiction on such basic decisions? This matter will be assessed at a later date. 2. The German Government has abandoned some of its valid , but uncompleted, contracts, such as the Bushehr nuclear power plant and its affiliated fertilizer project after 90 percent of the work was completed. Germany's reasons for such a breach of contract are not acceptable. Iran is a signatory of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty [NPT] and IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] inspection teams have repeatedly visited Iran and endorsed Iran's performance in this regard. Meanwhile the Israeli regime has not signed the NPT and has proclaimed that it has nuclear weapons but no one dares complain to them. Thus, Germany's breach of bilateral contracts will remain a dark spot on Iranian-German relations. 3. Germany's conduct has not been very just or humanitarian in some cases in the Middle East. For example, during the Iraqi war against Iran, the Germans supplied chemical weapons to Iraq and its experts assisted Iraq in extending the range of its missiles, resulting in greater casualties for the Iranian side. The Germans did not pay any reparations to Iran, but when similar missiles were fired upon occupied Palestine during the Iraqi war against Kuwait, the German foreign minister himself went to Tel Aviv and paid 200 million marks as reparations. Such conduct is unacceptable. In response, the Germans say they were the first European country to condemn Iraqi aggression against Iran, and this is true, but it does not compensate for Iran's losses in the war. 4. The Germans display sensitivity regarding terrorist groups but do not pay much attention to the fact that they are nurturing an anti-Iranian terrorist group in their midst. In 1986 Mas'ud Rajavi admitted to the killing of 15,000 Iranians in an interview with FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE. The Germans say that their criterion is that they should not commit terrorist actions on German soil. This is while the Monafeqin [pejorative term for Mojahedin-e Khalq Organization, MKO] recruit members from German soil and carry out terroristic operations in Iran through the Iraqi government. In addition, Germany is not prepared to treat all terrorist groups which are active against European governments in the same manner and refuses to grant them asylum. As far as the controversy on human rights is concerned, Europeans take the liberty of interfering in the internal affairs of other countries except in the case of terrorist activity, when they say as long as terrorist actions are not committed on their soil, it does not matter. Everyone knows that terrorist actions are carried out in that particular country. These double-sided policies are not acceptable for the broadening of Iranian-German relations.
