Given its content and the circumstances in which it was created, this agreement is of far-reaching and also crucial and historical importance. The agreement was reached under the aegis of the United States and with the consent of leading European countries. For this reason, this agreement first of all means a radical change in their attitude to the settlement of the crisis on former Yugoslav soil. The most important international factors -- led by the United States -- have finally come to the conclusion that one has to take resolute steps in order to end the three-year crisis, which began with the aggression of the Yugo-communist army and Serbia against Slovenia, Croatia, and Bosnia-Herzegovina, and end the war in Bosnia which has caused one of the biggest tragedies of our time and is threatening to spread the catastrophe of war worldwide. These were and still are the reasons for which the state policy of democratic Croatia will stand by its orientation toward achieving and protecting vital national interests in accordance with international circumstances. By adhering to principles and through our consistent policy in this respect, Croatia gradually gained favor with those who were not partial to its sovereignty and independent policy and finally obtained full guarantees from the most responsible international factors for the security of its state and the future of the Croatian people. Croatia increasingly won the trust of the world democratic public and responsible statesmen starting with a recommendation that the Croatian people should take part in a referendum for the retention of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the urgent establishment of diplomatic relations with the government in Sarajevo, and the urging and accepting of proposals for the settlement of the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina along cantonal, provincial and finally confederal lines in the form of a union of republics. This was rejected both by the Serb and the Muslim sides until the agreement was signed in Washington. The implementation of the agreement signed in Washington by Croatian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Mate Granic, Prime Minister of Bosnia-Herzegovina Haris Silajdzic, and Kresimir Zubak, president of the presidential council of the Croat Republic of Herceg-Bosna, is in the interest of the Croatian and Bosnian Muslim nations, as well as the international community. An end to the war between the Muslim and Croat nations in Bosnia is of paramount importance for us. That conflict has caused great loss in human life and material destruction to the Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and brings the threat of international sanctions upon Croatia because of the assistance lent to them [Bosnian Croats], first in the defense against the Serb aggression, and then in their struggle against the threat of the Muslim extremist forces. The agreement between the Croatian and Muslim sides also sets conditions for reaching an agreement with the Serb side and for defining borders acceptable to all three nations within Bosnia- Herzegovina. However, international factors must persist in seeking a sensible overall solution in order to create preconditions for normal neighborly relations between the new Croatian-Bosnian confederal union on the one side and Serbia, that is, Yugoslavia on the other side; all the more so because this [agreement] determines a new long-term fault-line between international powers which have for centuries been opposing and fighting each other in this critical region of different civilizations. All national and political entities which are in any way participating in solving the extremely complex Bosnian problem should -- in the interests of European and global peace -- do everything they can in order to reach an accord between the three warring nations and their mother-countries, but also with the main world factors -- the United Nations, the European Union, the United States, and the Russian Federation, in order to create preconditions for the stability of a new international order in this part of Europe, precisely because its birth has caused unimaginable war atrocities and threats of conflict between civilizations. The implementation of the Washington agreement will secure the survival and future of the Croat people not only within the borders of the Croat Republic of Herceg-Bosna, established in the war of defense, but throughout the territory of Bosnia, which will not be allocated to the separate Serb Republic. Furthermore, the agreement guarantees Croats full national sovereignty in the Croat cantons -- probably to be called grand-counties [velezupe] in Croatian -- which will form a Croat council as a separate representative body of the Croat community, as well as full parity and complete equality in overall state affairs of the Federal Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. All of this will have additional guarantees in the recognition of dual citizenship, i.e., Croatian citizenship too, for every member of the Croatian people from Bosnia as well as in the confederal union between Croatia and the Federal Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. This confederal union will be based on shared interests in developing comprehensive relations in all spheres, particularly in international and defense policies, the economy, science, and culture. The establishment of a joint command of defense forces is envisaged, as well as a customs and monetary union within the framework of a common market. A permanent confederal council [konfederalno vijece] will be formed with a view to coordinating joint policy and activity. The materialization of the envisaged federation between the Croatian and the Bosnian Muslim people in Bosnia-Herzegovina and its confederation with Croatia implies creating needed political, constitutional, and legal foundations. The Croats ought to understand that such a solution is historically necessary and purposeful for the survival of Croatiandom in Bosnia and the protection of the Croatian state's strategic interests. The alliance with the Croats secures the survival of the Bosnian Muslims in these lands, as well as links with western civilization and democratic countries. The effective implementation of the agreement on both unions [federation and confederation], something that is in the vital interest of both peoples as well as of the democratic Western world, can only be opposed by advocates of narrow-minded nationalism and extremist-fundamentalist views. Unlike such exceptions, the vast majority of Croats and Bosnians -- not just those Muslims who have hitherto declared themselves as Croats -- will wholeheartedly start building the shared future. Referring to all the above, I find it necessary to emphasize that the Croatian-Bosnian-Muslim union is not aimed against the Serbs. Nor is it being created in order to continue the war. It is being created to secure peace without delay. Croatia will remain committed to peaceful, political solutions to all contested issues, including the normalization of Serbian- Croatian relations on the basis of mutual recognition, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. In order to achieve this, Serbia and Yugoslavia ought to stop supporting the further occupation of Croatian territories by arming [Krajina], introducing a shared currency, and suchlike. It is high time for Krajina's Serbs to draw their conclusions about the futility of continuing their resistance to being integrated into Croatia's constitutional and legal order, because their further out-maneuverings of UN Security Council resolutions will no longer be tolerated either from the point of view of Croatian interests or from the point of view of international interests. Croatia guarantees to them all human, civil and ethnic rights, but it cannot tolerate any delay in the return of its refugees, the reintegration of its state territory, and the establishment of normal conditions for its further economic and cultural development. Dear Croats at home and abroad, the citizens of Croatia, by signing the agreement in Washington, we took a big step along the difficult path to secure the future of the Croatian nation, and the stability and prosperity of the Croatian state. On our part, we will do everything to complete the agreement as soon as possible in the constitutional and legal sense, and to implement it. During the talks which our foreign minister and I personally held with representatives of many foreign countries -- and on the day the agreement was signed even with U.S. President Clinton -- we received assurances from the most senior statesmen and world factors that Croatia would be given support in solving all its vital and burning problems. Everyone promised us diverse and resolute assistance in the process of integrating the areas under the protection of the peace forces into the overall life in Croatia. We were promised assistance for reconstruction. World and all international financial institutions will be free to offer us loans and to finance various economic investment programs, which have so far been denied to us. The door to European integration will be opened to us, as well as admission into NATO's Partnership for Peace protection system. All this confirms that major international factors today consider Croatia an important, even one of the crucial, elements for establishing peace and international order in this part of Europe. All this leads us to believe that we have come close to the ending of the war and the beginning of a new period in the building of the sovereign democratic state of Croatia. The new conditions will allow us to dedicate all our potential to the economic recovery and cultural development of our homeland. The preliminary Washington agreement has therefore created preconditions for a political solution to the crisis, for an end to the destruction of war, killing and persecution of people, and for their return to normal life. Briefly, it heralds peace. All this confirms the correctness and usefulness of our consistent state policy, the paramount goal of which has always been to secure the freedom of the Croatian people and the sovereignty of Croatia with as few victims as possible. We have strengthened the democratic system and international standing of the Croatian state guided by our own judgment, maturity and support of the vast majority of the Croatian people and all citizens of Croatia. We can be proud of the results we have achieved and new possibilities which have opened up for us, but we should also be aware of the responsibilities and the seriousness of the tasks ahead of us in new, more favorable international conditions.
