In order to gain social approval for ownership transformations, privatization must be done with society in mind. So "Strategy for Poland" also envisages the establishment of social protection for the workforce of those enterprises being sold to foreign investors, said Professor Jan Monkiewicz, a secretary of state in the Office of the Council of Ministers, and an associate of Deputy Prime Minister Grzegorz Kolodko. According to a statement issued at a press conference, the Polish Business Council [PRB] has received with satisfaction the governmental Strategy for Poland program. Its provisions are largely in agreement with the views of PRB which has demanded such a document for two years now. One cannot strive at privatization at any cost, by applying the principle of the state getting rid of a burden. Investors must have the financial means for investment and development. In addition, Jan Monkiewicz added, we want to maintain the workforces' influence over the fate of the companies where they work. Placing the private and state-owned sectors on an equal footing in terms of their rights is an equally important issue relative to the functioning of enterprises. This is to facilitate transforming state-owned enterprises into companies based on Commercial Law. The transformation will have yet another dimension, as well: At the point that Commercial Law companies are established, employee boards will disappear since the Code of Commerce does not provide for such boards in enterprises. So there will be a clear division of authority between trade unions, and the companies' governing boards, J.Monkiewicz explained. When asked how fighting inflation will be reconciled with fighting unemployment, Dr. Jerzy Hausner replied that according to the Strategy, the inflation level will be decreasing faster than the unemployment rate. The program envisages that unemployment will continue to rise both this year and next. According to J. Monkiewicz, high employment would not increase inflation, providing the work week is cut short and salaries are reduced in accordance with the work done. Such methods have been applied in Germany among others. But for that, one needs first of all social consent, said Professor J. Monkiewicz. The lifting of popiwek [enterprise tax on above-normative pay] is to serve the goal of changing the situation of enterprises. In the view of experts, popiwek does not guard against anything but only serves as a bargaining chip. Salary negotiations should be conducted at the level of individual enterprises while the state may just be an umpire. Some method of salary regulation is applied everywhere, said Professor Danuta Hibner. In Poland, one receives a penalty for raising salaries. The new element will be the possibility of awarding enterprises for observing rules, instead of applying punishment. The establishment of a Treasury Ministry has already been decided. It will take over ownership supervision over state-owned enterprises. Work on a new law on the State Treasury is taking place in several different places. The discussions are about the functions and powers of the future Treasury Ministry, Professor J. Monkiewicz stated. We still do not know at this stage when the law will become effective. PRB has noted with satisfaction the governmental Strategy for Poland program. Its basic assumptions are largely in agreement with the views of PRB which has demanded such a document for two years now. In our view, the Strategy identifies the problems that our economy is facing very well, both in the microscale and the macroscale. When we hear views that the program is unrealistic, we disagree. The problem is whether we know how to consolidate all the means in order to implement the program, said PRB Chairman Jan Wejchert. According to PRB, the program's success will depend on the speedy implementation of the detailed provisions that will enable a speeding up of the rate of privatization, and the development of the capital market. The program's success will also depend on making bold changes in the tax system which would render the system clearly investment-oriented and exports-oriented. There must be a system of installment-based privatization procedure, a consolidated balance of payments for holdings, and a Guarantee Privatization and Development Fund. PRB is also preparing a proposal to introduce a system of breaks using investments as their legal basis; it would also include establishing new jobs and exports measures. According to PRB, implementing the measures being proposed by it, along with other measures mentioned in the Strategy, would result in establishing over 500,000 new jobs over four years. Maintaining existing jobs is as important as the establishment of new ones. The constantly changing legal provisions concerning taxes and customs, are a reason behind the fall in the number of jobs, says PRB Deputy Chairman Zbigniew Niemczycki. In his view, Poland still does not have the kind of investment dynamism that businessmen would like to see. Capital is being invested only in those places where there is a motivation for doing so.
