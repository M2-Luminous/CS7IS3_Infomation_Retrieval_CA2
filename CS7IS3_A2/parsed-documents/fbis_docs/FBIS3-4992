Pyongyang wants to develop Chongjin port on the East Sea [Sea of Japan] because of its potential as a link with China and Russia by land and sea when the North Korean region near the Tuman River opens up to foreign investment. North Korea's committee on promotion of external economic cooperation recently distributed pamphlets on the project to develop Chongjin port to Western financial institutions and investors here, explaining how Pyongyang wants to gradually expand the port's capacity to transfer and handle cargo up to 20 million tons and 10 million tons, respectively, by the early 2000s. In doing so, North Korea will construct a container terminal for 1 million tons of cargo next year and expand the present seven quays. It will also dredge a 700,000-square-meter area in front of the port and build storage facilities covering 560,000 square meters. Chongjin port currently sits on a 300,000-square-meter site and the total length of its quay is 2,138 meters. It can accommodate 105,000 tons of ships, or eight 10,000-ton ships and five 1,000-ton ships, at a time and 8 million tons of cargo a year. Pyongyang also plans to lay rails linking Najin-Sonbong-Chongjin-Hunchun (China)-Khasan (Russia)-Posyet (Russia) to improve the transportation system.
