A spokesman for General Aidid's Somali National Alliance (SNA) said US troops on Monday "deliberately killed innocent people" in an unprovoked attack, but the US charge d'affaires, Stevenson McIlvaine, said he was "convinced" that Somali gunmen had opened fire first. Military spokesman for the US Army and the UN Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM II) said the capital had remained calm overnight, but there were unconfirmed reports that a young Somali had been killed in the evening by American troops in the port district. Monday's brief firefight, the bloodiest incident since Aidid's militiamen declared a ceasefire last October, took place at the crowded Kilometre-4 junction on the busy Afgooye Road in southern Mogadishu and left at least five Somalis dead and a score of others injured, including women and children. "I am now convinced that the incident started...when two Somali gunmen opened fire on the Marines" escorting US liaison office personnel to a meeting with SNA reprentatives," McIlvaine said Tuesday. "This was a tragic incident," he added. "Some people have been hit and should not have been hit." But McIlvaine warned that "this is a sort of terrible accident that is going to happen as long as the streets of Mogadishu, particularly the streets near the (UN) compound and the streets that we use are crowded with gunmen." Among those killed by the marines, who were in a convoy including Humvee armoured vehicles mounted with heavy guns, was a renowned Somali elder in his 60s, Sabriye Alale Barise, who had been walking by on the pavement. The secretary-general of the United Somali Congress-SNA (USC- SNA), Abdulkarim Ahmed Ali, categorically denied that Somalis were the first to open fire. "How could we organise an ambush on a crowded street? There was no shooting towards the US (troops)," he told AFP on Tuesday. "The US soldier in the first car was very nervous, he started shooting... They deliberately killed innocent people." Ahmed Ali charged that the soldiers "did it on purpose. This is a revenge for what happened on the 3rd of October," when Somali gunmen loyal to Aidid killed 18 US troops in a pitched battle after the marines mounted a raid to capture Aidid aides. After that fight, the SNA declared a ceasefire and the United Nations suspended a hunt for Aidid, who had been declared a wanted man accused of ordering attacks on UN peacekeepers. "We've asked our people to keep quiet, to hold the ceasefire," Ahmed Ali added. "We are doing our best to solve Somali problems internally. We will continue to talk with everybody." The first secretary at the Ethiopian embassy here, Yemane Abadi, who had organised Monday's planned meeting between the US officials and the SNA representatives, said he also did not think "it was an intended attack" and called it "a tragic accident." All sides called for a continued effort to reconcile Somali clans, who plunged the country into bloody strife and famine after the January 1991 ouster of strongman Mohamed Siad Barre.
