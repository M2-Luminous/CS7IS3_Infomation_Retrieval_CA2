FR941021-2-00021 FR941021-2-00016 Federal Energy Regulatory Commission [Docket No. CP94&hyph;29&hyph;000] Paiute Pipeline Company; Intent To Prepare an Environmental Assessment for the Proposed Paiute Pipeline Expansion Project October 18, 1994. The staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC or the Commission) will prepare an environmental assessment (EA) that will discuss environmental impacts of the construction and operation of facilities proposed in the Paiute Pipeline Expansion Project. 1 This EA will be used by the Commission in its decision-making process to determine whether an environmental impact statement is necessary and whether or not to approve the project. 1 Paiute Pipeline Company's application was filed with the Commission under section 7 of the Natural Gas Act and Part 157 of the Commission's regulations. Summary of the Proposed Project On November 10, 1993, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC or Commission) issued a Notice of Intent To Prepare a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the Northwest Expansion II Projects. The projects included two proposals by Paiute in Docket Nos. CP93&hyph;751&hyph;000 and CP94&hyph;29&hyph;000, and related projects proposed by Northwest Pipeline Corporation (Northwest) in Docket Nos. CP93&hyph;613&hyph;000 and CP93&hyph;673&hyph;000. The purpose of the notice was to request comments on environmental issues. Because of changes made in Northwest's proposals, Paiute withdrew its application in Docket No. CP93&hyph;751&hyph;000 which proposed the construction of 7.8 miles of loop pipeline in two segments on September 8, 1994. Also, on September 9, 1994, Paiute sent a letter to the Director of OPR indicating that no changes were necessary to Docket No. CP94&hyph;29&hyph;000. In this application Paiute proposes to: •Construct 53.5 miles of loop pipeline in seven segments; •Construct two new compressor stations with a total of 2,139 horsepower (hp) of compression; •Add 268 hp of compression at an existing compressor station by installing an upgraded compressor unit; and •Modify other existing meter, compressor, and pressure reduction stations. The following table contains more detailed information about the facilities. The general location of the project facilities is shown in appendix 1. 2 2 The appendices referenced in this notice are not being printed in the Federal Register . Copies are available from the Commission's Public Reference Branch, Room 3104, 941 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426, or call (202) 208&hyph;371. Copies of the appendices were sent to all those receiving this notice in the mail.
