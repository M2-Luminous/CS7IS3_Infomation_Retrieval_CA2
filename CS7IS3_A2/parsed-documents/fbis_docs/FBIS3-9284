With the intention of finding out whether he had changed his views, especially those on Croat relations, we asked him to comment on the preliminary agreement signed in Washington and to assess the possibility of implementing the agreement. [Ganic] The agreement is a political success for the Presidency and the Bosnia-Herzegovina Government, because we have been fighting against the division of Bosnia-Herzegovina from the very beginning. We started out together with the Croats against the Serbian aggressor, who not only wanted to divide Bosnia-Herzegovina but also conquer all of Bosnia-Herzegovina and a large part of Croatia, but the creation of Herceg-Bosna -- Greater Croatia -- resulted in a conflict between the Croats and the Muslims. This agreement is necessary to preserve the integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina, which the Bosnian Croats proposed at their assembly in Sarajevo last month and the Muslim -- Bosniak leadership -- in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The success of the agreement depends on the Croatian side, especially the extreme part of the leadership from Grude. [Cemerika] What about the extreme part of the Muslim leadership? [Ganic] I think all Muslims are doing their best to preserve the integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina, regardless of their politics. [Cemerika] Some Muslim generals do not believe in the political solution and they do not trust politicians. [Ganic] The Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency -- that is, its president -- is the supreme commander of the army, and since we now have an organized army that gets its orders from its supreme commander, I do not believe that there are officers in our army who do not obey those orders. [Cemerika] If this agreement with the Croats is successful, how will you arrange your relations with the Serbs? [Ganic] Bosnia-Herzegovina is a country that belongs to all of its citizens, and every honest Serb has his or her place in that country. We will try to come to an agreement with those Serbs who still believe in the integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina because the agreement with the Croats is not aimed against the Serbs. [Cemerika] Has Izetbegovic authorized Silajdzic to make this agreement? [Ganic] Mr. Silajdzic cannot sign any agreement without authorization from the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency -- that is, its president, Alija Izetbegovic. [Cemerika] If the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly rejects the agreement, will Mr. Izetbegovic also reject it? [Ganic] We are a democratic country with a democratic system and the Assembly elected by the people, and if the Assembly rejects the agreement, then no one has the right to accept it, although I am sure it will be unanimously adopted by the Assembly. [Cemerika] During our conversation, you have shown that you are in favor of a peaceful solution for Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, you are famous for your "hard" views in your statements on solving the Bosnia-Herzegovina problem and you have advocated war more often than peace. Can you explain this change? [Ganic] First of all, I did not make such statements and, second, every new event deserves a new comment. [Cemerika] If a confederation between Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina is formed, will you lose your position? [Ganic] (laughter) There will be democratic elections!
