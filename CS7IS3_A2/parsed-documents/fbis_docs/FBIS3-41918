Pressured by the arms industry, the coalition Bundestag groups and the Economics Ministry are trying to relax the German guidelines for arms export, which are stricter than those of most other countries. One of the reasons for this is job security. The foreign policy spokesman of the Christian Democratic Union [CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU] Bundestag Group, Karl Lamers, told a newspaper that the German arms export guidelines put German companies at a disadvantage: ``Thousands of jobs and high-tech know-how that are of enormous importance for the civilian industry threaten to be lost.'' Lamers demands a uniform European Union [EU] policy on arms exports. This is also mentioned as an objective in the section on joint foreign and security policy of the Maastricht treaty. Lamers said that, due to the resistance of other European states, however, the high German standards cannot be maintained in Brussels. Bonn's attempts to facilitate the exporting of arms via Brussels meet with strong resistance from the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD]. SPD Bundestag Group manager Peter Struck said the constitution demands that the Bundestag has to be consulted by the Federal Government first. The constitutional amendment passed when the Maastricht treaty was ratified says: ``The Federal Government, before agreeing to an introduction of new laws by the EU, gives the Bundestag the opportunity to comment. The Federal Government bases its negotiations on these comments.'' The deputy SPD chairwoman and European affairs expert, Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul, accused the government of negotiating a softening-up of the arms export guidelines in the European Council of Ministers, ``behind the Bundestag's back, ignoring the constitution, and excluding the public.'' The government is ``by no means entitled to do this.'' The Economics Ministry denies negotiating uniform export guidelines for traditional armament products within the EU. These negotiations only refer to dual-use products. This means products that can be used for both civilian and military purposes, such as machinery, special steels, and pesticides. The government coordinator for aerospace and space technology, Reinhard Goehner, has repeatedly said that it will not be possible to maintain the strict German export regulations. Negotiations on dual-use products have reached the final stage. The German guidelines for traditional arms and dual-use products were tightened after the Second Gulf War in early 1991. United Nations inspectors had discovered that a large share of Iraqi dictator Saddam Husayn's arms supply came from German companies. Since then, the German arms industry constantly complained about disadvantages as compared to other countries, especially France and Great Britain. Arms producers from these countries have blamed the Germans for being unreliable, the German arms industry said. Over the past four years, 280,000 jobs were lost in the armament industry. Yet, according to the Stockholm-based SIPRI Institute, with a 3.1 billion German marks turnover, Germany was still the world's third-largest arms exporter in 1992.
