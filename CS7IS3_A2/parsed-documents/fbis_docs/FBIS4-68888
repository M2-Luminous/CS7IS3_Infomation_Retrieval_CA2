An Intelligent Law Is Not Born in a Hurry"] [Text] The parliamentary hearings on the course of privatization conducted recently in the state Duma confirmed: The State Committee on the Administration of State Property of the Russian Federation will continue its work "outside laws." And the esteemed department does not wish to burden itself with developing drafts of them. The victorious reports about privatization encompassing all of Russia, the triumphant news conferences and the corresponding publications are intended to give the appearance of well-being. And this is against a background of an almost total lack of the legislative base necessary for destatization. But when will there be viable Russian laws protecting property owners from the omnipotence and arbitrariness of the bureaucracy. And finally, how did the hearings that were conducted go? With these questions I "attacked" the chairman of the Duma Committee on Property, Privatization, and Economic Activity, Sergey Burkov. And here is the answer I heard: [Burkov] There were extremely stormy and lengthy debates. For two days they discussed the results of the first stage of privatization, the concept of the state program for privatization of state and municipal enterprises, and also problems of administration of state property. Today the process is regulated basically by presidential edicts, decrees of the Government of the Russian Federation, and directives from the State Committee on the Administration of State Property. Frequently they contradict one another, which is taken advantage of by people who want to get rich quick. The process of privatization must be placed on a stable legislative-legal foundation. [Chernyshev] If I have understood you correctly, it will be necessary to place the appropriate legal base under the practical actions of the executive organs of power. [Burkov] Action without laws or outside of laws is arbitrariness. It is typical of totalitarian, antidemocratic regimes. In Russia it is time to create a rule-of-law state. The preconditions for this are established in the constitution of the Russian Federation. The deputies are trying to determine clear-cut and distinct contours of the revival of the Russian economy and imbue it with a dynamic, highly effective nature. Every Russian citizen must stand firmly on his two feet. But now they do not feel that there is solid ground underneath their feet. [Chernyshev] How did participants in the hearings evaluate the report from the chairman of the State Committee on the Administration of State Property, Anatoliy Chubays? [Burkov] The report of the State Committee on the Administration of State Property mentioned quantitative successes above all. As of the present day up to 70 percent of the objects of small-scale privatization have been placed in the hands of private owners. On the basis of medium-sized and large enterprises about 12,000 joint-stock companies have been created. The voucher stage is being completed. The main thing now is the qualitative content of the process, its coordination with Russia's long-term interests, its revival, and the raising of the level of well-being of Russian citizens. But the deputies still have not received a clear picture. As we know, in spite of the fact that even profitable enterprises are being privatized, the budgets at all levels are failing to receive a considerable share of their revenues. The standard of living of the population is declining and the economy is faltering. Much of the confusion and many complaints have been caused by the existing and clearly too low assessment of the value of the privatized property. This allows all kinds of "nearly privatized" fly-by-night firms to buy up considerable amounts of national wealth for token sums. Tendencies toward artificial separation of large technological conglomerates into autonomous units have been discovered. For example, pressure on the collectives "from above" has evoked a sharply negative reaction at the Nizhniy Novgorod automotive plant, the Chebarkul metallurgical plant, and in the collectives of many other complexes that have been created and are functioning successfully as a unified whole. The Duma quite pointedly raises questions of developing mechanisms on the administration of state property, restriction of the authority of the owner among organs of state power, and effective administration of state shares. The first stage of privatization has taken place. What next? Unfortunately, the Government of the Russian Federation has not yet submitted the corresponding draft laws. [Chernyshev] Do you have any kind of information about their content? [Burkov] I cannot answer that until the draft laws have been submitted. But any civilized state must protect the rights of its citizens. It is extremely necessary, for example, to have strict state control over the activity particularly of check investment funds, and they must be audited continuously. The activity of "Technical Progress," "Oil-Diamonds-Invest," and certain other structures, which evoked a storm of indignation, could disrupt the process from within. Whom are firms like these "investing in"--the domestic economy, the West, or their own pocketbooks? Unfortunately, privatization has brought about cases of abuse from the organs and workers of the State Committee on the Administration of State Property themselves, especially in the localities. The deputies are afraid that this mass of lawlessness could become critical. It is even being said openly that because of the corruption, impoverishment of the people, and unemployment there could be a social explosion. The legislators intend to clear the way for creative movement. [Chernyshev] And how do you envision this path? [Burkov] Dialogue, interaction, accord. Like the majority of deputies, I am convinced that the reforms that are being conducted must be coordinated with the entire order of public life and the Russian national character. This is the path of relying on our own forces, open and equal cooperation, harmonization of public life, and gradual formation of a market mentality. A certain "grab it" ideology has taken over now. We need new concepts, a new economic philosophy, the center of which is the working man. Our committee recommended that the Government of the Russian Federation develop and submit to the Duma in the form of draft laws an integrated concept of privatization, the development of diverse forms of ownership, and a program for the corresponding actions. All segments of the population and not just individual parts or groups of it must be drawn into the movement toward a civilized market. Alas, the executive power is still not letting go of the worst traditions of the command-administrative bureaucracy. Thus, for example, according to a schedule coordinated with the Government of the Russian Federation our committee was to have received a number of draft laws as early as March, but they are still not ready. As we know, the procedures for the work of the state Duma on draft laws take no less than two months. If the documents are submitted "for a vote" the deputies will be unable not only to study the documents but even to read them. Are some people really still living in those good old days when the entire hall "unanimously" raised their hands? What kind of democracy or profound and well-considered discussion can there be then? Such relations not only do not correspond to the constitution of the Russian Federation but also lead to conflict among the branches of power and a continuation of the situation of lawlessness. [Chernyshev] And what laws do the real proprietors need? [Burkov] They need laws that reinforce their creative energy and develop the market and democratic process. I am speaking about drafts of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation, the package of laws "On Joint-Stock Companies," "On the State Enterprise," "On the Mortgage," "On Changes and Additions to the Law `On Insolvency (Bankruptcy) of Enterprises,'" "On Administration of State Property," "On Securities and Stock Exchanges," "On Trustee Property (Trust)," "On Financial-Industrial Groups and Holding Companies," and possibly certain others. As one can easily understand, the laws must be adopted in packages, that is, one law cannot exist without another. Moreover, the package of laws must be formed for a specific state privatization program. And this is what we do not have. [Chernyshev] Obviously it would be more reasonable to think about the path we have travelled and not rush forward recklessly. [Burkov] Naturally. After all, even the deputies are asking the question--to what extent is privatization economically expedient? But we do not have a complete picture of where Russia's economy has arrived as a result of privatization. There is no register of state property. What proprietor can allow himself that? We do not even have an integrated set of statistics rather than individual ones on the financial condition of state and privatized enterprises. It is impossible to make any calculations. I emphasize that the directives of the State Committee on Administration of State Property and other such acts are not the law. Therefore we need laws that protect the rights of the owner and regulate the privatization process. Nothing else is allowed in civilized rule-of-law states. [Chernyshev] It seems to me that such laws should have already existed. [Burkov] I hope that the arrears in legislative work caused by certain factors will still recede into the past. In any case our committee is aiming toward profound prognosticatory-analytical and at the same time operational work. The only reliable compass in this is high quality of domestic legislation in the name of the revival of Russia and respect for the dignity and individuality of each Russian. [Chernyshev] So our editorial office can get on the "hot line" where the readers can not only share what is bothering them but also make constructive proposals? [Burkov] In any case, when developing decisions we will rely on the most diverse opinions of ordinary people, experts, and specialists. The extensive reader mail, the results of public opinion polls, expert assessments, and other channels of feedback can increase the "reserve of durability" of future laws. * * * For those wishing to share their thoughts, observations, and proposals we give the "hot line" number of the editorial office: 8 (095) 257-29-17.
