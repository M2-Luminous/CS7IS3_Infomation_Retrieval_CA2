According to Liu Shipu, director of the Fire-Control Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security, direct losses of the fires in 1993 amounted to 1.12 billion yuan, the heaviest since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949. Liu attributed the frequent outbreaks of the fires to the increase of sub-standard construction projects and of enterprises dealing with combustibles, management chaos in the fire prevention sector in some departments, poor quality of certain employees, as well as insufficient fire-fighting equipment. He said another major factor was that some enterprises and localities raced for economic profits, at the expense of fire- prevention. A breakdown of the fire figures shows that 57 percent of the 206 large-scale fires broke out in the booming coastal areas and 10 percent in foreign-funded ventures. Liu called on governments at all levels to implement strictly the laws and regulations regarding fire-prevention. He also urged that more funds should be put into the revamping of fire-control equipment and infrastructure. In 1993, 36 Chinese fire-fighters lost their lives and more than 2,000 were injured on duty.
