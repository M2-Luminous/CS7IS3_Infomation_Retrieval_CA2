Our president, who was addressing the press festival yesterday, said the British Government violated international norms by planting a secret microphone in our embassy in London. It also raised the controversy of collaboration between Iran and the IRA. About two weeks ago, the British Foreign Office claimed that its security personnel had discovered documentary evidence that the Islamic Republic of Iran was providing funds to the IRA through its agents and was seeking to plan to deliver weapons to the IRA too. These claims were immediately endorsed by the minister for Northern Ireland affairs in the House of Commons. But not much had happened when a spokesman for Sinn Fein--the political wing of the IRA-- refuted the British claim as a baseless shot in the dark and unfounded propaganda, adding: To eclipse its defeat in organizing peace talks on Ireland, the British Government has resorted to such accusations. Similarly, three days after the British allegations against the Islamic Republic of Iran and following a swift and categorical rebuttal by our officials, London's newspapers revealed that the accusations by John Major's government were totally unfounded and bereft of any grounds or evidence. In this regard, THE SUNDAY TIMES, in its 1 May edition, wrote: The British Government has no acceptable documentary evidence to present to the court. It thus appears that the veteran statesmen of London resorted to espionage and an overt violation of international laws by planting listening devices in our embassy to pursue objectives that were more important than their international credibility and reputation. Many possibilities can be enumerated in an analysis of these actions and London's desired objectives. No one should ignore that John Major's government and the Conservative party led by him are confronting serious problems stemming from a dichotomy in the party. This problem is so crucial that there is talk of the resignation of John Major's government. Despite the defensive action by the British Government in leveling charges against the Islamic Republic of Iran being nipped in the bud, and neither British officials nor the British rumormongering newspapers presenting any plausible evidence of Iran's support for the Irish secessionists, the British Government strove to initiate this unfounded rumor in a so-called preemptive move to prevent humiliation regarding its espionage activities in the Islamic Republic of Iran's Embassy. The British Government--by trampling international laws underfoot--has confirmed that it attaches no importance to its commitments to international rights and diplomatic immunity and that when the country's interests dictate, it considers any illegal activity justified. As a country professing reciprocal respect for others' rights, Britain has--by its recent acts of espionage in the Islamic Republic of Iran's Embassy--again revealed its interventionist and aggressive nature. The past record of espionage is nothing new for the British echelons. They believe that the colonial world of past centuries continues and that Britain has the right to interfere in others' affairs and to trample upon diplomatic immunity. For such countries, wholesome relations based on reciprocal interests have no meaning. What is important is getting information and capitalizing on the amicable approach of the other side. The issue of British spying on the Islamic Republic of Iran's Embassy is not the first such incident. It is certainly not the last. Every country should be vigilant, aware that such intentions and actions might not be confined to one embassy in Britain alone.
