Government heads Viktor Chernomyrdin and Vyacheslav Kebich stated on 5 January that "the necessary preparatory work...has been practically completed," and certified the "achievement of a high degree of readiness of the monetary systems" for unification. Both passages in the statement do not seem obvious. Even with all its difficulties, the stability of Russian finances is significantly higher than that of its "Slavic brother." The negative balance in Belarus' trade has reached more than 100 billion rubles [R], its rate of inflation is 20-25 percent higher than Russia's and the exchange rate of the surrogate "zaychik" to the ruble is 4.5:1. At the same time, the level of wages and pensions of our neighbor exceeds that of Russia by three times. The motives which are compelling the Belrusian leadership to force monetary integration are extremely transparent. First of all, union, judging by the words of the Belarusian Central Bank chairman Mr. Bogdankevich, is thought of according to the artificial exchange rate of 1:1, thus Russia is supposed to allocate approximately R1.6 trillion to maintain currency circulation. Secondly, the need for our neighbor to pay for energy sources in freely covertible currency will disappear, and the possibility of raising the question of "brotherly" prices--like those for Russian consumers--appears. Thirdly, the Belarusian taxpayers are saved from the excise tax, while in Russia oil and gas are subject to a strict tax. Despite the optimism of the two countres' prime ministers, the Belarusian side has still not expressed its readiness to sign the agreement on the single mechanism for managing the budget systems, which indicates their wish not to come under Russian control. The situation becomes even more understandable taking into account the agreement, already signed by Gerashchenko and Bogdankevich, on the schedule for unifying the mechanism for the function of the common monetary system. According to this agreement, the Central Bank of Belarus has the right to establish credit limits and to grant licenses to banks on its territory, while the Central Bank of Russia "is to ensure satisfaction of the basic (? A.B.) requirements...for currency bills." Thus Belarus maintains its political independence, including an independent emissions bank and an autonomous budget, which, as is known, is the main calalyst of inflation. There is no precedent for unifying monetary systems under similar conditions. Consequently, it is possible to discuss the seamy political issues of what is going on. The striving by the high officials of the Russian Central Bank to reanimate, even in a truncated version, the monetary-credit [system] of the USSR is an open secret. There are supporters and collaboraters in the government. However, one must think about the economic consequences of such a "mutually beneficial" union for Russia. There is still one tricky obstacle. Belarus is not opposed to the agreement being implemented by decree of the Russian Federation government, bypassing the State Duma. It is not difficult to guess that the opposition would not hesitate to use this as grounds for accusing the president and the cabinet of ministers of betraying national interests. In September during the signing of the agreement on creating a ruble zone of a new type, Belarusian Supreme Soviet chairman Stanislav Shushkevich delicately posed the question of writing off his republic's debt to Russia. Hastening the current agreement, Belarus apparently wants to keep Russia as a financial donor and achieve with a "caress" what Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan did not succeed in with pressure.
