We also look forward to further clear and strong relations based on confidence and cooperation between two peoples who have the same aspirations, objectives, and march. This march is embodied in unbreakable ties linking our kinsfolk on the eastern and western sides of the River [Jordan]. The success that has been achieved comes to crown and respond to His Majesty King Husayn's directives, calls, and wise views regarding the need to establish clear, firm, and serious Jordanian-Palestinian relations. It also comes as a response to King Husayn's eagerness that bilateral coordination should actually be entrenched on the ground and not on paper, and that the sons of our one people should feel both the results and positive aspects of this agreement in their practical daily life and not in words and wishes. The current formula of this agreement affirms that the Jordanian and Palestinian leaderships wish to outline the features of joint cooperation in the face of developments, and that they also want to confront the challenges and dangers of this phase. This agreement fulfills our masses' aspirations for preserving the elements of their existence and safeguarding a free future and a decent life for their generations. Such a life would put the interests of Jordanians and Palestinians within a bilateral framework and give them a pan-Arab dimension away from the Israeli attempts to control the destinies of the two peoples and confiscate the free and independent Palestinian decisionmaking. The common interest of both peoples requires circumventing all the residues and repercussions of the previous phase. It also requires removing the seeds of doubt and mistrust which the Israelis are trying to plant in a clear Arab soil. This fact, whose political and economic dimensions were affirmed by His Majesty King Husayn last week, has imposed itself on the atmosphere of the talks and disappointed all those who wagered on the inability of both sides to overcome obstacles. It has also disappointed those who believed that bilateral dialogue and interpretations would develop into a state of estrangement and differences, so they would realize their dreams, ambitions, and conspiracies. The Jordanian-Palestinian agreement--along with the economic and financial cooperation issues it addresses--constitutes a step on a long path. However, it is a large and serious step and is part of a larger framework which would pave the way for agreement on all issues that are being raised and that concern the supreme interests of both sides such as Jerusalem, the refugees and displaced people, water, borders, and security in a spirit of joint responsibility and concern for the principles of coordination, solidarity, and cohesion in the battle of peace in order to regain both the occupied territories and the usurped rights. The Jordanian leadership and people have always stood alongside the Palestinian brothers in their just and legitimate struggle to regain their territories, rights, sovereignty over their national soil, and free self-determination. Moreover, King Husayn's affirmations of continued adherence to this pan-Arab principle as part of Jordan's policy on the Palestine question will increase confidence that the march will proceed. This is because the agreement greatly embodies the fateful solidarity which links Jordan and Palestine. This solidarity also prompts the sons of our one people to champion the brothers and kinsfolk in the occupied territories and holy Jerusalem. The agreement also increases confidence that this cohesive march will continue and be enhanced despite all obstacles, challenges, and pressures on various levels and in all fields. It is hoped that the framework of this march will expand under a more comprehensive Arab coordination and on all fronts of confrontation with the enemy as part of the battle for peace and survival.
