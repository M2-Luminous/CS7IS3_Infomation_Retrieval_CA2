To Enter Bio-agricultural Chemical Industry 94FE0163B Tokyo NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN in Japanese 17 Nov 93 p 1--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 94FE0163B Tokyo NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:CSO [Text] Sumitomo Chemical Co. (Mr. Teruo Kosai, president) will full fledge enter into the bio-agricultural chemical field that will make full use of biotechnology. As a first shot, a bio-agricultural chemical that will suppress the growth of white flies will start selling in the United States during l994 and in Japan, it is intended to start its sale possibly as early as 1997. At this point, with the background of the consumers safety goal in mind, bio-agricultural chemicals other than chemically synthesized agricultural chemicals are being actively developed especially in countries centering Europe. In Japan, sex pheromones and insecticides using natural enemy have been partially introduced, but in the future, the company will aggressively form a new agricultural chemical market in the field of bio-agricultiural chemicals that makes use of biotechnology. The new bio-agricultural chemical to be marketed will act as prevention and removal of white flies by suppressing its growth by preventing skin shedding. Insects have hormones that enhances skin shedding and hormones that prevent shedding. With the new bio-agricultural chemical, the suppressing hormone is extracted and artificially synthesized. The scheme is to use this hormone to interfere in the white flies skin shedding. The characteristics of the method is that unlike previously used insecticides which possesses powerful poison, it removes only designated harmful insects. Also, it is claimed that because it applies to its mode of life, the insects will not develop immunity as it does towards insecticides so there is no worry about losing its effectiveness. White flies will proliferate by centering around green house cultivated plants such as green vegetables and tomatoes and also to the outdoor fields. It is a world wide problem and recently, many insecticides have lost its effectiveness due to immunity. Sumitomo Chemical Co. has already registered in South Africa and in parts of the Middle and Near Eastern countries where they have started test marketing. Full fledge marketing will start as soon as a permit is obtained from the United States in 1994. Also, presently, application is being submitted in Japan and if all goes well, marketing will be possible in l997. Looking at the bio-agricultural chemical market world wide, it is said that it comprises about 5%of the total agricultural chemicals, but by the year 2005, it should expand to about 12 to 30%. Domestically, bio-agricultural chemicals are being developed such as sex pheromones that can disturb insect copulation and others that use natural enemy to remove notorious insects. At the present, bio-agricultural chemicals have not been accepted widely due to regulations over conditions of usage, and from the users side, there still exists the image gap between insecticides and the bio-chemicals.
