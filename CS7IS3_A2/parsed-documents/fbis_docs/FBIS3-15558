Put Him Behind Bars!"] [Text] A group of people's deputies has turned to Ukraine's Procurator General V. Datsyuk with a protest in connection with the recent search of the headquarters of the Ukrainian Nationalist Assembly (UNA) and private apartments of individual UNA members. The search was sanctioned by Hariy Shevchenko, Procurator of Pechersk Rayon [in Kiev]. As already reported in the press, at that time, about 30 UNA members were detained, including four candidates for people's deputies. The authors of the protest are trying to find out from the Procurator General what social danger these people present so as to enable the Procurator's Office to violate the status of immunity of candidates for Ukraine's people's deputies. Perhaps our legislators want, in this manner, to show their activity instead of intensifying the struggle against corruption and organized crime? The group of people's deputies, including Kateryna Zavadska, Iryna Kalynets, Mykhaylo Kosiv, Stepan Khmara, Ihor Yukhnovskyy, Ivan Makar, and Mykhaylo Batih, all together 21 people, regards this action as a trial of strength in unleashing a campaign of political repression on the Ukrainian people and political organizations that stand up for the right to a decent life in the Ukrainian state. The people's deputies concluded their protest against the attempt to use law enforcement agencies to deal with political opponents with a demand that those arrested be released without delay.
