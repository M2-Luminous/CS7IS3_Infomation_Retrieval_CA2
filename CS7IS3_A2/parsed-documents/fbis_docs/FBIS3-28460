Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh and Puppet Hun Sen of the two-headed government on 5 February [words indistinct] stated that the troops of the Vietnamese communist puppets and two-headed government have already captured Anlung Veng [Siem Reap Province]. This statement is designed to conceal the serious defeats suffered by the Vietnamese communist puppets, the Vietnamese communists, the alliance, and the two-headed government. II. It is worth recalling that the provisional two-headed government formed in January 1993 was set up by the Vietnamese communists and the alliance to further the Vietnamese war of aggression against the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK] and other national resistance forces. In fact, the government belongs to the Vietnamese communists, the United States, and the alliance. People are all aware that the Para troops [Khmer People's National Liberation Front] were jointly created by the United States and the alliance in the time of In Tam [former prime minister under Lon Nol regime] in 1975. The United States and the alliance supplied money, material, uniforms, food, camps, and training schools to the troops, which are their (?important) forces. So when it saw the forces of the Vietnamese communists, the United States, and the alliance combining, the two-headed government also merged the two armies [National Army of Independent Cambodia and Cambodian People's Armed Forces] politically and militarily. This is why the government has only raised its three-point policy demanding that the NADK be dissolved, that Democratic Kampuchea's liberated zones be surrendered to the government, and that the Party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK] lay down arms and stop fighting in a war that continues to be inflamed by the Vietnamese communists and the two-headed government. III. Political, military, and diplomatic events during the implementation of the Paris accord, during the protectorate of UNTAC [UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia], and during the tenure of the two-headed government [words indistinct] have clearly shown that the old and new enemies of our nation and people continue to maintain their strategy of doing away with our nation and people. However, historic, political, military, diplomatic, and all other events in the past two years and at present are clear evidence that the nation's enemies can never destroy our national forces and people, who have struggled for years to defend the nation, people, and (?race). IV. In particular, the offensives launched during this 16th dry season by (?the two-headed government), the Vietnamese communists, the United States, and the alliance in the areas of (?Phnum Chhat), Stoung-Kompong Thom, Malai, south Sisophon, (?Pailin), Moung-Pursat, Kompong Chhnang, (?Kompong Thom), Kampot, Koh Kong, Kompong Cham, [words indistinct], Preah Vihear, (?Route 12), Route 68, and so on have been defeated one after another. The invading troops and [words indistinct] have been opposed and counterattacked by the national resistance forces in the political, military, economic, and communications fields everywhere. V. Moreover, major offensives were launched by the two-headed government with the aim of (?capturing) the Anlung Veng area, but they were severely defeated for the first time in early (?October) 1993, the second time at the end of January 1994, and the third time on 4 and 5 February 1994. In Phnom Penh, 99 percent of the two-headed government belongs to the Vietnamese communists, while in the provinces it is 100 percent. The government also belongs to the United States and the alliance 100 percent. VI. The Vietnamese communist puppet and Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh of the two-heads-three-eyes government on 5 February agonizingly proclaimed their alleged victory at Anlung Veng. But people (?say): A. The fact that Puppet Hun Sen spoke [words indistinct] about its success is because the puppets have actually suffered a great defeat on the battlefield. They have not captured even one inch captured of Anlung Veng. Most of their forces have been destroyed in the fighting by malaria and typhoid due to the lack of medicine, by starvation, and by the summary executions of puppet leaders including Long Sopheap, Prum Samen, and Keo Prasit. Their troops do not dare to go and fight and groups of hundreds of puppet and para soldiers have fled the battlefields. The 1, 2, 3, and 4 February 1994 statements of Vietnamese communist puppets and two-headed government are also not consistent. Puppet Hun Sen stated that Anlung Veng had already been captured, while other puppets such as Tie Banh, Toan Chay, and other officials of the two-headed government said they were only moving in the direction of Anlung Veng, but had not yet reached the area. B. Some foreign reporters and radios broadcast the two-headed government's (?exaggerated) report about Anlung Veng, while others, citing various views, said Phnom Penh troops have not reached the area yet. All this shows that the two-heads-three-eyed government is in great fear and confusion because it and its masters have been utterly defeated in their major campaigns against Anlung Veng. The people are asking why the two-headed government acts like that. Because it wants to takeover and use Anlung Veng as its supply line to force Democratic Kampuchea to accept its three conditions -- accepting the three conditions means that Democratic Kampuchea will be destroyed. However, the turning point the two-headed government wanted to attain has been reversed; that is, it has been defeated completely on the battlefield [words indistinct]. VII. The entire Cambodian nation and people are pleased to see the defeat of the Vietnamese communist puppets and the two-headed government on the Anlung Veng Battlefield. The NADK, the people, and Democratic Kampuchea have attacked and routed the strategies, tactics, and ambition of the Vietnamese communists and the alliance and their proteges who are opposed to the king's five points for national reconciliation. The people and the masses, especially those in Phnom Penh, are delighted to witness the defeat of the two-headed government, and the success of Democratic Kampuchea with this victory will allow the nation, people, and all patriotic forces to promote King Norodom Sihanouk's five-point national reconciliation plan [words indistinct].
