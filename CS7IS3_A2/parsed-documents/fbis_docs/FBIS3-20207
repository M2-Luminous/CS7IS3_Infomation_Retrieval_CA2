Turkish newspapers have been complaining for the past few days that the economy has been sacrificed for the sake of the elections. It is true that the government, despite claims to the contrary, did not take the necessary steps to fend off the current financial crisis which is systematically draining Turkey's remaining economic resources. Yet, we feel this coalition government would never be capable of preventing an economic crisis, simply because it lacks both the leadership and the competence to do so. We do not want to say that this government or that prime minister would be better for Turkey. We are merely stating the fact that the coalition partnership between the True Path Party (DYP) and the Social Democrat People's Party (SHP) is not equipped with the staff or the know-how to overcome the current crisis. The surge of major foreign currencies against the Turkish lira [TL] is pushing the economy into utter chaos. The central Bank and the Treasury seem completely incapable of making a move to avert the collapse of the Turkish currency. This in return is creating some very serious problems in the market. The traders of many industrial inputs which have to be imported have shut their shops and are refusing to supply the industry with these vital inputs. Traders say the foreign currency situation is so unsettled they will wait for the situation to return to normal before they start operations again. That is why many industries are temporarily packing up. The auto and textile industries, which are the driving force of Turkish industry, are completely paralyzed. We have to add to all this the current stagflation, which further complicates the industrial crisis. We are aware the prime minister and the deputy prime minister are too busy with the election campaign to attend to the economic crisis. But we feel the local elections are an alibi, and that even under normal circumstances there is not much the leaders of the coalition are capable of doing to salvage the economy. This situation cannot continue even a few weeks more. Those who do not have fund reserves, those who have foreign currency debts and even those who have domestic bank loans will all be facing some very hard times in the not too distant future if the slump of the TL continues at the current rate. This means the ranks of the jobless will swell. It also means that all the economic balances of the country will be disturbed, which in turn will lead to domestic upheaval. What we are facing is much more deadly than the murderous PKK terrorist organization...
