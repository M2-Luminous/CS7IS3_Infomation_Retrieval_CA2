He told XINHUA that the good neighborly relations between the Chinese and Kazakhstan people are centuries long, and many common elements bring the two peoples together. He added that the joint statement on Sino-Kazakh friendly relations signed in Beijing last fall was an historic document of great significance, paving the way for long-term and steady development of bilateral relations. On economic cooperation, Nazarbayev said that the two countries have established 150 joint ventures in Kazakhstan. He hoped these joint ventures will develop rapidly. On the domestic economic situation, he said Kazakhstan is rich in natural resources and has tremendous potential economic power. But the disintegration of the Soviet Union has destroyed the economic connection between the former Soviet Republics. The economic situation and the people's lives have been seriously affected. He said Kazakhstan is carrying out industrial structural reform aimed at transforming a raw material economy into a high-tech oriented market economy. He added that Kazakhstan is creating investment laws to better attract more foreign investment, introducing more foreign technology and improving management.
