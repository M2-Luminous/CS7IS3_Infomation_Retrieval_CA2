Yermakov's News Conference"] [Text] Ivan Yermakov, dismissed from his post of Ukrainian presidential representative in Sevastopol, stated at the news conference that he was not going to leave the political arena and that, in his opinion, "Leonid Kravchuk did not do the right thing" when he signed the edict on his dismissal. "This should not have been done with such a difficult situation prevailing in the Crimea," said Yermakov. He pointed out that he will not run for the Ukrainian Supreme Council, but will be a candidate for deputy of the Crimean Supreme Council. He also promised that he would return to his post, no matter what it is called (his dream is to become mayor of Sevastopol). Yermakov stated that he was going to create a Slavic Christian Party that will also be open to Muslims, Judaists, and all other people irrespective of their nationality. He focused on the fact that, over the period of his work as Ukrainian presidential representative in Sevastopol, he had to go through quite a number of unpleasant moments and even hours. In particular, it was when he had to hoist the Ukrainian state flag at the building of the city state administration, since "the colors of that flag do not appeal to me."
