It was hoped after Azerbaijan's disclosure that it agrees to the protocol that was signed in Bishkek by the Russian Federation and Kyrgyzstan that a cease-fire will be observed on the front line and suitable conditions will be created for the implementation of the measures that have been planned to end the dispute. We wish to recall that the NKR leaders ordered their defense units to cease firing on [words indistinct]. The Armenian side has remained committed to that order and has refrained from retaliating against the fire directed on the Armenian defense positions in various parts of the front line. However, it is common knowledge that Azerbaijan is not interested in observing a cease-fire and suspending its military operations. A significant difference exists between that Republic's words and deeds. That viewpoint is confirmed by the following: Azerbaijan's troops intensely shelled NKR positions with artillery units at 0600 today. Later, they attacked (Vashkeravan) in the eastern sector of the front line. The NKR Defense Army Press Service has reported that Azerbaijan's military forces, supported by armored vehicles, also attacked Yarymdzha in the northeastern sector of the front line at 1015. A preparatory wave of artillery shelling preceded their onslaught. According to the information we received at about 1100, the NKR defense units were successfully obstructing the enemy's attacks. Tension continues to exist in other parts of the front line. However, the Armenian units, in an effort to avoid worsening the situation and undermining the cease-fire agreement, have tried not to return the fire of the enemy forces as much as possible. According to the information we have received, an incident did not occur on the border between Armenia and Azerbaijan until this afternoon. However, the situation in the region is tense. Will the agreement reached within NATO's framework for peace also have a bearing on the NKR front line? Who knows?
