FBIS4-1017 "drafr075_c_94026" FBIS-AFR-94-075 Daily Report 19 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA NPKF, Thokoza Hostel Inmates Exchange Fire NPKF, Thokoza Hostel Inmates Exchange Fire SADF To Lend `Limited Support' MB1904135994 Johannesburg SAPA in English 1306 GMT 19 Apr 94 MB1904135994 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [Text] Johannesburg April 19 SAPA -- Thokoza residents and residents of Angola Hostel fought running battles with each other in the southern section of the East Rand township on Tuesday. One National Peacekeeping Force [NPKF] soldier was reported to have been shot dead, and SAPA reporters at the scene saw at least half a dozen cars ferrying wounded to Natalspruit Hospital. Spokesmen at the hospital reported five deaths and at least 40 wounded in the violence. It also appeared as if SADF [South African Defense Force] troops were returning to the township to restore order. By 2.30PM on Tuesday order had been restored to lower Khumalo Street by what appeared to be defence force troops, SAPA reporters said. A spokesman for the SADF's Wits Command told SAPA the army was lending "limited support" to the peacekeepers at the request of the NPKF. It did not mean a full scale military return to the East Rand was imminent, said Major Christo Visser of Wits Command. NKPF members patrolling Khumalo Street, which was covered with stones, tree stumps and burning tyres, came under sporadic fire. Township residents repeatedly charged the hostel and took many casualties, according to a witness. At 1PM a dozen South African Defence Force Ratel armoured vehicles, a fire engine and NPKF armoured vehicles arrived, reporters on the scene said. The arrival of SADF troops was cheered by those in the hostel. In a statement to SAPA, the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] -- whose supporters dominate most hostels -- demanded the NPKF withdraw from the East Rand's townships by 5PM on Tuesday (today) "and the immediate return of the SADF". "The IFP also delivers an ultimatum to the NPKF command to unconditionally return licenced weapons and their registration papers illegally dispossessed from their IFP- supporting owners yesterday," said the statement issued by Abhraham Mzizi, IFP constituency chairman for Thokoza. He also alleged members of African National Congress supporting township self defence units (SDUs) had been seen among NPKF members during a gunfight with residents of Thokoza Hostel No 3 on Monday. Photographs which appeared in Tuesday newspapers confirmed this, according to Mr Mzizi. "NPKF members allegedly escorted MK [Umkhonto we Sizwe -- Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing] members to the hostel yesterday to retrieve weapons they claimed were hidden there. This in itself was a provocative gesture. Together with SDU members they then proceeded to fire indiscriminately at the hostel," charged Mr Mzizi. "This culminated in the crossfire that triggered the tragic death of STAR photographer Ken Oosterbroek..." NPKF members had also illegally taken away from IFP supporters their legal firearms and registration papers on Monday, Mr Mzizi alleged. "This was done in the clear knowledge that it would leave hostel residents vulnerable to an ANC assault... "When confronted by IFP officials, NPKF members refused to identify themselves and allegedly threatened IFP leaders. When IFP officials challenged them (NPKF) to hand over the firearms to police for ballistic testing, they refused to do so," according to Mr Mzizi. There was no immediate comment from the NPKF. Mr Mzizi said the decision to send the NPKF into the East Rand was a "lethal error of judgement". Returning from a tour of the embattled township, IFP Transvaal leader Mr hemba Khoza on Tuesday said law and order had broken down and the language of the township was a bullet. "They are talking though the barrels of guns," he told reporters in Johannesburg. Mr Khoza said he was in an NPKF vehicle when it was petrol-bombed and stoned by residents near Buthelezi section. "There is serious trouble and people are going to die. I was really scared; we're lucky up to now so few people have been killed." On the IFP's decision to contest the elections, Mr Khoza said "it is nice that the leadership has found each other, but they have to quell the violence". He said a lot more had to be done to end violence or there would be no free and fair elections. Mr Khoza repeated the IFP's demand for the withdrawal of the NPKF from Thokoza. He said members of the NPKF were undisciplined and blatantly ignoring orders of their commanding officers. Mr Khoza said he had seen NPKF members refusing an order to disperse a crowd of African National Congress youths and swearing at the commanding officer.
