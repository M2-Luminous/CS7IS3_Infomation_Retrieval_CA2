The National Electoral Commission [CEN] has announced the partial results for the 19 constituencies where the 20 February elections took place. However, it was of the view that it was not in a position to announce the results for the five remaining constituencies, where serious incidents disrupted the smooth running of the electoral exercise. The CEN has, therefore, submitted the dossier to the Supreme Court. The government has no intention of interfering in the settlement of the election disputes. It hopes that the competent organs, which are provided by the Constitution and the Electoral Law to settle electoral disputes, will be able to make their decisions with full sovereignty -- and without any pressure. It will do everything in its power to facilitate the establishment of the institutions of the Fourth Republic with peace and security for all. Finally, the government hopes that everyone will respect the Constitution and the Electoral Law, as is the tradition in each of the countries serving on the Internatonal Follow Up Committee.
