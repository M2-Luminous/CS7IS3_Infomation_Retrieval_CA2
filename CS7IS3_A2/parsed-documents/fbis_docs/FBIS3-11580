CSJ President Orlando Trejos Somarriba said the eviction cases will be studied by a special commission comprising representatives from the National Assembly and various magistrates. He added: "This is an issue with serious consequences involving all state branches." Dr. Rodolfo Robelo, a commission member -- the commission also includes Rodolfo Vargas Sandino and Alba Luz Ramos -- told BARRICADA that no specific agreements were reached in Tuesday's meeting with various Sandinist party representatives, but he added that there was a CSJ initiative "to begin an in-depth investigation" of more than 1,000 evictions occuring within the past three weeks. The National Assembly should appoint a group of deputies from different parties to begin the investigation no later than Monday. Robelo said only the investigation will confirm or deny accusations on the alleged politization of court orders, and he declined any further comments. Nevertheless, Magistrate Robelo said that if the commission confirms the irregularities reported by the injured parties -- namely, that many of the decisions resulted from widespread political corruption within the judicial branch -- "the CSJ has the authority to not only sanction the judicial officials who have taken part in these presumed irregularities, but also to try those officials in compliance with the country's laws." Magistrate Robelo said: "I want to make it clear that this investigation in no way will undermine the independence of the judicial branch," like some self-serving individuals have claimed concerning the parliamentary initiative to resort directly to the CSJ. "Rulings on these cases will be issued by various judges of this state branch," Dr. Robelo added. Concerning the evictions still being carried out, Robelo issued an appeal to the people, urging them "to understand that when a decision is made, it must be carried out." The magistrate also explained the difference concerning cases between private individuals, over which the state has no jurisdiction, and those cases in which it does have jurisdiction. "It is one thing when the state has awarded property to someone, in which case the state has to assume responsibility," said Robelo, pointing out that the plaintiff must take action against the state rather than against the person who occupies a house or other type of property. Robelo believes that in cases in which a poor person has been favored by the state with a home or property, "his rights to that property should be respected when he fulfills all the legal obligations." Meanwhile, CSJ President Orlando Trejos rejected the charge that the execution of justice is being delayed within his state branch. "What is happening is that, because there is no court for administrative disputes, all cases come directly to us when they actually only need an administrative legal ruling," Dr. Trejos said. The CSJ president has been approached by a group of former customs employees who have been waiting for a court decision since June to recover their jobs. The magistrate has promised to receive them in his office on Monday.
