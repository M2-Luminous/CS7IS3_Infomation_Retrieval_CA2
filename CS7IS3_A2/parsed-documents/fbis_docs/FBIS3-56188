Possible Development Scenario" -- from PROMYSHLENNAYA GAZETA section] [Text] The Russian Federation Economics Ministry has prepared a forecast of socioeconomic development in the Russian Federation in 1994. We offer readers excerpts from the section on the main industrial sectors. The crucial factor in industrial development in 1994 will be not so much the significant (60 percent) slowdown in the decline as the character of the specific tasks and problems occurring in the sectors in whose solution the state must be actively involved. The main problems material production will encounter in 1994 can be split into three groups. The first is the group of general economic and financial problems that objectively exist and adversely affect practically all aspects of the economy. The second group of problems is associated with sector and product supply and demand discrepancies. The third group of problems is the problems of specific enterprises, coupled with regional peculiarities. The first group certainly includes problems of nonpayments and lack of funds for development. In the Economics Ministry's opinion, the main ways of solving these problems might include paying off the state's debt and helping to pay off the CIS's debt. As of October 1993 this sum was of the order of 25 percent of the economy's debts. In view of the fact that it is estimated that the paying off of this part of the debt could have a threefold multiplication effect given the particular mechanism currently being prepared at the Economics Ministry, the problem of nonpayments could be resolved in principle. The only way to solve the problems in the second and third groups is on the basis and within the framework of the implementation of a selective structural policy by finally putting into operation a mechanism for selecting enterprises either for support or for reorganization on the basis of the bankruptcy procedure. Hitherto limited support funds have been allocated, often without any assessment of production efficiency, without their being combined with a financial clean-up and organizational and technological renewal of the production potential. Selective support for individual production facilities and projects must be implemented on the basis of a thorough analysis of the support recipients and in accordance with adopted federal programs. In view of the limited financial resources, it is necessary to establish the principle of killing several birds with one stone. In other words, the task is to ensure that the selective identification of support recipients makes it possible to tackle problems that lie within the sphere of interests of several sectors or regions. In 1994 there must be an active policy of reorganizing nonviable enterprises and inefficient production facilities, which are a major drain on the budget and are holding up structural transformations in the economy. A tougher credit and finance policy without appropriate changes in the institutional sphere, above all the absence of the practice of bankruptcies, will constantly exacerbate the problem of nonpayments, which will ultimately affect the level of industrial production. More and more enterprises can be expected to adapt to the prevailing conditions in 1994, with the majority of enterprises being able to ensure the volume of sales that is required for their normal operation. But if uncompetitive enterprises do not cease operations, they will have to be maintained by the budget at the cost of an increased tax burden. Should this happen, there will be no movement of capital from inefficient to efficient producers, whose development will be held up. The Fuel and Energy Complex Production and extraction of fuel resources in 1994 is forecast to be 6 percent below the 1993 level. Oil and gas condensate extraction in 1994 is estimated at 327 million tonnes, as opposed to 357 million tonnes in 1993 (taking extraction by joint ventures into account). But the rate of decline in oil extraction will total 8 percent in 1994, as opposed to 10.5 percent in 1993 and 14 percent in 1992. It is only possible to prevent a decline in oil extraction and then stabilize it if development of new fields with total reserves of 6-8 billion tonnes is expedited. In 1993 the Russian Federation Government exempted oil industry enterprises from paying import and export duties, and also granted concessions in the shape of an exemption from the mandatory sale of their foreign exchange earnings from oil exports so as to provide an incentive for work to develop new fields and bring dormant wells on stream. Foreign firms have been involved in repairing wells. The concessions have been worth around R1.8 trillion to oil drilling enterprises. The rate of decline in oil extraction has slowed as a result. It will be necessary to preserve existing measures of state support in 1994 in order to develop this trend in the oil extracting industry. It is also planned to leave up to 60 percent of the oil lifted from new wells in the hands of the sector so as to ensure that the funds raised from its sale are channeled into modernization, new construction work, and the development of new fields. Supplies of crude oil to refineries in 1994 are forecast at 225-226 million tonnes (taking joint-venture and customer-supplied crude into account) -- in other words, at close to the 1993 level. Production of light oil products will increase somewhat on last year's level, reaching 32.2 million tonnes for gasoline, 58.1 million tonnes for diesel, and 12.5 million tonnes for jet engine fuel. The problem in developing the sector is the low utilization of Russia's refinery capacity for the primary processing of oil -- refineries (not counting enterprises in Groznyy) were operating at 72 percent of capacity in 1993. Yet certain enterprises are operating at a critical level of utilization. With a view to enhancing efficiency in the refining of crude oil, a program has been drawn up to fundamentally modernize and upgrade Russia's oil refineries. During phase one of this program it is planned to increase the level of refining [glubina pererabotki] from 62 to 75 percent and to considerably improve the quality of petroleum products. The gas industry, which has a reliable raw-material base for further development, will in the very near future be the only sector in the Russian Federation with the real potential to increase production of fuel and energy resources. Gas extraction in 1994 is expected to be 620 billion cubic meters. But in recent years nonpayment by customers for gas used has resulted in a virtual halt in the construction and commissioning of new capacity in the sector owing to a lack of funds. As of 1 October 1993 nonpayments for gas were running at R1,345 billion. Provided that the debts owed by the state and the CIS countries are cleared and that subsequent transactions with most customers are effected on this basis, the gas industry is capable of resolving the main issues of its development. The government has made a decision to build a system of main gas pipelines from the gas fields of the Yamal Peninsula across Belarus and Poland to Europe. The commissioning of this sytem of gas pipelines will make it possible to sell Europe additional amounts of Russian gas (up to 65 billion cubic meters by the year 2010), to provide an alternative to the current monopoly corridor through Ukraine, and to guarantee that Russia's obligations to supply gas for export are complied with. Coal extraction in 1994 is forecast at approximately 250 million tonnes, as against 300 million tonnes in 1993. It is also expected that consumer demand will fall owing to the increased cost of the coal itself and higher transportation costs. Any further increase in prices could substantially reduce effective demand. Consequently, a considerable proportion of the actual requirement for coal -- as a result of the severe climatic conditions over most Russian territory -- might not be covered by effective demand. The state of our coal mines is constantly deteriorating, and labor-intensive and dangerous mining is steadily on the increase. Our of 270 pits 60 percent have been mined for more than 20 years and have not been modernized during that period. In order to solve the main problems facing the coal industry in 1994 it will be necessary to change the procedure for allocating subsidies, with a view to steering the bulk of the subsidies toward coal consumers -- above all, rail transport. In 1994 it will also be necessary to start solving the very complex problem of closing down pits and open cuts, which have no future. A list of 42 no longer viable pits and open cuts with a total capacity of 11.2 million tonnes of coal a year and a workforce of more than 48,000 industrial production personnel has now been drawn up. Pit closures will require considerable expenditure on social, technical, and technological measures. Electricity generation in 1994 is forecast at 910 billion kilowatt-hours, as against 945 billion kilowatt-hours in 1993. The power supply situation will remain difficult in a number of parts of Russia. As in all fuel and energy complex sectors, the main problem in power generation is the inability of consumers to pay their debts. Since 1992 there has been state regulation in the sector of electricity and thermal energy, which has made it possible in the context of the gradual deregulation of prices for fuel resources and free prices for other raw materials to set rates for electric and thermal energy through regional power commissions, taking account of the self-financing of power generating enterprises and not allowing unjustifiable costs to be included in the prime cost. It is planned in 1994 to maintain state regulation of prices for electricity and thermal energy at two levels -- the federal and regional levels -- through the relevant power commissions. Despite the shortage of investment funds, it is planned to commission around 700,000 kilowatts of new power generating capacity in 1994 at the Gusinoozersk and Kharanorskaya State Regional Electric Power Stations [GRES] and at other installations in the Far East and Siberia. R83.5 billion will be allocated from the federal budget as a priority in order to improve the safety of existing nuclear electric power stations [AES]. And construction of a number of research testbeds and installations will have to be postponed owing to a shortage of funds. The commissioning of Power Unit No. 3 at the Kalinin AES and Power Unit No. 5 at the Kursk AES -- each with a 1-megawatt capacity -- will also have to be postponed to future years, as will commissioning of the first units at the Bureya, Boguchanskaya, and Irganayskaya Hydroelectric Power Stations. Thus, a problem common to all fuel and energy complex sectors is nonpayment, and its solution will determine the prospects for the development and self-financing of the complex in 1994. The budget has suffered a shortfall of around R0.6 trillion due to nonpayments alone. And more than 90 percent of the consumers of fuel and energy resources are now in debt. Given the specifics of the functioning of the fuel and energy complex -- the continuous nature of the production and consumption of fuel and energy resoures, and the onset of the winter heating period, during which the possibility of enforcing restrictions on customers' access to energy resources declines substantially -- the problem of the failure to pay fuel and energy complex enterprises for the energy resources they supply cannot be fully resolved. At a time of limited budget appropriations the main sources for investment in 1994 will be enterprises' own funds and funds specifically geared to financial support for fuel and energy complex sectors. Appropriations from the federal budget in the coming year will be able to provide only 3-5 percent of the total volume of investments compared with 14 percent in 1993. Metallurgy In 1994, production of finished ferrous rolled metal will decrease by 1 million tonnes compared with 1993 and will total 42 million tonnes; the figures for the production of steel pipes will be 0.2 million tonnes and 5.8 million tonnes, respectively. Production will be 63 and 48 percent of total capacity, respectively. As the economy stabilizes, the demand for metal products will increase, which will require a larger volume of production. For a long time the fixed capital replacement rate in metallurgy has been 0.9-1.2 percent, which is three to four times less than the proper technical and economic level. What this means is that more than 60 percent of steel and 50 percent of rolled metal is now being produced on obsolete equipment. The national economy loses $3.5-4 billion annually as a result of the technical backwardness of Russian ferrous metallurgy and the consequent increased production costs. As well as demand constraints on ferrous metallurgy products, there is the inhibiting factor of problems when it comes to supplying enterprises with refractories, which are the main construction materials for lining heating units, not only in metallurgy, but also in machine building, the construction materials and chemical industries, and defense and other sectors of industry. The production of refractories is being cut by 7 percent annually due to the depletion of existing deposits of magnesite and the delays in the commissioning of new mines. As a result the national economy's magnesite needs will be catered for in 1994 by import purchases. Supplies of imported powder will diminish as the production capacities at the Savinskoye deposit come on stream (beginning in 1995). The production of the basic types of nonferrous metallurgy products is significantly affected by the foreign economic situation and also by the provision of raw materials, which is governed by the very slow development of the Russian mining base. Smelting of alumina is expected to remain steady, as in 1992 and 1993. High production costs have meant that wholesale prices of such highly important types of nonferrous metals as lead, tin, aluminum, and nickel have already reached or exceeded world levels. If this trend continues and the ruble is stable against the U.S. dollar it could result in a loss of competitiveness and a reduction in exports and effective demand for these metals inside the country. Given the demand constraints on certain types of nonferrous metals (titanium, magnesium, refined copper, zinc, and so on), a number of enterprises producing them are using free capacities and manpower to process customer-supplied raw materials from countries in nearby and faraway foreign parts. Measures are envisaged for 1994 to give state support to a number of enterprises in the form of the allocation of quotas for the supply of nonferrous metals for export and concessionary export and import duties, which will make it possible to import the requisite raw materials and supplies for industrial engineering needs, as well as equipment to continue the reconstruction and retooling of the production potential. In order to maker fuller use of the metallurgical complex production facilities established on the territory of the former Union it is advisable to remove export duties from supplies to CIS countries of products produced under intrasector production-sharing arrangements, which will ensure the production of finished products on a mutually advantageous basis. Since the critical state of raw material provision for the sector's enterprises due to the severe underdevelopment of the Russian mining base because of underinvestment remains the main problem facing the development of nonferrous metallurgy, it is necessary to approve the "Nonferrous Metallurgy Raw Material Base Development" program. The main sources of finance for the national program to retool and reconstruct the enterprises and also to develop the raw material base are enterprises' own funds (depreciation, profits), as well as the nonbudget-financed investment fund, which constitute 80.5 percent of the total value of essential investment resources. Around 11.5 percent of the money will come from export and import business concessions and foreign investments and only 8 percent is scheduled to come from centralized credits. The Chemical, Petrochemical, and Microbiological Industry In 1994, according to the projected estimate, output of chemical, petrochemical, and microbiological output will fall by 11 percent against the 1993 level. The production of artificial fertilizers is by far the most responsive to demand constraints. The country has the capacity to produce roughly 20 million tonnes of artificial fertilizer. This is roughly the amount required according to biological norms for applying fertilizer to the soil. However, given the imbalances in the correlation between prices for agricultural produce and industrial items for the agricultural sector, even with state financial support for the agricultural sector the demand for artificial fertilizers, which developed in 1993 meant that between 8.3 and 8.5 million tonnes was produced. Demand constraints for 1994 could intensify, and production of artificial fertilizers could drop to 6.3 million tonnes. At the same time, opportunities for exporting artificial fertilizers will be greatly restricted as their price is already creeping ahead of world prices. The main reason for the high price of artificial fertilizers is the extremely low level at which production capacities are utilized (37 percent). The way out of the existing situation must lie in the planned withdrawal of worn-out equipment and obsolete technology, a cut in the production of outdated products, and an increase in the output of more progressive types of fertilizers. Previously highly specialized enterprises producing artificial fertilizers have started up production of products in constant demand on the market alongside the basic production commodity: polymer plumbing equipment, construction materials made from scrap, bricks, tiles, sports clothes, polymer items. In this way, the financial stability of enterprises is attained, new jobs are created, and problems in the social sector are resolved. In the synthetic resins and plastics industry, proceeding from the projected demand, production of polystyrene, PVC, and chemical fibers and filaments will drop between 5 and 7 percent, and output of polyethylene and polypropylene, taking due account of the assimilation of new capacities, is set to stabilize at the 1993 level. It should be noted that with the attainment of stability in the Russian economy the domestic market's capacity for chemical products will rise once again. Therefore, considering the huge inertia of fundamental major projects, it is essential, despite extremely limited finances, to implement measures for the selective state support of certain of the most important enterprises in the mining and chemical industry. In 1994 the total output of medical supplies is forecast to be at the estimated 1993 level. This presupposes state financial support for producer-enterprises and consumers of medicines. This could be implemented by means of stopping subsidizing imports of medical supplies and channeling the released funds, worth R70 billion in 1994, into maintaining health services and granting preferential medical help to the population (accounting for up to 90 percent of the funds), and into developing the national pharmaceutical industry (around 10 percent). Moreover, it would be expedient to halve export and import duties incurred by enterprises in the medical supplies industry on exported products and purchased raw materials, semimanufactured goods, substances, materials, and equipment. This would make it possible to stabilize the financial situation of enterprises in the sector and improve their provision with the material resources essential for the manufacture of drugs and items for medical purposes. Machine Building The situation in machine building in 1994 will substantially depend on investment activity and the possible reduction (elimination) of demand constraints on certain types of machines and equipment -- primarily output for consumers such as agriculture, construction, freight and passenger transport, and the population (passenger cars). On the whole, the decline in output volumes at machine building complex enterprises is expected to be of the order of 5-7 percent as opposed to 11-12 percent in 1993. Given the forecast demand, production of the most important types of machines and equipment supplied to vitally important sectors of industry and the national economy -- equipment for the fuel and energy complex, diesel engines and diesel generators, AC electric motors, basic types of rolling stock for rail transport, and other types of equipment -- is planned to be at or slightly below the 1993 level. In the machine tool and tool making industry the strained situation with the sale of metalworking equipment and tools -- primarily of the high-tech variety -- will persist, as it did in 1993. With a view to adapting machine tool making enterprises to market conditions, retaining their collectives, and making best use of their production potential, work is actively under way to convert them to the production of multipurpose equipment with manual control, as well as bench metal-cutting and wood processing machine tools that are in demand from small and commercial enterprises and from the population. Moreover, enterprises in this sector are assimilating production of products that are new to the machine tool and tool making industry. This is allowing them to retain their collectives and survive in market economy conditions. But the sector of the machine-tool and tool-making industry producing high-tech machinery and equipment may lose its scientific, production, and personnel potential without state investment support. Demand constraints are having a particularly negative impact on the performance of enterprises in the subsector of tractor and agricultural machine building. As a result, production of marketable output in 1994 will fall 12 percent in comparison with 1993. Yet rural commodity producers are not refusing to take this equipment because they do not need it but because they lack the funds to pay for it, in part because of their nonreceipt of funds for agricultural output consigned to the state. In the automotive industry a complex situation is developing in terms of passenger car sales. The rise in prices and corresponding shrinkage of demand is not only the result of cost inflation in the industrial sectors that supply their products to car plants. In the automotive industry costs for which the vehicle builders themselves are responsible are extremely high. But, taking account of the acuteness of the situation and the need to retain an automotive industry, which determines the development of many related sectors, and considering that excise duties are intended to apply mainly to high-profit output, levying this duty on enterprises that produce passenger cars should be abandoned from 1994. The Defense Complex A characteristic feature of the upcoming period of development is the implementation of targeted substantial structural transformations in sectors of the defense industry. It is envisioned that by the beginning of 1995 the formation of a nucleus of specialized state enterprises to meet state needs in the defense and security field will be complete and a considerable proportion, primarily of enterprises undergoing conversion, will have made the transition to the conditions of a self-regulating open economy. It is estimated that by the end of 1994 state enterprises could account for a total of around 20 percent of the enterprises in defense sectors of industry. In terms of the complex as a whole, the volume of marketable output in 1994 is predicted to be between 94 and 95 percent of the 1993 level, and civilian output's share of total defense complex output will increase by 3 percentage points. The competitive mechanisms for state support for priority areas of conversion, which have been elaborated and are being implemented, are aimed at getting enterprises to choose for themselves the most effective ways to respecialize their production, to study demand, and to build economic links, including foreign economic links. The Consumer Sector The development trends, which have currently developed in the national economy and the measures being taken by the Russian Federation Government to stabilize it, ensure the further consolidation in 1994 of the structural shifts toward the preferential development of the consumer sector. Consumer goods production's share of total industrial output will rise to 23.8 percent in 1994 as against 23 percent in 1993. In the manufacture of nonfood consumer goods there will be increasing signs in 1994 of the satisfaction of effective consumer demand for a number of the most important types of durables. At the same time, given the growth of effective consumer demand and as a result of the stabilization of the population's real incomes combined with a decline in inflation rates, production of some cultural, everyday, and economic goods (particularly socially significant goods) can be expected to stay at the current year's level in 1994. An increase in output for products produced in insufficient quantities is expected. These include food processors, microwave ovens, electric mincers, electric juicers of various capacities, food mixers, and others. An increase in production of compact monochrome television sets (there is a demand for affordable ones) is expected to result in a 4-percent increase in television output. It is predicted that there will be an expansion of the range of commodities produced for farms, yards, and market gardens, including the production of a wide list of manual and power tools offering increased efficiency and intensified work. Should it not prove possible to maintain effective consumer demand in 1994, only refrigerators and freezers can be expected to increase against the expected 1993 level. At the same time there could be a decline in production of washing machines and television sets. Strong competition from higher quality imports will most likely lead to a decline of around 20 percent in tape player and radio equipment production in comparison with 1993. The prediction sees a 7-percent decline in light industry output in 1994 as against 21 percent in 1993. The decline in cotton, woolen, and linen fabric and footwear production will continue. Only silk fabrics, knitwear, and hosiery can expect to match the 1993 production level in 1994. Conclusions The problem for 1994 is to convert the general decline in production into a structural process initiating progressive structural changes. In 1994 Russian industry will face increasing competition from foreign products on both the domestic and the foreign market. By switching to prices at world levels while labor productivity is lower, the products of a considerable number of enterprises could prove uncompetitive on the domestic market, which would require the adoption of a number of protectionist measures with respect to the output of individual raw material sectors (ferrous metallurgy, the chemical and petrochemical industry, light industry) and the global task of raising output quality -- particularly in processing sectors. A preliminary analysis of the problems and the cited calculations for performance parameters in physical production give grounds for considering that the increasing trend among producers to aim to meet effective demand will make it possible in 1994: - to ensure that most enterprises, on the basis of increased accuracy in identifying the scale of production, have the minimum output sales level necessary to function viably; - to stop a whole number of enterprises operating on their previous institutional and technological basis and to start redirecting capital from inefficient to efficient production processes; - to ensure the development of new economic links -- internal and external alike. The pursuit of a consistent structural policy will require selective support for individual production facilities and projects and can be implemented only on the basis of in-depth analysis of recipients of the support in accordance with federal programs which are adopted (after prior expert examination). The main "players" in structural restructuring in 1994 will be enterprises themselves. In the process many enterprises' structural policy could change and become more active with a view to securing the conditions for their own development, increasing competitiveness, and achieving economic growth. At the same time the calculations show that in the sphere of physical production the skewed nature of the structure of production in our country, the temporary structural imbalances between supply and demand for a number of commodities, and the ensuing social problems necessitate the adoption of state decisions on: - settling payment arrangements with CIS countries, particularly for energy resources; - renewing the mineral and raw material base; - overcoming the negative impact of transportation costs on the supply and demand equation; - supporting industrial exports and protecting producers in our country in the context of an "open" economy and rising domestic prices (this applies particularly to light industry); - supporting effective demand in the transportation and construction sectors and among the population.
