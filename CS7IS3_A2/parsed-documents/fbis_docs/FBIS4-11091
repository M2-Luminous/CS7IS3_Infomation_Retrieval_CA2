[Begin Lage recording] It is important. We have always maintained a dialogue with sectors of the Cuban community abroad that maintain a position of respect toward the Revolution, acknowledge the Revolution, and condemn the blockade policy. I would say that this is what shapes our relations with certain sectors of the emigre community. With those sectors of that community who support the goals of U.S. policy -- blockade and hostility toward the Revolution, there is not, nor can there be any type of ties. In this context, this conference is important. There is the precedent of the previous meeting in 1978, if I remember well. That conference did not have a proper follow-up because the U.S. policy was progressively hardened and affected, and is still affecting normal ties between Cuba and the emigre community. Those ties are damaged because they are hampered by U.S. policy. We believe that this meeting will make progress in this regard and could represent an important step to strengthen communication and ties, and above all, policies and the struggle against the blockade.
