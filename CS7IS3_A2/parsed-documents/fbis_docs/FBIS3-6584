In the statement, he said that North Korea's unilateral breakup of the working-level contact for the exchange of special envoys is an act of turning a blind eye to our efforts for dialogue for the resolution of the nuclear issue and the international efforts toward that end and that it is unacceptable and cannot be justified with any excuse. In today's statement, Deputy Prime Minister Yi also said that contrary to our patient efforts, North Korea had consistently maintained an attitude of delaying or avoiding the adoption of the agreement for the exchange of special envoys and gone, finally, so far as to reject the contact itself, stating that it does not hesitate to wage a war. He also said that North Korea had been leading the situation to a serious phase. He added that our position to peacefully resolve the nuclear issue remained unchanged and that the government would explore all means possible, while maintaining close international cooperation to resolve the nuclear issue. He also urged North Korea to be keenly aware of the situation facing it at home and abroad at present and assume a correct attitude at an early date to resume the dialogue to resolve the nuclear issue.
