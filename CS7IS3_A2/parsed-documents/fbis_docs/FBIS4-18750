[Nyangoma] The situation is more serious than in recent weeks, when the forces of law and order were not responding to the orders issued by the political powers. This time, it is worse still because the commander in chief of the army, who was also in the aircraft, was killed, too. Now there is really no one left to command our armed forces. [Braeckman] Just a few days ago, you were calling for foreign intervention. Do you still hold that view? [Nyangoma] More than ever. There is only one way to succeed in reassuring everyone in Burundi, by which I mean the population, but also, and I insist on this point, the army itself. [Braeckman] And what if the army once again refuses to intervene? [Nyangoma] It must understand that it is in its own interest to do so, because there is a real risk of general confrontation among the population. People are still saying that if there is civil war, and that is what we risk seeing happen, then there will be neither vanquishers nor vanquished. [Braeckman] Have you established any contacts in this connection during your visit to Belgium, and, in your capacity as interior minister, do you not believe that you should return to your country as a matter of urgency? [Nyangoma] No, I am not planning to return before the scheduled date. First, I have the means to keep informed about the situation, and second I believe that I can make useful achievements while abroad as well. As for contacts, it is too soon to speak about them, because they have not yet been finalized. [Braeckman] Was the Burundian president, who was onboard the aircraft of his Rwandan counterpart, the intended target, or did he die by chance? [Nyangoma] We will have to wait and see what the results of the inquiry are before answering that question. We still do not yet know the precise circumstances surrounding the assassination. [Braeckman] How will a successor to the late president be appointed? [Nyangoma] According to the constitution, the only eligible successor is the president of the National Assembly, who will take over for a period of three months, after which time a new president will be elected by our Parliament. [Braeckman] What is the situation like in Bujumbura, according to your sources? [Nyangoma] Clearly, the population is very angry. However, for the time being, the situation is calm. The people are aware that there is a difference between the assassination of President Ndadaye and recent events, where our president was an accidental victim. [Braeckman] What are the regional implications of this crisis? [Nyangoma] We must fear that there will be fresh waves of refugees in neighboring countries. Nonetheless, I would like to formally refute the news claiming that a Zairian commando took part in the assassination of President Ndadaye. None of those who were on the scene at the time of the incident reported this item of information. The coup was carried out by the eleventh battalion of paratroop commandos, and eyewitnesses gave their assurance that the assassins were only Burundians.
