As last year, Russia remains Mongolia's principal trading partner. Areas of cooperation include Mongolia's leading industries -- mining, power engineering, geology, agriculture, and transport. Both sides expressed their intention to increase two-way trade, which was worth about $400 million last year. Mongolia will significantly increase deliveries of copper concentrate, currently its main export commodity. The Russian side will also receive fluorspar and articles made from leather and fur. Exports of meat will resume after having been interrupted for a while. Mongolia will import a greater range of goods from Russia. Russia will supply Mongolia with all its requirements for petroleum products. Imports of agricultural machinery and vehicle spares will actually resume. Cooperation in health care and medicine is also resuming. Agreements on the establishment of joint ventures in mining, oil exploration and extraction, and construction work on projects built in Mongolia with technical and economic help from the former Soviet Union also testify to stabilization and progress in the development of bilateral cooperation. Amongst other things, the Russian side will help to modernize the capital's heat and power plant No. 3 and a junction on the Trans-Mongolian railway. Another new feature of the current stage of Mongolian-Russian cooperation is the fact that neighboring regions of Russia -- Buryatia, Irkutsk, and Chita oblasts, Tuva, Krasnoyarsk Kray and others -- are being actively brought into it. Another noteworthy aspect of the equitable and mutually advantageous cooperation between the two neighbouring states is noticeably greater involvement of commercial organizations in foreign trade. Their share accounts for roughly 40 percent of total trade. The sides agreed that this year Mongolia would continue repaying its current debt to Russia.
