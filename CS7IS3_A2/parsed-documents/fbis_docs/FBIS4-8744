Reporter Mirjana Kursmuk talked to Chairman Krajisnik. [Begin recording] [Kursmuk] Today you were supposed to meet with the UN secretary general's special envoy Yasushi Akashi. However, the meeting never took place. Can you tell us what really happened? [Krajisnik] Well, we received information that Mr. Akashi and Mr. Churkin wished to meet with us. The first meeting was set for 1130, and later for 1340. Only Mr. Churkin arrived, and not Mr. Akashi. He told us that unforeseen difficulties had arisen, and that Mr. Churkin [as heard] was called to return to Sarajevo, so that he actually turned back when he was already on his way and went back to Sarajevo [sentence as heard]. We spent almost the entire day in talks with Mr. Churkin, trying to find a solution, because the situation was very dramatic around Gorazde itself and on the international level because there was constant danger of another air attack. There were several unconfirmed reports that our tank had entered the town of Gorazde, that it was firing at Gorazde, and that this would be reason for a military intervention. Not only support for the UN Protection Force in the form of a military strike [as heard], but a military intervention which would mean a general attack. We managed to dispel this dilemma through constant contact with our General Staff and our commanders on the ground, because our tank was not in that position. We nevertheless issued orders that fire was not to be opened on the town itself. After that, pressure eased, and dilemmas regarding our attacks on Gorazde were dispelled. We are still in the midst of talks, because there is pressure for Serbs to withdraw away from Gorazde, but the Serbs cannot withdraw. Moreover, they did not advance in the course of the day. That was inaccurate information launched by the Muslims. [end recording]
