Ferrera accused members of the Armed Forces who have managed Hondutel of committing acts of corruption, although he clarified that there are some honest soldiers. Ferrera questioned those opposed to Hondutel's privatization, because he believes it is a profitable enterprise. He added that an enterprise should be sold when it is profitable in order to receive good offers and not when it goes bankrupt. With regard to the fears of Hondutel employees, he said those who are working efficiently should not worry but noted that "in the private sector inefficient workers are fired." He suggested that the privatization process be handled openly in order to avoid returning to the practice of "state enterprises that belong to all Hondurans ending up in the hands of a few opportunists." He said some appraisals have been made to determine the sum that will be asked for this enterprise, adding that in his opinion it needs new management to give it the modern techniques demanded by the telecommunications world. In Ferrera's opinion, international telecommunications enterprises such as AT&T and Motorola will have to participate in the process. He stressed that there will be various offers in view of Hondutel's profitability, despite its bad administration and a scandalous theft that was detected. He added that the profit, more than the result of a good administration, is due to the administration's decision to raise the tariffs paid by its users. He said that in Hondutel there has been "a scandalous theft; when the best mechanisms are not used to manage an enterprise, there is corruption; it cannot be described any other way." Ferrera said the Armed Forces have been part of that corruption. "If any Honduran can show me that there has been no corruption in Hondutel's management, I will resign my post as finance minister," he stressed. "They (the soldiers) are involved in corruption," he said, but noted that just as there are corrupt soldiers there are also some honest ones.
