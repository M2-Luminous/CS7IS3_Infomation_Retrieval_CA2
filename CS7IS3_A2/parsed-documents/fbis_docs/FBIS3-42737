What is the essence of these supplements? [Medvedchuk] The right to a defense is an unchanging and important feature of a state based on the rule of law. To a considerable extent, it is conditioned by what kind of role is played by the institution of the bar within the legal system. In line with the earlier enacted law entitled "On the Bar in Ukraine," the full weight and authority of lawyers were expanded. However, they were still unable to guarantee citizens' right to a defense. It took a year for the legislators to become aware of the need for supplementary legal changes. In my view, the most essential of these supplements is the provision that--from now on--a citizen who has been arrested by staffers of the internal-affairs organs, security service, or procurator's office as a suspect or an accused person shall have the right to see a lawyer face-to-face (and, therefore, to obtain skilled legal assistance) prior to the initial interrogation. There are also other changes and supplements with regard to a lawyer's participation in the preliminary investigation and the court trial. It must be said that their interpretation corresponds to the legal norms which exist in civilized countries. [Bondar] Insofar as I know, these very demands for guaranteed rights to a defense constituted one of the demands made by the recent lawyers' strike. [Medvedchuk] Yes, that's true. And it is important to understand here that--in demanding the changes which have now been incorprated into the legislation--neither the strike committee nor the Ukrainian Society of Lawyers were defending the rights of the lawyers themselves. The expansion of our full powers and authority is the expansion of the full powers and authority of the citizens who entrust us with the task of defending their rights and interests. [Bondar] A short time ago the expansion of thier own rights was also achieved by the organs of the procuracy; and corresponding changes were introduced into the effective legislation. To what extent are these two branches of justice equal today, let's say--for example--in the pertinent court procedure? [Medvedchuk] With respect to legislative acts and norms in both court procedures and in matters of procedural regulation, the procuracy and the bar are markedly equal. In this connection, however, I cannot--unfortunately--affirm that we have achieved such equality in practice. The courts (such is the inertia of thought) are still inclined to pay more attention to the ideas set forth by the procuracy. But the recent changes, including those in the awareness of our fellow-citizens, attest to the fact that--no matter what has been said there--we are, nevertheless, building a state based on the rule of law. And I am convinced that this will not be just something on paper here in our country. [Bondar] You say that the rights of lawyers are the rights of the citizens whose interests they are defending. But to what extent are the rights of lawyers themselves defended and protected? I ask you this bearing in mind the instances whereby some lawyers have been persecuted for participating in the recent strike.... [Medvedchuk] I would not view this matter in a narrow aspect, inasmuch as lawyers are not at all unique in the legal understanding of a portion of society; their civil rights are the same as those of other persons. As to specific persecutions of lawyers for participating in the strike, let me note the following: These persecutions were neither organized nor targeted in their nature. Leading officials in the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Justice, the Supreme Court, and the Procurator General's Office supported the demands made by the strikers; they addressed a letter on this matter to persons occupying the highest positions in our country. The violations and abuses of power were perpetrated by certain staffers of the law-enforcement organs on the local level. Such actions attested basically to a desire to take adavantage of the strike in order to settle some old scores with certain lawyers who were inconvenient for them. None of these attacks was left without a reaction from the Ukrainian Society of Lawyers. At present I can affirm that there are no illegal actions with regard to lawyers. [Bondar] The Ukrainian Society of Lawyers recently addressed a proposal to the president of Ukraine, wherein they advocated the creation--under him--of a coordinating council for the defense and protection of human rights. But there are quite a few such committees and commissions already in existence. How does your proposal differ from them? [Medvedchuk] The citizens' committees and commissions which already exist cannot encompass all aspects of the right to a legal defense; they are limited to merely the most blatant political cases. But we, as lawyers, encounter on a day-to-day basis violations of human rights which have nothing to do with politics. However, for an individual citizen, they are--believe me--no less painful. Moreover, a person whose interests are being trampled upon cannot always travel in search of justice to a rights-defense committee which is located in Kiev or some other large center. But our proposal boils down to creating a coordinating council which would be able to combine the information and efforts of lawyers (making good use of their organizationally repaired structure) and the other rights-defending organizations. It would also enact decisions pertaining to human-rights violations regardless of whether they involve--so to speak--persons who are of great power in this state. Because for the state there should be no difference whose rights are being violated--whether it is a well-known or a little-known person. It is certainly the case that either one is a citizen of this country. [Bondar] To what extent, in your opinion, does the presently existing legislative base fully defend, protect, and guarantee the right of a citizen to have a defense? [Medvedchuk] If we compare the system of legal defense for a Unkrainian citizen with what we had just a few years ago, I can assert the following: In our country the right to a defense is now much, much greater. Today we are proceeding along the path of building new legislation, introducing new legal norms which--at the legislative level--are strengthening the protection and defense of Ukraine's citizens. Of course, this path is still far from reaching the stage of full protection and defense. But I am convinced that there is no other path for us to take. I anticipate that the new Ukrainian parliament will also support and maintain such a stance. P. S. By the way, if you have questions for the president of the Society of Lawyers--questions which pertain to the legal defense of citizens, their rights and interests--you can send them to our editorial offices. Viktor Medvedchuk has promised to answer them.
