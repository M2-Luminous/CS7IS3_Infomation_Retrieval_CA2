President Kim Il-song's younger brother Kim Yong-chu and veteran economist Kim Tal-hyon have been appointed to jointly manage the group dealing with South Korean Affairs, the official said. The team set up to take charge of relations with the U.S. is headed jointly by Hwang Chang-yop and Kim Yong-sun, both secretaries of the Workers Party, he said. "What laid behind the formation of these two special task forces seemed to be North Korea's intention to break the logjam in its relations with the U.S. and South Korea this year, especially as it marks the 20th anniversary of the designation of Kim Chong-il, son of President Kim Il-song, as his father's successor," said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. North Korea's economy is reportedly in crisis and Pyongyang's refusal to allow full inspections of its nuclear facilities has further aroused suspicion that it is secretly developing nuclear weapons. The U.S. has put pressure on North Korea to accept international inspections of its suspected nuclear facilities and clear up doubts about its nuclear intentions. The U.S. and North Korea reportedly made progress last week in resolving the dispute. Among the North Korean officials named to head the key new task forces, Kim Yong-chu, comanager of the South Korean affairs team, made a sudden political comeback last month when named vice president as part of a top-level personnel shakeup. Kim Tal-hyon, dropped from the post of vice premier and chairman of the State Planning Commission in the same reshuffle, has reportedly been relegated to the post of manager of a chemical factory in Hamhung, North Hamkyong Province. But the South Korean official said that move appeared to be purely a symbolic gesture and that Kim Tal-hyon will soon take up a high-profile job as a major economic policymaker. A North Korean source at the border village of Panmunjom said last month that Kim's appointment as a manager of the chemical factory did not mean his "downgrading to an idle job."
