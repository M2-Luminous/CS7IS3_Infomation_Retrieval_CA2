"With all the contradicting views and political sympathies of Duma factions we have agreed that the Chinese direction in foreign policy and foreign trade is a priority", Rybkin told a press conference on Monday. He added that trade turnover between the two countries went up by 30 per cent in 1993 and that Russia enjoys a three-billion dollar favourable balance in it. During talks in Beijing the Russian delegation offered concrete cooperation projects which can be supported by the governments and parliaments, according to Rybkin. He stressed that Russia is proposing to China unique technologies which "are very important for solving the burning economic problems of China". "Russia's joining `Partnership for Peace' plan should not cause concern of the great eastern neighbour" as Russian armed forces would remain independent anyway. Russia wants to "preserve the originality of its army, both in armaments and the organisational structure. Thus we shall preserve the independence of the army which is not the last in the world", the speaker said. Speaking about the health of Boris Yeltsin, Rybkin said that at his nearly 50 years of age he envies the fitness of the president who is 63. "He feels well, has a strong handshake, good logics and an intensive work schedule", the speaker added.
