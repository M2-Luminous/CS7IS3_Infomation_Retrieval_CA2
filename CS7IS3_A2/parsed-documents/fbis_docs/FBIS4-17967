"I have had talks with Russia's foreign minister, or rather my friend, Andrey Kozyrev...." In this unexpectedly friendly manner, Kinkel began his statement at the closing news conference. He stressed that people in Germany are awaiting the arrival of President Yeltsin with interest and joy, and preparations are on the whole complete, with only a number of technical matters to be clarified. The main thought expressed by the head of the German department was that Germans considers it important for Russia to be fully involved in the process of seeking a settlement in Bosnia and that all decisions on this question should be adopted only with the participation of the Russian side. This applies not only to Bosnia but also to the Near East. After his introductory statement, Kinkel was frankly bored, shifting his weight from one foot to the other while the Russian minister was given a hard time, as virtually the entire hail of questions fell on him. The journalists learned that Russian views on a Bosnian settlement coincided to a considerable extent with the Kinkel-Juppe initiative that was put forward by the foreign ministers of the FRG and France within the framework of the European Union [EU]. "The task now is to make this position, which is becoming consolidated, more precise--taking into account the experience of recent months--and also to get the United States involved in it." "As a result of a series of meetings and conversations that took place this week", Kozyrev said, "I feel considerable satisfaction in connection with the fact that our Western partners are not confining themselves to settling the problem by military means, which are an extreme measure in extreme circumstances. Along with Russia, the West is prepared to double the pace and quality of work specifically on the political approach to settling the conflict in Bosnia. The forthcoming meeting of foreign ministers could prove to be a decisive stage on the path to holding a summit conference." At the same time, there were tough notes, normally not associated with the foreign minister, to be detected in Kozyrev's words, especially with regard to the actions of the parties to the Bosnian conflict. "We need to see how events develop, but the foreign ministers of Russia, the United States, the EU, and the United Nations could also discuss the Bosnian problem without the involvement of the conflicting parties. It seems to me," he continued, "that the important thing now is for Russia, the United States, the EU, and the United Nations to work out a coordinated approach. This is necessary in order to make the conflicting parties in Bosnia aware that there is a reasonable alternative to war and that they will not succeed in playing on differences between various states." "The conflicting sides in Bosnia should get it clear: They can no longer continue the game in which one side or the other puts forward deliberately unacceptable demands, for example, on territory. There will be no more of this," Kozyrev said. ... the military part of the Cologne-Bonn airport, then by helicopter to "Petersberg", three hours later back to the airport.
