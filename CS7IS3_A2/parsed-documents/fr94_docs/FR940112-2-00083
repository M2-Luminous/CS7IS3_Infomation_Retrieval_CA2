FR940112-2-00083 FR940112-2-00057 Dotson's second argument, that the ALJ overestimated the cost of the narcotics, is also unpersuasive. As an initial matter, this claim suffers from the same weakness that proved fatal to his first argument, that is, Dotson testified without contradiction to using $200 to $300 worth of heroin and cocaine daily. 11 If Dotson actually paid less for his narcotics, one would have expected him to testify accordingly. Furthermore, this case is unlike Curtis v. Sullivan, 764 F. Supp. 119 (N.D. Ill. 1991), where the ALJ simply imputed to the claimant an income sufficient to satisfy his addiction. In that case, the ALJ concluded, in the absence of evidence as to legal or illegal employment, that the claimant had to be engaging in SGA in order to support his expensive drug habit. Here, on the other hand, Dotson's testimony as to his thievery filled the gap. From this, the ALJ was justified in finding that Dotson's earnings surpassed $500 per month, thereby rendering him presumptively ineligible for SSI benefits. See 20 CFR 416.974(b)(2)(vii). 11 Moreover, this is not an instance where the claimant's testimony was of such dubious veracity that the ALJ should have discredited it. Dotson's claim to spending $200 to $300 per day on heroin and cocaine, while on the high side, is certainly within the realm of possibility. See, e.g., Hart v. Sullivan, XXX F. Supp. XXX , No. C&hyph;92&hyph;1172 SBA, 1992 WL 496646 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 30, 1992) (claimant ``presently consumes seven or eight twenty-dollar bags of heroin daily *␣*␣*, uses crack every night *␣*␣*, and drinks approximately eight half-pints of hard liquor daily''). We agree with the court in Curtis that simply because a claimant has a severe and expensive drug habit does not mean that the person is engaging in SGA to support it. 764 F. Supp. at 120&hyph;21. The record must contain substantial evidence, of the type outlined in Section II(B), supra , that the claimant is engaging in legal or illegal activities that are substantial and gainful. Because we have held that the ALJ's decision in this case comports with those requirements, we reject Dotson's challenge to the evidence supporting the Secretary's decision. D. Narcotics as an Impairment-Related Work Expense Dotson next raises the interesting yet ultimately unavailing argument that, if illegal activities undertaken to maintain a drug habit can constitute SGA, then the cost of the narcotics must be deducted from income as an impairment-related work expense (``IRWE'') under 42 U.S.C. 1382a(b)(4)(B)(ii) and its interpretive regulations, 20 CFR 416.976. As we discuss below, Dotson misapprehends the nature of IRWEs. 42 U.S.C. 1382a(b)(4)(B)(ii), enacted as part of the Social Security Disability Amendments of 1980, Public Law No. 96&hyph;265, 94 Stat. 441 (1980), provides: In determining the income of an individual (and his eligible spouse) there shall be excluded *␣*␣* if such individual (or such spouse) is disabled but not blind (and has not attained age 65, or received benefits under this subchapter (or aid under a State plan approved under section 1352 or 1382 of this title) for the month before the month in which he attained age 65) *␣*␣* such additional amounts of earned income of such individual, if such individual's disability is sufficiently severe to result in a functional limitation requiring assistance in order for him to work, as may be necessary to pay the costs (to such individual) of attendant care services, medical devices, equipment, prostheses, and similar items and services (not including routine drugs or routine medical services unless such drugs or services are necessary for the control of the disabling condition) which are necessary (as determined by the Secretary in regulations) for that purpose, whether or not such assistance is also needed to enable him to carry out his normal daily functions, except that the amounts to be excluded shall be subject to such reasonable limits as the Secretary may prescribe. See also 42 U.S.C. 1382c(a)(3)(D) (restating same). In 1983, the Department of Health and Human Services promulgated 20 CFR 416.976. See 48 FR 21940 (1983). These regulations established a five-part test for determining the deductibility of an IRWE: We will deduct impairment-related work expenses if_ (1) You are otherwise disabled␣*␣*␣*; (2) The severity of your impairment(s) requires you to purchase (or rent) certain items and services in order to work; (3) You pay the cost of the item or service␣*␣*␣*; (4) You pay for the item or service in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section; and (5) Your payment is in cash (including checks and other forms of money). Payment in kind is not deductible. 20 CFR 416.976(b). With respect to the deductibility of drugs as an IRWE, the regulations provide: If you must use drugs *␣*␣* to control your impairment(s), the payments you make for them may be deducted. The drugs or services must be prescribed (or utilized) to reduce or eliminate the symptoms of your impairment(s) or to slow down its progression. * * * * * Examples of deductible drugs *␣*␣* are anticonvulsant drugs to control epilepsy *␣*␣*; antidepressant medication for mental disorders; medication used to allay the side effects of certain treatments;*␣*␣* and immunosuppressive medications that kidney transplant patients regularly take to protect against graft rejection. 20 CFR 416.976(c)(5)(i), (ii). Consistent with the Act's objective, use of the drugs must be necessary to allow the person to perform work. See Soc. Sec. R. 84&hyph;26 at 18 (1984) (``Routine drugs *␣*␣* are `needed' when they are required to control the disabling condition, thereby enabling the individual to function at work.'').
