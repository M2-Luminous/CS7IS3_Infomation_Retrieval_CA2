They said the compromise text, due to be officially accepted at next week's GATT ministerial conference in Marrakesh for signing the Final Act of the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations, does not refer specifically to international labor standards. But it was agreed that the conference chairman, Uruguayan Foreign Minister Sergio Bonilla, should make a declaration in Marrakesh specifically mentioning the inclusion of the "social clause," for which the United States and France have pressed hard, in the working program of the future World Trade Organization. Washington had threatened to delay the signing of the Final Act in the absence of a commitment to have the future World Trade Organization discuss workers' rights. It maintains that countries exporting goods made by low-paid workers enjoy an undue advantage in trade. Developing countries have opposed inclusion of this issue on the WTO agenda.
