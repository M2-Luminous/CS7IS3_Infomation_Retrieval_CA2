There were no casualties in the attack that was carried out by persons unknown who somehow managed to drive a car through the heavily guarded streets of central Tehran late Tuesday night. According to Tehran sources, Britain requested a "full investigation" with "appropriate measures." A paper reflecting the views of President Hashemi-Rafsanjani accused Mojahedin-e-Khalq, the organization in exile, of carrying out the attack, but the latter denied any connection with the attack and accused the government of fabricating the incident. In a telephone call to a Tehran paper a hitherto unheard of organization called "the Imam's Soldiers" claimed responsibility. Britain has had no ambassador in Tehran since the mullahs seized power in 1979. [passage omitted]
