The statement has come in reaction to a complaint recently lodged with the Brno-based Constitutional Court by a Czech citizen of German nationality living in Liberec, North Bohemia, who demands that some of Benes's decrees be revised and possibly rescinded. Not mentioning the name of Benes, the SL's statement says that the legal order of a democratic state cannot be built on the "moving sands" of the decrees of a "self-styled president" that it says contradict international law. The Sudeten German Landsmannschaft would welcome it if the Czech Constitutional Court "demonstrate such a sovereignty," which is characteristic of the Constitutional Court in Germany, the SL says. "The abolition of certain decrees would by no means destabilise the Czech Republic's legal system," the statement says. "The abrogation of the decrees on `forced labour,' the dissolution of the German University in Prague and the German Evangelic Church, the "recolonisation of the Sudetenland," and on "legalising crimes committed against the expelled," would mean a chance for a new fundamental beginning, the SL believes. The abolition of these decrees would not automatically mean the renewal of the initial legal state, the SL says. It believes, however, that it is necessary that members of the "groups discriminated against thus far" -- and not only Sudeten Germans -- be able to participate in the Czech Republic's development as full-fledged citizens.
