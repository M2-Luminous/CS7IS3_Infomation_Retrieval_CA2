When and how does corruption occur? In your opinion, where are the highest levels of corruption in Colombia? [Samper] The country's highest corruption rates are found within the public administration because of influence peddling, irregularities in the handling of contracts and procedures, and illegal actions by government officials. Certain positions within the government are more vulnerable to corruption and the abuse of power because of the nature of their functions. Therefore, the plan against corruption I have proposed includes special mechanisms to identify and control those positions and create "transparency zones" [zonas de transparencia] in the administration. [Pastrana] The highest levels of corruption in Colombia are linked to the large mafias, particularly the mafias involved in drug trafficking and contraband. These mafias have managed to infiltrate institutions such as civil aeronautics, customs, justice, and the political system. Administrative corruption has also grown because the state continues to be viewed as political booty. The result is a distorted administrative structure -- one without goals, dominated by power brokers, characterized by permanent changes in leadership, and which lacks incentives for honest officials; one in which disorganization fosters corruption. Taking into consideration that this same "politization" dominates our control mechanisms and that our justice system has shown little efficiency, is not hard to understand that why a climate that favors the use of public posts for personal gain has spread. [Navarro] THE ECONOMIST has described Colombia as one of the most corrupt countries in the world. We believe it is one of the most corrupt countries in Latin America. The roots of corruption are embedded in the decomposition of our social values, where religious ethics have not been maintained or have been replaced by secular ethics. Corruption is eroding relations between the public and private sectors in two main areas: decisionmaking and compliance with the law. In order for corruption to exist, someone must be willing to receive money and someone must be willing to pay it. In the state, corruption is basically concentrated in the Executive Branch, because this is where most decisions are made and most funds are handled. Taking into account there are some exceptions, corruption occurs from the highest national levels to the lowest municipal levels. This is clearly associated with public activities, particularly with politics. [EL TIEMPO] 2. Will you "negotiate" with Congress? Congress and the government have been criticized for negotiating bills in exchange for sinecures (appropriations, positions, etc.). Do you believe this mechanism contributes to corruption? Would you employ it during your tenure? [Samper] Of course this mechanism contributes to corruption, and therefore, I will not use it. That was why the Ethics Code of last year's campaign clearly stipulated the responsibility of congressmen supporting my candidacy. Those congressmen are committed to back and promote from Congress the approval of measures aimed at facilitating the government plan I have been presenting to Colombians. In a way, it is a programmatic vote at a national level. [Navarro] Independent government branches are essential in a mature democracy. Therefore, not only will I not employ this mechanism, but I propose that as of today, it be considered a crime to do so. [Pastrana] The country strongly opposed the appropriations. Therefore, we should not yield to any pressure to reinstate them. The problem of positions is linked to a concept of bureaucratic rewards that causes great harm to the country. The weak partisan structures make relations between the president and Congress difficult. We must establish rules to ensure governability. I believe it would be a good idea to explore the mechanism of a pact similar to the one signed by the New Democratic Force with President Gaviria. That pact should seek a commitment with the government plans, and, at the same time, it should publicly assume responsibility in policies. In addition, we should create a political consensus around a development plan that would alleviate pressure on annual budgets. 3. Other Measures [EL TIEMPO] What other measures, in addition to draft bills or statutes, will you implement to fight corruption? [Samper] Our task is to once again make ethics a form of social behavior. To my way of thinking, it is fundamental that the laws generate credibility and thus encourage citizen participation, which I consider the only way to win the struggle against corruption. If we do not get the people to join the struggle by reporting and cooperating, the task of moralization will be very difficult. I intend for my government to once again have grade school classes in constitutional ethics and civics instituted, so that new citizens being formed in school classes may once again take up the lost concept of good citizenship. [Pastrana] I have already begun. The Congress Ethics Commission was created at my request and has started combating corruption in the Legislative Branch. The statute against corruption that I submitted will allow the state the legal basis to investigate and prevent corrupt behavior. It is important to break up that "marriage" between the corruptor and a corrupt person. An organization with power and citizen support is required to carry out intelligence operations as specified in the statute. Special treatment and a commitment by society and by the state is required in order to cope with the Mafia. The status of the war against narcotics trafficking is a result of the permissiveness of government and society. Contraband has always been allowed by the passive and permissive attitude of society. First, there were the sanandresitos [area where smuggled goods are sold openly], and today there are strong ties between contraband and money laundering. The presence of these monies in political parties and in Congress is an insult to the country. Society must wage a considerable battle against contraband if we want to defend our industries and our jobs. The issue of the Cusiana [oil fields] is something else. The country is worried about the macroeconomic effects, but it has not devoted much attention to how to prevent corrupt practices associated with financial boons. Many countries have squandered opportunities that have arisen from such a boon. [Navarro] Laws and statutes are necessary. They must include appointing civic supervisors, punishing more severely front men in money laundering operations and those who pay bribes, lifting bank secrecy laws, requiring public officials to provide statements of income, strengthening control mechanisms, and rewarding informants, among other things. In addition, two essential things are needed: A) To practice new ethics and preach by good example, starting with the president of the Republic; and B) To organize an Operation Clean Hands as of 1500 on 7 August 1994 led by the Search Bloc against corruption, with the participation of the Presidency of the Republic, the Prosecutor General's Office, the Attorney General's Office, the Treasury Overseer's Office, and the technical and support teams that are necessary. 4. Strategies [EL TIEMPO] How will you cope with corruption at the national, departmental, and local levels? [Samper] This will be done by strictly applying the anticorruption statute which I presented and which I hope will become a law as soon as possible. In addition, it is necessary to promote citizen participation in this struggle against corruption, through public trials, citizens supervisors, and privileged access to information. Colombian democracy cannot succumb to the cancer of corruption, which is as dangerous as violence itself. It must strengthen and expedite the work of the control mechanisms. The Attorney General's Office, the Comptroller General's Office, and the Treasury Overseer's Office exist for these basic purposes. As for the issue of regional officials, that worries me, because we cannot allow this great democratic achievement of political decentralization to be foiled by the actions of corrupt and immoral regional officials. The people in the regions must choose their representatives well, since this is the only manner of ensuring that decentralization successfully stays on course. [Pastrana] It is essential to strengthen and make independent all control structures. This must be done not only among those in charge of disciplinary and penal control, but also among those responsible for the control of efforts and results. In the first case, it is important that the country have a visible leader from whom the people can demand results. The Attorney General's Office must take over this role in cases of administrative corruption, just as the Prosecutor General's Office has been doing for other crimes. In the second case, deficiencies at the comptrollerships are considerable and more attention should be paid to them. It is also necessary to strengthen the superintendencies to prevent aberrant situations such as those observed in the public services, or financial crises such as we had in 1982 or the one that Venezuela is currently experiencing. To conclude, a pledge must be made to modernize the administration, increase the continuity of the managerial structure, and actively involve various civic organization in the administration and surveillance of public services. [Navarro] The points outlined above are the main strategies we will use. In addition, we will adopt the following specific measures: A) We will give the post of Overseer of the Treasury permanent status, maintain Dr. Jorge Garcia Hurtado as its director, give that office more punitive duties and its own agents in the departments and in the 50 most highly populated municipalities of the country. We will also establish alternate overseers in the municipalities that receive sizable bonuses. B) As of 7 August 1994 all employees, beginning with the president and vice president of the Republic, must declare their properties and incomes at the Office of the Overseer of the Treasury. The GAZETTE will publish the declarations of officials who have jurisdiction and control on the day they are sworn in and on the day they retire. [EL TIEMPO] 5. What is the connection between the centralization of power and corruption? What will you do about this situation? [Samper] Someone once said: "Absolute power corrupts absolutely." Therefore, the best way to avoid this corrupting power is to open democracy, decentralize power, and implement efficient and effective mechanisms like the ones foreseen in the new Constitution. This connection exists throughout the world, and therefore, it is essential to continue to achieve progress in the regional and local autonomy processes -- so that power is distributed among more people and so the citizenry has more access to it. Fortunately, in Colombia we have a presidential regime; with the 1991 Constitution, we continue to strengthen the other two state branches: the Legislative Branch and the Judicial Branch. Nevertheless, we can and must do much more for the balance and independence of these branches, and to give more power to the regions. [Pastrana] I have no doubts about the connection between the concentration of power and corruption -- both political power and economic power -- and even worse is the possibility of either of them ending up controlling the media. The Television Broadcasting Law should ensure that this cannot happen and that the Executive Branch should be ready to fight the figureheads with all means at its disposal. We must also strengthen the overseeing authorities and establish political campaign financing limits. [Navarro] Of course there is a connection. The centralization of power implies a weakening of checks and balances. This is why we will move toward a balance of power, as outlined by the spirit of the Constitution. We will also use the Search Block we mentioned before to combat our current problems. [EL TIEMPO] 6. Campaign financing could generate corruption. What changes will you make in this area? [Samper] I believe significant steps have already been taken to control the entry of funds whose origin is unknown. There are two basic measures that should be highlighted: government financing and the work of the Overseer of the National Treasury. It is urgently necessary for these measures to go even further, and it is up to us candidates to show transparency and honesty in financing our campaigns. This is why I appointed a director of ethics to control our income. [Pastrana] Illegal money and contributions by economic groups should be handled differently. Regarding the former, eradication is part of the comprehensive strategy I proposed against drug trafficking and contraband. We must also fight the negative influence of economic groups and their control over politics. The 1991 Constitution took one step forward by obliging the state to finance political campaigns and by controlling the contributions made by private individuals. To do this, we need to tighten the measures regarding auditing, accountability, and public reporting of campaign resources. [Navarro] It is absolutely essential to establish spending limits for political campaigns. The ceilings do exist today, but there is no control over penalties for those who violate them. I propose that the Overseer of the National Treasury serve as the authority to enforce these controls and that any violation of them be reason for disqualification. In addition, it is essential that information regarding campaign finances be verifiable and that any related violation also be reason for harsh penalties. [EL TIEMPO] 7. The Inspector General's Office, the Attorney General's Office, and the Comptroller General's Office require changes to become more effective. What are these changes, and when should such changes be implemented? [Samper] It is necessary to make investigation procedures more efficient and to conduct them expeditiously to convince the people, who often do not believe these institutions are reliable. It is necessary to eliminate obstacles and simplify procedures. Investigations of public officials should not go on for four or five years, and sentences should not be announced when the officials are no longer in office. Greater efforts must be made to update and improve these institutions. Also, it is necessary to standardize penalties and procedures for all public officials. It might even be advisable to consider the possibility of officials waiving statute of limitations benefits in disciplinary investigations in corruption cases. [Pastrana] All of these institutions require urgent changes. Nevertheless, I do not think there are any clear-cut means to enable the people to assess the results of such changes. The Attorney General's Office should become the great visible leader in the fight against corruption -- the great ally of the people. This office should be invested with broad powers to conduct investigations and show results to society. The Comptroller General's Office should be made to fit the new concept of stringent procedures and results. It is incredible that, while our public institutions are inefficient, the citizens do not have information enabling them to pressure for the necessary changes. [Navarro] Several changes have already been mentioned, in particular those within the Inspector's Office, which seek to strengthen the office and keep the current inspector. This is very important because he has exceeded the expectations placed on his position. An Inspector's Office without bite is of no use. The Comptroller General's Office requires in-depth reforms, because it is one of the state's most influence-peddling institutions. This is why we did not include it in the Countercorruption Search Block that we propose. It is necessary to start by changing the procedure to appoint the comptroller general, for which the Congress is currently responsible. The comptroller general should be appointed by the attorney general, the Inspector General's Office, and the Legislative Assembly's judicial commission. In addition, the comtroller general's control functions should be strengthened urgently as ordered by the Constitution. [EL TIEMPO] 8. During your administration, what specific mechanisms will the citizens have to actively participate in the struggle against corruption? [Pastrana] There are several mechanisms that should be implemented. First, public hearings would allow public officials and the community's representatives to meet to discuss and resolve matters related to efficiency and morality in carrying out the tasks in the relevant institutions. Meanwhile, civilian overseers should be organized with the power to request from state officials information on contracts and agreements signed by various administrations. This will allow the citizens to know what these contracts are all about. Last, the promotion of active participation is necessary by the various media in this struggle in order to facilitate this task. [Samper] The people and the press should play an active role in the struggle against corruption. It is important to instill in the citizens high moral values and to organize a broad council whose main goal will be to outline goals and assess results. Moreover, the common, everyday citizen should be constantly informed on the quality of services he receives and on the costs of negligence and corruption he is forced to pay. To reach this goal, it is necessary to have more dynamic media and to establish an information system of an obligatory nature that is easily understood by all Colombians. [Navarro] The citizens will have two specific types of anticorruption duties: A) The accusation, with mechanisms as those previously mentioned, such as protection of witnesses and rewards for information, which would go to individuals or to organized communities. B) Control of the process of public contracts and their execution, as well as in the decisionmaking process in matters of public interests We will also establish the community tax clearance certificate. A great deal of encouragement will be given to all of those municipal administrations that, in keeping with current laws, offer active participation to citizens when awarding contracts for public works projects in the community. [EL TIEMPO] 9. And what about the police? Are the changes implemented in the police effective enough to control corruption within this institution? Why? [Samper] We cannot deny that progress has been made in cleansing the police. Nevertheless, the population still considers corruption to be the main problem within this institution, which obviously encourages growing distrust. The recent creation of the post of national high commissioner and the excellent performance by the former directors have contributed to the institution's efficiency. Likewise, it has contributed to improving the institution's public image. However, there is still much to be done such as training, increasing the number of units, especially in the large cities, and establishing efficient and acceptable mechanisms that will prevent excesses by some institution members. [Pastrana] For many years we have neglected our police. Restoring citizen safety depends in great measure on our ability to rescue this institution. Changes are important, but we must be cautious in order to be able to adapt to an ever-changing situation. I would welcome a more concrete commitment by the Executive Branch, because the reforms, including the institution's control and cleansing guidelines require significant investment. [Navarro] Apparently, not. It is necessary to wait for the results of the preliminary report prepared by the National Commission, a body created within the police as a result of the recent restructuring. If it is demonstrated that it is insufficient, new changes will need to be implemented to grant more control to the population. [EL TIEMPO] 10. Performance Indicators. If you were president, which indicators could the Colombian people resort to in order to evaluate your performance in the struggle against corruption? [Samper] They could rely on the most important indicator for a public official: the ability to honor promises made -- my word. [Pastrana] During my administration, I will be committed to eradicating contraband from Colombia. We are talking about a frontal and permanent struggle for the survival of our entire industry and honest work in general. Another of my objectives is to continue the battle the country has been waging against the influence of drug trafficking. All the officials in my administration will be honest and divorced from petty political party interests. We cannot continue attacking influence peddling during campaigns and at the same time exercise it in the government. [Navarro] The indicators will be as follows: A) The number of inmates and persons tried for crimes carried out against the public. B) The public resources recovered during Operation Clean Hands, which I propose be carried out by the Search Bloc against corruption. C) The number of citizens overseeing operations throughout the country at the end of my term. D) The number of public officials who demonstrate transparency in carrying out their duties, which will be measured through their disclosing their income and property. E) The results of the reforms implemented to the institutions to which I referred previously.
