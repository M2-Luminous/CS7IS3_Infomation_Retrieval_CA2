FR940405-2-00190 FR940405-2-00081 (F) Prohibition Against Lobbying of HUD Personnel. Section 13 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act (42 U.S.C. 3537b) contains two provisions dealing with efforts to influence HUD's decisions with respect to financial assistance. The first imposes disclosure requirements on those who are typically involved in these efforts_those who pay others to influence the award of assistance or the taking of a management action by HUD and those who are paid to provide the influence. The second restricts the payment of fees to those who are paid to influence the award of HUD assistance, if the fees are tied to the number of housing units received or are based on the amount of assistance received, or if they are contingent upon the receipt of assistance. The regulations implementing section 13 are codified at 24 CFR part 86. If readers are involved in any efforts to influence HUD in these ways, they are urged to read these regulations, particularly the examples contained in appendix A to part 86. Any questions concerning the rule should be directed to the Director, Office of Ethics, room 2158, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington DC 20410&hyph;3000. Telephone: (202) 708&hyph;3815 (voice/TDD). (This is not a toll-free number.) Forms necessary for compliance with the rule may be obtained from the local HUD office. (G) Prohibition Against Advance Disclosure of Funding Decisions. Section 103 of the Reform Act proscribes the communication of certain information by HUD employees to persons not authorized to receive that information during the selection process for the award of assistance that entails a competition for its distribution. HUD's regulations implementing section 103 are codified at 24 CFR part 4. In accordance with the requirements of section 103, HUD employees involved in the review of applications and in the making of funding decisions under a competitive funding process are restrained by 24 CFR part 4 from providing advance information to any person (other than an authorized employee of HUD) concerning funding decisions, or from otherwise giving any applicant an unfair competitive advantage. Persons who apply for assistance in this competition should confine their inquiries to the subject areas permitted by 24 CFR part 4. Applicants who have questions should contact the HUD Office of Ethics (202) 708&hyph;3815 (voice/TDD). (This is not a toll-free number.) Dated: March 29, 1994. Joseph Shuldiner, Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing.
