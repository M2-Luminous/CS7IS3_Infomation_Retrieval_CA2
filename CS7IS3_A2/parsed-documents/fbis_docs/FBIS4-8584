Nothing can disgust an Albanian more than such a thing: A foreigner violating your home and murdering in the night. Crime disgusts everyone, especially a crime as ugly and macabre as that of recent days. However, the Greek Government has reacted to it in a peculiar way. In its first responses, it not only failed to express sympathy for the victims, which in human terms was the least it could do, but government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos spoke about an Albanian "provocation." This shows not only levity, but malice, especially at this time. The progovernment Greek daily TA NEA did the same. Meanwhile, a previously "unknown" group of Greek terrorists has shouldered responsibility for the crime. However, Venizelos seems not to be interested in this fact. In a way, the terrorist group's claim to the crime frees the Greek Government and Army of responsibility for organizing it. However, facts testify to a group wearing Greek Army uniforms, carrying the weapons of special units, and heading for a Greek border post. Anybody could telephone the editorial board of a newspaper (in this case ELEFTEROTHYPIA) and claim responsibility for this crime in order to let off the true culprits. However, let us suppose that this terrorist group exists and the government did not organize the incident. Is the Greek Government responsible for the crime? Venizelos' reply was that the Greek Government bears no responsibility. It is easy to shirk responsibility in a couple of words, but... Despite attempts toward understanding, Albanian-Greek relations have often undergone very fraught periods. Even today, although the democratic Albanian Government makes every effort to foster not only a calm but friendly atmosphere with Greece, no such predisposition is apparent from the other side, and serious incidents recur. One might ask what responsibility the Greek Government bears for a crime committed by a group of terrorists. Does the Greek Government bear responsibility for public statements issued by its members, such as the former minister Sotiris Kouvelas? Is the Greek Government responsible when such a creature as Sebastianos, who God knows why is called a priest, has founded a radio station that does nothing but rant against Albania and openly spread warmongering propaganda to its neighbor? Is the Greek Government responsible when it deceitfully talks of 400,000 members of the Greek minority in Albania and when it issues bogus protests about alleged violations of the rights of this minority, which lives better on Albanian soil than the Albanians themselves? Are all these things not a direct incitement to such crimes, whether they are planned by "independent" terrorist groups or by organized Greek military forces? It is inexcusable for the Greek Government to maintain such a position, in such a serious situation in the Balkans, when any incident could lead to a conflagration. The Greeks have already come out as allies of the Serbs, but a EU member-state cannot be allowed to behave with such a barbaric mentality. Thousands of Albanians work in Greece today, but thousands of members of the Greek minority likewise work on Albanian soil. These members of the minority cannot be used as Trojan horses, because we are no longer in the era before Christ and the Albanians are not besieged Trojans. The members of the Greek minority came to Albania and worked the Albanian land they still work today; Albanian kindness must therefore not be rewarded with malice, as Greek political representatives have often done. Under these conditions, the present Greek Government would do well to control its policies, in which it is lining up not only alongside the Slavic heathens of Belgrade but against the whole of Europe, and possibly setting off on a path fraught with consequences for Greece and the Greek people themselves.
