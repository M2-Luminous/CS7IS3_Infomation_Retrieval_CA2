Keeping this in mind, let us try to portray the nature of Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk. This is important, because he personifies the entire current Ukrainian leadership -- the union between democrats and postcommunists. As everybody knows, the former as well as the latter had been rejecting the idea of Ukrainian statehood before the "reconstruction," and became advocates of independence only under the pressure of circumstances -- the collapse of the USSR. Therefore, knowing who Kravchuk really is, we will know where Ukraine is going, and what we should expect in the future. President Kravchuk seems to be a man who is able to view issues comprehensively. One should be particularly alarmed by his speeches, in which he consistently explains his opinions, covering any acute issues with apt metaphors and arguments, as a result of which the issue no longer seems as acute as before. Many people ask themselves: Why do people like the president's speeches? The answer is simple. There is a certain probability in his words. This is merely a probability, not the truth. Additionally, it is hard to avoid the feeling that his reasoning is meant to be admired. Moreover, it is meant to satisfy all people. Therefore, while estimating the president, an open-eyed man experiences a harassing duality of feelings: sympathy on the one hand and dissatisfaction on the other. The first feeling is induced by the president's intelligence, the second one -- by the lack of clear goals. The events of the last three years have convinced many people of the certain incongruity and even vulnerability of Kravchuk. It must be pointed out that this incongruity is characteristic of the entire current leadership of Ukraine, whose best representatives, though they represent the right way of thinking, actually lack an essential element of spirit -- the ability to see the main goal and consistently pursue it. This is why estimates of various democratic or postcommunist leaders imply an opinion about their affectation and even insincerity. Despite their words, suspicions occur that those are not their words, that their beliefs are far from these words, and that none of them will keep or is even able to keep their promises. Such a feeling is induced, first of all, by the lack of the above-mention element. There is no doubt that this element is the strength of will. Kravchuk and the entire democratic-postcommunist Ukrainian leadership lack strength of will. This makes Ukraine's leaders incongruous and ephemeral. They resemble people who bargain at the market with a serious look but have no money in their pockets. Summarizing the above, it can be said that Kravchuk has gifted, uncommon intelligence but also a very weak will. His activities in the offices of Supreme Council chairman and Ukrainian president have confirmed this. Let us more carefully examine the internal mechanism of behavior of the current Ukrainian president. All his "successes," which actually reduce to a masterful balancing of Ukraine's political temporariness, are exclusively based on his natural slyness and ability to predict people's moods. He bets everything on intensifying tactical steps and accomplishing superficial tasks, while avoiding resolution of any fundamental issues, which, of course, may lead to minor victories, but which will never result in a global victory. These are the typical deeds of a weak-willed man, who is afraid of everything great. It is evident that the president does not have any state-building program. Since he does not know what he wants, what should he do, and where should he go; he is merely forced to respond to external stimuli. This is the only thing he does. President Kravchuk's activities have explicitly testified to the fact that he is unable, and does not want, to accomplish great tasks connected with the development of the Ukrainian state. Probably, he does not even realize that this is an important matter. This is why he has neither a concept of state nor an approximate plan of action. A man who is not going to do anything does not need any plans. Such an assessment of President Kravchuk is not groundless. The fact that he catastrophically neglects the factor of strength is significant. If someone wants to achieve something, he usually accumulates his strength. Any task is doomed to failure without strength. This relates to any task, particularly, the building of a state. If the Ukrainian president realized the importance of strength in state-building processes, all of his energy would focus on forming such strength. This means that he would undertake intensive work aimed at increasing the number of people devoted to the idea of Ukrainian independence, that he would support -- at the state level -- all activities aimed at boosting patriotic attitudes, and that he would mercilessly terminate all antinational activities. In such a case, massive patriotic-educational work would be conducted in our country, and anti-Ukrainian propaganda would be banned. All this would have to be carried out within reasonable boundaries, respecting reality, however consistently and steadfastly. As a matter of fact, the president would have to make a clear ideological choice, and, having divided the people into two sectors -- supporters and enemies of independent Ukraine -- he would bet on the first one. Understanding that the fate of the Ukrainian state would depend on the strength of the supporters of independent Ukraine, the president would make all possible efforts to strengthen them. A patriotically educated population is the foundation of a state; it is its force that creates and maintains a state. If there is no such foundation, there is also no sense to deal with such attributes of state as political system, economy, democracy, culture, and religion. Meanwhile, Kravchuk completely ignores the main problem of Ukraine -- developing such strength, which means forming a great number of patriots, whose support could help resolve any problems. He attempts to build the state in a different way, which has been unknown in the history of the world -- not by the strength of united people, but by cunning, acrobatic diplomacy. This has not given any positive results during the two years of Ukrainian independence, because it could not give any. Ukraine today resembles an amorphous social substance, all the spheres of which are ruined. There is no order, laws are ineffective, and nobody listens to anybody. No reforms are conducted. Everything is plunged into inactivity and the realm of daydreams. There can be only one answer to the question of who rules Ukraine -- inertia. It is President Kravchuk who is responsible for this situation, because he has never had his own political line, but has always followed an average line of the entire society, not advocating the creative minority, but the inert majority. His willingness to make compromises kills any attempt to move forward. Therefore, there has been no such movement. The lack of movement has resulted in the current decay. This is quite normal, since society can change, and therefore, develop, only if it adapts new ideas advocated by minorities or even separate individuals. The responsibility of a state leader is to select from new ideas the most suitable one, and to guide society in the right direction. A leader should steer society. He should not be an average voice of inoperative mass that does not have any intelligence, but only potential energy. All that has been said above allows one to come to the conclusion that the activities of Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk are determined by two factors -- bright intelligence and weak will. The lack of a precise concept of state-building, the slyness of his policy, his willingness to make compromises, and neglecting the factor of strength are the results of these components. Knowing this, one can easily explain and predict every step of the president. [passage omitted]
