Kiselev begins the conversation by saying that many people of the presidential team were sacked recently or have fallen in disgrace, all of them from the Democratic Russia party. As an example, he cites (?Sabyanin) and Filippov. He asks Burbulis if it is a chain of coincidences or if there is some logic in it. Burbulis answers: "I believe one cannot build a vision of a deep strategy on these two examples. Simultaneously, the administration has brought in such powerful thinkers as Yasen, Lifshitsh, or Baturin. These are the president's very good buys." Kiselev goes on to say that in his recently published memoirs, Yeltsin speaks more than candidly about his early comrades-in-arms, namely Yegor Gaydar and Gennadiy Burbulis himself. He asks if it means that in political terms, Yeltsin is now bidding good-bye to his political past when liberals were his closest allies. Burbulis answers: "I am not excluding this. I believe, however, everything is not so simple. Today Yeltsin is looking for a new social base and a new political structure and professional environment. Unfortunately, he still insists he is the president of the entire people, but his personal psychological directives are not reflecting the real situation in the country." Kiselev wonders whether what Burbulis means is that there are social groups in the country that do not acknowledge Yeltsin as a leader. Burbulis says: "No doubt, there should be a will and an ability to search for consensus with opponents and the ability to create an attractive and a convincing environment that at the same time would be clear for a grassroot voter as well as attractive for the intellectuals in society. Here our president is facing big problems today. Yeltsin's prestige was based more on the idea of a charismatic leader who is able to tackle global issues personally. This image met the psychology of fast, easy results and victories over the past. But that time is gone. Now endlessly blaming communists for ruining the country, or endlessly praising themselves -- `we are democrats, who had courageously taken on the responsibility for society and who now have the right to influence it, because of our political record' -- all this is no big deal any more, it is all secondary." Kiselev says this statement seems to contradict the stance of his former allies in the Democratic Russia and Russia's Choice parties. Burbulis disagrees, saying: "I do not agree with your question. Unlike you, I can't describe my political allies in Democratic Russia as former. They have been and remain my allies. There is a question of a different understanding of the strategy and tactics of achieving the same human, normal, and kind ideals that united us in the first place." Kiselev says that Burbulis left Russia's Choice and that is why he uses the word former. Burbulis continues: "I have not abandoned my allies politically or personally. I have come out to welcome the new political reality in the country, new ideas and people." Kiselev presses on, saying that after discovering Gaydar to political life, Burbulis ended up being pushed out and is not even a supporting principal any more. Burbulis replies: "I regret very much not being able to give a distinct explanation for my recent decisions and having to constantly put this idea that Gaydar and Burbulis were unable to share the posts behind me. I think you know very well why I left the government. It was at the insistence and strategically stubborn pushing of the opposition and at the demand of Khasbulatov." Kiselev says the Yeltsin memoirs give a completely different version of the reasons for Burbulis's departure, saying that the president asked him to take a rest. Burbulis says: "I agree that it is perfectly natural for a man to get tired and, in that regard, I both understand and agree with Boris Nikolayevich. It is for God to judge his opinions and conclusions." Kiselev asks if Burbulis finds the harshness of some of his assessments and conclusions offensive. Burbulis responds: "I'm not offended at all. I think he has the right to his ideas and opinions. But he should be quite tolerant as regards the analyses to which I think his memoirs will now be subjected, because there was a certain human etiquette and unwritten code in our political relations. In the case in question, when the president opens the door through his writings and invites us to express our opinions on the key problems of Russian history of that period, then we're not talking about competing with him, but of the moral right we have been given. I think this will be realized very quickly." Kiselev asks if Burbulis intends setting up a party of his own now that he has left Russia's Choice. Burbulis answers: "I am convinced we do not need at all costs to set up a party as such. We need to assist the formation of an efficient party system in the country. This system is in fact already being formed, but lacks two principal, essential elements. We have two oganizations -- what they call themselves is not important. What is important is that one of them will be closer to the so-called social-democratic program. So the need arises to form a right-of-center organization completely loyal to the ideas of the liberals. This organization, in union with the social democrats, must be set up not by people drifting from the communist bloc in a desperate attempt to get votes; it must be set up consciously by people who have taken on reform and who have a strategy they understand." Kiselev asks if Burbulis sees himself as the leader of this party, or as second man in the shadows, the man who would "push to the fore some charismatic leader." Burbulis answers: "I do not see myself as someone who could be a useful or nice leader, either in a party or state structure. My experience has taught me that I have skills others do not possess. But, aside from the temptation of taking up such a role or post, my strengths, in my opinion, lie elsewhere -- in my ability to work out long-term strategic ideas for the development of the country, society, and state." Kiselev refers to the problem of finding a successor to Yeltsin. Burbulis replies: "We suffered from illusions that it would be easy to find a president who would come along and put things right quickly. There is also the pyscholgical law of electoral campaigns and of the society's socio-psycholgical state. As far as I understand it today, that law requires us to give a clear and honest answer: if it's not Yeltsin, and if we are speaking about the generation of 40- to 50-year-olds, the country does not know that person yet."
