Pawlak added that talks with President Clinton's envoy Madeleine Albright on Friday did not result in a declaration that the "Partnership for Peace" program would lead to NATO membership. According to the prime minister, these are only mechanisms enabling Poland to maintain direct military contacts for which this country will have to pay. These contacts will not function in case of a threat. Pawlak told journalists he had discussed the American proposal with Russian Ambassador to Poland Yuriy Kashlev on Friday. He said the cabinet would adopt an official stand of the Polish Government on this question before the summit of the Visegrad group in Prague and talks with President Clinton and would do this at the nearest session of the council of ministers with the participation of President Lech Walesa and chairmen of the Sejm and senate foreign policy committees.
