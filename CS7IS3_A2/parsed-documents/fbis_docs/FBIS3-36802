The Foreign Minister, the sources said, emphasized in his letter that any strikes, even limited ones, are fraught with heavy consequences. He is sure this will aggravate the situation on all Bosnian fronts and will even jeopardize the UN relief operation, because it will make assistance meaningless. Kozyrev believes the decision to use air power in Bosnia is solely the prerogative of the UN Secretary-General in consultation with the UN Security Council. Speaking about the opening of the airport in Tuzla, Kozyrev said that Moscow was sure that only a political solution could be effective. The main aim of Russia is the same, said Kozyrev. It is the earliest political settlement in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In this plan we fully rely on common sense and the desire of all sides to solve the problem politically.
