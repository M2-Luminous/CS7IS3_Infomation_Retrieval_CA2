The reasons for this are the absolute increase in traffic, delay of NO[.sup]X[/] countermeasures and the increase in the proportion of vehicles with diesel Figure 1. Condition of Environmental Standards for NO[.sup]2[/] At Automobile Exhaust Measurement Stations engines. Along with emphasizing the development of NO[.sup]X[/] reduction technology, the Environment Agency has promulgated the "Act for Special Measures Concerning the Reduction of Total Emissions of NO[.sup]X[/] from Vehicles in Specified Areas" and is aiming at the reduction of NO[.sup]X[/] concentrations. In addition to these countermeasures, there have been various proposals for development of technology for cleaning environments with high concentrations of NO[.sup]X[/], but the main roads of metropolitan areas have become more multilayered and complex each year and creation of tunnels for new roads is progressing. The exhaust from these large-scale tunnels contains more than 1ppm of NO[.sup]X[/], and elimination of NO[.sup]X[/] from large amounts of exhaust is expected to help in improving the environment in these areas. At present, processes in which silica gel and zeolite are used as dry absorbents and ammonia is used for reduction processing are being examined. However, the processing equipment for this method is very large, and the energy and cost required for operation are estimated to be very large. Why Attention Was Drawn to Photocatalysts As one study on the behavior of NO[.sup]X[/] in the atmosphere, the authors examined the NO[.sup]2[/] absorbency and reactivity of soil particles and the metal oxide particles that compose them in relation to photochemical air pollution and acid rain. The absorbency of NO[.sup]2[/] itself was not so large, but we obtained interesting results concerning the absorption using incident light and the increase in nitric acid produced (Table 1). Among the metal oxides that were examined, titanium dioxide (TiO[.sup]2[/], which is present in soil particles at around 1%), which has photosemiconductivity, exhibited a large effect with incident light, and we found out that NO[.sup]2[/] was oxidized to create nitric acid. Nitric acid is more easily absorbed by solids, has greater dissolution in water and is more easily processed using absorbents and absorbent liquids than NO[.sup]X[/]. Therefore, we thought of actively using the photocatalytic operation of these photosemiconductive particles in the elimination of the sub-ppm level of NO[.sup]X[/] in the atmosphere. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 1 Amount of NO[.sup]2[/] Eliminated by Soil Particles and Metal O-| |xides with Incident Light and Quantities of NO and Nitric Acid Produced (-| |NO[.sup]2[/]: 1.6ppm, relative humidity: 50%, units: 10[.sup]-7[/]mol | |g[.sup]-1[/]h[.sup]-1[/]) | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |particle mate-|NO[.sup]2[/]|UV/dark[.sup]*)|NO produced |HNO[.sub]3 | |rial | absorbed |[/] | |[/] produc-| | | | | |ed | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |soil particle-|14.3 |3.6 |6.3 |5.3 | |s 1 | | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |soil particle-|13.2 |3.3 |5.9 |4.5 | |s 2 | | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |soil particle-|13.7 |3.9 |6.9 |6.9 | |s 3 | | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |SiO[.sup]2 |35.6 |1.9 |5.5 |15.1 | |[/] | | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Al[.sup]2[/]|17.7 |1.3 |2.9 |8.2 | |O[.sup]3[/] | | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Fe[.sup]2[/]|9.3 |21.2 |3.8 |3.1 | |O[.sup]3[/] | | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |TiO[.sup]2 |25.9 |16.7 |-0.9 |15.3 | |[/] | | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |CaO |4.4 |- |0.9 |3.4 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |MgO |12.6 |3.2 |1.9 |8.5 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |*) Value indicating effect of photoincidence: amount of NO[.sup]2[/] el-| |iminated with light/amount of NO[.sup]2[/] eliminated in dark | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- NO [.sup]X[/] Elimination Capacity of Photocatalysts As is shown conceptually in Figure 2, the electrons of photosemiconductive metal oxides like TiO[.sup]2[/] shift (excitation) to the conduction band from the valence band when light with an energy higher than the band gap (difference in energy between the valence band and the conduction band) is incident to them, and particles (holes) with a positive charge are generated in the valence band. A part of the electrons and holes are dispersed on the surface of the oxide particle, and the electrons are involved in reduction reactions and the holes in oxidation reactions. TiO[.sup]2[/] is a semiconductor excited by ultraviolet light (360nm or lower) and is an photocatalyst with great oxidative power; we conducted our search for a catalyst for processing NO[.sup]X[/] centered on this. Figure 2. Generation of Electrons and Holes Through Light Absorption by Semiconductors Like TiO[.sup]2[/] 1. Experimental Methods The experimental system shown in Photo 1 [not reproduced] is composed of a flow-through photo reaction unit, reaction gas control unit and analytical unit. The reaction tube is a silica glass tube with fine glass powder sintered to the surface, and about 250mg (0.8ml) of the catalytic powder is applied to this; after being baked in air over night, this was placed in the central glass tube. The catalyst on the surface of the reaction tube was illuminated using 12 blacklights (wavelength 300-400nm). The reaction gas was air that included 1-2ppm of NO[.sup]X[/], and humidity was controlled (dry to 70%) using a humidifier; the reaction was carried out continuously for five hours at a flow rate of 0.5l per minute. During this time, the concentration of NO[.sup]X[/] (NO and NO[.sub]2[/]) in the reaction gas was monitored continuously by a chemiluminescence nitrogen oxide meter. After the experiment was completed, the reaction tube was removed and cleaned ultrasonically in pure water, and the pH and nitric acid ion (NO[.sup]3[/][.sup]-[/]) concentration measured. 2. NO [.sup]X[/] Elimination Activity of the Photocatalyst As can be predicted from Table 1, TiO[.sup]2[/] exhibited a high NO oxidation activity, but about 30% of the NO was released into the gas phase as NO[.sup]2[/], and we can see that this is not a sufficient catalyst from the standpoint of NO[.sup]X[/] elimination. Using something that absorbs NO[.sup]2[/] well can be thought of as sufficient for avoiding the release of NO[.sup]2[/], and we took a look at mixing activated carbon (AC), which can be expected to absorb NO[.sup]2[/] with TIO[.sub]2[/]. Table 2 shows the amounts of NO and NO[.sup]2[/] eliminated and the amount of nitric acid produced when reaction gas that included 1.6ppm of NO[.sup]2[/] was used with TiO[.sup]2[/], AC and TiO[.sub]2[/]-AC. When there was no illumination, it was clear that (1) AC and TiO[.sup]2[/]-AC eliminated NO[.sup]2[/], (2) generation of NO actively occurred with AC and TiO[.sup]2[/]-AC and (3) little nitric acid was generated with any sample (no NO[.sup]2[/] oxidation). On the other hand, when there is illumination, (1) there was a large change in the activity of TiO[.sup]2[/]-AC, and the generation of NO was inhibited and nitric acid production hastened, but (2) there was almost no change in the activity of AC. The elimination of NO[.sup]2[/] and generation of NO by AC is assumed to be reduction of NO[.sup]2[/] to NO when absorbed by AC. On the other hand, both the oxidation of NO to NO[.sup]2[/] and the oxidation of NO[.sup]2[/] to nitric acid (HNO[.sub]3[/]) occur on the surface of TiO[.sup]2[/], and this is related to the generation of various types of active oxygen (0, 0[.sup]-[/], OH, etc.) on the TiO[.sup]2[/] surface when illuminated. The nitric acid generated is caught by the TiO[.sup]2[/] surface, but the ability of TiO[.sup]2[/] to absorb NO[.sub]2[/] is low and part of the NO[.sup]2[/] is thought to be released as a gas. The reason that the release of NO[.sup]2[/] is inhibited by mixing TiO[.sup]2[/] and AC can be understood as there being time for NO[.sup]2[/] to be caught by AC and the NO[.sup]2[/] to be oxidized to HNO[.sub]3[/]. Figure 3 shows the mechanism for NO[.sup]X[/] elimination using the TiO[.sup]2[/] photocatalyst. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |Table 2.

The results are summarized in Table 3, but in comparison with TiO[.sup]2[/]-AC, elimination of NO with a TiO[.sub]2[/]- AC-Fe[.sup]2[/]O[.sub]3[/](I) catalyst is about double, and there is a 30% or more increase in nitric acid production. TiO[.sup]2[/]-AC-Fe[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/](II) is made by mechanically mixing commercially available Fe[.sup]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] powder with TiO[.sub]2[/]-AC and adjusting it, but the nitric acid production is two times that of TiO[.sup]2[/]-AC. Since Fe[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] itself does not exhibit much photocatalytic activity and the optimal addition is 1-3 wt%, Fe[.sup]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] is a auxiliary catalyst, and it can be thought of as playing a role in promoting the attachment of NO and NO[.sup]2[/] to the catalytic surface (see Figure 3). Figure 3. Mechanism of Oxidative Elimination Reaction Table 3. Increase in NO and NO[.sup]2[/] Elimination and HNO[.sup]3[/] Production by Adding Fe[.sup]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] to TiO[.sub]2[/]-AC (reaction gas: NO 1.5ppm, relative humidity 50%, reaction time: 10 hours, units 10[.sup]-6[/]mol); 1) dipping of two wt% Fe[.sup]3+[/] for TiO[.sup]2[/], sintered at 620�K; 2) mechanical mixing of commercial Fe[.sup]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] (2 wt%) into TiO[.sub]2[/]-AC; 3) pH value is that of the water with which the catalyst was washed; 4) The numbers 1, 2 and 3 are the number of times the same catalyst was used. 3. Properties of the Photocatalyst Developed The properties of this TiO[.sup]2[/]-AC- Fe[.sup]2[/]O[.sub]3[/](II) catalyst are as follows: (1) The reaction occurs at room temperature, and sunlight can be used (wavelength: 300nm-360nm). (2) Special reaction materials (ammonia, ozone, etc.) are not needed (NO[.sup]X[/] oxidation uses atmospheric oxygen and the electrons and holes generated on the surface of TiO[.sup]2[/]). (3) It has a high activity for directly oxidizing low concentrations of NO[.sup]X[/] (nitric acid production), and Figure 4. Applications of Photocatalytic nitric acid is caught by the surface. (4) Regeneration of the catalyst is easy (water wash: see numbers (1)-(3) in Table 3). (5) Easy adjustment (mechanical mixing of the three components). (6) Changes in catalytic activity due to relative humidity are small. (7) TiO[.sup]2[/], activated carbon and Fe[.sup]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] are available in large quantities and are not expensive. Toward NO [.sup]X[/] Elimination Applications of the Photocatalyst We have shown that oxidative elimination of NO[.sup]X[/] using a photocatalyst centered on TiO[.sup]2[/] can be effectively carried out, but in order to use this catalyst in the cleaning of tunnel exhaust as in Figure 4, a system that can process large volumes of exhaust gas must be constructed. On the other hand, in cases in which an open atmosphere is the object, as with street canyons (environments that include roads surrounded on both sides with tall buildings in which the concentrations of pollutants like NO[.sup]X[/] are high), there is a need for appropriate placing of the photocatalyst in the environment. 1. Cleaning of Closed Atmospheres Like Tunnels (Using Artificial Light) The small reaction unit shown in Photo 1 [not reproduced] was insufficient for obtaining the necessary data for designing a system for processing tunnel exhaust, and experiments were started using a large scale unit produced jointly with Fuji Electric Co., Ltd. On the inside surface of the cylindrical reaction chamber (1.5m x 0.2m�) in the middle of Photo 2 [not reproduced], 20-30g of catalyst was applied, and illumination provided by an internal fluorescent lamp. Reaction gas containing several ppm of NO[.sup]X[/] passes through an electrostatic precipitator from the inlet at the far left, at a rate of several meters of gas per minute. Part of the results are shown in Figure 5, but in a reaction chamber (basic type) in which the gas passes straight through, with a flow of 2m per minute, the rate of elimination is low at 10%. On the other hand, the data shown by solid black circles is that obtained for a reactor set up with a circular cone shaped screen, and there is a great improvement in NO elimination. We can see that when the gas flow is large, it is important to improve the contact of the gas with the catalyst, inclusive of the time of contact. Research on developing systems, including reaction tube length and diameter and light intensity, aimed at practical applications is continuing. 2. Atmospheric Cleaning for Open Systems Such as Highways (Using Sunlight) It is not easy to use sunlight in tunnels, but it is possible with open systems such as highways. In such cases, the energy for artificial lighting is unnecessary, and we can expect energy efficient economical NO[.sup]X[/] elimination systems. However, since it is difficult to apply powdered photocatalysts Figure 5. Evaluation of NO Elimination Performance to the surfaces of sound absorption panels on highways and the surfaces of buildings and not have exfoliation over the long term, it is necessary to create panels and set them up. What was developed for this were the sheet catalysts shown in Photo 3 [not reproduced]. A fluorine-contained resin powder and the photocatalyst were mixed, and these were formed by rolling. Experiments comparing the two 10 x 10 cm sheets continually exposed to a flow of 0.5l per minute of air containing NO for 12 hours were conducted. With an atmosphere with a 0.05-2ppm NO concentration, it was confirmed that almost all of the NO was eliminated. The NO elimination rate decreases with the time of use of these sheet catalysts, but if they are washed with water the activity is completely recovered. There are many small holes in the fluorine-contained resin used to form the sheets, and, it was shown that starting with NO, gasses and water are easily diffused within the sheet, osmosis takes place, and there was sufficient contact with the catalyst. In addition, when these sheets are exposed to outside air for a long time, a large amount of nitric acid is recovered, so it was confirmed that the photocatalyst works with sunlight. From here on, we plan to move forward with evaluation and research on helping to develop a high activity, durable catalyst, determining how much the photocatalyst can contribute to NO[.sup]X[/] elimination at actual sites such as highways and determining on what scale there is a need for using the photocatalyst in order to make a contribution. While there is a great deal of basic research at present on breakdown and elimination of pollutants using photocatalysts, there are very few that have actually been offered for use. Since photocatalyst technology for elimination of pollutants that does not require thermal energy and does not use reaction materials like ammonia is technology that is in harmony with environmental protection, we plan to promote research and development with the goal of reducing materials that cause air pollution, starting with NO[.sup]X[/]. The sheet photocatalyst that was developed, has the merit of easy "separation on contact with water," which was difficult with the earlier powdered photocatalyst, and there are expectations for applications in the processing of water pollutants and high-level processing of water.
