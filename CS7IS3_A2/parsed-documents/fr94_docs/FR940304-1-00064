FR940304-1-00064 FR940304-1-00013 Not knowing the outcome of the ACC's appeal and Secretarial review, many vessel owners chose not to register for the Norton Sound fishery in 1993. Twenty-eight percent of the vessels that were registered were from the local region. A new fresh market for summer king crab was developed and resulted in higher ex-vessel prices than that received for crab that are processed and frozen. Local residents are maintaining plans to develop this market further. Most of the fishermen on the small vessels are expected to be unemployed if they do not participate in this fishery. The infusion of employment and income from the 1993 small vessel fishery was significant in the Nome area. The 1993 king crab fishery represented the largest fishery in the region in terms of income. Superexclusive registration is predicted to result in an increase in retained revenues and possibly to improve market conditions for increasing overall revenues. It is expected to reduce industry compliance costs. The economic impact on small entities under the proposed action would not result in a reduction in annual gross revenues of more than 5 percent, annual compliance costs that increased total costs of production by more than 5 percent, or compliance costs for small entities that are at least 10 percent higher than compliance costs as a percent of sales for large entities. A copy of this analysis is available from the Council (see ADDRESSES ). This rule is not subject to review under E.O. 12866.
