Margherita Boniver of the Socialist Party, who is among the founders of the new body, on Saturday claimed the Liberal-Socialist "thing" will be a "political subject...not a party but a cultural political movement" which will include members of the Liberal, Republican and Social Democratic parties. "Many parties, like the Socialist Party, have disappeared, but that does not mean their heritage of ideas must also be lost," she said, adding that the movement will place itself "left of center" and will adopt as its slogan and official magazine the phrase, "don't give up." The magazine (NON MOLLARE) already exists and was founded in 1925.
