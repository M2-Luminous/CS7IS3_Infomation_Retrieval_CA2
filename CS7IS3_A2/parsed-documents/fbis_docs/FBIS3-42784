Six years ago this was the distance the heavy Urals would cover every day carrying their loads. For some drivers the path to the mountain of gold was their last: Their brakes would fail on the steep pass and the vehicles "were on their way" into the abyss. As for the extraction of metal, the workers of the Zabaykalzoloto state association spent more time boozing it up than increasing the country's gold supply. "Taking into account the lengthy period when the mines were worked at a loss, their insolvency plus the fact that the measures taken repeatedly...produce no positive results," effective 1 July 1988 the association terminated state mining. The Irokinda mine and the wretched housing that went with it were turned over to the Vitim gold mining artel. In a short period of time the private owners had completed the construction of a mining village and a factory for enriching metal, they had blasted the pass and built a road from Taksimo that could be traveled in a couple of hours, and they had extended an electric power transmission line to Irokinda. The few kilograms of gold from the period of state production were turned into 2.4 "artel" tonnes. And a real interest in Irokinda awakened again in the state: The Buryatzoloto state gold mining enterprise (GZP), which replaced Zabaykalzoloto and with which Vitim had concluded contracts for leasing technical equipment and working the mine, decided to become a joint-stock company. And in such a way that the mine and practically everything that had been done by the prospectors was to go to the GZP, while the artel itself would either be absorbed by Buryatzoloto, half of which was made up of white-collar workers in Ulan-Ude, or, after turning over what it had acquired and created, would depart. At the same time the Vitim prospectors, who were also trying to privatize, wanted nothing to do with this "vassal." The scenario is not a new one: When they divide up property everything is blood, sweat, and tears. But when they divide up a "vein of gold" there is a lot more of everything. The branch, which has enriched the country by tens of billions of dollars, was built through unconcealed exploitation of gold mining artels. They did not receive licenses to work the deposits, they did not have the right to bring armed guards to the gold mines and fields, and they were essentially deprived of their property claims, being forced to conclude agreements for leasing by state enterprises. The latter sold the gold to the Committee on Precious Metals at prices considerably below world prices, but they cut the payment to the "private owners" by another third. They did not manage to include in the first state program for privatization in 1992 a provision whereby gold miners could purchase leased property from state enterprises. A certain breakthrough was made by Council of Ministers Decree No. 117, according to which during 1992 the artels were permitted to work without licenses, automatically, without special clearance from state enterprises, leasing agreements were extended, and payments were set in the form of 75 percent in rubles and 25 percent in foreign currency in direct settlements with the state for gold. The only thing that Buryatzoloto won away from the artels that year was that the apparatus would be maintained with deductions from profit and amortization. And the artels, even without valuable instructions from the GZP, increased extraction and expanded mine production out of their own revenues, they improved the technology for enrichment of gold in the factories, and they started up their own refineries. The prospects of losing the "gold mine" made the general director of Buryatzoloto, Valeriy Dmitriyev, uneasy. His instinct for self-preservation told him that he should gather together some workers and start mining. The question as to "where to mine?" was answered by the general director without much fuss: the best deposits. And where would he find them? He would take them away from the gold mining collectives. Valeriy Dmitriyev acted intelligently. In order not to have the artels form a front against him, he set all the small, placer mines adrift. The GZP chief dealt his first blow to the largest artel in Buryatia, Sayany. "They literally wrenched it out of our hands," said its chairman, Mr. Markovskiy. "Administration by injunction, threats, and graft among workers were all put into play. We were forced to turn over the enrichment factory and abandon the richest mine, Kholba." The best artel, by the admission of other gold miners, one that had built dozens of kilometers of roads and bridges, an enrichment factory, and sanatoriums, one that had extracted about two tonnes of gold and introduced technology for obtaining it in slabs, was essentially crushed, forced to retreat to the Irkutsk placer mines where gold is extracted by the kilogram. It was a little bit difficult for Valeriy Dmitriyev to "swallow up" Sayany and Vitim all at once, and therefore he applied the tactic of gradual suffocation to the second artel, Buryatzoloto. According to the law on minerals and the "Statute on the Procedure for Licensing the Use of Minerals," Vitim, which was operating at Irokinda, should have received its license for 1993 automatically. But the republic Council of Ministers and Geology Committee, sidestepping the law, issued it not to the artel but to the GZP. The Vitim chairman, Vasiliy Davidyuk, resisted for three months, but the futility of the situation forced him to sign an agreement with Dmitriyev. Under these conditions 63 percent of the revenue from the sale of the metal would be collected by Buryatzoloto. Without lifting a finger, last year the GZP "panned" out of the artel R5.9 billion and $1.09 million. In words Valeriy Dmitriyev is not denying Vitim the right to exist: "The artel can form a joint-stock company as a part of Buryatzologo and receive the portion of shares due to it." The trick here is that the GZP sharply increased the sum of its own fixed capital by appropriating the property of Sayany and part of Vitim's and it also gave this sum in current prices while the artel's "wealth" was accounted for in 1992 prices; thus the gold mining collectives' share of Irokinda in its authorized capital shrank from 70 percent to 10 percent. But even that is not the main thing. Valeriy Dmitriyev submitted one document whereby Buryatzoloto would not inform the artel of the plan for extraction for 1994--the general director, in his mind not considering himself the master of Irokinda, gave Vitim up as a lost cause. And this is at a time when the laws are on the side of the latter. On 21 May 1993 Decree No. 480 of the Council of Ministers, was published under the signature of Viktor Chernomyrdin, according to which the Russian Federation State Committee for Management of State Property was instructed "upon privatization of mining enterprises not to include in their authorized capital property leased by gold mining artels and to include it on the balance sheet with subsequent transfer to be leased by the gold mining artels." The fact that the Buryat conflict was so typical and the desire of the Russian GZP's under the Committee on Precious Metals to profit from the formation of joint-stock companies at the expense of the artels led the first deputy chairman of the GKI [State Property Committee], Petr Mostovoy, in a special letter to the local regions to emphasize once again the property rights of the gold mining collectives. And right before that Yegor Gaydar, a deputy prime minister at the time, instructed the chiefs of administrations of the oblasts where precious metals are mined and the chairman of the Council of Ministers of Buryatia, Vladimir Saganov, "before 31 December 1993 to adopt a decision to issue licenses to gold mining artels for precious metal deposits they are working or preparing for working." Vitim still did not receive a license. In this case Valeriy Dmitriyev, the law abider, as he calls himself, interprets obedience to the law extremely broadly. Since October of last year Buryatzoloto has stopped paying money to gold mining collectives for the work they have done. In January, on orders from the general director of the GZP, all work was halted at Irokinda, dozens of armed people from Buryatzoloto took the enriching factory under guard, and they are trying to drive the gold mining collectives out of the electric power plant and the boiler room. The situation heated up to such a degree that the Committee on Precious Metals sent a commission to the site of the events. It is no secret that the chairman of the Committee on Precious Metals, Yevgeniy Bychkov, depends on the general directors of state gold mining enterprises for support. The commission could not fail to take this circumstance into account and it unequivocally took the side of Mr. Dmitriyev. Both Mr. Bychkov and the "generals" of the branch are afraid that Vitim will create a precedent. In order to prevent this they are refusing to recognize the instructions of the State Property Committee and they are ignoring the decrees of the government right down to the directive of Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets of 22 January to the Russian Federation State Committee on the Administration of State Property and the Committee on Precious Metals "to provide for unconditional fulfillment" of the property rights of the artels. If we set aside the moral and legal aspects of the Buryat "battle" it makes no difference to the Russian citizen who chips away at the ores of Irokinda--as long as they mine more gold. But the fact is that the state enterprises have demonstrated their abilities long ago. After taking the Kholba deposit into his own hands and driving Sayany out, Valeriy Dmitriyev, instead of the 1.5 tonnes of gold he had promised the republic, produced 840 kg while the plan of the artel, which was overfulfilled every year, was for 1.2 tonnes. It took Sayany four months to build the technological line at the enriching factory while the GZP took a year. And there was nothing stored up for the future. The same thing will happen if Irokinda is seized. They can only squander what they have obtained for nothing. Practically nothing can change the nature of the GZP, which is capable of surviving only on state subsidies and what they can steal from the artels. In 1992 and 1993 on secret instructions from the government to Buryatzologo, 500 kg of precious metal each were allotted for financing developments in Kholba and Irokinda. The commission of the Committee on Precious Metals, which had been given the assignment of figuring out what the money was spent on, never did make their way to the end. The gold mining collectives from Vitim said that they were prepared to pay half of Buryatzoloto's debt--as long as the artel was allowed to privatize itself along with the mine and everything that had been done there by Vitim. In general this only requires something small--but it is fundamental: to legally grant the gold mining artels the right to buy from the state not only movable but also immovable property. It seems that the Russian Federation State Committee on the Administration of State Property did not have enough strength to beat off the attack from the Committee on Precious Metals and at the last moment that point was left out of the State Privatization Program for 1994. And so there will be more conflicts like the ones in Buryatia and resolving them is not likely to add to Russia's gold supplies. In December of last year at a conference of branch leaders the chairman of the Committee on Precious Metals, Mr. Bychkov, proudly informed those in attendance that against the background of the general depression of the national economy only the gold mining industry did not lower the production level. It is just that Mr. Bychkov forgot to add that this had not occurred because of the self-sacrificing labor of the GZP. It is simply that the gold mining artels had increased gold extraction by 18 tonnes in three years.
