The Impact of the Return to GATT on Enterprises of Our Country and Measures To Deal With It A. Challenges Enterprises of Our Country Will Face 1. Under the principles of the elimination of quantitative restrictions and of trade liberalization, it will be necessary to limit the use of, or eliminate such things as quotas and import and export licenses; as a result our country's import system will undergo significant changes. Our country has committed herself to reduce the use of import licenses by two-thirds and to terminate the import regulation tax within the next three years; eliminating and reducing nontariff barriers are certain to weaken our country's trade protection measures. (Footnote 1: The Legal Rule Formulation Office of the Legal System Bureau of the State Council, "The Great Significance of the Return to the GATT to Our Country's Economic Life," JIAGE LILUN YU SHIJIAN Apr 93) All this will result in our country's enterprises facing a harsher external environment for business operations. 2. "The resumption of GATT membership" may make consumption structure mature too soon, a development which may hamper the upgrading of China's industrial structure. In the 1980s, the strong disruptive effects and demonstration effects produced by imported durable consumer goods constituted the factor which induced industrial structure to become more based on light industry. To improve the overall quality of the economy and increase overall national capabilities so as to create a solid foundation for achieving the strategic objectives for the middle part of the next century, China must immediately start efforts to upgrade her industrial structure, and must change her industrial structure from centering on heavy industry into centering on light industry. With regard to this issue, China is faced with the likely negative effects produced by "the resumption of GATT membership." "The resumption of GATT membership" will inevitably result in substantial increases in imports. After "the resumption of GATT membership," with the weakening of trade protection, China's consumer goods market, especially the market for large, durable consumer goods, will become a place of competition among the signatories. According to forecasts, once foreign durable consumer goods are imported in large quantities, urban consumption first of all will be stimulated. A contradiction will therefore emerge: On the one hand, the upgrading of industrial structure requires that mainly the capital- and technology-intensive industries, chiefly heavy and chemical industries, be developed, and those industries need a great deal of capital input; on the other hand, the main sources of capital formation in China now are residents' savings and fund raising of various forms, but the upgrading of consumption will siphon off a substantial part of residents' savings. Thus the upgrading of industrial structure can be hampered by inadequate capital formation. (Footnote 2: Zhao Lingyun, "Four Major Challenges Posed by the Return to the GATT on the Chinese Economy," GUOJI JINGMAO TANSUO Jan 93) 3. The exporting of competitive products is very likely to cause antidumping problems. Under the GATT's general principles, the signatories may adopt tariff protection policies against imports. After "the resumption of GATT membership," our country can use this method to protect domestic infant industries; Western developed countries can also use this method to restrict exports from our country. This will be a major problem our country will face in regard to exports after "the resumption of GATT membership." It will be difficult to set appropriate prices for some of our country's products which sell well on the international market; as a result such products are prone to be subjected to antidumping tariffs imposed by developed countries in order to restrict imports from China. Such a development can adversely affect competitive exports from our country. (Footnote 3: An Furen, "The Impact of Joining the GATT on Our Country's Economy and the Challenges Our Country's Economy Will Face As a Result," CAIJING WENTI YANJIU (Dalian) Jan 93) 4. The expanding of the scope of protection of intellectual property rights will result in some domestic enterprises paying high licensing fees. As some developed countries are significantly superior in the areas of science and technology, techniques, name-brand trademarks, artistic and literary works, computer software, etc, expanding the scope of protection of intellectual property rights is doubtless in accord with the wishes of those countries. As enterprises of our country will have to incur a great deal of expenditures on many patent licenses and purchase patents from Western developed countries legally, there will be increases in their production costs and a decline in the competitiveness of their products on the international market. (Footnote 4: Yang Pengcheng, "The Impact of the Return to the GATT on the Business World of Our Country," QIYEJIA TIANDI Jan 93) 5. Under the condition of the granting of market access, the technology-intensive, capital-intensive, and knowledge-intensive products of our country will face the challenge posed by the fierce competition from manufactures imported from foreign countries. For a long time, under the protection of high import tariffs, our country has followed the import substitution strategy with regard to technology-intensive, capital-intensive, and knowledge-intensive products, neglecting the introduction of foreign things and giving excessive emphasis to having things produced domestically. Consequently, some technology-intensive, capital-intensive, and knowledge-intensive products and industries of our country, such as passenger cars, electronic products, chemical products, and high-grade textiles and the industries producing those products, are not competitive on the international market. After "the resumption of GATT membership," disruptive impacts of imports on the domestic market will be unavoidable because of the reduction in administrative intervention and the opening of the domestic market. According to estimates, after "the resumption of GATT membership," there will be direct disruptive effects on industries whose output value accounts for approximately one-third of the total value of industrial output. If the degree of connectedness between industries is also taken into consideration, the prospective impact should be considered to be very extensive. (Footnote 5: Chen Jiaqin, "The Impact of the Resumption of GATT Membership' on Our Import and Export Trade and Measures To Deal With It," GUOJI MAOYI Sep 93) B. Measures Our Country's Enterprises Should Adopt To Deal With the Impact 1. Several measures to improve the quality of our country's products so as to make them more competitive. a) Do a good job of selecting pillar industries and leading products, bringing about the progress and improvement of all industrial products. In view of realities in the world and in our country, it is proper to consider making the microelectronic and information industries the pillar industries of our country, making energetic efforts to support them and develop them on a priority basis, linking them up with the information system, automation system, and machinery industry system, and making applications in the hundreds of thousands of enterprises of our country. Such developments will be certain to speed up the technological progress of our country's enterprises and improve enterprises' management standards, thereby fundamentally resolving the widespread problems of poor product quality, small product variety, high costs, and low output in enterprises. b) Accelerate enterprise reform, completing the thorough transformation of enterprises' operating mechanisms as soon as possible. The basic condition for making enterprises transform their operating mechanisms is the transformation of enterprises into actors engaged in market competition. First, separate government from enterprises and have enterprises truly acquire the statuses as commodity producers and business operators and as market actors. Second, it is necessary to build and perfect the domestic market as soon as possible, making the domestic market a unified, open, and comprehensive market based on fair competition. Finally, make enterprises enter the market, thoroughly transforming their operating mechanisms. All this demands that accelerated supporting reforms of the systems regulating foreign trade, finance, materials, investment, prices, technological renovation, foreign exchange, etc., be carried out, so that after the transformation enterprises' new operating mechanisms can be used in practice and play their role. c) Accelerate the development of new products, using high-quality new products in efforts to occupy and expand market. First, it is necessary to form "scientific research-development-production complexes" in backbone enterprises or enterprise groups, directly turning achievements of scientific and technological research and applied technologies into new physical products, and carrying out mass production of those products. Second, with regard to the approach to new product development, it is necessary to mainly depend on one's own research, and to use technology introduction and technological cooperation as supplementary means, combining the two approaches. Lastly, carry out the technological transformation of enterprises on the basis of revolving around the development of new products and variety development. d) Make active efforts to adopt international standards so as to increase the international competitiveness of our country's products. The standards of products reflect the technological standards, labor quality, and management standards involved. Moving our national standards toward international standards as fast as possible and making enterprises directly adopt international standards have also become urgent tasks. e) Reform enterprises' wage system, making employees more inclined to care about product quality. On the one hand, educate employees on quality in a more vigorous manner, and raise employees' quality awareness; on the other hand, have wages linked to product quality. (Footnote 6: Liu Mingshun, "Several Measures to Improve the Quality and Competitiveness of Our Country's Products After Our Country's Resumption of Her Status As a GATT Signatory Member," BEIJING SHANG XUEYUAN XUEBAO Mar 93) 2. Change enterprises' organizational form, so as to make them capable of competing with foreign enterprises. a) Organize enterprise groups, so as to make it easier to give play to overall strengths, to create returns to scale, and to stimulate fund accumulation and vertical and horizontal financing; in addition, group economic activities are equipped with huge fund-gathering capability and multiple fund-gathering channels, a fact which is conducive to the concentration of production and funds. Enterprise groups are capable of organizing and conducting researches regarding the development of new products, and are therefore able to proceed with technological renovation and transformation. Enterprise groups are capable of taking risks and competing with foreign companies, and are therefore both more capable of attracting foreign capital and capable of developing abroad. Currently, our country's enterprise groups are small in scale. Local governments should emancipate their minds, and break down vertical and horizontal barriers; they should adopt policies tilted in favor of enterprises with potentials and good prospects and invigorate those enterprises on a priority basis, and should merge small and medium-sized enterprises with low efficiency and concentrate funds on using technology to tap their latent capability. b) Adopt the joint stock system. The joint stock system is tied to socialized large production. The joint stock system clarifies ownership rights over assets, so that enterprise employees' status as masters will become explicit and concrete. For now, correctly leading residents to move toward stock and bond trading so as to turn consumption funds into production funds also constitutes an effective way to increase funds. (Footnote 7: Wang Chuanrong and Li Huimin, "A Preliminary Discussion of How Some Enterprises of Our Country Should Meet the Challenge Posed by Joining the GATT,'" SHANDONG CAIZHENG XUEYUAN XUEBAO Feb 93) 3. Effectively use a flexible tariff system or differential tariffs to protect national industry. At present, for developed countries, tariffs no longer constitute a powerful means of trade protection, but developing countries can still protect their domestic industry very effectively by using the flexible tariff system approved by the GATT. While lowering the overall tariff level, it is necessary to adopt flexible differential tariffs in view of the differences in the level of technological development of different industries and the differences in the competitiveness of different products of a given industry. It is necessary to carry out little or no reduction in tariffs applied to industries and products which are being developed domestically, such as products of the electronic, chemical, and medical supply industries. It is proper to substantially reduce the tariffs applied to industries and products with regard to which our country enjoys rather high technological standards and is very competitive, such as textiles, clothing, light industry products, and toys. (Footnote 8: She Jianzhi, "The Advantages and Disadvantages of Our Country's Return to the GATT and Measures to Deal With the Issue," JINGJI WENTI Feb 93) 4. Conscientiously study and consult various countries' successful experience regarding nontariff trade-protection measures, in an effort to develop our national industry. a) Government's necessary intervention in international economics and trade is indispensable; b) endeavoring to maintain a low restriction on market shares of imports; c) in order to prevent being controlled by foreign enterprises, some countries prohibit foreign enterprises from carrying out any direct investment in some sectors; d) enforcing strict technological standards and safety and health laws and regulations; e) support provided by the fiscal and financial policies of the government; f) the policy of having things produced domestically; and g) organizing customs unions and free trade areas, thereby exercising trade protection based on having blocs of states serving as the actors. 5. Seek better conditions for entering the international market and for acquiring advanced technologies by making use of the GATT. At the present moment, to different extent all the major developed industrial countries are imposing conditions or restrictions on giving our country the most-favored-nation treatment, imposing discriminatory quantitative restrictions on our country, applying unjustifiable antidumping measures against our country in an inappropriate manner, and controlling technological exports to our country. After "the resumption of GATT membership," our country can try to gradually eliminate those discriminatory trade conducts and barriers under the relevant provisions of the GATT. (Footnote 9: Yang Taishan, "The Impact of the Return to the GATT on Our Country's Enterprises," QIYEJIA (Wuhan) No 23, 92) 6. Organize production and marketing in accordance with international rules and practices. In the process of taking part in the international division of labor in a comprehensive manner, our country's enterprises should observe international practices. For example, they should pay attention to compensated use, special-purpose use, and regional and scope restrictions in regard to the introducing, utilizing, and purchasing of patents, trademarks, copyrights, etc. Enterprises should clear up matters of intellectual property rights involving foreign works, technologies, trademarks, and patents which they are now copying, reproducing, or use without compensation. As another example, those enterprises which have long been competing on the basis of low prices should analyze their products' share of a given market and their price ratios to comparable foreign products; if the share is too large, it would be necessary to try to reduce the concentration, for otherwise such a situation can cause damage law suits and antidumping investigations. (Footnote 10: Zhou Saiqin, "The Impact of the Resumption of GATT Membership on Our Country's Industry," JINGJI WENTI TANSUO Mar 93) II. The Impact of the Return to the GATT on Domestic Prices in Our Country and Measures to Deal With It A. Impact on Domestic Prices in Our Country Some comrades believe that "the resumption of GATT membership" will have a large impact on the general price level on the domestic market. From a short-term perspective, prices will decline on the domestic market. With the accelerated reform of our country's foreign trade system, tariffs are gradually becoming the main means of regulating imports and exports. With the further opening of the domestic market, high-quality, low-price products from the international market are more likely to enter the market of our country, thereby bringing about decreases in prices of comparable domestically produced products. On the other hand, as required by the GATT, our country's tariff level had to be appropriately lowered, and as a result selling prices for some imports on the domestic market will decline. All this will help alleviate supply and demand contradictions, and will thus suppress inflation, thereby contributing to effectively maintaining relative stability of the general price level on the market. From a long-term perspective, it will be more difficult to maintain the basic stability of the general price level on the market. a) Under the traditional system, our country has been a low-price country. After the resumption of GATT membership, the domestic price level will move toward the price level on the international market, leading to price increases. b) With the economy becoming more externally oriented, the supply and demand relationships on the international market and the resultant price fluctuations will both directly affect the supply and demand balance and prices for materials in our country. c) With the reform of the foreign exchange system, downward exchange-rate adjustments' role of encouraging exports and inhibiting imports will be strengthened; increases in purchasing prices for goods for export will bring about some increases in prices for comparable goods sold domestically. Therefore it is necessary to establish a new set of effective mechanisms for suppressing inflation. (Footnote 11: Sun Quan and Zhang Xianbin, "The Impact of the Resumption of GATT Membership' on Domestic Prices and Measures to Deal With It," JIAGE LILUN YU SHIJIAN Apr 93) Some other comrades believe that after "the resumption of GATT membership" the domestic general price level's basic tendency to increase amid general stability will be determined by the following several situations. a) Price increases caused by the expansion of the scope of market regulation of prices will be hampered by such factors as the opening of the domestic market and the intensification of market competition. According to estimates, after the scope of market regulation of prices is expanded, prices for energy and raw materials will rise to some extent, and prices for factors of production will also rise, but because of competition the manufacturing sector will be forced to absorb such price increases; thus prices for manufactures and consumer goods can remain basically stable, and the domestic general price level will not be markedly affected by the two factors. b) Import tariff concessions and the downward adjustments of renminbi [RMB] exchange rates are also two mutually constraining factors. c) The price-raising effects of protection of intellectual property rights will also be cancelled out by the acceleration of technological progress. Consequently, after "the resumption of GATT membership," the domestic general price level will neither fall substantially nor rise substantially. It will show a tendency to rise amid general stability. (Footnote 12: Zhang Qian, "A Preliminary Analysis of the Impact of the Resumption of GATT Membership' on the Domestic General Price Level," GUOJI MAOYI WENTI Jun 93) According to another view, in the process of development as well as reform and opening up, an economically backward country will see large increases in its price level, or even hyperinflation. As far as international factors are concerned, the spread of international inflation into a country represents a necessary law. It can spread through many means such as foreign trade, foreign capital, foreign debts, and exchange rate devaluation; it can also spread from the coastal regions to the hinterland. As yuan may not be taken abroad, international inflation can spread to the country, but domestic inflation cannot spread abroad. All this shows that in the process of opening up, our country's price level will inevitably rise until it is the same as the price level on the international market. By increasing the openness of our country, "the resumption of GATT membership" is certain to accelerate the rising of domestic prices. (Footnote 13: Yang Fan, "The Impact of the Return to the GATT on Prices in Our Country," GUOJI MAOYI WENTI Feb 93) Some comrades have also analyzed the defects of the traditional price system. As they have pointed out, except for a few commodities, the international and domestic price systems have been basically disconnected for a long time; "the resumption of GATT membership" will surely have disruptive effects on the domestic price system. First, in terms of the price level, the lowering of tariffs and the reform of the domestic tax and fee system will result in the price level falling somewhat; but reforms regarding the dual-track yuan exchange rate system and the foreign-exchange distribution system will lead to increases in the domestic price level, and especially the further downward adjustment of yuan exchange rates will result in increases in prices for goods for export; enterprises will spend more on debt serving, resulting in increases in costs, and the purchasing prices for goods for export will also rise accordingly; increases in fees for foreigner-related services will also bring about increases in some related fees. Second, there will be further adjustments of price structure. Prices for some goods which are too high or too low domestically will gradually move toward prices on the international market. With the development of international service trade and because of the demand of the development of tertiary industry in our country, service fees will be substantially increased. (Footnote 14: Ma Song, "The Impact of the Resumption of GATT Membership on Prices in China and Thoughts on Measures to Deal With It," JIAGE LILUN YU SHIJIAN Jun 93) B. Price Reform Measures Which Should Be Adopted To Deal With the Impact 1. In accordance with the demands of the socialist market economy, accelerate the transformation of the price-forming mechanism and establish a pricing mechanism based mainly on market regulation of prices. In the future, on the one hand, it is necessary to supplement and perfect the pricing measures regarding the production materials, light industry products, and agricultural products for which prices have been decontrolled, truly giving enterprises the right to set prices; on the other hand, gradually decontrol, in batches and by stages, prices of products which are suitable for being decontrolled and of which conditions for decontrolling are basically ready, such as prices for grain and some production materials as well as fees for some social and business services. (Footnote 15: Gao Tiesheng and Zhang Xuehong, "The GATT and Price Reform in Our Country," JINGJI LILUN YU JINGJI GUANLI May 93) 2. Accelerate and deepen price reform. a) Accelerate the price reform related to prices for imports and exports. b) Accelerate the price reform related to factors of production, so as to stimulate the flow and factors of production and the growth of the factor market. Especially, it is necessary to accelerate the reform of prices for input of factors of production relating to imports and exports. c) Accelerate the reform of tertiary industry prices. d) Introduce market-economy countries' effective pricing methods and principles which are conducive to market competition, and reform the pricing methods and principles which do not meet the demands of international competition and a market economy. e) On the basis of referring to practices in market-economy countries, establish and perfect our country's socialist-market-economy system of the state's macro-level price administration, regulation, and control. f. Enhance the investigating and research involved in the price decisions made by enterprises, especially large- and medium-sized enterprises, strengthen enterprises' internal price management, give emphasis to the gathering of price information, train price workers, etc. (Footnote 16: Ma Song, "The Impact of the Resumption of GATT Membership' on Prices in China and Thoughts on Measures to Deal With It," JIAGE LILUN YU SHIJIAN Jun 93) 3. Transform the function of price work, and improve price management, so as to meet new demands. a) Broaden the horizon, and emancipate the mind; establish the concept of large market and the concept of the international market; and enhance the analysis of dynamics of the international market, and study the links between the domestic and international markets and the impacts of the domestic and international markets on each other, making such analysis and study one of the preconditions for handling price work. b) Perfect price laws, regulations, and methods, reduce direct administrative intervention, and use laws and policies to regulate enterprises' pricing behavior and to guide the functioning of the market, so as to make sure that the situation is in accord with internationally followed principles. c) Guide efforts to establish industrywide price consultation organizations, which will coordinate the respective industries' prices for imports and exports. (Footnote 17: Sun Quan and Zhang Xianbin, "The Impact of the Resumption of GATT Membership' on Domestic Prices and Measures to Deal With It," JIAGE LILUN YU SHIJIAN Apr 93) 4. Complete the price reform mainly consisting of price deregulation as soon as possible. As a comparison of the price structure of our country's products with that of the international market would show, prices for industrial products and capital-intensive products of our country are too high, whereas prices for primary products and labor-intensive products of our country are obviously too low. In terms of our country's tariff structure, our country's nominal tariff rates for industrial products and capital-intensive products are high, whereas our country's nominal tariff rates for primary products and labor-intensive products are low. After the return to the GATT, it will mainly be tariffs on industrial products in the high tariff category and with values higher than on the international market that will be reduced; on the markets for such important industrial products as automobiles, machinery, and electric appliances, domestically produced products will be easily replaced by foreign goods. However, prices for primary products such as crude oil and coal are lower than international prices; thus, after "the resumption of GATT membership," those products will flow to the international market in large quantities, thereby aggravating the situation of short supply on the domestic resource market. Therefore, to take the initiative in meeting the challenge posed by "the resumption of GATT membership" to domestic industries, it is necessary to carry out the price reform mainly consisting of price deregulation, so as to increase as much as possible the time difference between the decontrolling of prices and the lowering of tariffs. In this way it will be possible both to give full play to prices' role in allocating resources and guiding production and consumption, and to mitigate the disruptive effects produced by the substantial weakening, caused by the reduction in nominal tariffs, of the protective effects of actual tariffs on industrial products. At the same time, alleviate the pressures created by tariff concessions on our country's industry by appropriately lowering RMB exchange rates some time later. (Footnote 18: Cai Sifu, "The Challenge Posed by Tariff Reductions to Our Country's Industries," ZHONGNAN CAIJING DAXUE XUEBAO Feb 93) III. Challenges Posed by the Return to the GATT to Our Country's Foreign Trade System and Measures To Deal With Them A. Challenges Posed by the Return to the GATT to Our Country's Foreign Trade System 1. Increases in imports will result in enterprises facing a more complicated external environment. After "the resumption of GATT membership," with the granting of large tariff concessions and the weakening of nontariff barriers, the degree of openness of the domestic market will suddenly increase; this will inevitably result in increases in imports, thereby producing huge disruptive effects on the external business environment for various domestic enterprises, especially state-owned enterprises. Such changes in environment will center on three issues: a) because of imbalances between imports and exports caused by increases in imports, maintaining a balance-of-international-payments equilibrium will become a very prominent issue; b) changes in conditions for importing goods and in the composition of imports will further prompt and stimulate the adjustment of consumption structure, thereby affecting the structure of the economy as a whole and the equilibrium of aggregate demand and supply, and thus adopting effective measures to prevent a new round of inflation of consumption demand will also become a practical issue; and c) under the condition in which market access is granted, foreign goods will squeeze into and occupy markets in our country, thereby posing severe challenges to the development of domestic industries, especially the machinery and electric product industries. All this will undoubtedly create new destabilizing factors in the macroeconomic environment. (Footnote 19: Wang Shiyuan, "The Return to the GATT and the Reform of the Economic System of Our Country," JINGJIXUE DONGTAI, Mar 93) 2. The return to the GATT will produce disruptive effects on our country's foreign-trade management system. After "the resumption of GATT membership," the import management system will certainly be greatly simplified, and tariffs and nontariff barriers will certainly be reduced. The foreign-trade management system based on state commands and highly monopolized state control will be transformed into a foreign-trade management system based on enterprises' decentralized, independent import and export operations. The decentralization of foreign trade operations may result in efforts to export domestically produced products by competing in lowering their prices, a behavior detrimental to the trade interests of the nation. (Footnote 20: Li Changcai, "Opportunities and Challenges Presented by the Return to the GATT," JINGJI DONGTAI Feb 93) 3. The impact of "the resumption of GATT membership" on the import and export system. Currently signatories to the GATT believe that our country's trade barriers are excessive, a situation far from meeting GATT requirements. Therefore, it is necessary to further relax foreign exchange control, lower tariffs, reduce the scope of the use of import licenses, improve import administration and policy transparency, reduce the scope of plan-based management of foreign trade, grant greater autonomy on foreign trade operations to foreigner-involved enterprises, and reduce or eliminate means of subsidy such as export-related tax refunds. Foreign trade enterprises will also encounter competition from exporting enterprises at home. Thus, the existing foreign trade system has to be reformed accordingly. 4. The impact of "the resumption of GATT membership" on foreign trade revenues and expenditures and on the value of the currency. As some goods from our country are not competitive internationally, they cannot be exported in large quantities to earn foreign exchange, whereas foreign goods will pour into the market of our country unimpeded; as a result there will occur balance-of-payments deficits, forcing our country's yuan to devalue and yuan exchange rates to decline. Such a development will also produce a situation unfavorable to securing foreign loans, resulting in increases in borrowing costs. (Footnote 21: Yang Wenyan, "The Impact of the Resumption of GATT Membership on Our Country's Economy and Measures to Deal With It," JINGJI WENTI May 93) 5. It will be difficult to complete the fundamental reform of the foreign trade system within a short period of time. From a long-term perspective, the benefits "the resumption of GATT membership" will give our country will be fundamental in nature. In the near term, there will be a time lag in many areas of work in our country. The sudden transition from the old to the new system will cause some confusion in economic life, and the impact of the reform of the foreign trade system on other parts of the economic system can be described as a situation in which a slight move in one part may affect the situation as a whole; it is absolutely impossible to complete the reform in a short time. (Footnote 22: Li Shousheng, "A Preliminary Analysis of the Resumption of GATT Membership' and the Issue of Access to the Chinese and U.S. Markets," GUOJI MAOYI WENTI Sep 93) B. Measures on Foreign Trade and Economic Relations Our Country Should Adopt To Deal With the Challenges 1. Further reform and perfect our country's existing foreign trade system. a. With regard to the export system: First, it is necessary to reduce plan-controlled goods as much as possible; with regard to large-volume investment goods with impacts on state plans and people's lives as well as goods with bearings on the national strategic interests, it is necessary to determine the specific facts and conduct measurement on specific things in an effort to achieve rationalization. Second, there should be transparency with respect to the procedures, modes, and methods governing the application for export licenses; give every enterprise qualified for application the right to be informed of all the aspects of the system and the procedures involved; simplify the elaborate procedures, reduce costs, endeavour to make things scientific and standardized, and reduce management loopholes as much as possible. At the same time, carry out competitive auctions, so as to increase returns on exports, thereby safeguarding the overall returns for the country. Third, further perfect foreign-trade enterprises' mechanism of shouldering independent responsibilities for profits and losses. Fourth, actively form all kinds of partnerships and joint ventures across the sectors and carry out all kinds of shareholding, mergers, and buy-out across the sectors, grant more production enterprises or enterprise groups the right to engage in import and export foreign-trade operations, and further diversify and decentralize foreign trade actors, so as to make it possible to take part in international competition in an effective way. b. With regard to the import system, the reform principles should be: establish a functioning mechanism which is mainly based on tariff regulation and based on having nontariff regulation serving as a supplement, which is characterized by a rational tariff level and an appropriate tariff structure, which contains the competition element to an appropriate extent, and which protects infant industries; on the basis of referring to the experience of some developing countries (areas) on structural reform and in view of the demands of the development of our national economy and the adjustment of our country's industrial structure, formulate annual mandatory and guidance plans on the entire country's imports, with the main objective being to facilitate the optimization of industrial structure; and, while protecting national industry, it is necessary to select newly emerging industries which are playing an important role in the development of the national economy and enjoy advantages in terms of development. (Footnote 23: Nie Wenlong, "Statements Made Before Our Country's Return to the GATT," DANGDAI CAIJING Jun 93) 2. Transform the function of government, further enhance the transparency of our country's foreign trade policy, and regulate foreign trade in accordance with the law. Under the condition of a socialist market economy, enterprises are legal entities carrying out business operations; government's function is mainly to carry out planning, coordination, supervision, and services, so as to create a good external environment for equal competition among enterprises, but government should not interfere in enterprises' business activities. At the same time, it is also necessary to emphasize that giving play to the market's role as the basic mechanism of allocating resources is not tantamount to relinquishing the state's macroeconomic regulation and control. (Footnote 24: Chen Jiaqin, "The Impact of the Resumption of GATT Membership' on Our Import and Export Trade and Measures to Deal With It," GUOJI MAOYI Sep 93) 3. Establish and perfect enterprises' mechanism of operating in accordance with international practices. First, deepen enterprise reform and transform enterprises' operating mechanisms. In considering issues, it is necessary to link up the functioning of the domestic economy with international economic circulations and to link up the domestic market with the international market; and it is necessary to focus on resolving the issue of carrying out business operations in accordance with the laws of movement of the international market and international practices. Proceeding from realities, establish joint-stock economic conglomerates in which foreign trade enterprises will serve as leaders and which are based on trade-industry, trade-agriculture, and trade-technology integration, or joint-stock economic conglomerates in which large backbone production enterprises will serve as leaders and which will be based on industry-trade, industry-agriculture, and industry-technology integration; take the initiative in actively participating in marketing activities on the international market; make enterprises turn into carrying out production and business operations in accordance with the standard system, market demand, price levels, marketing practices in the area of international trade; include such internationalized-operation targets as those on the amount of foreign exchange produced by exports, costs for earning foreign exchange, the rate of foreign exchange retrieval, and the amount of foreign exchange remitted in the system of targets used in enterprise accounting, so as to ensure the sustained, steady, and high-efficiency development of foreign trade. Second, actively develop market internationally, and promote the diversification of foreign trade. The main problem in our country's foreign trade is that the relevant market abroad is small, with around 90 percent of the exports being confined to such regions as North America, Hong Kong, Macao, and Europe. Such a situation is very far from meeting the demands of the development of the situation at home and abroad. In accordance with the principles of combining economic relations with trade, of unified planning, of exploiting strengths, and of rational distribution, closely combine export trade with such activities as the utilization of foreign capital, labor service cooperation, building projects on the basis of contracts, and overseas investment; create new breakthroughs in regard to purchasing and marketing channels, fund raising, market development, and approaches to business operations; gradually form a functioning mechanism of economic and trade activities which is based on a situation in which the economy stimulates trade, in which trade brings along the economy, and in which domestic and international elements are joined, forming a combined a force; enhance the performance of many functions such as sales promotion, fund raising, introduction of foreign things, exploratory efforts, coordination, service, and information; and promote the diversification of foreign trade. (Footnote 25: Lu Xinde, "A Brief Discussion of the Linking Up of Our Country's Domestic Market With the International Market," SHANDONG CAIZHENG XUEYUAN XUEBAO Feb 93) 4. Establish and perfect laws and regulations on imports, and replace the existing administrative regulations of various kinds with laws, so as to enhance the transparency of our country's foreign trade policy. Therefore, it is necessary to formulate and enact our country's Foreign Trade Law, Antidumping Law, and Antisubsidy Law as well as market protection measures as soon as possible. As the day of our country's final resumption of her GATT signatory status is drawing near, our country is faced with the prospect of foreign products pouring into the domestic market. As soon as preexisting administrative measures are terminated, they must be replaced with relevant laws to provide protection so as to help customs offices protect national industry; otherwise there will be inestimable harms to the implementation of the state's industrial policy and the development of the national economy.
