Ruehe said in Washington that he would consider that to be a wrong move. Concerning the U.S. Congress and its efforts to lift the embargo, he said the United States and Europe must not diverge on this issue. The main objective, he said, is to prevent the Bosnian war from spreading to other localities, and to set the peace process in motion once again. The war in the Balkans was one of the main topics of Ruehe's talks with U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry and acting Secretary of State Strobe Talbott. In their discussion about the situation in the Balkans, the interlocutors agreed that despite the threatened use of air strikes, the attempt to subdue the Serbs had not succeeded. The U.S. Department of Defense does not consider the use of air strikes a suitable method of proving the West's assertiveness indefinitely. As for the deployment of land forces, there is no public approval for such an idea, and no peace plan supported by at least one of the parties to the Balkan conflict. In addition, such an operation would create more victims than the Gulf war. Ruehe indicated that one was now going to consider ways of meeting halfway Serbian attempts to use a kind of evasive action in order to spread the war to other areas. He did not wish to divulge any details, but observers think he meant an expansion of the safety zone. A high-ranking Pentagon employee said now is a good time for diplomatic steps to be made, because the Russians have lost their patience with the Serbs and the siege of Gorazde has revealed to the Muslims the military weaknesses of the Serbs. But the American side expressed concern about the restricted military maneuvering space. It was said that the threat of air strikes already represents a high degree of military pressure that can hardly be exceeded. What else, it was asked, can be achieved on a military level if the Serbs withstand a bombardment? The politicians discussed at length NATO cooperation with Russia, and hoped that Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev will sign the Partnership for Peace agreement when he visits NATO headquarters in Brussels at the end of May. NATO's offer of cooperation is receiving various reviews in Moscow. Plans for a Russian-American joint maneuver this year are not receiving further consideration for the time being. Ruehe explained to his interlocutors his plans for the restructuring of the Bundeswehr, and encountered approval. Defense Secretary Perry supported his plan to reduce the personnel level of the army, before a "hollow army" emerges. Apart from that, said Ruehe, for the sake of future Bundeswehr tasks, it is important to establish strong and efficient crisis-reaction forces. Ruehe explained that as a result of the Constitutional Court's ruling, the restructuring of the army could now be planned. But according to the Pentagon, the reduction of European armies makes it difficult to justify to Congress the presence of 100,000 American soldiers in Europe. In any case, the U.S. Government is not considering any reduction in U.S. troops in Europe.
