"When do I stop? Later, after I have accounted for my duties in five years. So, in another five years I will stop," Suharto said in response to a question at a national consultation meeting of the government-sponsored Indonesian National Youth Committee. "I have no ambition of becoming president for life," the 72-year-old head of state said. Suharto urged qualified Indonesians to show the people their accomplishments so that they could possibly be elected as president by the People's Consultative Assembly, the country's highest legislative assembly. "Feel free to compete, who is the (nation's) best son and has the best performance, so as to be seen by the people," Suharto said at the rare question and answer session at the presidential office. He said that aspirants could come from officialdom, the military or the civilian population. Suharto laughed in response to a statement by one of the youth committee members that the organisation wanted him to serve another five-year term. "In that year (1998), how old would I be?" he replied. "This should be taken into account. The laws of nature prevail and should be taken into account.
