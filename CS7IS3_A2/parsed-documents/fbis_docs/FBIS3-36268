They were told that the press, with one exception, will no longer be admitted to these meetings. Here is what our observer, Valeriy Kiosa, says: [Begin recording] [Kiosa] The decision by the Russian Government's chief of staff to bar the press -- except for the government's own ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA -- from these meetings also took the government's own press service by surprise. It had taken all the usual steps to ensure that journalists accredited with the government could get on with their normal work today. So, how did the participants in the meeting react to this decision? Here is what economist Pavel Bunich thinks. [Bunich] I don't think this is the right way of going about things. There are some individual issues which the press is not allowed to cover, and that is understandable. [Kiosa] But those are classified subjects. Today's issue was agriculture. [Bunich] No doubt there is some scandal here which they don't want to come out. The present situation in agriculture is the biggest scandal of all. We have come up against a brick wall. How can you bar the press from government meetings? [Kiosa] Here is what Andrey Illarionov, head of the prime minister's analysis and planning group, says. [Illarionov] I think this is absolutely intolerable. It undoubtedly closes off the most direct and clear channel of information by which the public and the mass media can learn about what the government is deciding and doing. Unquestionably this can only worsen relations between the government and the mass media. [Kiosa] Naturally we were all interested to hear the views of Vladimir Kvasov, the Russian Government's chief of staff. Here is what he said. [Kvasov] Work is done at government meetings. Therefore, the only elements of the media who will be allowed to attend these meetings are those which are accredited with us, so to speak. I am referring to ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, the government newspaper. All their correspondents will be admitted. Other representatives of the media will be admitted to the opening of these meetings so that they can take photographs. After the meetings are over, news conferences on the results will be held, if so wished. In other words, there will be plenty of objective information for the press and for the radio. [Kiosa] You mentioned ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA. Will agencies like, for example, TASS -- which is also regarded as an official government agency -- be barred from the meetings? [Kvasov] It all depends on what subjects are being discussed. Various different subjects are discussed at these meetings. If it's a question which interests a narrow circle of specialists, media access will of course be restricted. However, full information will be provided. [Kiosa] The last point I would like to make is this: I am not of course disputing the government's right to decide for itself who will attend or not attend these meetings. However, I would emphasize that the moment which was chosen for this decision was not altogether auspicious, to put it mildly. As you know, many government actions are being sharply criticized at the moment. It was at this precise moment, when you might expect the government to have an interest in the fullest and most objective reporting of what it is really doing, that the government's chief of staff suddenly decided to bar journalists from the meetings -- for good, or so it seems from his words. This is the first time such a thing has happened for two years, I stress. [end recording]
