This sensational allegation appears in a new Bellona report published yesterday concerning the nuclear situation in northwest Russia. The environmental foundation has had access to hitherto unknown documents showing how and where Russia intends to dismantle 150 nuclear submarines. The documents show that all future decommissioning of nuclear submarines, including vessels from the Pacific fleet, will take place in the shipyard city of Severodvinsk on the White Sea, southeast of the Kola peninsula. According to the START II agreement, Russia will decommission 150 nuclear submarines carrying 278 reactors in the next few years. So far only two nuclear submarines, with four reactors, have been completely dismantled. The fuel rods have been removed from another 34 vessels, of which 16 come from the Northern fleet. According to the Bellona report, nuclear submarines with a total of 206 nuclear reactors and 45,000 used fuel rods will be dismantled at Severodvinsk. In the Bellona report, which is the first comprehensive report concerning the nuclear situation in the region, a detailed overview will be published for the first time describing how the two enormous submarine yards in Severodvinsk will be upgraded in order to handle the huge dismantling job. The plan includes, among other things, the building of new dry docks, a new installation intended for the removal of fuel rods, improvements of the railroad from Severodvinsk to the nuclear city of Mayak in Siberia, and the construction of docking facilities for the storage of nuclear submarines. "The upgrading of Severodvinsk was to have been carried out between 1993 and 1998 in order to receive the many submarines that will be decommissioned. However, several of the projects that should have been started last year are still in the planning stage. The uncertainty as to the responsibility and the financing might result in the postponement of the dismantling and destruction of the submarines. In the meantime the submarines are being stored in bays and fjords along the Kola peninsula, among other places," says the two authors of the report, Thomas Nilsen and Nils Bohmer. Full Storage Facilities The definite plans for the improvement of the Severodvinsk docks that Bellona has had access to include only pure dock functions per se and a small increase in the capacity for the interim storage of nuclear waste. As all storage facilities for nuclear waste in the Kola region were filled to capacity a long time ago, new solutions must be found. The used fuel that is most radioactive will be carried to the nuclear city of Mayak according to the plan. But there is no place to send the reactors, the reactor sections and other solid radioactive waste. "From the documentation we have received and from the talks we have had with different people, it has become clear that Russian authorities are considering two alternatives. One is to dump the waste in the Kara Sea as was done up through 1991. The other possibility is to build a new regional storage facility for solid waste," Nilsen and Bohmer say. The two men express a great deal of worry over the nuclear situation up north: "In addition to the 150 nuclear submarines that will be destroyed in accordance with the START II agreement, it is assumed that 80 Russian nuclear submarines will be taken out of operation because of their age over the next 30 to 40 years. As all storage facilities are full and there is no money to build an expensive new long-term storage facility, we fear that dumping will again become the only alternative. Maybe that is why Russia has refrained from signing the final London convention against such ocean dumping," Nilsen says. It can be clearly seen from the Bellona report that the nuclear waste crisis in northwest Russia in no way has improved during the last year. However, Bohmer and Nilsen say that what they fear most is the social [repercussions of the] nuclear crisis. "Workers in the shipyard city of Severodvinsk, at the nuclear power plant, at Atomflot, and at the military Northern fleet are paid only rarely. It is not uncommon for them to go three to four months without being paid. The result is that they are careless with security. I fear that human error might lead to an accident long before the technical equipment actually fails," Bellona's nuclear physicist Bohmer says. Discarded nuclear submarines with intact reactors that are stored in the various fjords around the Kola peninsula need just as careful maintenance as nuclear submarines that are in operation. [Box, p 3] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Thanks Bellona "Bellona has access to channels of communication and information that we do not have. That is why they compliment our work," Thorbjorn Norendal, the assistant director of the Department of Foreign Affairs, says. He is heading the preparation of a white paper on nuclear safety in northwest Russia. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has given financial support to Bellona's work in Russia. "Bellona's new report is a factual and straightforward account of the problems," Norendal says. He thinks that Russia probably will not resume ocean dumping. "However, the fact that this is under consideration shows how urgent the problem is. It is news to us that all dismantling of old nuclear submarines will take place in Severodvinsk. I fear that this will mean an accumulation of nuclear waste in the north. Unlike the United States, the Russians have made no plans for where to store all the old reactor sections. The thought that they will be floating in the water at the docks in the fjords around Kola is a frightening one," Norendal says. He states that Norway's resources will not reach far in helping Russia. "However, we are prepared to participate in creating an international movement in order to help them with their disarmament, which will be just as expensive as the [original] armament was."
