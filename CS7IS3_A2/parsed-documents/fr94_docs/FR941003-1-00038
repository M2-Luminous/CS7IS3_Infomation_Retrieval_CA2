(a) An > administrative patent judge < examiner-in-chief shall review any evidence filed by an applicant under §1.608(b) to determine if the applicant is prima facie entitled to a judgment relative to the patentee. If the > administrative patent judge < examiner-in-chief determines that the evidence shows the applicant is prima facie entitled to a judgment relative to the patentee, the interference shall proceed in the normal manner under the regulations of this part. If in the opinion of the > administrative patent judge < examiner-in-chief the evidence fails to show that the applicant is prima facie entitled to a judgment relative to the patentee, the > administrative patent judge < examiner-in-chief shall, concurrently with the notice declaring the interference, enter an order stating the reasons for the opinion and directing the applicant, within a time set in the order, to show cause why summary judgment should not be entered against the applicant. (b) The applicant may file a response to the order > , which may include an appropriate preliminary motion under §1.633(c), (f) or (g), < and state any reasons why summary judgment should not be entered. Any request by the applicant for a hearing before the Board shall be made in the response. Additional evidence shall not be presented by the applicant or considered by the Board unless the applicant shows good cause why any additional evidence was not initially presented with the evidence filed under §1.608(b). At the time an applicant files a response, the applicant shall serve a copy of any evidence filed under §1.608(b) and this paragraph. * * * * * (d) If a response is timely filed by the applicant, all opponents may file a statement > and may oppose any preliminary motion filed under §1.633(c), (f) or (g) by the applicant < within a time set by the > adminsitrative patent judge < examiner-in-chief . The statement may set forth views as to why summary judgment should be granted against the applicant, but the statement shall be limited to discussing why all the evidence presented by the applicant does not overcome the reasons given by the > administrative patent judge < examiner-in-chief for issuing the order to show cause. > Except as required to oppose a motion under §1.633(c), (f) or (g) by the applicant, evidence < Evidence shall not be filed by any opponent. An opponent may not request a hearing. (e) Within a time authorized by the > administrative patent judge < examiner-in-chief , an applicant may file a reply to any statement > or opposition < filed by any opponent. * * * * * (g) If a response by the applicant is timely filed, the > administrative patent judge < examiner-in-chief or the Board shall decide whether the evidence submitted under §1.608(b) and any additional evidence properly submitted under > paragraphs < paragraph (b) > and (e) < of this section shows that the applicant is prima facie entitled to a judgment relative to the patentee. If the applicant is not prima facie entitled to a judgment relative to the patentee, the Board shall enter a final decision granting summary judgment against the applicant. Otherwise, an interlocutory order shall be entered authorizing the interference to proceed in the normal manner under the regulations of this subpart. (h) Only an applicant who filed evidence under §1.608(b) may requests a hearing.

Unless otherwise ordered by the > administrative patent judge < examiner-in-chief or the Board, the applicant and any opponent will each be entitled to no more than 30 minutes of oral argument at the hearing.
