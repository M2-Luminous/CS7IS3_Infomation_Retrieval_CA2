Statistics from local agricultural departments show that by early March local farmers had got 420,000 ha of farmland levelled for spring farming, one third of the area to be levelled. They have transplanted rice seedlings on about 57,333 ha of farmland, accounting for more than a half of the planned transplanting area and at a faster rate than last year. At the same time, they have also planted 554,000 ha of spring crops such as sugarcane, peanuts and vegetables, completing 70 percent of the set plan. To make a success of this year's spring farming, different localities had made good preparations and drawn up careful plans before the traditional spring festival in early February. Leaders from Shantou city led a working group shortly after the spring festival to conduct investigations in rural areas, and organized assistance for agricultural production with the purpose of making a success of the spring farming and to achieve a better grain harvest. The city fulfilled its task of seed sowing before March 5. Meanwhile, different localities have also attached great importance to the work of including idle farmland in spring farming. They have worked out a series of preferential policies to encourage farmers to transplant rice seedlings on more idle farmland in a bid to fulfill the grain-growing plan.
