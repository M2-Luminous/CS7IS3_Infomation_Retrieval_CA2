We are getting ready to meet him in Moscow next weekend. This was reported today by Sergey Filatov, the leader of the administration of the head of state, in an interview to an ITAR-TASS correspondent. In his words, he phoned Boris Yeltsin in Sochi today, but the president, together with his aide Lev Sukhanov were on the tennis court at the time. In response to a question by an ITAR-TASS correspondent asking why, during the vacation, Yeltsin does not talk to the press -- as leaders of other states do, and thus gives grounds for rumors about his ill health -- Filatov answered: There are as many characters as there are people. Boris Yeltsin is not Bill Clinton, and he has the right to his own style of behavior.
