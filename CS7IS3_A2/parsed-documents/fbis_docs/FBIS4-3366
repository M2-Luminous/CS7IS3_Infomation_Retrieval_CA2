He pointed out that facts prove Tibet's propagandists and ideological workers are a contingent loyal to the party and the people's cause; a contingent of especially good, devoted, and hardship-enduring fighters; a contingent full of vitality; and a contingent which the party and people can trust. Basang, also a deputy secretary of the autonomous regional party committee, presided over the 19 April afternoon meeting. Comrade Danzim's speech was entitled: Work Under the Guidance of the Theory on Building Socialism With Chinese Characteristics and Carry Out the Tasks on the Propaganda and Ideological Front in an All-Around Way. It contained three parts: (1) The basic situation of Tibet's propaganda and ideological front; (2) several major tasks of Tibet's propaganda and ideological front which we should strive to perform well now and in the days to come; and (3) strengthening leadership and improving methods to raise the level of our propaganda and ideological work. Comrade Danzim first summarized the basic situation of Tibet's propaganda and ideological front. He said: Over the past 40 years since the peaceful liberation of Tibet, the propaganda and ideological front in this region has done a great deal of work and made remarkable achievements in seriously implementing the party's basic theories and basic line of various periods, effecting an historic change in Tibet's society and accomplishing the tasks assigned by the party. Since Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee in particular, comrades on the propaganda and ideological front, adhering to the Marxist ideological line and working under very arduous conditions, have overcome difficulties, seriously conducted discussions on the criteria of truth, and helped bring about a thorough emancipation of the minds among CPC members, cadres, and the broad masses of people in the region. They have persistently treated economic construction as the central task, subordinated themselves to and served the party's central task, and actively publicized the party's line, principles, and policies, as well as the guidelines of the Party Central Committee's instructions on work in Tibet. They have carried out a thorough education in patriotism and in unity among all nationalities, seriously performed the task of arming the whole party with Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, applied the theory in unifying people's thinking, and promoted the study of the Volume 3 of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping." Comrade Danzim said: During political storms and the Lhasa riots, comrades on the propaganda and ideological front in this region always identified themselves with the Party Central Committee and autonomous regional party committee, correctly guided public opinion, and helped maintain social stability in Tibet [sentence as heard]. During the course of deepening reforms and opening up wider, they have stepped up ideological education and ideological and political work, ensured the smooth implementation of major reform plans, and conducted active and effective propaganda work toward the outside world. Against the intensified attempt made by Western hostile forces and the Dalai clique to separate Tibet from China, comrades on the propaganda and ideological front have waged a tit-for-tat, justified, and forceful mass media struggle. They have publicized the accurate image of socialist new Tibet, made Tibet's actual situation known to more people, and effectively promoted Tibet's opening to the outside world and its cultural exchanges with foreign countries. They have helped the building of socialist spiritual civilization, and promoted cultural and educational undertakings and social progress in Tibet. Comrade Danzim said: Propaganda and ideological work has made the people of all nationalities in Tibet emancipate their minds, and has aroused their enthusiasm, initiative, and creativity for participating in reforms and establishing a socialist market economy. Propaganda and ideological work has been a strong support in the anti-splittist struggle and work of maintaining stability. It has enriched the people's cultural life in Tibet, advanced the fine cultural traditions of all nationalities, upheld the unification of the motherland and unity among various nationalities, and ensured the smooth proceeding of Tibet's reform, opening up, and modernization drive. Comrade Danzim pointed out that the propaganda and ideological front of this region should strive to do its work well in the following 11 major respects both at present and in the days to come: (1) To continue to do good work in arming the whole party with Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics; (2) to do good work in conducting news propaganda and in guiding public opinion; (3) to strengthen ideological education; (4) to make socialist culture, literature, and art flourish further; (5) to step up publication work; (6) to give wide publicity to the anti-splittist struggle and work of maintaining stability; (7) to step up the building of socialist spiritual civilization; (8) to continue to step up propaganda toward the outside world; (9) to put emphasis on strengthening propaganda and ideological work at grass-roots units in rural and pastoral areas; (10) to strengthen the contingent of propagandists and ideological workers; and (11) to seriously do good work in publicizing the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Tibet Autonomous Region. Comrade Danzim emphatically pointed out: What should Tibet rely on to reform and develop itself, further liberate and develop its productive forces, and improve the people's living standards? It is most important and most fundamental to rely on the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Only by seriously studying the theory and arming our minds with it, can we correctly apprehend the party's line, principles, and policies; keep to a correct orientation, correct road, and correct measures in reform and development; and attain the objectives of reform, development, and stability in this region. Danzim called on the whole region to study Volume 3 of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping," the decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and the guidelines of the Fifth Enlarged Plenary Session of the Fourth Tibet Autonomous Regional CPC Committee, simultaneously; and to apply what is learned in the study to bring about a more comprehensive, thoroughgoing, and down-to-earth development. On publicizing the anti-splittist struggle and work of maintaining stability, Comrade Danzim emphasized: Tibet's stability is a political issue concerning the situation and stability of the whole country. Without a stable social and political environment, Tibet's reform and development will be an empty word. Propagandists and ideological workers should deem it their duty to maintain social stability in Tibet; always put the stress of propaganda and ideological work on publicizing the anti-splittist struggle, maintaining the unification of the motherland, strengthening unity among all nationalities, and maintaining social stability; be (?faithful) [zhong shi] ideologically and solid in work: and actively maintain a political situation of stability and unity in this region. Comrade Danzim called on the news media in Tibet to meet the needs of establishing the new socialist market economic structure, start new special columns and new programs on special topics, improve editorials, commentaries, theoretical articles, and serial reports, increase the weight and depth of news media, and help create a powerful public opinion for Tibet's economic construction, reform, and opening up. In conclusion, Deputy secretary Danzim pointed out: Propaganda and ideological work has a bearing on the undertaking of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. It should be done by the whole party and all party members should attach importance to it. Party committees at all levels must pay great attention to propaganda and ideological work, strengthen leadership over it, and seriously build both material and spiritual civilizations and attach equal importance to both. The party committees should conscientiously assume the responsibility for leading propaganda and ideological work in their respective localities and departments, strive to accomplish all tasks, improve the quality of propaganda and ideological work, and make new and greater contributions to promoting reform, development, stability, and comprehensive social progress in Tibet.
