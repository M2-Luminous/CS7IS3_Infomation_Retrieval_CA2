After our delegation returned from the meeting, Emir Brackovic interviewed Haris Silajdzic, prime minister of Bosnia-Herzegovina. [Begin recording] [Brackovic] Prime Minister, in your statement yesterday you, in a way, announced today's meeting of the Group for Restoring Mutual Confidence. This is a new group, a new form of attempting [words indistinct] in a way. [Silajdzic] Yes, this group had a meeting today. The meeting lasted for somewhat shorter time today. Mr. Akmadzic also attended today's meeting. The meeting dealt with two groups of topics. They were military and humanitarian topics. Regarding military topics, those touched upon were direct telephone lines and (?something) was agreed upon -- soldiers will (?certainly) be able to tell it better: meetings, regular meetings of commanders, joint military commissions. Then we went over to humanitarian issues, that is, the issue of convoys and the issue of electricity. Regarding electrical power, we drafted and signed an agreement by which the sides oblige themselves firstly that they will not destroy power lines, that they will in no way hamper the flow of electricity, as well as that the repair of and resumption of work on the following lines will be undertaken urgently: Jablanica-Kakanj, Travnik-Novi Travnik-Nova Bila, Visegrad-Gorazde-Foca, as well as Lepenica, Visegrad-Zvornik, and finally the powerline near (?Zepce). Therefore, these are the six lines that should be repaired as soon as possible. There is also the repair that had been agreed upon, but which has failed five times -- that along the line of Buca Potok-Reljevo, that is, at Perivoj. We agreed upon this today, firmly agreed that the repair of that part should begin immediately. Here, this is a concrete result. [Brackovic] Is the group going to meet again before 10 February? [Silajdzic] It should meet on 5 February, but we shall see at what level. [Brackovic] Is the Croatian side included in all these commissions and groups for humanitarian issues? [Silajdzic] All right, you are obviously well informed. Yes, the Croatian side is now also included in the commissions working on humanitarian issues, the issues of cooperation regarding electricity, gas and so on. So far it was not included, but as of now it will be. [Brackovic] Have you had bilateral meetings with [word indistinct] the Croatian side and can you [words indistinct]? [Silajdzic] There were bilateral meetings with both sides. These were mostly political talks about which I can say that they were not particularly productive. Regarding these issues, we are obviously turning around in a circle and we are obviously not going to get out of it in this way, even though all the sides had good intentions. What is involved are simply different political options, different military options, so that there is no result. This does not mean that one should not talk and, for that very reason, we are talking. [Brackovic] Thank you very much. [Silajdzic] Not at all.
