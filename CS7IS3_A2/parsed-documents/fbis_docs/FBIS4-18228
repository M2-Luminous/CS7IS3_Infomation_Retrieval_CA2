FDP Chairman Klaus Kinkel does not completely agree either with the way in which Rexrodt is fulfilling his role: The man regards himself too much as a minister of the FRG Government and too little as an FDP politician, he said. Bad words for Rexrodt come from the coalition partner. In Norbert Bluem's Labor Ministry it is stated: "A lightweight who does not work things out properly before he takes them to the outside." Behind his hand, a liberal party friend referred to the minister as follows: "A big mouth who does not get anything done." Rexrodt gives in too frequently to the chancellor and the Christian Democratic Union [CDU], it is stated in the FDP Presidium. -- Pensions example: Rexrodt announced in the news magazine FOCUS in late 1993: "Pensions will definitely not be safe as of 2010." The economics minister recommended increasing the working life span and thinking about the pension system structure. Kohl: "Pensions are taboo." End of debate. -- Health policy example: In the paper "Securing the future of Germany as an economic location," Rexrodt demanded in August 1993 that, in the future, patients pay for their medicine in pharmacies themselves. The money will be later refunded to them by the sick fund. Seehofer (Christian Social Union -- CSU) said no. End of debate. -- Coal subsidies example: Rexrodt announced in October 1993: "In the long run, we can no longer afford to spend 7 billion German marks [DM] on German power production from German hard coal every year." After miner protests in the Ruhr area, Rexrodt gave in to the coalition round. Annual financial assistance of DM7 billion for the German mines from 1997 to 2000 was resolved. End of debate. -- Shop closing times example: The liberal economics minister said: "The law regulating the closing time of shops is deadwood." In addition to the FDP, CDU Secretary General Peter Hintze, segments of the CDU/CSU Bundestag Group, Defense Minister Volker Ruehe (CDU) supported him. However, Helmut Kohl rejected it and the retail trade and trade unions protested. End of debate. -- The law governing discounts example: The economics minister put this basic element of liberal pricing on the Cabinet agenda. But Kohl simply removed it again. End of debate. The criticism vented on Rexrodt finally even startled the party leadership. With a view to European elections in June, which are particularly problematic for the FDP, nobody wants to repeat the deliberately spread criticisms of the Presidium. Yesterday the following was said in the Thomas Dehler House: "Rexrodt? He becomes better day by day!"
