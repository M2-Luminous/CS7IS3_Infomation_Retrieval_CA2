Even when it came to a fight at the ballot box for the European Parliament, voters did not make the most of their opportunity to give the CVP [Flemish Christian People's Party] and SP [Flemish Socialist Party] a drubbing. Whether or not this can be taken to mean that they approve of the government's policy is an open question. However, evidently voters were not totally indignant at the actions of the Dehaene government. The most important event of the elections, namely, the fact that the renewed VLD [Flemish Liberal Democrats] failed to make a breakthrough, is a nonevent in Flanders. One may puzzle for weeks over why the blue [color of VLD] tidal wave never came about, but there would be little sense in doing so. No tidal wave materialized, except in the predictions made by the opinion polls. The citizens did not turn their backs on the message issued by the VLD. Indeed, unlike a number of politicians, they never went over to it in the voting booth in the first place. If there is relief in the Flemish Government camp, then this is less true for the PS [Walloon Socialist Party] and PSC [Walloon Social Christian Party]. Some serious blows were dealt in comparison with 24 November 1991. Two years after it did so in Flanders, the far right has also made inroads in Wallonia, to the great dismay of a large number of Walloons, who thought they were immune to that virus, which they pityingly viewed as a Germanic phenomenon. As was the case at the last European elections, [PS] Jose Happart succeeded in channeling a large number of dissatisfied citizens in his direction. The farmer and former mayor from Voeren is a populist maverick. An accident-prone individual who is looked askance on by the PS leadership, but who is tolerated on the party's list because he brings in as many 250,000 write-in votes, a figure which represents as much as 13 percent of all Walloon voters. So the government will find it heavy going on its Walloon flank. Not only are the PSC and the PS seeing their support cave in, but Happart's influence within the PS is also growing. He is already busily cashing in on it. Happart is threatening to become Voeren's mayor again. He is calling for a fresh "return of heart" by increasing minimum wages and minimum benefit payments. Happart can hamper the coalition. With the St. Michael accord, the government succeeded in putting the community pests on ice. They did so in expectation of the regional parliaments also being directly elected in the general elections at the end of 1995, and of calling upon the community energy at that time. At the economic level, this government has just recently significantly scaled down its "return of heart," which the previous government had hastily embarked on. In a country where the end of the restructuring of the budget and social security is not yet in sight, and in a Europe where the meaning of minimum thresholds for the payment of wages and benefits is increasingly coming up for discussion, Happart certainly intends to row very much against the current. The Dehaene government is not taking things as far as some other European countries, where left-wing or center-left governments are implementing a "right-wing" policy. In recent years, at the social and economic level, the coalition of Dehaene has set to work in an unmistakably "labor party" manner. However, at the same time, the policy falls within the logic of the restructuring process, and circumstances are resulting in the emergence of traits that can be described as liberal: privatization, flexibility, imposing responsibility, competitive companies. Perhaps that is why voters did not consider it worthwhile to defect to the VLD.
