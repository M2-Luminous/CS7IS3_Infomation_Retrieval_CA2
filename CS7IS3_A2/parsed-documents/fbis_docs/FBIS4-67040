Alberto Vasquez Restrepo, president of CAMACOL [Colombian Chamber of Construction], spoke on behalf of 14 economic associations. [Begin Vasquez recording] As we said in a communique sent to the president today, we are absolutely dumbfounded. This decision has really taken the country by surprise and we have asked the president to invoke the constitutional right to consult the people on any subject. This right to a referendum is needed more than ever today, considering that there is no higher body above the Constitutional Court to which this decision can be appealed in order to abolish or modify it.
