In remarks to foreign journalists, the minister emphasized that Zionist pressure had neutralized the positive signals sent by the Geneva summit. Clinton, according to Salman, has one of two choices--either defend U.S. interests in the region and thus put his career on the line, or give in to Zionist pressure and so forfeit America's credibility. Salman charged that Israel was out to exclude the United States from the region by convincing it that its interests are best served by Israel. He produced an American document titled Syrian-American Cooperation to Combat Drugs in Lebanon, in which the United States applauds Syria's anti-drug measures over the past few years. Syria, Salman said, was bewildered by the drug charges, especially seeing that it has been coordinating with the Americans in the fight against these poisons. The pressure on Syria, he maintained, is calculated to undermine its negotiating position and split the Syrian and Lebanese tracks at the talks with Israel. Salman contended that drug abuse and trafficking in Syria are virtually nonexistent. He explained that drug traffickers in Syria receive the death sentence and abusers receive at least three years in prison. In contrast, the minister said, drug abuse and trafficking were widespread in the West, in particular in the United States. [passage omitted]
