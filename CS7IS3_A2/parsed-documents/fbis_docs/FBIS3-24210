The NATO countries cannot go on threatening air strikes for years on end. Nor can the peoples of Bosnia, Serbia, and Croatia live under such a threat for years on end. Unfortunately, not even having begun combat operations, military leaders in the United States are already discussing the possibility of their expansion. UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali and the NATO leaders have not rescinded their threat--they have only postponed it. They are not considering that in the event of air strikes in Bosnia, NATO and the United Nations will turn into a warring faction. The blue helmets will turn dark with blood, and the units wearing them will be quickly swept aside by armed forces of Serbs, Croats, and Bosnians--which might evoke a responsive reaction from the NATO forces. Such a course of events could lead inevitably to large-scale war in Europe. It is clear that the peoples of Bosnia, Serbia, Montenegro, and Croatia would be the primary victims of this. It is not clear who would compensate for the material damage--many times surpassing the scope of humanitarian assistance now being extended to Bosnia. Today like never before it is important to prevent escalation of the conflict in Bosnia into a European tragedy and to deny NATO the right to determine when bombing and missile strikes will be carried out in Bosnia. It is important that we urgently begin to seek new approaches and ideas for achieving a political settlement in Bosnia and, on the broader scale, in the Balkans. As a minimum such a decision must be made by the UN Security Council. It seems that a conference must be convened to this end under the aegis of the United Nations to attain a settlement in the former Yugoslavia. The initiator of such a conference could be Russia and other Slavic states that support even contacts with all sides in the Bosnian conflict. Such a conference could give all republics of the former Yugoslavia the opportunity to participate in it on an equal basis and preclude the possibility of a situation arising where decisions would be made behind their backs and be imposed on them by outsiders. It is also important that all permanent members of the UN Security Council participate in the conference. In the event accord is reached with respect to convening this conference, the preparations group need not be limited to international representatives David Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, whose positions reflect the pro-West, pro-NATO orientation, but should include representatives from Serbia, Montenegro, Croatia, and Bosnia, as well as the ethnic minorities of these republics. The group could include Russia, Greece--as the neighbor of the Yugoslav republics, and Bulgaria--as a Balkan Slavic country. The preparatory work of a broad-based group could help convene the international conference in a more favorable environment than that in which negotiations have thus far been conducted. Conflict in the former Yugoslavia has been ongoing for about two years and no end is in sight under the current development of events. Conference preparation with participation of the Serbs, Croats, and Bosnians themselves should help reduce the tension. Negotiations can and must replace military operations. The time has come to establish in Russia the Committee of the Russian Community To Facilitate a Political Settlement in Bosnia and Herzegovina, with the participation of representatives of political parties, social movements, and Slavic organizations. This committee could also facilitate the search for a settlement through the establishment of unofficial contacts between representatives of the sides in conflict. This too could yield great dividends.
