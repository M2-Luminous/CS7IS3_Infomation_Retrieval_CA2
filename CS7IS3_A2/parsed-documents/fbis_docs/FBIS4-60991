Gulnev, announced to the minister of defense of Russia, P. Grachev: "Azerbaijan is prepared to cease-fire on the night of 28 April if Armenia will follow its example." The leader of the Russian war department promised to notify Yerevan of Baku's decision immediately, adding that "I am convinced that the answer will be affirmative." Commenting on this information, the radio station Mayak noted that, judging from everything, Azerbaijan is prepared to join the Russian peace initiative, which, as we know, "envisions the release of all seized Azerbaijani territory and the return of the Karabakh formations to within the confines of Nagorno Karabakh itself. Along with them, Russian separation subdivisions will be brought into these regions." If all this is true, it would be difficult to overestimate what has occurred. G. Aliyev's stubborn unwillingness to give his consent to the introduction of Russian peace keepers into Azerbaijan has finally been broken. And this happened because of two circumstances. Armenia's latest successes in defending the Nagorno Karabakh Republic in the southeastern section of resistance created a very real threat both to Gyandzha and the Yevlakh transportation and energy center. Practically all of the right bank of the Kura ended up extremely vulnerable in military terms. Further success of the Karabakh Army in these areas would mean unconditional defeat for Azerbaijan. Obviously, this scenario inevitably involves serious domestic political collisions with an easily predictable result: New, pro-Russian leaders will take over power in Baku. There is no doubt that, for example, this was understood in Ankara, which explains the advice from Hikmet Cetin to the Azerbaijan leader to accept the Russian peace plan. Seeing that the war was lost de facto and his closest ally was washing his hands of it, G. Aliyev probably decided to try to save what still might be saved -- his power. Time will tell whether he will succeed in the end; only the winners will not be judged, and the losers always will be. One thing is clear today: Russia will gain one more (after Abkhazia) large military-political victory in the Transcaucasus. And again -- with no effort on its part -- but that is not the main thing. The main thing is that it is above all our common Armenian victory-- military and political and diplomatic and moral. But is it not too soon to speak about that? After all, anything could happen, and even Russia's position, as we know, can very quickly undergo remarkable metamorphoses. Still one wants to hope that today will be the turning point in the situation. There will undoubtedly be new, quite justified misgivings and concerns related to the fact that the people of Karabakh will apparently have to gradually begin to deploy troops closer to their borders, but there is also the hope for peace, the hope for termination of the blockade, that during the course of very lengthy and complicated negotiations the diplomats will find a new status for Karabakh, which will be acceptable primarily to the people of Karabakh themselves. There is no doubt that the process of transition from a state of war to a state of peace will be long, hard, and fraught with numerous complications, snags, and various kinds of surprises. We must be prepared for this. Ultimately we were able to prove to ourselves and to the entire world that we are worth something as a nation, that force, and war, and a blockade could not break us and could not provoke us to internecine strife. Therefore, the time will definitely come when the crown of thorns on the head of the people will be replaced by a wreath of laurels. In the cruel winter cold, under conditions of the large-scale Azerbaijan offensives in Karabakh, when there was no light in the homes for weeks and the front was caving in and it seemed that defeat was around the corner, the president of the Republic firmly, confidently, and solemnly promised: This year we will start up the nuclear power plant, we will adopt a constitution suitable for a free, democratic country, and we will achieve peace with dignity. Did many of our compatriots at that time believe our president without reservations?
