On the issue of the next general election for the House of Representatives, Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the SDPJ, told the meeting: "If the general election were to be held before this autumn, it would be under the present multiseat constituency system. The ruling coalition parties need to prepare for their election campaign under any electoral system. They need to cooperate with each other in the next general election." He indicated the need for the ruling coalition parties to speedily prepare themselves for electoral cooperation in anticipation that the next general election will be held under the current multiseat constituency system once the House of Representatives has been dissolved. Commenting on moves by Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] to form a new party, he expressed again a negative view. He said: "It will be difficult for the ruling coalition parties to form a new party unless they reach a general consensus on the view of the state, the Constitution, and political tactics."
