After the vote in favour of the new course propounded by the Social Movement's secretary, Gianfranco Fini, the party's central committee was meeting here this afternoon to name the candidates for the elections on March 27. The committee will approve extending the political bureau to include representatives of the internal opposition led by one of the more radical of the old guard neo-Fascist ideologues, Pino Rauti. In a speech this morning, Rauti accepted the Fini line and urged that the party must be "as compact and united as possible" at the polls. Even while admitting that, today, he would still don the uniform he wore when, fifty years ago, he took part in dictator Benito Mussolini's rump Fascist republic at Salo' on Lake Como, he said the National Alliance should "choose from the past what bears indications for the future." He also said there was no going back to the laissez-faire economic theories of the 1800s "as though Fascism and Communism had never been.... For my part, I wouldn't want to have taken part in the March on Rome and a World War simply to arrive at laissez-faire." More immediately, as the Italian Right sorts itself into new configurations, apart from the ex-Christian Democrats of the Democratic Christian Centre, the National Alliance's major electoral ally will be TV tycoon Silvio Berlusconi's Rooting for Italy movement, which is seen as a bridge between National Alliance and Umberto Bossi's Northern League. For Fini, Berlusconi is a possible prime minister: "As I've said before, I rule myself out, and I don't think there is any need to indicate a premier (before the elections). But if there had to be a choice between Bossi and Berlusconi, I would choose Berlusconi because he unites North and South, whereas Bossi splits Italy in two." Yesterday, Northern League leader Umberto Bossi took a similar line when he launched the League's election campaign at Rovigo near Venice, though he disagreed with Fini when he poured cold water on Berlusconi's ambitions to become premier. "I don't see him as the next prime minister," said Bossi, sketching in a role for the tycoon as a "mediator" between the often conflicting demands of northern and southern Italy. Bossi also joined Berlusconi in identifying the Democratic Party of the Left [PDS] as the major adversary, though he also condemned the Vatican's statement of support last week for Catholic unity, warning that "religion must return to caring for souls, not politics." These right-wing formations all sought to distance themselves from the former government parties which are still trying to re-create the former bloc of moderate opinion that they represented in the centre of the political spectrum. At a meeting of the Republican Party's National Council here, Party Secretary Giorgio La Malfa argued for a "third position" with figures such as ex-Christian Democrat Mario Segni, People's Party (ex-Christian Democrat) Secretary Mino Martinazzoli, and ex-Premier Giuliano Amato, identified closely with former Socialist Party Secretary Bettino Craxi. While surprising his audience by announcing that he would not be seeking re-election, La Malfa ruled out any alliance on the right in a brusque beginning and spent much of his time explaining why he excludes joining the progressives with whom he has shared the opposition benches since pulling the Republicans out of their traditional slot in the ruling majority in mid-April 1992. Like other political leaders, including PDS Secretary Achille Occhetto, La Malfa said the Italian political scene was currently one of "great confusion." In particular, he said the next parliament would have to complete the electoral and institutional reform and also said he expects the future scenario of political alliances to take some time to stabilise. "I'm looking neither right nor left, but straight ahead," quipped Martinazzoli at a meeting of the People's Party in Milan, who also said he would not be seeking re-election. He added an ironic reference to the ex-Christian Democrat Neo-Centrists who are expected to ally themselves with Fini: "If you will allow me, calling oneself a `centrist' when you are leaving the centre is something of an eccentricity. Moderation is to 'moderatism' as chastity is to impotence." But, in Florence, Rocco Buttiglione, the leading ideologue of the People's Party, which many have accused of seeking to postpone the elections so as it can regroup the moderates more effectively, argued for a highly temporary vision of the coming parliament. If a moderate bloc fails to win, he told reporters, the best solution would be a government of non-party experts or one named by the head-of-state to push through the "urgent and indispensable" measures and then return to the polls when the political options may be clearer. Meanwhile, if Martinazzoli said he would be leaving the political scene at the congress of the People's Party convened in May, between the Italian and the European elections, the Estates General called by Socialist Party Secretary Ottaviano Del Turco was told that a congress was likely at about the same time. Even though the Estates General voted no motion, one bearing the names of 100 delegates urged the expulsion of ex-Secretary Bettino Craxi and his closer aides for their "evident political responsibilities" and their role in the still unfolding bribery and corruption scandals. Del Turco's speech returning the Socialists firmly to the progressive and breaking with Craxi's location of the party in the political centre received wide applause across the progressive political spectrum. "A real turning-point," was the comment from Occhetto, whose entry into the assembly hall was greeted by the exit of a small group of Craxi faithful, including his former spokesman Ugo Intini. As the Socialists pursue what their present chairman, Labour Minister Gino Giugni, described as the "restoration of the house of Italian Socialism," a poll of delegates showed that 74 percent wanted no renewal of Craxi's party membership and 60 percent would like to see Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi serve a second term. Other findings in the survey 43 percent in favour of the resignation of President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro immediately after the elections, a demand also advanced by National Alliance, the Northern League and others because of Scalfaro's apparent implication in alleged moves to cover up financial misdeeds in the secret services. Republican Party secretary Giorgio La Malfa's platform not to join the Progressive Pact and the Democratic Alliance, to which many Republicans already adhere, was passed by a very slim majority of 6 votes, 65 to 59, confirming the divisions within the small party which may become official Monday [31 January]. Before the final vote was taken, La Malfa added to his document a passage which said how he would make a "last-ditch attempt", in his meeting tomorrow with the Democratic Alliance, to convince PDS leader Achille Occhetto to drop the orthodox Communist Renaissance and Leoluca Orlando's Rete from the progressive pole. La Malfa went on to add how he in no way underestimated Berlusconi's entrance in politics nor the reinforcement of the Right. Nevertheless, he argued, there was no solid rightist block from Martinazzoli to Fini, nor Right-Left confrontation. Otherwise, La Malfa said "I would have called everyone to the Left". This was not the case, the Republican leader argued, because of the novelty of Martinazzoli, steering clear to the Right, and the credibility of Mario Segni. Reaction to La Malfa's stand was predictable, with Massimo D'Alema of the Democratic Party of the Left defining it as "short-sighted", while praising La Malfa's decision not to run, while Senate Speaker Giovanni Spadolini, the Republican deacon, saw it as "coherent."
