The vice president is voting just as the president of the Republic already voted at the center in the university assembly hall. While the vice president is voting we would like to say at this time the city looks very crowded, and there is much traffic. We also observed that there are several buses parked directly in front of the mayor's office. We do not know why so many buses are parked there, given we have not seen any municipal officer around the area. As we said, the city seems increasingly crowded. Numerous individuals are starting to approach the voting centers located throughout the city. The vice president of the Republic is with us now, and he will comment on the referendum taking place. [Herbruger] My first impression is that it is quite favorable. There are not too many people at this time, but neither is the place deserted. There are many people right now. I believe as the day progresses, voter turnout will increase. [Unidentified reporter] Do you believe the campaign against the referendum had anything to do with the low voter turnout? [Herbruger] I cannot say anything about that specific issue, because anything on which I may comment may be interpreted as propaganda. [laughs] [Reporter] It is possible, however, to see propaganda against the referendum scattered throughout the street. Can you comment on that? [Herbruger] I have not seen anything. As I was driving from my home, there was not much traffic, and I did not see any garbage or propaganda scattered about the streets. [Reporter] How do you believe this process is being viewed internationally? [Herbruger] I believe it is being viewed positively, because it is the first time a referendum is taking place in Guatemala in order to approve constitutional reforms; in this respect, I believe that internationally it is going to be viewed favorably.
