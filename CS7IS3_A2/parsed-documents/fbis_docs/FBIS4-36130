It was the first large contingent of Palestinian exiles based in Tunis to return to the territories vacated by Israel to be placed under Palestinian self-rule . The 158 who are officially part the Palestine Liberation Army, the PLO's military arm, were mainly officials who had served for the last few years in the PLO's various civilian departments. Some who had never worn a uniform seemed ill at ease in the green military fatigues offered by the Tunisian authorities. The group included six Palestinian journalists, some of whom will man the first bureau in Gaza of the Palestinian news agency WAFA. Others will join the Palestinian television service now under construction. The contingent left for Cairo on a Tunisian aircraft chartered by Saudi Arabia. The group will travel by bus from Cairo to the border and will cross over into Gaza at Rafah on Sunday. Several senior Palestinian officials, including the Palestinian ambassador in Tunis Hakam Bal'awi and Ahmad Quray' (Abu-'Ala'), economics "minister" of the new Palestinian Authority took part in a farewell ceremony at Tunis airport. A Palestinian source said 20 security agents trained in Tunisia or in other countries had left Tunis since Thursday for the Gaza Strip and the other autonomous territory of Jericho on the West Bank. So far, 3,500 Palestinian policemen have been deployed in the two territories which PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat is scheduled to visit in the middle of June. "The next step is to repatriate the political cadres to Gaza and Jericho," a senior PLO official told AFP Friday. Abu-'Ala' told journalists that promised funds from international donors must be forthcoming quickly, saying the lack of resources was causing serious anxiety to Palestinians. "Without the means there can be no security," he said. Thirty-one of the officials' family members had left earlier Friday by a scheduled flight to Cairo. The leader of the contingent, Colonel Samih Nasr, 46, said he hoped to have the means "to defend the dignity and institutions" of the new Palestinian authority. He denied that the Palestinian police would be repressive, saying "that is not our aim."
