The company will only receive Fr2 billion. The company's two supervising ministers, Defense Minister Francois Leotard and Economics Minister Edmond Alphandery, announced this on 2 February. They were backed by a lengthy official commentary: "This decision of the state shareholder will allow Aerospatiale to benefit fully from the progressive recovery of the markets especially in its new programs such as the Airbus A330 and A340. Like most aircraft manufacturers, it has been heavily affected by the situation of airline companies and the reduction of military sales. Aerospatiale knew how to adapt to this situation, launching an austerity program in 1992 which it then reinforced in 1993. Through this [funding] decision, the state shareholder gives proof of its confidence in a company of great potential, which has acquired in each of its product lines a leading global market position." The allocation of these funds confirms LA TRIBUNE's report (see our edition on the 27 January 1994) of "an imminent but partial recapitalization of Aerospatiale." The Fr2 billion should increase shareholder equity to Fr8 billion on a little more than Fr13 billion debt, or a ratio of 1.6 compared to the somber ratio of three just a year ago. The company estimates that its debt/equity ratio will be "presentable" in the future and points out that it has "reduced its debt last year from Fr16 billion to some Fr13 billion and that it has reduced its operating expenses 12 percent in the last two years." It notes that it is engaged in heavy and strategic programs for the future: the Aster missile, the Ariane 5 rocket, Tigre helicopters, the NH90, and, of course, the new Airbus and ATR aircraft. The Economics Ministry -- the Defense Ministry argued for funds of Fr3 billion -- noted that the recapitalization of Aerospatiale, which is a "technological jewel, at the level of U.S. companies, and with a strong commercial success," was "a priority." The company, whose sales last year should turn out to be Fr49.3 billion (- 5 percent) "has multiplied its sales by five in 10 years. Aerospatiale -- political considerations aside -- will only have been recapitalized twice, in 1988, for around Fr2 billion, and today." According to Bercy [Finance Ministry], the company, which had consolidated losses of Fr2.380 billion in 1992, "reported a very notable recovery of its profits before the funding. These funds, which will cover the 1994 reorganization plan, are important but net profits will in any event register a sharp increase. We are hoping that Aerospatiale will be able to break even rapidly." The prospect of privatization is thus no longer so far away. Budget for Public Company Funding Dwindles The economics minister is a bit worried about the reactions from Brussels over the funding of Aerospatiale. On the other hand, the Fr21-billion budget for recapitalizing has dwindled right in front one's eyes. A little more than Fr7 billion is predicted for Bull (now being eyed by the EU Commission), at least Fr5 billion for Air France, Fr2 billion for EMC (Potasses d'Alsace), Fr500 million for CEPME; CGM, which is asking for Fr5O0 million should also be helped. But then what of Giat Industries, which wants Fr1 to Fr2 billion, which could be withdrawn -- the negotiations are still going on -- from the defense budget; of SNPE, which wants Fr400 million; and of SNECMA, which already received Fr750 million in 1993, which Bercy compares to Aerospatiale in terms of potential, and which wants yet another Fr 1 billion?
