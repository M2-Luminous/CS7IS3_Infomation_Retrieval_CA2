FBIS4-43634 "drweu118_q_94012" FBIS-WEU-94-118 Daily Report 12 Jun 1994 TURKEY NOKTA Profiles Islamic Group NOKTA Profiles Islamic Group TA1606200794 Istanbul NOKTA in Turkish 12 Jun 94 pp 15-18 TA1606200794 Istanbul NOKTA Turkish BFN [Report by Metin Sever and Baran Dural] [Text] The IBDA-C [The Islamic Great Eastern Raiders Front], which not only defended the Sivas massacre of 2 July 1993 -- which caused great grief throughout Turkey -- but also admitted to regretting the fact that it was not present, showed how sincere it is in its views a short while ago when it bombed a bar in Fatih, Istanbul, killing one person and wounding 19 others. The IBDA-C, which aims at carrying out an Islamic revolution through armed struggle and teaching a lesson to the "pro-Western secularists," has recently featured prominently on the public agenda. This time, the issue involved one of the most colorful figures in Turkish society, Aysegul Nadir. One wonders: What does she have to do with this organization? Apparently, she mediated in the sale of a priceless handwritten Koran, which was stolen from the Amasya Sultan Beyazid Library by IBDA-C militants, to Ihsan Azzami, who lives in London. With Nadir's mediation, the IBDA-C reportedly sold the Koran for $8,000 to antique dealer Cavusoglu, who in turn sold it for $16,000. The organization managed to earn itself a "significant" place on the public agenda recently as a result of its "radical" statements. The roots of this organization go back to 1975. Salih Mirzabeyoglu, who is known as "commander" in the organization, has been leading the IBDA-C movement from the start. He has had more than 30 books published containing his views on almost every topic, from poetry to novels, from economics to Islam. He is different from the usual Islamic militant type. He tries to look like Che Guevara. His manner of dress and speech is modern. He quotes [executed leftist youth leader] Mahir Cayan. In other words, he looks more like a leftist militant than an Islamic leader. In fact, he even goes as far as marking the anniversary of Cayan's death in his magazines. The slogans they use are the Islamic version of the Dev-Sol [Revolutionary Left] slogans: Instead of "One, two, three, or more Vietnams," they say "one, two, three, or more Sivas'"; instead of "Struggle until liberation," they say "Struggle until victory." In 1975, Mirzabeyoglu left the Raiders Association, which was a pro-National Salvation Party organization, and established the Raider-Birth movement. With his supporters, who organized around the magazine KARAR [Decision], Mirzabeyoglu opened war on the entire spectrum of the Islamic movement. He says that he was supported by Necip Fazil Kisakurek at every opportunity. The organization assumed leading roles in the Islamic religious headgear and St. Sophie incidents. It made itself heard by raiding the Press Museum and a class at the Istanbul Technical University, where a professor was manhandled. The IBDA-C considers the Prosperity Party part of the establishment today. It is supported by radical Islamic movements. In its ranks you can find "hard" [last word in English] Marxists of the pre-12 September era, as well as former "idealist" militants. The most important characteristic of the IBDA-C -- which is really one of a kind -- is its opposition to the state in all things. Like Dev-Sol and the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan], IBDA-C calls Turkey "TC" [Turkish Republic]. It supports PKK activities only to irritate the state. In fact, when the state operations in the southeast intensified and the PKK began to withdraw, TARAF [THE SIDE], the IBDA-C organ, carried this slogan on its cover: "Bosnia-Sirnak." It is possible to understand the basic trait of the organization that calls Tansu Ciller "devil" and antiterror teams "verger teams" from the following slogans: "Power lies at the end of the gun; Point the gun at the invaders; Liberate the street, and the city will be liberated; liberate the city and the country will be liberated; Blockade!; Trample!; Free yourself!" What are the concrete steps of this organization, which uses "hard" [preceding word in English] slogans indifferently, and what do they see as their chances of achieving an "Islamic revolution?" Is the IBDA-C, as the sound-of-mind Islamic writers claim, an artificial organization established by the state in order to create antipathy toward Islam, or are the IBDA-C militants a handful of dreamers who listen to folk songs they themselves sing? Abdullah Kiraci, owner and managing editor of TARAF, provides answers to these questions: Claiming that the IBDA-C is speedily gaining power, Kiraci explains that anyone who wants to join them must meet three basic conditions: They must be anti-imperialist, ready to fight the exploitation of Turkey, and willing to defend Turkey's complete independence. Although Kiraci claims that the IBDA-C is not a very demanding organization, his claim brings to mind the expression: "We'll cross that bridge when we come to it." As a matter of fact, after the "revolution" they are planning to carry out, Kiraci is not overly generous about according the right of existence to those who do not think like him. You should take note now that it is a dream to think that you can become part of the system envisaged by the IBDA-C. Kiraci claims that the sanctions he is thinking of implementing are considered necessary in Islam. According to Kiraci, the rightful owners of our lands are Muslims; however, according to this organization, the Muslims are prevented from living as they wish. Kiraci claims that the day will come when Muslims will not be obliged to live with those who create obstacles, and then they will implement their own rules. It is up to you whether you will comply. If you do not, however, it means that you have taken into consideration the punishments envisaged by Islam. Claiming that the organization has reached its goal ideologically, Kiraci states that, from now on, the IBDA-C will consolidate its front lines and thus march step by step toward the "revolution." Asserting that the IBDA-C will have an increasing impact on the country's course if Turkey's situation deteriorates, Kiraci claims that either they will come to power or anarchy will spread and take over. Kiraci is very optimistic about the future of his organization; however, it is obvious that he does not receive too much approval from the Islamic sector of the IBDA-C. As a matter of fact, Fethullah Gulen, a prominent member of the organization's Islamic sector and one whom the organization accused of being a "collaborator-agent," harshly criticized the organization in some of his speeches. TARAF, which has published condemnations of National Action Party [NAP] leader Alpaslan Turkes, has been attacked by publications close to the NAP, and as a result of this clash of ideas, the organization was forced to show more "sensitivity" to its idealistic foundation. Among those who sharply criticized the IBDA-C is Ercument Ozkan, owner of IKTIBAS [ADAPTATION], another periodical said to be the voice of the Islamic sector. Ozkan even went as far as to say that the IBDA-C is not in the slightest degree connected to Islam. Obviously, the IBDA-C is a very unique organization. While nowhere near the Turkish left, the IBDA-C, in one of its statements, praised the famous revolutionary Mahir Cayan on one hand and defended the Sivas massacre on the other. One can only wonder what line the organization, which now has an autonomous sector, will follow and how it will conduct its armed actions. It is not even possible to figure out this organization's potential area of influence. We still find it beneficial to remind you: The best thing for you to do is be careful, because you are not from the "TARAF" and one day you may be "put aside." It is for us to warn you....
