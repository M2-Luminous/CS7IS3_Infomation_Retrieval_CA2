They had established a large number of training centres, and they had also attracted the imagination of a large number of young people who were constantly interacting with Pakistan. Some of them demanded Independence, some others wanted to merge J&K with Pakistan. Normal life had been disturbed, terrorism was in full swing and the authority of the Indian government had completely eroded. I thought that in a part of our own country, in Kashmir Valley, people, Kashmiri Hindus, have been squeezed out of their hearths and homes and rendered homeless. What is this government sitting in Delhi and Srinagar? How is it that the government has lost the sensitivity to react to the situations? There is no concern for those unfortunate but patriotic people. All the political leaders heard the slogans of Pakistan zindabad... "Indian dogs get out of the Valley", and other anti-India outpourings. The posters carrying such slogans were appearing on the walls. Then there was a massive anti-India propaganda, hate-India campaign on Kashmir all over the world. Our security forces were painted one of the most inhuman forces, brute forces violating all human rights. The government in New Delhi was pumping money, crores, hundreds of crores in Kashmir Valley. But despite all this generosity nobody could dare personally go and hoist the National Flag in Srinagar any day -- Independence Day or Republic Day. A certain feeling and sense of despondency was descending on the people of Jammu and Laddakh also as there was nobody to raise a little finger against the terrorists. Therefore, the Party (the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party]) decided that I should go to Srinagar and hoist the National Flag in order to emphasise India's basic unity and integrity. We wanted to tell the whole world that India is indivisible. You cannot say that this is Kashmir, this is this, this is that. These divisions are for administrative set up but culturally, emotionally and historically, India, including Kashmir, is one. As I discovered during the Ekta Yatra, even in the remotest corner down south the sentiment on Kashmir is same as in the rest of the country -- north, east or west. The main objective of the Ekta Yatra was to emphasise this positive side of the Kashmir problem and to educate the people about the harm and damage which was done by retaining all these years Article 370 which has sowed the seeds of separatism. My analysis was that the major problem arises because of this Article under which Kashmir appears to have been given a separate status, separate from other States. The continuance of the Article was responsible for separatism in Kashmir, said Shri Murli Manohar Joshi, former President of BJP, in an interview to ORGANISER on his sixtieth birthday, January 5. Excerpts. [Question] The government is having talks with Pakistan on Kashmir. what is your view about it? [Answer] Regrettably the government has not acted wisely in handling Kashmir affairs and has provided a handle to separatist, anti-India elements in Kashmir. The most unfortunate part of government's policy (on Kashmir) is that Kashmir which was only a bilateral matter, under the Shimla Pact, has been allowed to become an international issue. Now, many countries are coming and trying to sponsor their services to mediate and United States and some of its representatives have even questioned the accession of Kashmir State to the Indian Union. They say that entire Kashmir is a disputed territory. This is because Government of India could not initiate talks with Pakistan. The GOI should have forced Pakistan to the negotiating table and asked for withdrawal of Pakistani forces from the occupied Kashmir as provided under UN resolutions. The UNCIP appointed by UNO had held that the accession was legal and valid. [Question] You mean UN resolution also called for withdrawal of pakistani Army from PoK? [Answer] Yes. But GOI never demanded the withdrawal of Pakistani forces. [Question] What would you suggest? Should the government hold talks? [Answer] Talks or no talks...that is not the issue. Well, first GOI should be in a position to create a favourable world opinion. All those countries which were supporting India till now have become non-interested. Even Russia which was extending blanket support in the past has withdrawn. Now, once you accept that Kashmir is a disputed territory, what about Sikkim? China does not think it is part of India. Arunachal also, China feels, is not a part of India. This is a design to destabilise India. Therefore, the basic question is that of country's integrity. [Question] Against this background what do you think can be a solution? [Answer] There are so many options being talked about. Some say, give Kashmir more autonomy, some feel borders should be made more porous. Some say Valley should be put under international control for some years. Some are thinking of independent Kashmir, some say that let Kashmir go to Pakistan. All sorts of solutions are coming up. These solutions are being talked about because the GOI has shown weakness in handling the Kashmir issue all these years. Had it dealt with the issue firmly there would have been no Kashmir problem today. [Question] The situation being so alarming, has the Party any other immediate plank on Kashmir? [Answer] Yes, I feel the soul of India must be stirred once again. To remain quiet on the new U.S. stance on the issue will be suicidal. Due to elections and other reasons the reaction of GOI was not so sharp as it should have been. [Question] It is said that Hazratbal episode gave BJP a very good chance to bring the Kashmir issue to the fore but BJP wasted it? [Answer] As I have told you, there were elections at that time. But still, all through the election campaign we focussed on Kashmir and told the people of government's surrender to militants. *
