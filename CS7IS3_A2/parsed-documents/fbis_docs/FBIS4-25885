These enterprises have raised 11.385 billion Hong Kong dollars by issuing 5.551 billion shares since July last year when they were first listed in Hong Kong. This figure made up four percent of the total overseas investment in the Chinese Mainland last year. These enterprises include the Qingdao Brewery, the Shanghai Petrochemical Works, the Beiren Printing Machinery Plant, the Anhui Maanshan Iron and Steel Complex, the Yizheng Chemical Works and the Tianjin Bohai Chemical Works. According to experts here from Hong Kong's market, the reason why the "H"-shares are popular in Hong Kong is because these mainland enterprises, which are backed by government policy, have valuable property and their products have a ready market. It was learned that 22 additional mainland enterprises are expected to get listed in the Hong Kong market this year.
