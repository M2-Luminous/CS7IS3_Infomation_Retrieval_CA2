Many Golkar functionaries in the provinces have resorted to acts of defiance in the election of local regents by rejecting the candidates backed by its central board or the central government. These acts within the Golkar rank and file in the provinces which have come to be dubbed "undercurrents", have been so frequent that many observers view them as positive phenomena in the development of the country's political system. Although in nearly all of the cases, Golkar's local politicians lost the cause, the inspiring aspect of their rejection of directives is that they now have the boldness to say "no" in situations in which they would previously have responded with total passivity. Every citizen here -- outside and inside the ruling political organization -- is quite aware that Golkar leaders are supposed to toe the government line. Most observers would probably agree that although provincial politicians might have been a bit extreme in expressing their views, the central government has not been totally right in its aggressive effort to make local legislators accept its candidates. Minister of Home Affairs Yogi S. Memet withdrew his gubernatorial candidate for Central Kalimantan after the latter won local election but was subsequently widely opposed by the local leaders. However, President Suharto refuses to recognize the existence of a trend. The head of state, in his capacity as chief patron of the Golkar, said in written message to the party leaders on Monday that there was no such thing as "undercurrents". In his view, the situation reflects no more than the fact that a few people claimed to speak on behalf of the masses. Suharto's notion could be viewed as a call for Golkar leaders to set the organization's house in order. It is their internal problem. But because the tendency is becoming more popular here now, the question is whether all political engineering -- which Suharto said cannot be separated from politics -- has a negative connotation? To Suharto the tendency toward more vocal local stances in the Golkar hierarchy might look like old-fashioned politicking because it does not introduce any positive way of thinking. But in other places, such as within the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI), this type of "political engineering" has managed to channel the aspirations of the younger generation who rejected any candidate for the party leadership with a clear leaning toward the establishment. They believed that this kind of person would not be able to make the PDI a viable party. During its congress at the end of last year, many young leaders of the PDI were of the opinion that the congress must be able to elect a strong and popular leader who would be able to put an end to the party's long history of internal squabbles once and for all. And to achieve this, they should also lend their ears to the young people, who had become more and more expressive. The younger ones were making an effort to gain wider participation within the party, a legal and normal crusade within a democratic country, where leaders are expected to be open and wise. Whether or not President Suharto specifically meant the recent extra high profile activities among Golkar leaders in the provinces when he spoke about undercurrents, when looking at the reasons behind the new tendency we believe that it is not political engineering but political professionalism which has begun to gain a foothold. And this can be expected to provide Golkar with a more colorful political spectrum.
