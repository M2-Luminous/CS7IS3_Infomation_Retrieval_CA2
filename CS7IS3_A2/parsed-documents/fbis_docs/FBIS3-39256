If the plainness of the words were a yardstick for the cordiality of relations, then there could be nothing better and more beautiful in international trade than trade between the United Statesa and Japan. Yet, the news and pictures of the weekend show the contrary: U.S. President Clinton and Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa were not trying to conceal that the Washington trade talks remained absolutely without any result -- and, what is worse, that the two sides even failed to show mutual understanding for the positions in the negotiations. If the Americans do not remain cool, the situation might escalate into a trade war or at least into a worrying dispute. The question as to who is to blame will hardly find a clear answer. It may be difficult to provide evidence of flagrant Japanese infringements of the free trade agreements that were also signed by Japan. However, one cannot say either that the only obstacle to the Japanese market are the letters that are so unusual to Westerners. The difference between the theoretical and practical openness of the Japanese market is striking, and it has a lot to do with the close interrelations between the economy and the administration in Japan. However, those who complain about discrimination must also ask themselves whether their product would really have such good chances on a completely open Japanese market. It is not without reason that the Japanese are so successful with their cars and their electronic products, which taught fear to their competitors in America and Europe. Thus, it is remarkable that the U.S. President should complain about Japanese trade restrictions without requesting their verifiable elimination, but that he is trying to achieve import figures and quotas for the U.S. economy. How should Hosokawa continue the difficult course of deregulation in Japan while taking home new regulations from trade talks? If he wants to retain credibility in terms of domestic policy, then he must not even listen to Clinton's proposal. Diplomatic efforts in international economy must not progress to new agreements, but return to GATT rules. The more the world is divided up into trade blocks, the more often bilateral agreements will replace the most-favored nation status and nondiscrimination. This does not serve peace. We are still far away from the international society guided by universal values: Based on the spirit of GATT, one step toward it could be taken in world trade.
