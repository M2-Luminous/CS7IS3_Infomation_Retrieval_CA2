FR941117-0-00181 FR941117-0-00012 (4) Commercial (for-profit) organizations, at 34 CFR 74.27; and (5) State and local governments and federally-recognized Indian tribal organizations, at 34 CFR 80.22. (b) A grantee must have a current indirect cost rate agreement to charge indirect costs to a grant. To obtain an indirect cost rate, a grantee must submit an indirect cost proposal to its cognizant agency and negotiate an indirect cost rate agreement. (c) The Secretary may establish a temporary indirect cost rate for a grantee that does not have an indirect cost rate agreement with its cognizant agency. (d) The Secretary accepts an indirect cost rate negotiated by a grantee's cognizant agency, but may establish a restricted indirect cost rate for a grantee to satisfy the statutory requirements of certain programs administered by the Department. (Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1221e&hyph;3(a)(1) and 3474) 4. Section 75.561 is revised to read as follows: §75.561 Approval of indirect cost rates. (a) If the Department of Education is the cognizant agency, the Secretary approves an indirect cost rate for a grantee other than a local educational agency. For the purposes of this section, the term local educational agency does not include a State agency. (b) Each State educational agency, on the basis of a plan approved by the Secretary, shall approve an indirect cost rate for each local educational agency that requests it to do so. These rates may be for periods longer than a year if rates are sufficiently stable to justify a longer period. (c) The Secretary generally approves indirect cost rate agreements annually. Indirect cost rate agreements may be approved for periods longer than a year if the Secretary determines that rates will be sufficiently stable to justify a longer rate period. (Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1221e&hyph;3(a)(1) and 3474) 5. Section 75.562 is revised to read as follows: §75.562 Indirect cost rates for educational training projects. (a) Educational training grants provide funding for training or other educational services. Examples of the work supported by training grants are summer institutes, training programs for selected participants, the introduction of new or expanded courses, and similar instructional undertakings that are separately budgeted and accounted for by the sponsoring institution. These grants do not usually support activities involving research, development, and dissemination of new educational materials and methods. Training grants largely implement previously developed materials and methods and require no significant adaptation of techniques or instructional services to fit different circumstances. (b) The Secretary uses the definition in paragraph (a) to determine which grants are educational training grants. (c) Indirect cost reimbursement on a training grant is limited to the recipient's actual indirect costs, as determined by its negotiated indirect cost rate agreement, or eight percent of a modified total direct cost base, whichever amount is less. For the purposes of this section, a modified total direct cost base is defined as total direct costs less stipends, tuition and related fees, and capital expenditures of $5,000 or more. (1) The eight percent limit also applies to cost-type contracts under grants, if these contracts are for training as defined in this section. (2) The eight percent limit does not apply to agencies of State or local governments, including federally recognized Indian tribal governments, as defined in 34 CFR 80.3. (3) Indirect costs in excess of the eight percent limit may not be charged directly, used to satisfy matching or cost-sharing requirements, or charged to another Federal award. (d) A grantee using the training rate of eight percent is required to have documentation available for audit that shows that its negotiated indirect cost rate is at least eight percent. (Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1221e&hyph;3(a)(1) and 3474) 6. Section 75.563 is revised to read as follows: §75.563 Restricted indirect cost rate_programs covered. If a grantee decides to charge indirect costs to a program that has a statutory requirement prohibiting the use of Federal funds to supplant non-Federal funds, the grantee shall use a restricted indirect cost rate computed under 34 CFR 76.564 through 76.569. (Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1221e&hyph;3(a)(1) and 3474) 7. Sections 75.564 through 75.568 are removed. 8. A new §75.564 is added to read as follows: §75.564 Reimbursement of indirect costs. (a) Reimbursement of indirect costs is subject to the availability of funds and statutory or administrative restrictions. (b) The application of the rates and the determination of the direct cost base by a grantee must be in accordance with the indirect cost rate agreement approved by the grantee's cognizant agency. (c) Indirect cost reimbursement is not allowable under grants for_ (1) Fellowships and similar awards if Federal financing is exclusively in the form of fixed amounts such as scholarships, stipend allowances, or the tuition and fees of an institution; (2) Construction grants; (3) Grants to individuals; (4) Grants to organizations located outside the territorial limits of the United States; (5) Grants to Federal organizations; and (6) Grants made exclusively to support conferences. (d) Indirect cost reimbursement on grants received under programs with statutory restrictions or other limitations on indirect costs must be made in accordance with the restrictions in 34 CFR 76.564 through 76.569. (e) Indirect costs for a group of eligible parties (see §§75.127&hyph;75.129) are limited to the amount derived by applying the rate of the applicant, or a restricted rate when applicable, to the grant in keeping with the terms of the applicant's indirect cost rate agreement.

The authority citation for Part 76 continues to read as follows: Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1221e&hyph;3(a)(1), 2831(a), 2974(b), and 3474, unless otherwise noted. 10. Section 76.560 is amended by revising paragraphs (a)(1), (2), (3), (4), and (5), by revising paragraph (b), by adding new paragraphs (c) and (d), and revising the authority citation at the end of the section, to read as follows: §76.560 General indirect cost rates; exceptions.
