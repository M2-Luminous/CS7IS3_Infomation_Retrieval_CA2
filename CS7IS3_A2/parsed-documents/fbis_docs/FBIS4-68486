So, Then, We Can Breathe Easy..."] [Text] "You would like to see our republic wealthy, attractive, prosperous? You would be pleased to see the appearance of a whole network of new enterprises and hundreds and thousands of extra jobs? You would take pride in seeing shops treating wool and garment factories operating in stable fashion? The burgeoning of mining industry in our abundant region with its priceless minerals? High-quality machine tools not hacking up but cutting the Khabaz and Bezengi stone according to specifications? And there is hardly a fellow countryman who would not want to turn the Elbrus region into a second Switzerland, if not better. The currency resources of foreigners involved in business, whom we are not as yet "luring" to the center of our beauties to the republic's benefit, would help here.... "And if you want all this, if you are interested in people's relations being not on a national and political basis but according to professional attributes, with a keen desire for property, peace, and prosperity, come to us!" This was the conclusion of the sincere and ardent introduction to an interview with Eduard Gazizovich Umarov, chairman of a new party registered by the Kabardino-Balkar Republic Ministry of Justice on 3 February 1994. It is called the Kabardino-Balkar Republic Organization of the Consolidation Party. Here are some extracts from its rules: "The KBRO [Kabardino-Balkar Republic Organization] of the Consolidation Party is a political organization voluntarily uniting in its ranks citizens of the Russian Federation who are permanent residents on the territory of the Kabardino-Balkar Republic and who recognize the program and rules of the party and also the rules of the KBRO of the party.... ...The main goals... are: the revival of Russia as a distinctive, historically unique state and of the Kabardino-Balkar Republic as a component of the Russian Federation uniting in peace and harmony people of different nationalities, religious beliefs, and professional, social, and property position on the principles of democratism, civic unity, patriotism, equal opportunities, the priority of the highest value--human dignity--and responsibility for the country and the fate of future generations. To achieve the said goals... it will participate in elections to the representative organs of power and local government, with its own slate of candidates for deputy included, take part in the established procedure in the formation of the organs of state power and administration and also local government, and exercise legislative initiative; appear in the news media and the party press.... maintain direct contacts and relations among public and political organizations of other components of the Russian Federation.... create research, analytical, and sociological centers for the study of public opinion, the needs and requirements of the citizens...." The rules say also that a citizen of Russia who has attained to the age of 18 and who recognizes the rules of the KBRO of the party, who renders it support, and who is a permanent resident on the territory of the Kabardino-Balkar Republic may be a member of the KBRO of the Consolidation Party. Party members do not pay dues. The monetary resources and other assets of the KBRO of the party, the rules say, shall be formed thanks to the voluntary contributions of organizations and citizens and income from its own industrial-economic and publishing activity and also from other receipts authorized by legislation. At an organizational session of the new party (its action committee was made up of about 30 persons) those who spoke noted the vital nature of the party's base principles. They said that its program would determine the prospects of the socioeconomic development of the country and, consequently, of our republic also. Of course, I immediately inquired after the sources of the event, how and in what connection the party chairman had conceived of its creation in Kabardino-Balkaria, and what altogether the Consolidation Party of Russia represents. Instead of answering, Eduard Gazizovich showed me the journal DELOVYYE LYUDI with a striking, well-designed cover. It contained a portrait of Aleksandr Tikhonov, the prominent Russian entrepreneur and general director of the Interural Enterprise. He has been chairman of the Consolidation Party of Russia since October 1992, apparently. "An entrepreneur in politics?" I expressed surprise. Here my interlocutor smiled silently. He then showed me a page of the newspaper KURANTY: "A journalist put to the person himself, Tikhonov, the same question...." Much did, indeed, become clear from a reading of Aleksandr Anatolyevich's interview with a KURANTY correspondent. The Interural Enterprise is a multiprofile enterprise and it has been involved in the production and exports of metal products, the development and assimilation of new technology, wood processing, and the production of building materials and consumer goods. It is apparent that business has been oriented toward the realization of social programs. Modern installations for the packing of meat and equipment for the production of sanitary engineering apparatus have been purchased, clothing is made up, and nails and cement are manufactured. In Nizhniy Tagil, where mountains of slag had grown up, its conversion was organized together with German and Swiss firms. But... enterprise has become increasingly difficult. The preposterous taxes are unsettling people. It was then that the idea of becoming involved in politics, which formulate the rules of the game, began to mature. After all, it can be seen more clearly "from inside" what kind of laws should emanate from the state so that those who are responsible for the economy might breathe more freely. It should dictate the rules to the politicians, not the other way about. Tikhonov believes that it is very important to create in Russia a procedure which would encourage production, not throw wrenches in its works. And I am sure that the activity of a highly skilled, honest entrepreneur might even lead to some amendment in the law which would improve the work of the enterprise and the ordinary worker. For this reason he created a party, as he said, with a unifying principle--creation is possible only in a stable society. I do not understand, Tikhonov said, the politicians--of both right and left--who are exacerbating the situation in the country! The Consolidation Party advocates a diversity of forms of property and a multistructured rural economy and everything being done intelligently. At the end of the interview the chairman of the Consolidation Party of Russia shared with the KURANTY correspondent recollections of how he, as an entrepreneur, had frequently traveled abroad. And had seen the following picture: In one room the politicians of two countries were negotiating, in another, businessmen from both sides. And before the adoption of a political decision, the first would inquire of the second: We have now considered questions with a bearing on such-and-such economic problems; what is best here? And the latter would make suggestions.... "Eduard Gazizovich," I tore myself away from the newspaper article, "the idea that the most adept politicians could emerge from the ranks of entrepreneurs is clear to everyone. But let us return to our party. How might Aleksandr Anatolyevich Tikhonov help it, a branch of the Russian party, initially?" "Everything will depend primarily on us, on an expansion of the circle of business people wishing to join the party. Not simultaneously and not all at once but certain heights may be scaled and ties to overseas firms established. We need to create an original economic basis. To strengthen our intermediary role in the organization of foreign tourism via Interural, say. "Foreigners involved in business would be told that people are not fighting each other here. They would prepare tourist packages for us, we would drive them around here and offer billionaires family recreation in the mountains of the Elbrus region and at the Goluboye lakes and Chegem waterfalls. We would, crudely speaking, force out foreign currency, which we would immediately allocate for social needs. Tikhonov has connections with the countries that have the most modern drilling equipment, rock drills (Italy, Germany), Swedish cars.... Of course, they will not invest a kopek for us in this work unless there are dependable guarantees from the center. Our membership of the Consolidation Party of Russia, which many of the world's businessmen recognize, could be this distinctive guarantee.... "Of course, in order to put things on as broad a footing as possible, all of Russian power, we need to increase the number of party members, explain to people the meaning of its work...." "Eduard Gazizovich, you are known and respected in the republic as an experienced, professional worker in the public utilities sphere. If you have resolved to put your economic knowledge at the service of policy, prosperity, and consolidation, I would like to wish you well and wish you success. Our newspaper always supports peaceful, profoundly considered initiatives. And we will, most likely, meet several times more for a discussion on this theme." "I am sure of it. Only let people respond, may they wish to realize our ideas together with us. My office number is 9-77-64.
