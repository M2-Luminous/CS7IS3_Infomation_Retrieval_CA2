FBIS4-1202 "drafr079_c_94036" FBIS-AFR-94-079 Daily Report 25 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Misconduct To Be Investigated Misconduct To Be Investigated MB2404075994 Johannesburg WEEKEND STAR in English 23-24 Apr 94 p 2 MB2404075994 Johannesburg WEEKEND STAR English BFN [Report by Newton Kanhema and Guy Jepson] [Text] One thousand members of the embattled National Peacekeeping Force [NPKF] have been fired since its formation in late January, according to its commander, Major-General Gabriel Ramushwana. The former Venda military strongman also hinted at further purges of undisciplined force members after the spectacular failure of the NPKF in less than a week at the sharp end on the East Rand. A special investigation team is to probe allegations of misconduct and indiscipline against members of the multiparty force since its deployment in Thokoza, Katlehong and Vosloorus last week. Wayward members are alleged to have held their commanding officer hostage for three hours in a de facato mutiny, disobeyed orders while on patrol, panicked under fire, consumed alcohol and smoked dagga [marijuana] on duty, and shot at the police. Among the more startling allegations against the peacekeeping force told to WEEKEND STAR by an impeccable NPKF source was that some Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation -- ANC armed wing] (MK) elements had passed on key intelligence on its operations on the East Rand to ANC-aligned self-defence units (SDUs). "We would strategise what we ought to be doing and before implementing the strategy the word would have been passed to the residents -- especially to the SDUs," said the source. "There is no trust between the SADF [South African Defense Force] and the MK soldiers. How can you describe an army which locks its own commander inside an amoured vehicle. They were sending messages to the people." The NPKF, which had been fired on repeatedly by Inkatha-supporting hostel dwellers in Thokoza and Katlehong since its deployment, beat a hasty retreat on Wednesday as a full-scale war erupted between hostel dwellers and the SDUs. But before they left, at least 20 people had been killed, among them THE STAR's chief photographer Ken Oosterbroek, who was allegedly shot on Monday by a panicking NPKF member during a fierce three-day gunbattle in Thokoza. The NPKF -- which will continue to perform "non-aggressive" duties in East Rand townships, such as providing escorts and protecting key points, schools and polling stations -- was replaced by the SADF, which had stabilised the area since the withdrawal of the controversial Internal Stability Unit in February. At a joint press conference on Thursday, NPKF and SADF commanders explained that the two forces would remain under separate commands but would conduct joint operations. The SADF is to carry out "aggressive" tasks -- searches, foot and vehicle patrols and roadblocks -- in the trouble spots. Significantly, while the NPKF is tasked with "liaising with the community," the SADF is responsible for the liaison forums -- key dispute resolution bodies set up in conjunction with community leaders in February. In an astonishing turn of events following heavy gunbattles in Thokoza on Monday and Tuesday, NPKF commander Colonel Quinton Painter was allegedly held hostage inside an armoured vehicle for three hours by MK elements within the NPKF. Painter had reportedly been due to attend a task force meeting which would include IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] representatives. He was reportedly freed after threatening to call ANC president Nelson Mandela. ANC PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] premier candidate Tokyo Sexwale, who addressed MK force members privately in their barracks after the incident, subsequently called for Painter to be dismissed. Sexwale's discussion with the MK members infuriated SADF elements in the force and drew strong criticism from Ramushwanna. "I do not accept any politicians coming into any of my barracks and addressing soldiers privately. We are an integrated force and we do not want unnecessary tensions," he said. Commenting on the mutiny allegations, Ramushwana said he had not yet received a report from his officers. "I have heard it as a rumour and I cannot comment until I receive a report." Asked what went wrong on the East Rand, Ramushwana said an incorrect perception had been created when the SDUs used NPKF armoured vehicles as cover when they attacked the hostels. "They were shooting at the hostels from under and on the sides of our vehicles and the IFP people saw us as part of the attack." However, the general stressed that the IFP had threatened before the arrival of the force on the East Rand that it would not be welcome. "They were prepared to create problems for us." Ramushwana said any NPKF soldier who acted partially would be fired and confirmed that 1,000 soldiers had been dismissed -- many for being absent without leave. It is understood that a large number of those dismissed were MK members. The source said several SADF soldiers had their lives threatened and some had chosen to leave the force.
