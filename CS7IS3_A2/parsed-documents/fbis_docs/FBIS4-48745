Speaking on his arrival at Addis Ababa in Ethiopia today, Mr. Nzo said the result is that the rest of Africa was looking to South Africa to help the continent out of hunger and poverty. He told our political staff that the raising of the South African flag at the OAU headquarters in the city today was seen by many countries in Africa as a symbolic gesture that South Africa would satisfy the needs of especially Sub-Saharan countries. However, he warned against exaggerated expectations. Mr. Nzo will meet the OAU secretary general, Dr. Salim Ahmed Salim, today to discuss the role South Africa will play in improving conditions for underprivileged societies throughout Africa. He also said that no plans had been drawn up yet on South Africa's involvement in a possible UN peace force for Rwanda.
