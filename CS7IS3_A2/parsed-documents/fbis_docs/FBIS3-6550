The recent inspections were designed to purely ensure the continuity of safeguards [sunsu tamboui yonsoksongul pojanghanunde] in conformity with the special status [tuksuhan chiwi] in which our country had temporarily suspended the effectuation of its withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. In the negotiations in Vienna with us on 15 February, the agency's Secretariat admitted that the inspections were for ensuring the continuity of safeguards and agreed on the scope of such inspections. Therefore, throughout the period after we received the inspection team, out of a desire to sincerely implement the DPRK-U.S. agreement and the agreement between us and the IAEA, we allowed all activities necessary to ensure the continuity of safeguards and positively cooperated with the inspection team's work. As a result, the agency's inspection team was able to satisfactory carry out all activities pointed out in the 15 February Vienna agreement, including replacing and maintaining [chongbi] sealing and surveillance devices [pongswae mit kamsisudan], examining inventories [chaegoryang], examining [komto] various documents, verifying design information [solgye tongbo], and obtaining and measuring samples [siryo chaechwi mit chukchong]. Nevertheless, during the period of the recent inspections, the agency's Secretariat and the inspection team unilaterally insisted that the inspections were not inspections for ensuring the continuity of safeguards but inspections under the safeguards accord. And, quite contrary to the 15 February Vienna agreement, they put forth an uncourteous request for inspections almost tantamount to regular and irregular inspections [chonggi mit pijonggi]. Not keeping with the Vienna agreement, the IAEA Secretariat gave directions [chiryong] to the inspection team, and taking the inspection team's incorrect report [kuruttoen pogo] as an established fact, it insisted on unfair demands, including the issues of extracting samples from places where seals, which are locking devices, remained untouched; gamma measuring of all parts, not selected spots; and checking of the cooling system, which was not even mentioned in the Vienna negotiations. The IAEA Secretariat continued to intimidate us by sending three telex messages saying if its demands were not fulfilled, it would report to the Board of Governors that it could not confirm nuclear materials were not used for other purposes. On the other hand, when the members of the inspection team in our country could not make any more objections to the administrators' logical explanation regarding the extraction of samples from places where seals were maintained, they made an excuse that they had no choice but to carry out the task [extracting samples] because it was assigned by the IAEA Secretariat. Even after personally confirming that the seals they put themselves in August 1993 remained untouched, they made an absurd assertion that they could not trust the seals because they were over a year old. The IAEA Secretariat's unfair demands, including the sample extraction from the inlet measurement tank [ipku kyeryang tank] locked by IAEA's seals, have nothing to do with the objective and nature of the inspection--which was to check that no nuclear activities had been carried out--but are a grave violation [omjunghan wiban] of the agreement reached in Vienna on 15 February. We have even shown a good intention by flexibly carrying out the IAEA's unreasonable [murihan] demands, including the issues of extracting samples from some places where sealing devices are installed and measuring gamma from all necessary places. Since it is so, the recent nuclear inspection activities carried out by a IAEA inspection team are sufficient to confirm that nuclear materials from our nuclear facilities are not used for other purposes and to firmly ensure the continuity of safeguards. In fact, these facilities were blocked doubly and triply as the gate of the radiochemical laboratory and major processes [kongjong] were frozen [tonggyol] with numerous seals, surveillance cameras, and marks of the IAEA. Nonetheless, the IAEA Secretariat, even before analyzing the results of the inspections, made an unjust assessment that it cannot guarantee that nuclear materials were not used for other purpose at these facilities because some inspection activities were restricted at the radiochemical laboratory, even though many inspection activities were carried out in accordance with the Vienna agreement. In connection with this, the IAEA is causing a stir that it will convene a meeting of the IAEA Board of Governors. This is an utterly unjust act of openly turning over the agreement reached with the United States and with the IAEA on ensuring the continuity of safeguards, and can never be justified under any circumstances. All these facts prove that the IAEA Secretariat attempts to widen the scope of unjustness and, under the U.S. manipulation, invariably pursues sinister political aims to crush [apsal] us. If the IAEA Secretariat truly hopes for a fair solution of our nuclear problem, it should withdraw its unjust hasty assessment on the results of the recent inspections We will watch the attitude the IAEA Secretariat will assume at the upcoming Board of Governors meeting. Based on this, we will judge whether it intends to resolve our nuclear issue fairly or attempts to use this for political aims. If the IAEA Secretariat again tries to agitate the unjust pressure commotions against us by finding faults with us, we will have no choice but to respond to this with a resolute measure [manil kukchewonjaryokkiku sogigugi urirul kolgodulmyonso ttodasi uriege pudanghan amnyoksodongul polliryo sidohandamyon urinun tanhohan chochiro kue taeunghajianulsuopkedwoelgosida].
