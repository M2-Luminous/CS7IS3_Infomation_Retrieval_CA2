The observation is gaining unusual interest. According to a reliable source in Washington on 30 November, working-level representatives of the ROK and North Korea are discussing pending issues, including the resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue which is at a stalemate, and the resumption of the South-North dialogue, in either Seoul, Pyongyang, or a third country city such as Beijing or Moscow. The source says there is also a possibility that a secret nuclear envoy of the ROK Government might have been in North Korea and have had contacts with high-ranking North Korean officials to seek a breakthrough in the nuclear issue. It is also rumored, but not confirmed, that the ROK side's representative to the contact with North Korea is one of President Kim Yong-sam's aides whose surname initial is "H" or "J".
