It said that Arab rights can only be recovered in full if the Arabs reinforce their solidarity and coordination to close all doors to the infiltration attempts Israel is trying to make through numerous channels. [passage omitted] A Syrian official told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that "what the current stage requires most is coordination and a unified Arab stance. Because Israel is not interested in peace and is proposing ideas that have nothing to do with peace. It is also embarking on actions aimed at hitting the peace process, namely its attacks on the peaceful people in southern Lebanon. The most recent of these attacks took place the day before yesterday. It proves that what Israel is interested in is implementing its plan to torpedo Arab solidarity, which is the cornerstone of the Arab position's strength." The official added that the Arabs must shoulder their historic responsibility now, by not giving Israel the chance to make its plan a success and control the region and its wealth. He said that the Arab states are urgently pressed to move forward with one view to achieve peace, which is in the interests of Arab states and the region. The official pointed out that Syria needs a clear and strong Arab position, because it cannot backtrack on its basic constants or accept compromises. And that Syria will continue to work with everyone to achieve a just and comprehensive settlement that guarantees the Arabs' rights. It declared its position clearly, namely that there can be no solution, peace, security, and stability while the land is still occupied. The Syrian official said that Washington continues to stress through the contacts conducted between it and Damascus the desire to establish peace in the Middle East -- a peace that ends tension and guarantees an atmosphere of stability that eliminates the dangers threatening U.S. interests. This is why Israel is resorting to evasions, because it is aware of this reality. It is not working for the sake of ending tension and establishing peace. In fact it is seeking to kindle new conflicts in order to weaken the Arab position and the possibility of improving relations between the United States and the Arab states. [passage omitted]
