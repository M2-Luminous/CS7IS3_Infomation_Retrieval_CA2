The negotiations, the first since the conflict erupted two years ago, broke off on March 22 after failing to reach a ceasefire agreement. The talks were brokered by Russian envoy Vitaliy Churkin. Kai Eide, the UN representative who is co-chairing the talks with European Union Ambassador Gert Ahrens, said: "I think that we will now conclude the cease-fire agreement and then we will look for the implementation of it." The talks are aimed solely at forging a ceasefire between the two sides. The rebel Serbs have proclaimed a separatist republic, the Serb republic of Krajina (RSK), on roughly a quarter of Croatian territory. Eide said the negotiating teams have spent the last week studying the oustanding problems. "We carried out... preparation on the ground and on the maps," he said, adding that there were a "few remaining issues. I think that it is up to the political determination of the two parties to solve them." "We certainly expect them to have that determination," he added. John Mills, spokesman for the mediators, said after the start of Tuesday's talks that: ``the Krajina and the Croatian delegates, with a military negotiation team, immediately started working on the maps. "There is determination (and) impatience to get results. This is an opportunity that should not be allowed to go by," he added.
