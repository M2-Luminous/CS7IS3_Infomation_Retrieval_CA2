At a press conference, Hata brushed aside some reports suggesting that Japan's policy on aid to Russia has changed because of recent political developments in Moscow, such as the resignations of reformers First Deputy Premier Yegor Gaydar and Finance Minister Boris Fedorov. Japan's position to support, in cooperation with the Group of Seven (G-7) nations, Russia's efforts for democratization, a shift toward a market-oriented economy and a transition to a diplomacy based on law and justice, remains unchanged, Hata said. Japan is watching closely Russia's moves to form a cabinet and other developments concerning its domestic politics, but it has not yet changed its policy on aid to Russia, he said. He said Tokyo will continue to extend the aid by grasping the progress of reforms in Russia and by understanding the needs of the Russian people. Hata also said Russia's development and stabilization are important because the country has influence within the international community and great resources and technology.
