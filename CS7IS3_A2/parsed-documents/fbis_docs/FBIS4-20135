The parliament in Taipei wants to make a basic decision in the period between May and July on the construction of a 350-km high-speed link between the capital in the north of the island and the industrial town of Koahsiung in the south, which would cost $17 billion. Not only the success of the Intercity Express in Germany and the advanced technology speak for the German system, but also the fact that a German consortium is offering a private financing and operating scheme in accordance with the wishes of the Taiwanese parliament. Under the leadership of the Daimler subsidiary AEG, the German enterprises are prepared to make a comprehensive technology transfer, so that the Taiwanese industry, too, will profit from this project. Rexrodt also stressed Germany's interest in the export of air buses, of short-distance traffic systems for the conurbation centers of the island, and of power plants and energy supply systems. Basically, the government is interested in an intensification of economic relations, the economics minister stated during his talks with State President Lee Teng-hui, Economics Minister Chiang, Transportation Minister Liu, and leading parliamentarians. Rexrodt welcomed the plan to establish a Taiwan center in Frankfurt and promised German support for the Taipei Government's wish to rejoin the United Nations and to be accepted by the newly founded World Trade Organization. The Chinese partners demanded that Taiwan be deleted from the "H list" for exports, which includes countries that need a special permit for the export of goods that can be used for military and civilian purposes. Rexrodt stressed that the Federal Government is currently considering reducing this list from 36 to 8-12 countries. A decision will be made by the summer. The German economics minister promised his partners in Taiwan that he will examine whether the next of the FRG's Asian economic conferences can take place in Taipei in 1996. [passage omitted]
