Such a country has nothing in common with modern capitalism." He was making his ombudsmans report to parliament on the year 1993. Zielinski saw the main deficiency in the process of improving the legal rights of Polish citizens as being the delay in passing a new constitution. He emphatically disagreed with those who thought that Poland could not afford to guarantee social and economic security, explaining that in constitutional legislation basic human rights could not be ignored because of a temporary crisis. Referring to the letters that were sent to his office Zielinski said Poland was not a just country and would certainly not be one for a long time. As proof of his claim Zielinski listed rising unemployment, worsening health care, the failure to guarantee minimum housing requirements and above all the lack of a guaranteed social minimum income. In Zielinski's view ideological conflicts were still going on in Poland. As an example he said that lawyers who wanted to freely state their opinions on the legal consequences of the concordat with the Vatican were unfairly accused of having an unfriendly attitude to the church. This was anologous to lawyers in communist times being expected to adopt an apologetic stance towards legislation passed in those days. Zielinski said that nothing sowed so much mistrust in the public where the state was concerned as legislative impotence. Laws were passed which could not be executed because of insufficient finances. Zielinski stressed that in the second year of his term in office he had not noted any important infringements of political rights such as freedom of assembly or the freedom to join trade unions. The removal of censorship meant that the right of free expression was being observed. However many newspapers were reluctant to correct false information. A member of the parliamentary justice committee, Wojciech Lamentowicz, said that Zielinski's speech had been "a job very well done". This was proof of the ombudsman's office being staffed by courageous and thoughtful people, he added.
