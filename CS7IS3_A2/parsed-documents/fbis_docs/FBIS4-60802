The political sphere has nowadays become more stable. In line with the standards of civilized, democratic countries, deputies' factions and political parties have formed which consolidate society and support exclusively parliamentary methods of fighting for power. A proof of this is the signing by all the leading political forces of the Treaty on Social Accord. Those political forces linked with extremism which refused to participate in the treaty are undoubtedly losing the support of society. Unfortunately, it was necessary to go through the bloody events of 1 May last year and the clashes of 3-4 October 1993 in order for the madmen to realize that this is no method for resolving political problems in Russia. Our country will never again bring itself to obtain rulers through methods of bloody dictatorship. We have had quite enough revolutions. We need victories only on the front line of winning prestige among people through concrete deeds. Nevertheless, in the light of last year's bitter experience the forces of law and order have been primed in sufficiently large numbers for the holding of the May Day celebrations. I am confident that they will ensure peace and quiet for muscovites. But we are ready to take control and adopt appropriate measures against disturbers of public order. There are fears of a rash of terrorist acts more than of a plan of concerted actions by gunmen. But today they should understand that their plans will not go unresisted. I am an optimist, but readiness to oppose extremists is an excellent thing in a mayor of Moscow. We are ready for any changes in the situation in the capital. And if anyone wants to cast a cloud over the holiday or to break the law, adequate measures and forces will be activated. At any rate, I personally will be at work on all four free days.
