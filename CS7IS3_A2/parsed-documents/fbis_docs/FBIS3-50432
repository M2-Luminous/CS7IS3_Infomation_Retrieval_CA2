Wise principles tell us: "When a society is in order, a single fool cannot alter it." Nevertheless, "when a society is in chaos, a sole wise man cannot order it." The latter is our reality. The country is becoming more chaotic every day, and, in 1994, we cannot and should not continue to think that the solution to our problems lies exclusively in the hands of the government or in the head of one of the many political, union, or guild leaders. We have to start being responsible and start accepting the fact that the way out of this chaos has to be reached by each and every Nicaraguan who lives, dreams, and struggles in this small country of lakes and volcanoes. We must nourish our faith, and we must hope for a better future for the people of Nicaragua. We have to respect one another and listen to what we are saying, and we need to look for the positive aspects in each other's words. We have to foster trust and not see ourselves as enemies, let alone allow ourselves to treat one another as enemies. We have to make a real and deliberate effort to achieve reconciliation with deeds rather than with words. It is true that our country is small, but it has resources and riches which, if rationally exploited and justly distributed, will bring wellbeing to all Nicaraguans. To promote the citizens' trust and faith, the government must listen to the demands made by the different sectors in Nicaragua, and it must comply with the commitments it has made and still has not kept. The government must be the first to respect the Constitution and the laws to strengthen the state of law. The government must realize that we live in a period of transition and that it has the duty of advancing joint decisions, especially those related to economic policies when they refer to negotiations with international organizations. UNO [National Opposition Union] politicians and Cosep [Higher Council of Private Enterprise] members: We must find a solution. The boards of the UNO political parties and producers guilds, such as Cosep, must take into account that we must all find a way out of the crisis. This requires a great deal of maturity, flexibility, and understanding. We have to understand that the search for solutions to the crisis should benefit everyone. There is a great distance between preaching and practicing democracy -- a distance as great as the one between heaven and hell. The challenge confronting all Nicaraguans is that we have to make tangible the democracy we have been preaching since last century. To this end, it is imperative that we conduct a true national dialogue. In turn, the Sandinists today are issuing an open invitation to a national dialogue, because we are convinced that this is the only way to find solutions to our problems in the areas of jobs, housing, health, food, and education, and that such a dialogue can lead to economic stability and peace. In the month of January 1994, we call UNO leaders to have all their deputies join the National Assembly, which will abide by the Constitution and will promulgate laws to favor the people, workers, and producers. Elections will be held in the north and south Atlantic autonomous regions in February 1994. The Sandinists have faith that this event will strengthen our country's democracy. We have promised to support and promote the candidacies of regional leaders and hope the Atlantic region residents will decide to vote in a favorable manner and demand that the elected candidates be honest and efficient in their administrative efforts. The year 1994 is the 15th anniversary of the victory of the revolution; it is the year of the 60th anniversary of the murder of Sandino; and it is the year of the special FSLN Congress. Sandinists must take bold initiatives to strengthen democracy within our organization. We are obliged to act with a broad mandate to add members, affiliates, and followers to the process of debating the modernization of the FSLN program and bylaws. Sandinists have the moral commitment to unite and gather around principles, programs, and bylaws that will make our organization a democratic and disciplined front committed to the causes and ideals of Sandino. This demands that we rescue the zeal of Sandino's small peasant army, of the FSLN guerrilla detachments, and of the thousands of brothers who gave their lives for the freedom of our fatherland in combat against the Somozist dictatorship and in the heroic resistance of the people against imperialist aggression. This means that we must again take up the zeal of the teachers, coffee reapers, and thousands of brothers who have been present in all the tasks that the fatherland has demanded for its defense. In this way we will guarantee a renewed and modern FSLN, which without losing its grass-roots support, will be the hope of the impoverished majority, as well as be the best alternative to achieve peace, prosperity, and democracy for all the Nicaraguans. Nicaraguan brothers: Receive the FSLN's and its National Directorate's affectionate salutations and our best wishes that 1994 be the year in which we will all contribute to the stability of our fatherland.
