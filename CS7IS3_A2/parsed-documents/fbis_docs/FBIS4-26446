Statistics show that Shanghai remained the area where Taiwan businessmen made the largest total amount of investment on the mainland. Of the 475 mainland investment projects, 66 were in Shanghai, where the investment amount totaled $68.54 million, far greater than that in Shenzhen, which ranked second place. Although Shanghai lacks natural and geographic partners for close economic relations -- like those that exist between Guangdong and Hong Kong, between Fujian and Taiwan, and between Shandong and South Korea -- Shanghai is still the favorite of Taiwan investors. In particular, some companies which have achieved initial successes in Shanghai are making additional investments, which form a substantial force. The chain store business, which began in 1992, is now the key point of competition among overseas corporations. Chung Hsing Group and Pacific Construction, companies that run chain department stores in Taiwan, have launched investment projects in Shanghai. In view of the good business prospects in Shanghai, Pacific Construction will launch a second-phase $7.2-million investment project in Shanghai's Pacific Department Store, which will increase its total stake in the department store to $12.7 million. Ouyang Yi-ming, the company's general manager, said that the rapid business growth in Shanghai prompted them to make the decision on the construction of the second building for the Shanghai Pacific Department Store. Last month, the board of directors of the Hua-hsin Li-hua Company, the Taiwan cable and wire producing enterprise that made the highest amount of indirect investment in the mainland, held a meeting to adopt three indirect mainland investment schemes. Its original plan for building a power and cable plant in Jiangsu's Wuxi was shifted to Shanghai, with the amount of investment increasing form $3.5 million to $6.75 million. Before that, Hua-hsin Li-hua had already invested and run factories in Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Wuhan. Shanghai became the Taiwan businessmen's favorite investment target thanks to Shanghai's vital relations with the Chang Jiang. After Shanghai was built into a port city in 1843, it continued to be a major foreign trade port for the entire Chang Jiang valley. Taiwan's Chang Jung Shipping decided to make investment in Shanghai precisely because it took this fact into account. On 14 May, the shipping company signed an official contract with the Shanghai Harbor Authority on building a container terminal with an area of 60,000 square meters along Baoshan's Jungong Road. The project will be completed and put into operation in approximately one year and will be named the Shanghai Chang Jung Container Corporation. The Shanghai side exchanged the land for shares of the company and the Chang Jung's holding in the company will not be limited. In addition, Chang Jung will have full management power. A number of Taiwan-funded enterprises engaged in labor-intensive industries such as plastics, footwear, garments, and mechanical tools have been set up in the nine suburban districts and counties. They and the urban Taiwan investment projects, primarily engaged in tertiary industry, support and supplement one another. In the first quarter of this year, Taiwan-funded enterprises in Shanghai's suburban areas numbered 846 and accounted for 51.8 percent of the total number of Taiwan-funded enterprises in Shanghai. Of the suburban Taiwan-funded enterprises, 70 percent were labor-intensive ones. Experts expect that Shanghai will become the base for the mainland headquarters of many Taiwan companies in the near future. After Citibank decided to move its China headquarters from Hong Kong to Shanghai and Morgan Stanley decided to move its Asia headquarters from Hong Kong to Shanghai, other foreign corporations may take similar action and this will give a warning to Taiwan businessmen: Do not let this opportunity slip by. Wei Chuan Group built a food producing center in Shanghai as its operation center in the mainland; Xiamen Kun Tsan, which was the first foreign-owned company to be listed in the mainland stock market, moved its mainland headquarters to Shanghai and also proceeded from Shanghai to sell its products in all parts of the country, thus becoming the model for Taiwan companies seeking to enter the mainland market. Yang Wen-fan, general manager of the China market headquarters of Kun Tsan, said that Shanghai plays two functions which cannot be replaced by other cities. It is the city that absorbs information and provides opportunities more directly and rapidly. The city is also the sole "economic window" which can radiate to all parts of the mainland market. As long as products can sell well in Shanghai and gain fame, they will certainly become popular in nearby provinces and cities. Since Shanghai became the key point of the mainland's reform and opening and once again became the economic, financial, and trade center of the Chinese mainland, it has certainly had great influence among Taiwan businessmen. In fact, Taiwan businessmen have had a strong interest in Shanghai for a long time, and this shows that they are well-aware of Shanghai's position. As Taiwan's CHING CHI JIH PAO said, in order to occupy the mainland market, one must first gain a foothold in Shanghai.
