Nikolayev added that this also meant the use of firearms against transgressors if they failed to obey orders by border guards. As concerns the mass violation of the Russian border near the southern Kuril Islands by Japanese shipping vessels on January 21 and 22, Nikolayev said that the transgression of the Russian border by 130 Japanese boats must have been preplanned. To all appearances, it was a reaction to the detention of a Japanese schooner under Captain Keinichi Noto by Russian coast guards in the same area at the end of November. Firearms were used after the Japanese captain declined to obey orders. He was wounded. Nikolayev said Keinichi Noto will soon face trial by a Russian court which will decide on the fate of the captain and his schooner. Soon after Captain Noto's schooner was detained, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs demanded in a note to Moscow that the captain and two sailors, as well as the boat, be released. The two sailors returned to Japan in January. Nikolayev stressed that the Russian border units in the Far East "will protect the state border in accordance with the principles defined by the Russian president and government". "No one should have any doubts that we will firmly guard our country's economic interests," he said.
