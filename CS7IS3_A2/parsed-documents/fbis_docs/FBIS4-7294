The Bank is under pressure to implement its identified projects. At the recent Conference on Subregional Economic Cooperation, infrastructure and energy were high on the agendas of the Mekong countries, and ADB had hoped to play a landmark role in funding the massive amounts of investment required. Given the loan squeeze, the Bank, rather than playing `family doctor' was forced to fund many white elephant projects. "The Bank as an institution must move beyond the traditional private sector `window' and explore innovative mechanisms for public-private partnerships, and find effective ways to link technical project information to the investment decisions of enterprises," ADB's President Mitsuo Sato told the heads of the six nation delegation from Cambodia, China, Myanmar [Burma], Laos, Thailand and Vietnam at the Third Conference on Mekong sub-regional economic cooperation last week in Hanoi. Sato also urged greater responsibility on the part of regional governments in finding unilateral and collective approaches to regulatory, legal and institutional bottlenecks in order to attract massive private sector investment in so-called "hard side" projects like transport and energy development. He stressed that "soft side" economic cooperation, (chiefly energy management coordination), though hardest to implement, must be simultaneously addressed along with "hard side" cooperation. The reorientation of the Bank's policy to seek private sector help in regional development stemmed mainly from tightening budget control. The private funding is needed, however, to help share in its lending which this year reached more than US$ 10 billion for infrastructure projects in the Mekong region. The Bank's 1993 annual report, released last week, said the ADB members should widen the private sector's role in infrastructure projects, expected to soar to one trillion dollars by 2000. Beyond 2000, the private sector's funding of the subregional projects will account for 70 percent of investment in the region. The Bank's Programs Director (West) Noritada Morita said in an exclusive interview with The Nation that the role of the private sector in financing these projects in the future will be formidable, and greatly complement the Bank's funding options. With increasing private sector involvement, Morita said, the Bank's role is to continue to provide technical information and to act as a middle agent to meet the needs of each country in the Mekong region. Morita also shared widely held concerns about the possible negative effects of private sector involvement in subregional economic development, especially concerning the impact of development on societies and the environment. He said the responsibility lies on each government to control potential environmental damage caused by private sector involvement. Governments, he said, should provide tax privileges and other incentives for sound environmental policies on the part of the private sector. "It is very difficult to say. Ability to combat environmental abuse depends on the maturity of the society the government and the public," he said. The Bank has come under pressure from traditional donors, in particular the United States, who are looking to channel financial resources to other emerging areas besides the Mekong subregion. Nevertheless, the Bank's 55-member agency was able to defend its proposed capital increase from US$14 to 28 billion this year, with the aid of Japan. The Bank is committed to conducting a basic reform of both its structure and policy to weed out the bad projects and raise lending criteria. The Bank has been criticized for unsuccessful projects. About 20 percent of ADB projects, mostly in infrastructure, have been unsuccessful, although it still rates well in comparison to similar institutions. Morita, echoing Sato's policy, said the Bank was devising a new lending strategy incorporating environmental provisions into funding eligibility requirements. A blueprint of the Bank's restructuring is expected to be completed by the end of this year. Among the "soft side" projects proposed at last week's conference was the proposed creation of an environmental forum to engage policy makers and private agencies to address environmental concerns and formulate regional standards for environmental regulations. It also included the setting up of a working committee on trade to look into ways to harmonize trade and tariff codes which have impeded cross border economic cooperation. Morita described the meeting as extremely successful, as participating countries were not only be able to show their readiness to take part in the "hard side" of economic cooperation, namely transport and energy sectors, but also an increased willingness to cooperate on the "soft," but harder to implement, side of economic cooperation. An official attending the conference expressed caution, however. "Some projects are designed to make the Bank look good and to please donors but did not really address demands of lenders," the official commented. The official said that while there was an increasing concern for environmental degradation in the subregion, not all participating countries are ready to join hands, and some preferred that it be addressed at the national level. The failure of the delegations from Cambodia, Thailand and Vietnam to deal with off-shore disputes regarding oil and gas production demonstrated that certain sensitive areas exist which defy resolution by the conference. Morita, however, said the Bank's success should not be measured by the number of projects that were agreed upon by participating countries. "Our success is in helping small countries sustain economic growth and development, in helping these countries reform their economies, and in making the private sector more active. Ultimately we are striving [to] reduce poverty in the region," he said.
