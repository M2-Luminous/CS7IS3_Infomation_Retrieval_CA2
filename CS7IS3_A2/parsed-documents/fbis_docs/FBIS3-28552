Kim, in Hong Kong on his way home from a 10-day tour to Sweden, Norway and Denmark, told foreign reporters here that the two heads of state should meet in Seoul or Pyongyang as soon as possible to end their hostility and distrust, and instead open a new era of cooperation and reconciliation. A meeting between the leaders of the capitalist South and communist North itself would be significant, the long-time opposition leader said. Kim, chairman of the private think tank on Korean unification and Asian democratization, made it clear that he had no intention of meeting North Korean leaders before the summit nor did he wish to return to politics.
