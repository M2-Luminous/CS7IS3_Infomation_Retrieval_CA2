He said that both parties acknowledged their positions during the meeting. The conditions of Azerbaijan remained the same: cease-fire must be preceded by withdrawal of Armenian armed units from the territory of Azerbaijan. Until now this problem is left unsolved. Isazade mentioned that presently the representatives of Defense Ministries of both countries maintain contacts. The terms of the truce and withdrawal of troops will be defined at the forthcoming meeting of the Presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan. The functions will be divided as follows: Azerbaijan will have to cease hostilities along the whole front line, Armenia will have to leave all occupied territories of Azerbaijan outside of Nagorno-Karabakh, Russia will have to observe the implementation of the concluded agreements. The fate of Shusha and Lachin is unknown. This problem is expected to be settled during the forthcoming meeting of the presidents of Azerbaijan and Armenia in Moscow. Having occupied the biggest in Nagorno-Karabakh Azeri city of Shusha, in May 1992, Armenian units completed the process of ethnic cleansing in the region. Having seized neighbouring with Shusha and Gorisskiy region of Armenia, Lachin town, Armenian units received the corridor connecting Nagorno-Karabakh with Armenia.
