Long queues were seen at 31 sub-branches and 44 automatic teller machines of the BOC Hong Kong branch throughout the territory. Many of them started waiting for their turns at midnight. "It's very memorable," an old customer told reporters in the BOC tower with the new banknotes in his hands. Speaking at the celebration ceremony, Wang Qiren, chairman of the directors board of the BOC, described the issuance as "a very significant event for BOC throughout its over 80 years of operation" and "an important occasion in the economic life of Hong Kong". "BOC's participation in note-issuing indicates China's confidence in the future of Hong Kong and the bank's readiness to undertake, with its strength and reputation, the responsibility for Hong Kong's smooth transition," Wang said. "As one of the note issuing banks, bank of China will operate strictly in accordance with the financial laws and regulations of Hong Kong and, along with the Hongkong Bank and the Standard Chartered Bank, continue to play its part for the monetary stability and development of Hong Kong," he said. Citing an old Chinese saying: The ability of horse is known by travelling far and the faithfulness of a person is revealed by the lapse of time, he said, "ever since its establishment, Bank of China has always followed its objective of taking root in Hong Kong and rendering services in Hong Kong." "For a long time," he said, "the bank has actively contributed to maintaining the stability and prosperity of Hong Kong and has won the confidence and trust of the public. By the same token, our issue of banknotes has also received extensive support from the local community." Wang said the issue of Hong Kong dollar notes by Bank of China, from planning to official circulation took only 20 months to complete. This speedy process has been made possible through the great support and cooperation given by many related parties in Hong Kong and in the mainland. He expressed, on behalf of Bank of China head office, heartfelt gratitude to all those who have rendered their great support towards the issue of new banknotes.
