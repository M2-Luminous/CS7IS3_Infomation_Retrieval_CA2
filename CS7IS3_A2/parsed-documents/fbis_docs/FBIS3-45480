Last year, the province conscientiously implemented the guideline laid down by the central authorities on intensifying macroeconomic regulation and control. All the projects under construction were sorted out and rearranged in order of priority, and resources and funds were pooled together to support selected key projects. In 1993, all the fixed asset investment projects completed by enterprises in the province involved a total value of 25.3 billion yuan, an increase of 33.8 percent over the previous year. Of this investment value, capital construction investments shared 13.5 billion yuan, an increase of 36.6 percent; and technological transformation and equipment updating projects shared 8 billion yuan, an increase of 36.6 percent. It is expected that the investment value of completed local-run investment projects will have reached 15.6 billion yuan by year's end, accounting for 61.8 percent of the total investment value. As far as the power industry is concerned, the year 1993 witnessed the province's largest ever scale of projects under construction and the highest ever amount of investment funds involved. The value of completed investments in the power industry totaled 1.56 billion yuan, total installed power generating capacity increased by 505,000 kilowatt-hours, thus raising the province's total installed power generating capacity to 8,135,000 kilowatt- hours and ranking the province seventh in the country. The province also made great progress in expanding its communication facilities. By the end of last year, the province's total length of highways open to traffic amounted to 45,000 km, and the per-unit-area distribution of highways was 26.48 km per square km, ranking the province eighth among other provinces in the country. The province's total length of local railroads open to traffic was 1,710 km, ranking the province first in the country. Smooth progress has been made in the construction of the Zhengzhou- Kaifeng-Luoyang expressway project, the leading one of the province's 10 key projects designated by the provincial government as part of its plan to expedite the process of reform and opening up. A section of this highway--the northern part of the Kaifeng- Zhengzhou section--has been completed and is about to be officially opened to traffic. Meanwhile, 79.2 percent of the earthwork to build the roadbed of the Zhengzhou-Xinzheng expressway has been completed. The Huang He bridge at Sanmenxia which links Henan and Shanxi provinces was already opened to traffic by the end of last year. The province also made breakthroughs in water conservancy capital construction. With regard to the two major projects to divert the water of the Huang He to Yuzhai in Xinshan and to Dafeng, more than 20 million cubic meters of earth digging work was completed last year as part of the main canal construction, and 85 related sub- projects were completed. Now the basic requirements have been fulfilled to enable the two projects to be put into primary operation by the end of the 1990's. The Huai He harnessing project has been progressing smoothly; by the end of last year 20 related projects had been launched, and the annual investment plans for all these projects were completed. In 1993, the province made major progress in the development of postal and telecommunication services. A total of 447,000 local telephone lines and 10,490 long-distance direct-dial telephone lines were newly installed. Meanwhile, the Beijing-Zhengzhou-Guangzhou optical fiber cable laying project has been completed and put into operation, 2,000 km of local second-class trunk-line optical fiber cable has been laid, and 266 km of microwave telecommunication line has been put into use. Telephone service at and above the prefectural and city level in this province is now operated on a program controlled basis. Cities above the county level now enjoy automatically connecting telephone service, and the central town of most counties enjoys long-distance direct-dialing telephone service. In addition, mobile phone and telephone paging services have been developing very rapidly. And a high-tech modern postal and telecommunication service network with a large capacity is in the making in the province.
