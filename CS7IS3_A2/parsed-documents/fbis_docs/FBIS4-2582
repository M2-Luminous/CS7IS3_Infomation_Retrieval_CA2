African April Elections"] [Text] Johannesburg, April 11 (XINHUA) -- A showdown might come out this week among South Africa's chief political players over the situation in the eastern South African province of Natal, the kwaZulu homeland in particular. President F. W. de Klerk, African National Congress (ANC) President Nelson Mandela, Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini and Inkatha Freedom Party President Mangosuthu Buthelezi held a crisis summit on April 8 on the situation in Natal and the adjoining kwaZulu homeland. The Zulu king declared independence of the `Zulu Kingdom' on March 18 and called on the Zulu people to boycott South Africa's first non-racial elections scheduled on April 26-28. The government and the ANC tried to persuade the king to drop his claim in exchange for a guarantee for the accommodation of the Zulu king position in the new constitution. However, they did not reach any agreement at the summit except establishing a working group to deliberate on various proposals and report back to the respective leaders on April 14. This week is considered crucial for the April 26-28 elections as the time is short for more talks and various preparations. Observers here are suspicious very much on the results of the second meeting of the four leaders due this week. They do not believe the Zulu king, with the support of Buthelezi, who is also chief minister of the kwaZulu homeland government, will change his position in such a short period. And, his demands are far beyond the government or the ANC to be able to meet. On the contrary, the observers believe the kwaZulu homeland might face an intensified security crackdown if the last gasp talks this week fail to produce a breakthrough in the electoral impasse. There are widespread fears that violence in Natal Province might soar if the working group fails to produce any concrete result. There is deep pessimism in both the government and the ANC circles over the prospects of this week's talks between the four leaders. `Even if we manage to reach agreement in the working group -- which is possible -- it appears that it will be blocked by the Inkatha Freedom Party leadership,' said a senior government official. Mandela expressed his intention to meet with the Zulu king again after their talks on April 8. But the king has not responded by now. With the failure of the four-way crisis summit on April 8, it is understood that security measures will be considerably intensified in Natal Province if tension there continues to lead to bloodshed. This week is also crucial to the kwaZulu homeland and the Zulu monarchy. The low-key civil war raging in the region could escalate and become out of control. Constitutional Development Minister Roelf Meyer said yesterday about 60 percent of Natal's inhabitants would be able to participate freely in the elections, but the Inkatha Freedom Party supporters are scaring people away from the elections. Meyer warned that if the elections were postponed, the future of the country would be determined by radical elements of the left and the right, and that a Bosnian-style situation would appear in South Africa. People in South Africa are watching the development of the situation in the country with great concern and care.
