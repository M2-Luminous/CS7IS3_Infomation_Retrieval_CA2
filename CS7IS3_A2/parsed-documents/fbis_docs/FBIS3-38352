FBIS3-38352 "drweu022__a94019" FBIS-WEU-94-022-A Document Type:Daily Report 2 February 1994 ANNEX United Kingdom Hurd Letter Responds to Editorial on Pergau PM3101133894 London THE TIMES in English 31 Jan 94 p 15--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY PM3101133894 London THE TIMES Language: English Article Type:BFN [Letter from Douglas Hurd, secretary of state for foreign and Commonwealth affairs: "Hurd Replies to Pergau Dam Critics"] [Text] Sir, You made sweeping allegations of illegality over the Pergau hydroelectric project in your editorial of January 19, headed "Dam deceit." In your editorial of January 28, "Alms and arms," you no longer do this. But the new ground of attack is just as flawed. The Foreign Affairs Committee soon will review expenditure on Pergau and our Aid and Trade Provision [ATP]. I do not, therefore, intend to go into the details here. The Prime Minister and I have already made clear our position in the House of Commons. But to correct the latest suggestions: 1. The formal offer of ATP support for Pergau was made in April 1989, not as you suggest only a month after the Memorandum of Understanding on Defence Procurement was signed in September 1988. The companies' application was first lodged in November 1988. The final decision was taken in February 1991. 2. Pergau is only one of 23 development projects in Malaysia which we have supported with ATP since the scheme was introduced by the Labour Government in 1977. 3. ATP has not been used at any stage for projects in Malaysia covered by the 1988 memorandum. The Malaysian Government regard the Pergau project as important for their country's economic development and the diversification of its energy resources. Our aid has helped to build a relationship which has brought benefits to both countries. These have included a large increase in British exports -- one of the acknowledged objectives of the Aid and Trade Provision. Our exports to Malaysia rose to almost 900 million pounds last year, nearly three times the 1988 figure. On the separate issue of the defence relationship, we have long been partners of Malaysia in the Five Power Defence Arrangements. It is right that we have been and continue to be ready to help Malaysia to acquire the equipment which it needs for its armed forces. None of this has been done under the aid programme. I find extraordinary the argument that Britain is wrong to pursue defence sales overseas within the rules which we have laid down. Developed and developing countries alike should have the right to buy the equipment which they need for their defence or for peacekeeping, provided that national and international laws are observed. Malaysia is a friendly and peaceable Commonwealth country. Exports made a big contribution to the success of Britain's defence industry. You suggest that our decision on Pergau threatens Britain's reputation for plain dealing. That is nonsense. ATP is a recognised form of aid, covered by OECD guidelines to which we adhere. If we had failed to honour our commitment to the Pergau project, then indeed our reputation for plain dealing would have suffered--and British interests with it. Yours faithfully, DOUGLAS HURD, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London SW1. January 29.
