FR940804-0-00005 FR940804-0-00002 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Parts 36 and 91 [Docket No. 25109] RIN 2120&hyph;AC22 Civil Supersonic Airplane Noise Type Certification Standards and Operating Rules AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Statement of policy. SUMMARY: This document provides a statement of Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) policy concerning noise limits for future civil supersonic airplanes (SST). The FAA is withdrawing a previously published Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) that proposed to amend the regulations regarding type certification noise limits of these airplanes. This document supplements the withdrawal of the proposed rule. EFFECTIVE DATE: August 4, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Laurette Fisher, Policy and Regulatory Division (AEE&hyph;300), Office of Environment and Energy, Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20591, telephone (202) 267&hyph;3561. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In 1990, the FAA proposed to amend the type certification noise standards and noise operating rules for future-generation civil supersonic airplanes. After analyzing the comments received on the NPRM, the FAA determined that further investigation and research is necessary before a final rule can be developed. The withdrawal of that NPRM its published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register . Although the proposed rule is being withdrawn, the FAA has not changed its policy on noise issues involving the development of future-generation civil supersonic airplanes. Policy Statement While it is premature at this time to issue a final rule establishing the specific noise standard for such supersonic airplanes, it is important to reiterate the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) commitment to aviation's longstanding efforts to achieve increasingly effective noise abatement at its source. Consequently, it is anticipated that any future Notice of Proposed Rulemaking issued by FAA would propose that any future SST airplane shall produce no greater noise impact on a community than a subsonic airplane certified to Stage 3 noise limits. As such, the noise limits prescribed in 14 CFR part 36, Stage 3 may be used as guidelines for the development of any future SST airplane. This is consistent with the recommendation recently added to Chapter 4 of the International Civil Aviation Organization's Annex 16, Volume I, that states that Chapter 3 noise levels applicable to subsonic airplanes may be used as guidelines for future SST airplanes. Provisions for the noise certification of future SST airplanes will be developed giving consideration, to the extent possible, to the unique operational flight characteristics of future SST designs. Issued in Washington, DC on July 29, 1994. Paul R. Dykeman, Acting Director of Environment and Energy. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;18904 Filed 8&hyph;3&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;13&hyph;M
