(KHI, President, Hiroshi Oba) has developed a functionally gradient material (FGM) which endures temperatures of up to 1,600� C which they intend to apply to components of gas turbine engines. This new zirconia/titanium aluminum-based FGM was made to resist extremely high temperature by creating a very special composition of zirconia on the surface which gets exposed to high temperatures. Traditionally, 1,400� C has been considered the maximum temperature materials such as nickel alloy can resist. KHI succeeded in improving the heat resistance by 200� C by making the joining boundary of thermal insulation and cooling structural materials into a gradient structure. KHI will present a paper on this subject at a June meeting of the Japan Institute of Metals. The increases in performance required in gas turbine engines and the engines intended for use in hyper/super-sonic aircraft have spurred the search for new heat resistant materials that can consistently endure higher temperatures. Engine manufacturers around the world have been striving to commercialize gas turbine engines now that gradient structural materials are being applied to thermal insulation/forced cooling structures that maintain stable temperatures with little load on the cooling system. KHI intends to use their newly developed FGM able to endure temperatures of 1,600� C for components of gas turbine engines. They expect to market it within the next two to three years. KHI has established the long awaited thermal insulation design method which has been demonstrated under actual environmental conditions. KHI also has developed expertise on destruction mechanisms for relaxation of thermal stress/material design. KHI's latest commercialization plan is based on accumulation of these basic technological accomplishments. Successful marketing requires that engineering requirements are met precisely, an objective KHI has achieved. KHI, together with the Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute, also has for some time been promoting development of an electric insulation FGM for components for nuclear fusion reactors. They have produced a pipe-shaped stainless/zirconia/stainless prototype 30mm in diameter. Ceramic is sandwiched between metals which can be welded with other metal materials outside. The compositional transition between the ceramic and the metals is gradual, thus achieving a new gradient functions of electric property and weldability. This is the first material created whose composition changes gradually on both sides of the material. This joint research group now is developing larger aperture pipes of 150mm diameter. KHI is confident that they now are at the stage at which FGM is ready for practical application, and therefore plan to vigorously pursue its commercial potential.
