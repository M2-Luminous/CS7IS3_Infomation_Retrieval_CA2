This is a happy occasion. Everyone is so upbeat. What will the Egyptian people gain from the Egyptian-Chinese friendship? [Musa] The talks were held in an excellent atmosphere of cooperation, friendship, and trust. Egypt and China are going through the same phase of economic development. In addition, the two countries share a common view of a number of international developments and problems. We discussed international problems of common concern. We went into detail on various problems in the Arab world, Asia, Africa, and other parts of the world. We also discussed GATT and the current international economic situation. We then discussed the issue of economic development and talked about the difficulties and successes experienced by the two countries. We reviewed ways of bolstering bilateral economic ties. We discussed investment opportunities in Egypt and the advantages of using the Egyptian tax-free zones. We talked about industrial and technical cooperation. We then signed two agreements concerning investment guarantees and judicial cooperation, all of which will propel Egyptian-Chinese relations into wider horizons, particularly considering the feelings of trust and friendship shared by the leaderships of both countries. President Mubarak, at the end of the talks, invited the Chinese president to visit Egypt in the near future. This visit will take place soon. Egyptian-Chinese relations should take a high profile, one that befits their promise. The Egyptian and Chinese civilizations are very ancient, as old as history itself. Cooperation between our countries will be fruitful in the cultural, political, economic, and popular sense of the word. [Correspondent] Did the leaders hold private talks before the delegations met, Your Excellency? [Musa] The talks began with a private meeting between the two leaders followed by a session in which both delegations took part. Tomorrow I will meet the Chinese foreign minister to discuss with him a number of matters concerning bilateral cooperation and political and economic ties. [Correspondent] Have you discussed [words indistinct] as Somalia, Bosnia-Herzegovina? [Musa] Of course, we discussed all of these matters. President Husni Mubarak, who is the current OAU chairman, broached a number of African problems, including Somalia and the situation in South Africa, in view of the progress recently made in the latter country. We also reviewed the situation in the Arab world, the peace process, the situation in a number of Arab countries, the general Arab situation, and several international problems including Bosnia- Herzegovina. [Correspondent] Are there any specific topics that President Mubarak plans to discuss tomorrow with Chinese officials? [Musa] Yes, the talks will focus on bilateral relations and economic cooperation. Trade between Egypt and China amounts to $200 million. We import $140 million worth of goods from China and export $60 million. Of course, this situation cannot continue. The private sector should assume its role in this matter. China is opening up its economy, so are we. Trade and economy can no longer be shoved under the carpet. [Correspondent] Thank you.
