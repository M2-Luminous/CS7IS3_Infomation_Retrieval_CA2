FR940302-0-00003 FR940302-0-00001 Although the effects would be minimal, the entities that may be most affected by this rule include U.S. potato producers, importers, and processing plants. Although it is not possible to determine the total number of entities within these categories which can be classified as small entities, over 64 percent of all potato growers and 94 percent of U.S. fruit and vegetable processing firms could be considered small by Small Business Administration guidelines. The negative impact on U.S. producers due to increased imports is likely to be small since U.S. prices are more influenced by domestic production and market conditions than by imports. Any negative impact is likely to be offset by a positive impact upon importers, exporters, potato processing firms, and consumers. The increased availability of Canadian potatoes will benefit potato farmers, shippers, importers, wholesalers, and retailers as well as potato processing firms. Consumers will be positively affected by slightly lowered prices. Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Executive Order 12778 This rule allows potatoes to be imported into the United States from Canada. State and local laws and regulations regarding potatoes imported under this rule will be preempted while the vegetable is in foreign commerce. Fresh potatoes are generally imported for immediate distribution and sale to the consuming public, and will remain in foreign commerce until sold to the ultimate consumer. The question of when foreign commerce ceases in other cases must be addressed on a case-by-case basis. No retroactive effect will be given to this rule; and this rule will not require administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court challenging this rule.
