Asked by TANJUG what the EU, which is currently chaired by Greece, planned to do following the U.S. initiative for a Moslem-Croat federation in Bosnia, Papoulias said Europe would come out with its own ideas on how to resolve the crisis. Acting under strong pressure from Washington, Bosnian Moslem and Croat officials met in Washington on Tuesday to sign a preliminary deal on forming a binational federation, which would subsequently form confederate ties with neighbouring Croatia. Washington's idea is to use the binational federation manoeuvre to enable the Moslems to preserve the integrity of Bosnia, expand the territory under their control, give them access to the sea and, finally, create a strong negotiating (and possibly military) bloc against the Serbs. In Cairo, Papoulias met Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak for talks on various issues, including Bosnia-Herzegovina, but he did not elaborate on that point. Egypt has cautiously welcomed the Moslem-Croat rapprochement under Washington's auspices, but the government-controlled press has been writing over the past few days the latest developments clearly indicate that Bosnia will be divided and that its days in the present shape are numbered. Bosnian Serbs, who were not invited to the talks in Washington, formed their own republic in 1992 in their ethnic and historical territories.
