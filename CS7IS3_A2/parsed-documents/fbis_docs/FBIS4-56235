The most salient issue discussed by the ministers during their four-and-a- half-hour meeting was the end of the rearmed saga on 15 April with the demobilization of the 3-80 Northern Front [FN 3- 80]. In this regard, Government Minister Alfredo Mendieta commented on the details of the disarmament plan and the reintegration into civilian life of the former FN 3-80 combatants. Minister Mendieta also reported on the recently implemented Operation Triangle. As for a plan against criminal gangs operating in northern and central Nicaragua, the ministers were not only briefed on actions by the National Police and the Sandinist People's Army, but on the determination of the Chamorro administration to complement them with legal actions. In regard to the relations between the Executive and Legislative Branches, the ministers engaged in ample discussion on an agreement signed between the two on 12 March in which they recognize that the two branches must reach a consensus on the various laws that affect national life. They also had a broad discussion on an agreement reached between government authorities and the top military leadership on the Code of Military Organization, Jurisdiction, and Social Security. As for the economy, President Chamorro and Minister Lacayo instructed the ministers to switch their focus from macroeconomic to microeconomic aspects to uncover bureaucratic red tape and make official procedures easier for the population, especially those related to basic services such as health, energy, electricity, and customs.
