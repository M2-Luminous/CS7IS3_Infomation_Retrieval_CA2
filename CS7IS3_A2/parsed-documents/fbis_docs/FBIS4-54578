"Despite their promises, those who govern you, who have not overcome their fear of the links which exist between you and I, are not allowing me to celebrate Easter with you, in Timisoara," the former king said in a message to Romanians. The 72-year-old former king said he felt bitter that his country's leaders were "upholding the unjust decision" taken more than 40 years ago. The king was forced to abdicate in 1947 and the communist regime took away his Romanian citizenship a year later. On Thursday, the former king said too many "restrictive conditions" had been imposed on him by the Romanian authorities for him to be able to visit. "My fate is in your hands. My return to my country depends on each and every one of you," he said in his message. He had not lost hope of being able to return to Romania, he added. Since the Romanian revolution in 1989, the former king, who lives in exile in Switzerland, has only once been allowed to return to Romania, for Easter 1992. He was welcomed by large crowds. The government was on Friday criticised by certain sections of the Romanian press, who said it had no respect for people's rights when those rights conflicted with its interests. The authorities imposed a series of conditions on the former king's proposed visit and insisted that he go to a town other than Timisoara, the place where the 1989 revolution began and whose mayor is a member of the opposition. Presidential spokesman Traian Chebeleu said the authorities had shown good will and had no responsibility for the cancellation of the visit. The authorities' refusal to allow the former king to attend festivities last December caused a political storm and the opposition boycotted official celebrations in protest.
