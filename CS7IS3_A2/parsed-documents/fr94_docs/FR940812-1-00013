FR940812-1-00013 FR940812-1-00004 Section 400.155(d) is amended to clarify that day care as an allowable service means day care for children. Section 400.155(f) is amended by stipulating that translation and interpreter services are allowable when necessary for participation in a service and when such translation and interpreter services are not available from any other source. Section 400.155(g) which permitted the provision of case management services as an allowable nonemployment-related service is removed. We believe that the use of refugee program funds should be limited only to the provision of case management services that are related to the obtainment of employment. Section 400.155(h) is redesignated as ยง400.155(g) and revised by removing title XX social services from the list of allowable services under refugee social services and by adding, as an allowable service subject to the approval of the Director of ORR, any additional service aimed at strengthening the ability of refugee individuals, families, and refugee communities to achieve and maintain economic self-sufficiency, family stability, and community integration. An example of an allowable service under this provision would be the provision of technical assistance and organizational development training to strengthen the capability of refugee mutual assistance associations to provide employment-related and other services to refugees. Section 400.156 is amended by revising the heading to read ``Service requirements'' and by amending ยง400.156(b) to clarify that, in planning services, States must take into account the reception and placement (R & P) services provided by resettlement agencies in order to ensure the provision of seamless, coordinated services to refugees that are not duplicative. Section 400.156 is also amended by adding new requirements that States must implement to the maximum extent feasible: (1) English language instruction must be provided in a concurrent, rather than sequential, time period with employment or with other employment-related services; (2) services must be provided through a separate refugee-specific service system rather than a system in which refugees are only one of many client groups served; (3) services must be provided in a manner that is culturally and linguistically compatible with a refugee's language and cultural background; and (4) services must be provided in a manner that includes the use of bilingual/bicultural women on service agency staffs to ensure adequate service access by refugee women. Providing services in a manner that is culturally and linguistically compatible means that an agency providing services funded under this part must employ or contract with staff who: (1) Speak the native language of and (2) are either from the same ethnic background as, or are culturally knowledgeable of, the refugee populations the agency serves. Subpart J_Federal Funding Sections 400.203 and 400.204 are amended by clarifying that Federal funding is available for the cash and medical assistance programs described in these sections only to the extent that sufficient funds are appropriated. We have added this clarification in light of the steady decline in Federal refugee funding for the State share of aid to families with dependent children (AFDC), supplemental security income (SSI), Medicaid, and general assistance (GA) which began in FY 1986 and has resulted since FY 1991 in no ORR reimbursement to States for the State share of these programs due to insufficient appropriated funds. Section 400.206 is amended by changing the heading to ``Federal funding for social services and targeted assistance services'' and by adding a paragraph on Federal funding for targeted assistance services. Section 400.207 is revised to clarify that Federal funding is available for reasonable and identifiable administrative costs of providing only those assistance and service programs for which Federal funding is currently made available under the refugee program. Thus Federal funding under 45 CFR part 400 is not available at this time for administrative costs related to the provision of AFDC, Medicaid, GA, or SSI to refugees. This section is further revised to limit the administrative costs that a State may claim to those costs that are determined to be reasonable and allowable as defined by the Administration for Children and Families. Section 400.210 is revised to clarify time limits for obligating and expending funds as well as for submitting final financial reports on expenditures of CMA grants and social service and targeted assistance grants. Subpart J is amended to prohibit the use of funds under this part for travel outside the United States, without the written approval of the Director. Subpart K_Waivers Subpart K is amended by revising the heading to read ``Waivers and Withdrawals'' and by revising ยง400.300 to allow for a more flexible waiver policy in keeping with Executive Order No. 12875, issued on October 26, 1993, which calls for increased flexibility for State and local waivers. In addition, a new ยง400.301 is added which requires that if a State decides to cease participation in the refugee program, the State must provide 120 days advance notice to the Director before withdrawing from the program. Section 400.301 clarifies that in order to participate in the refugee program, a State is expected to operate all components of the refugee program. In the event that a State wishes to retain responsibility for only part of the refugee program, it must obtain prior approval from the Director of ORR. Such approval will be granted only under extraordinary circumstances and if it is in the best interest of the Government. Section 400.301 also provides that when a State withdraws from all or part of the refugee program, the Director may authorize a replacement designee or designees to administer the provision of assistance and/or services, as appropriate, to refugees in that State. Pursuant to the statutory authority in 412(c)(1)(A) and 412(e)(1) of the INA to provide grants to, and contracts with, public or private nonprofit agencies for services, cash assistance, and medical assistance to refugees, the Director may authorize a designee to administer the refugee program in place of a State when the State chooses not to participate in the refugee program. This authority is different from the statutory authority in 412(e)(7) of the INA which permits the Director to authorize the development and implementation of alternative projects under the Fish/Wilson program.
