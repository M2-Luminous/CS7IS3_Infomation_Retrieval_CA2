He regards these declaration as campaign tricks. In his view, the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] cannot achieve a worse result at the elections than second place. [Zsoldos] In view of the latest opinion polls, do you see any chance of a stable government coalition after the elections? [Kuncze] The opinion polls reflect trends. The election results will really show the coalition possibilities. With this restriction, my opinion is that there is a chance for a stable coalition after the elections. [Zsoldos] Mutual exclusions could be heard from various political parties during the election campaign. The Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] excluded the possibility of a coalition with the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] and the SZDSZ under the current leadership; the MDF had a similar position regarding the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP]. The Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz] rejected the idea of a government coalition with the MSZP. These are only a few examples. Have the parties not narrowed their scope too much before the elections? [Kuncze] Most of these exclusions are not more than campaign tricks. It is not worth dealing with them too much. These positions of the current government parties show that they would like to be in the opposition after the elections. They should not be hindered in this. [Zsoldos] In other words, you would not take it for granted that these positions will last long? [Kuncze] I do not generally take anything for granted, particularly not political issues. [Zsoldos] There have been conflicts between the SZDSZ and the Fidesz lately, but you said that there are no unbridgeable differences of views between the two parties. Is it true? [Kuncze] That is true. [Zsoldos] Do you not regard the fact that the Fidesz excludes the possibility of a coalition with the MSZP while the SZDSZ does not exclude such a possibility as such an unbridgeable difference? [Kuncze] The SZDSZ does not exclude the possibility of coalition with any democratic party, and I do not know of any such official position on the part of the Fidesz. Viktor Orban generally speaks about this in his own name. [Zsoldos] Among other things, the SZDSZ focused its campaign on doing everything in its power for the best possible results of the liberal bloc and on making sure that a stable government coalition will emerge after the elections. Which of these two goals do you regard as more important? [Kuncze] I think it is important for the liberal parties to achieve good results, but it is also important that, aware of the election results, the SZDSZ should examine the possibilities of coalition agreements. It is not justified now to set up an importance list. I will know the real possibilities in a few days. Let us wait until then. [Zsoldos] Many people say, including the government parties, that the SZDSZ might disintegrate if it forms a coalition with a strong MSZP. [Kuncze] Who said that the SZDSZ would form a coalition with a strong MSZP? Nor did anyone say that the SZDSZ would form a coalition with the MSZP at all. At the moment, all I can say is that we should wait for the election results. [Zsoldos] What guarantees will the SZDSZ ask in exchange for its willingness to participate in the government coalition? [Kuncze] We have already published our position, in which we formulated the coalition guidelines in 25 points. We will stick to these guidelines. [Zsoldos] Could it be a guarantee that, in a given circumstance, the SZDSZ will provide the prime minister? [Kuncze] The SZDSZ is not striving to achieve good results at the elections. If our hopes come true, we will consider this. This is only natural.
