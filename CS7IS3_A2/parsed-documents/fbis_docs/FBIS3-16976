Kovalyov said that a working group has prepared a draft resolution on the application of the amnesty resolution. He did not rule out the possibility that the draft may be submitted to the Duma on Friday. "The idea of the document is to specify the provisions which may be interpreted in different ways. Particularly, the draft stipulates that the amnesty resolution shall not stop legal proceedings instituted against those who committed criminal offences during the August 1991, May 1993 and October 1993 events which were not directly connected with these events," Kovalyov said. In accordance with this provision, marauders who plundered the parliament building during the October revolt in Moscow or thieves will not be amnestied. "Only those are subject to amnesty whose actions were in the cause-effect relation with the political events in August, May and October," Kovalyov explained. He noted that the draft resolution is the result of agreement between all participants in the work on it, including deputies, representatives of the public prosecutor's office, the ministries of justice and foreign affairs and presidential representatives.
