In the past, that has made it possible to save substantially on the development of satellites that are more advanced, primarily photoreconnaissance satellites. If the Americans spent more than $100 million on launching a heavy "spy," the heaviest Soviet launch vehicle, Proton, cost 40 million. In addition, recon satellites themselves were initially created on the basis of the Gagarin Vostok, were placed in orbit by the medium R-7 Vostok rocket, were manufactured at a plant in series production, and were very inexpensive. They were launched and forgotten, as it were. Within a week or so, you get a capsule with photographic film. All the enemy's intrigues as if they were on the palm of your hand. The R-7 rocket, the "Golden No. 7," was developed by the Podlipkinsk-based OKB-1 [Special Design Bureau-1] under the guidance of S. P. Korolev and V. P. Mishin. That's where they started working on the modest Zenits. In 1963, domestic, series-produced, first-generation reconnaissance satellites went on line. And then No. 7 and the Zenits and some other things were transferred to the Kuybyshev branch of OKB-1. Now it's the Samara-based Central Specialized Design Bureau. Academician D. I. Kozlov heads it. Beginning in 1957, various versions of the R-7 rocket lifted off from Baykonur and Plesetsk and placed all the Vostoks and Soyuzes and a good many Kosmoses -- peaceful as well as not so peaceful -- into orbit. But time passed, and eventually seven tons, the maximum lifting capacity of that rocket, wasn't enough for the developers of space vehicles. But the 20 tons of the Proton was a bit too much. In the mid-1970's, specialists from the Moscow Central Scientific Research Institute of Machine Building, apparently not wanting to part with the traditional No. 7's, put out the first rough sketches of the 77 rocket. Then that rocket became the well known Zenit. It could lift as much as 13 tons into orbit and was manufactured in Dnepropetrovsk at NPO Yuzhnoye. So it was a domestic rocket, and became exported. But the needs for lifting heavy payloads remained. At the present moment, the Central Specialized Design Bureau is working on the project for the Rus launch vehicle. It expects to use some of the elements of Zenit, primarily the control system, to substantially improve the characteristics of the veteran R-7 rocket, as well as increase the payload by half a ton. On the other hand, special requirements are being placed now on rockets in terms of ecology. So the R-7 is running on trivial kerosene and entirely safe oxygen, and, except for the mass of scrap in the drop zone for spent stages, it's not doing any particular harm to the environment. But the heavy Proton, as it slams into the ground, sprays around itself what is left of the unburned fuel -- nitrogen tetroxide and unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (correctly pronouncing those names is one of the principal habits of student rocket builders). Those horrible reddish-yellow chemicals do have one nice feature: their maximum allowable concentration in air is below the level of sensitivity. Roughly speaking, when a human finds himself in a nitrogen tetroxide-UDMH environment, he at first gasps for air and then begins to feel as if something doesn't smell right. That's why the Proton developers -- the staffers at the Khrunichev State Rocket-Space Center -- are making improvements on it at present. Before the end of this century, plans are to use the Proton M -- instead of the 21 tons of cargo, it will be able to delivery as much as 22.3 tons into low near-Earth orbit. But the main thing is that the new control system will make it possible to substantially reduce the drop zone for spent stages and to place them with almost "jeweler's precision." A special system will make it possible to combust the unused portions of fuel before the rocket falls to the ground. But that's all housekeeping business. On the world market, Lockheed-Khrunichev-Energiya International is representing the interests of the Proton developers. Whether M. Khrunichev, the people's commissar for the aviation industry, would have ever thought or guessed what loud company he would fall into, no one knows. But the company is not without success in moving the Protons to market. In late 1995, that rocket will place a communications satellite manufactured by the Space Systems/Loral firm into orbit; talks are also under way about the launch of four additional vehicles. Things are relatively easy for Proton -- there aren't that many rockets of that class in the world, and our "heavy lifter" faces competition from only perhaps the American Titan. But competing with the R-7 are the Ariane of the European Space Agency and a number of American mid-class rockets that are currently in use or are expected to be used. It would seem that everything is leading up to a real "cold war" breaking out in the space market at the turn of the century. But then... "Main European Rocket Firm About to Sign Agreement on Cooperation With Russian Rocket Builders!" is the kind of sensationalist headline that appeared in newspapers at the end of October. As it turns out, representatives of the Central Specialized Design Bureau and the Paris-based Aerospatiale, purposely not informing the public, are almost ready to sign the unprecedented contract. The firms are getting ready to develop a launch vehicle by 1996. The first stage is expected to be the first stage of the Samara Vostok; the Parisians will build the upper stage. As it is, the contract is not signed yet, but, in the words of the representatives of the two sides, recent difficulties have been overcome. "On the path to this program," declared Central Specialized Design Bureau Deputy General Designer G. Fomin, "there are no technical or any other obstacles." And he promised that he would launch a rocket from Plesetsk in 1996. And Vladimir Saygak, a Samara specialist in outside communications, praised the Moscow officials -- there are no impediments on the path of the new rocket. And the events of early October? "It took place in Moscow, not in Russia." It seems that the good old No. 7 will still be in service. Especially since the now foreign Zenit rocket is now handcuffed with large and small problems. On 4 October 1990, the 15th in the Zenit series blew up on the launch structure, eliminating one of Baykonur's pads. As it turns out, one of the sustainer engines broke down. Although launches have resumed since then, the pad is in ruins. The most recent Zenit lifted off on 16 September 1993. In December, the deputy general designer of Dnepropetrovsk's Yuzhnoye Design Bureau, Yu. Smetanin, said that his firm has orders to fill from the Russian government until 1995 -- at 3-5 rockets a year; after that, it's hard to say. Yuriy Smetanin complained about the politicians -- and the Russians are complaining about the Dnepropetrovskians, who are striving to convert their relationships with domestic buyers to a dollar basis. Again those dollars! We would hope that the Rus project will hold up no matter what and that the Russian space program will not be left with no reliable "cabs." Otherwise, things will be bad. After all, for recent launches to Mir, the launcher had to be taken from the arsenal of the space forces -- there weren't any others. And the arsenals of the space forces aren't made out of rubber.
