[Correspondent Magdalena Winiarczyk] The agreement, which has been signed for a three-year period, sets the conditions for legal employment. Any form of employment that does not comply with the principles of the agreement is illegal. The period of individual employment may not be longer than 12 months and, in exceptional circumstances, can be extended to 18 months. The pay and working conditions for foreign employees may not be worse than the conditions enjoyed by the citizens of each country. This is to prevent dumping practices. Social security, health care and legal protection are to be guaranteed by the employing country and are to be included in consular conventions. Work permits are to be issued by employment offices for specific employers and specific jobs. This principle also concerns applications for long-stay visas, which include work permits as well. Ministers Leszek Miller and Mykhaylo Kaskevych have also signed an agreement on cooperation in the area of labor and social policy between the two countries. [Announcer] Magdalena Winiarczyk was speaking from the Ministry of Labor for the Midday Magazine.
