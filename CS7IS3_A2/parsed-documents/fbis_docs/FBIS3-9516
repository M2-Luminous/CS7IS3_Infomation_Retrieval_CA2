Also on Monday, during his news conference, Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu said that, in practical terms, a PDSR-CDR [Democratic Convention of Romania] alliance is impossible. Shortly before that, PDSR leader Adrian Nastase also expressed skepticism as far as the effectiveness of the dialogue with the CDR is concerned. From a practical point of view, these declarations represent the official funeral of the PDSR-opposition dialogue. I say the official funeral because as a matter of fact, this dialogue died when the government reshuffle was announced. At that moment it became clear that the reshuffle would give a fatal blow to the delicate process of rapprochement between the PDSR and the opposition, first of all because the reshuffle defied one of the claims of the CDR and the Democratic Party (National Salvation Front) [PD(FSN)] -- not to remove Nicolae Spiroiu from the helm of the Ministry of National Defense -- and second, because the reshuffle took place in the middle of the dialogue that had just started between the PDSR and the opposition. The fact that the PDSR proceeded to a government reshuffle without even bothering to discuss it with the opposition represented clear proof that the openness toward the right wing was not taken seriously by Ion Iliescu's party. The idea of starting a dialogue between the PDSR and the opposition parties was received with great satisfaction and mainly with great hopes by the entire Romanian society. Taking into consideration the dispute between the PDSR and the nationalist-communist forces, the opening of this dialogue justified the belief in a major change at all levels of Romania's political life. While it was taking place, the dialogue enjoyed the support of independent politicians, journalists, and the public. A recent opinion poll by the IRSOP [Romanian Institute for Public Opinion Poll] shows that 60 percent of those who were questioned are in favor of a government that includes both the PDSR and the opposition. Taking into account also the possibility that this opinion poll, just like all the others made by the IRSOP so far, might be just a diversion, nevertheless the 60 percent rate shows us that Romania's population views the dialogue between the PDSR and the opposition favorably. The reason for the enthusiasm brought about by the opening of dialogue can be found in the complex reality currently prevailing in our country. It is clear that, in spite of all the propaganda declarations made by Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu and by some leaders of the ruling party, the serious effects of a political-economic bottleneck are being felt at all economic levels and by the whole society. This bottleneck is the result of a slow but continuous change within the ruling party. The PDSR started off as an antireformist party in the electoral campaign and won elections on this basis. Later the PDSR realized the domestic and international realities that are resolutely demanding the continuation of the reform. Even if it wanted to act differently, the ruling party could not oppose some serious but necessary decisions that have been taken in connection with increases in prices, unemployment, and in the fiscal area. Due to its move to the right, the ruling party came into contradiction with its allies. The current majority coalition is dominated by nationalist-communist forces. These forces exist and are felt not only in the Greater Romania Party [PRM], the Socialist Party of Labor [PSM], the Romanian National Unity Party [PUNR], and the Democratic Agrarian Party of Romania [PDAR], but also in the PDSR. As a result of this, all the laws of the reform have been voted with great difficulty in the parliament. A significant number of similar laws are waiting in vain to be discussed. The implementation of the laws of the reform meets with serious opposition because of the bureaucracy that engulfs the entire state apparatus and the leadership of enterprises. This bureaucracy has gotten stronger and reached spectacular proportions through the alliance of the PDSR with the left-wing parties. The great majority of those who were moved by the wave of the December 1989 revolution has been removed. They were replaced by former second- and third-rate nomenclatura members of the Ceausescu period. A bureaucratic mentality is a typical characteristic of those former nomenclatura members. This means that they are scared of changes, they lack initiative, and have confidence -- something they hide with difficulty -- in the economic centralism. From all this, one can draw the conclusion that no matter how reformist the ruling party might have become, its intentions are hampered by an incontestable political reality, namely, the nationalist-communist character of the majority coalition and the useless but stubborn resistance of the bureaucratic forces that are in the middle of a restoration process. Under these conditions, the political-economic bottleneck is perfectly explainable. Both economy and politics are virtually paralyzed. The way out of the blockage could have been achieved only through a new formula of parliamentary majority, a formula in which the reformist forces would have dominated the coalition on which the government relies. This parliamentary majority that would have been established as a result of the PDSR-CDR and PD(FSN) alliance would have had also the immense advantage of boasting an overwhelming proportion in the parliament. The laws of the reform would have been adopted much more rapidly and much more efficiently. At the same time, the new coalition would have created a new atmosphere throughout the entire Romanian society. Under the power of the new political wave, the reformist forces in our country would have gained courage, while the bureaucratic and the antireformist forces would have lost ground. Unfortunately, not only for our political life but also for the whole Romanian social life, the PDSR-opposition dialogue did not justify people's hopes. Was this the normal thing to happen? Was it normal that the dialogue was not carried to the end? I believe that, looking logically at our social and political realities, the answer is affirmative. However, it is fatal that the dialogue did not to continue. The real reasons might be the following: A. The presence of a gap between Ion Iliescu and the PDSR on the one hand and the CDR-PD(FSN) on the other. In the years that have passed since the December 1989 events, the contradiction between the opposition and those who grabbed the power has increased every day. In the beginning, the FSN and later the PDSR arranged numerous acts of diversion against the opposition and used the opposition as a target for violent accusations. In turn, the opposition contested the legitimacy of the new leadership and sometimes pleaded for its removal by force. Under the specific conditions prevailing in Romania after 1989 December events, the antagonism between the two political forces overstepped the borders of a normal democratic confrontation. The more so since in 1990 the battle reached the level of "who is knocking out whom." At one point, each of the two forces proposed to eliminate its rival. The fact that the electorate that supported the two political forces polarized to an amazing extent made things even more serious. Thus, a gap of suspicion was created, not only between the two political forces but also between the two electorates. This gap got broader when the nationalist-communist forces made an appearance on our political scene. The PDSR and Ion Iliescu did not have the power to rapidly detach themselves from these forces. Therefore, it seemed that the communist-nationalists were talking in the name of the PDSR and Ion Iliescu. As a result of it, the violent nature of the nationalist- communist attacks was perceived by the opposition as coming from the PDSR and Ion Iliescu. One can not easily overcome this gap. This was admitted also by one of the PNTCD leaders at the end of the first round of talks with the PDSR when he said that there is a difficult psychological threshold to cross. This psychological threshold belongs not only to the opposition but also to its electorate. It is extremely difficult to convince your supporters that it is possible to negotiate with the PDSR and with Ion Iliescu, when after for years on end you told them that the PDSR is a neo-communist party and Ion Iliescu must be removed. However, reasoning in this way, it was still a mistake to start a dialogue. It would have been much better if, in a first stage, secret contacts would have been made, far from the eyes of the public. Some compromise could have been reached, without the sides having their own electorate breathing down their necks. Likewise, the rapprochement between the PDSR and the opposition should have started through temporary alliances, discussions, and the voting of certain laws that would have been convenient both for the moderate wing of the PDSR and the opposition. Thus, a psychological ground would have been prepared for the opening of an official dialogue. Since this is not the way things were done, the shock of change of atmosphere between the two political forces was strong enough to make the two electorates apprehensive and to make the personal vanity and interests come out in the forefront. B. The confusion that continues to prevail within the ruling party. It is clear that the reason for opening the dialogue was the presence of a reformist group within the PDSR. This group is aware of the internal and external danger posed by an alliance with the nationalist-communist forces. Therefore, through victory over the whole conservative majority, this group forced the whole party to get closer to the CDR and distance itself from the nationalist- communist forces. However, this reformist group is a minority group within the PDSR. Apart from being a minority group, it mainly includes opportunist politicians, who are ready to do everything in order to stay in power. Thus, the opening of a dialogue with the opposition took place under difficult circumstances for the reformist group. It would have been normal for this group to definitively win in the party and put the conservative majority to its place. There would even have been a chance for a part of the conservative group to move toward the left-wing parties. Not being able to win within the party, the reformist group saw in the opening of a dialogue with the opposition an opportunity to strengthen its position within the PDSR. Thus, the opening of the dialogue did not take place prior to some clarifications in the government party. The reformist group did not consider the opening of the dialogue as the final stage in the process of clarifications, but as a beginning of such a process. Thus, the reformist group was compelled to hold negotiations with the opposition while extreme pressure was being put on it by the conservative majority, and through this majority by the whole PDSR. It is easy to understand that, in such a situation, the reformist group had small room for maneuver when it came to accepting certain compromise with the opposition. That is the reason for the sudden rigid position adopted by the PDSR during the negotiations and for that party's apprehension that its move closer to the opposition should not lead to the definitive breach with nationalist-communist forces. It is more than certain that any spectacular modification of the PDSR policy would have caused the split of the party. Being apprehensive about the policy promoted by the reformist group, the conservatives would have filled the ranks of the PRM, the PSM, and the PUNR. The reformist group would have faced the risk of losing everything. On the one hand, because of the psychological gap, the negotiations with the opposition would have been dragged in time, while on the other hand the PDSR would have lost its parliamentary majority. Likewise, taking into consideration the opportunism of certain leaders of the reformist group, it is easy to understand that, at one point, they were afraid of the dialogue. The government reshuffle was the signal that finally this group gave in. It returned to the previously occupied positions, that is, a minority position, compared with the majority of PDSR members and the supporters of that party. C. The lack of a strong left wing. As I have already written, the PDSR and the CDR cannot establish an alliance except when a new disturbing common adversary makes its appearance. This adversary is none else than the a possible PSM, PRM, PUNR, and PDAR alliance against the PDSR. However, these parties are still rather weak and do not dare rise against the strong protector of the PDSR, namely Ion Iliescu. Therefore, their recent attempt to detach themselves from the PDSR, an attempt that was expressed in the PRM leadership's letter, was quite flimsy. At the first signs of anger showed by the PDSR and Ion Iliescu, the left-wing allies rapidly calmed down. Pretending to be satisfied that the reshuffle has solved their interests, the PRM, the PSM, the PUNR, and the PDAR returned to their previously set condition: to humiliate the satellites of the ruling party. Since the PDSR did not have a firm and unfailing response to its allies, it would have been a mistake if it insisted to departing from the left wing and come closer to the right wing. No matter how discrediting they are, these allies are still preferable to the opposition. They are pleased with small measures, while the opposition wants almost everything. The common adversary of the PDSR and the CDR has not made its appearance yet. It is still to be seen whether it is able to appear soon.
