Participating in it were state ministers, ministers, Defense Ministry and Internal Affairs Ministry workers, managers from the procuracy, military commissars, chairmen of ispolkoms [executive committees] of the Yerevan city and rayon councils, and also through conference calls--representatives of ispolkoms of city and oblast councils of the republic. Opening the conference, Prime Minister Grant Bagratyan emphasized the importance of the recruitment in the matter of reinforcement of the national army and defense of the country under the conditions of the continuing conflict in the region. The prime minister noted the need for both extensive explanatory work and the creation of a certain military-patriotic atmosphere by the mass media, on the one hand, and, on the other, a refusal to put up with draft dodgers and deserters and the application of punitive measures against them within the framework of existing legislation. In this connection Grant Bagratyan reported that by a government decree the republic procuracy was asked to file criminal cases in keeping with the established procedure against citizens who evade the draft and to take measures to return to Armenia draftees who are outside the republic. The corresponding instructions were also given to the ministries and departments. Mr. Bagratyan also emphasized the need to ensure fairness and openness in the matter of conducting the draft and expressed the hope that, as a result of the hard work, the draft would go successfully. State Minister Vazgen Sarkisyan talked about the problem of conducting the draft, introduced the members of the regional coordination commission, and addressed the tasks facing each rayon. The state minister condemned the bad system that exists whereby through fair means or foul every soldier is transferred to the military unit of their native region. The draft will be conducted according to a nonregional principle, he said, and nobody will serve in his own rayon. The state minister denied rumors that 18-year-old draftees would be sent to the border regions of combat activities and called them absurd. Describing the draft as a task of not simply republic but of national significance, Vazgen Sarkisyan emphasized the importance of universal support for this work, noting that it would be desirable for deputies of the Supreme Council and parties and public organizations to participate in it. The state minister said that work was being done in this area and there had been appreciable results. A number of other issues related to the draft were also discussed at the conference.
