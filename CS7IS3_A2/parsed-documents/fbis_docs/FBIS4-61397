What do you think of it? [Baburin] A mafia has long come to power. [Ulanskiy] ??? [as published] [Baburin] I didn't think this up. Everybody has been talking about this for more than a year. Today mafia-like criminal structures have unleashed an unprecedented political terror. They are killing deputies, torching their apartments. There was no such thing in the Soviet Union. The Federal Counterintelligence head has recently admitted the existence of "Betar" Zionist armed formations. [Ulanskiy] Do Betar men terrorize deputies? [Baburin] I didn't say that. I don't think they are involved. But they do exist. [Ulanskiy] You spoke resolutely against the signing of the Treaty on Social Accord. Has your attitude to this document changed now? [Baburin] It has not. I continue to think that it is the highest degree of hypocrisy to sign something behind the people's back. It doesn't even smack of accord so far. [Ulanskiy] What guideposts would you set on the "Russian road" [allusion to Baburin's group] to accord? [Baburin] We will come to accord one generation from now at best. One should not entertain any illusions here. As for civil peace, we must come to it immediately. Because the only possible alternative is war. Why do I say no accord is possible? What sort of accord could there be between someone who has been stealing and someone who has been made a pauper? But their differences must be resolved without butchery. Therefore, as the first guidepost, we should sit down and decide what we regard as the first priority in the area of the economy, which measures would rescue the economy and which enjoy the support of all sensible political forces. All forces that have influence in society. Such figures.... who have discredited themselves as leaders should go, owing to the failure of their economic and political policies. There should also be accord in regard to individuals: someone should quit, someone should come in. And there should either a coalition government be formed, or it should be stated flatly, who is going to form a one-party government. Today we can see that no single party wishes to take over responsibility for what is going on in the country. Not a single one. In our parliament there are 10 factions, but I do not think you could find even one that would call itself the ruling faction. [Ulanskiy] What about Zhirinovskiy? He constantly trumpets his victory in the elections. [Baburin] No! He always underlines that they would come to power only in the fall. Like hell! It is ourselves who will come to power in the fall. [Ulanskiy] We? [Baburin] We, is the Russian pan-national union and state- patriotic organizations. We have no use for either today's ruiners or impostors who chant patriotic slogans while having always supported the ruining of the country in practice. [Ulanskiy] Power is wonderful. But who is after all going to decide today on who is to quit the political stage and who is to emerge onto it? [Baburin] Parliament, among others. If it finds no common language, well, early elections should be called both for parliament and president. There's nothing awful about that. [Ulanskiy] Do you agree with the slogans with which the implacable opposition has defiled the White House environs: "Prosecute Yeltsin's Gang," "Betar is the Guard of Bandit Yeltsin," and so on? [Baburin] I usually make use of terms I understand. This topic is so far very painful for me, and I do not touch on it in passing. [Ulanskiy] Does this mean your stance is that of open radicalism, that you do not call for violence, for the overthrow of today's authority? [Baburin] For resignation, yes; for overthrow, no. So far! [Interview ends] P.S. Baburin's last "so far" rang out like a tocsin. That single short remark showed that the opposition has already recovered from last October's concussion. It has rejected the treaty on accord in society only because it needs no two-year or even one-month truce. It is ready for spilling fresh blood now to satisfy its own ambitions.
