"The settlers of Qiryat Arba', Gush Qatif, Qedumim, Teqoa', and Ari'el must leave their settlements by March 15," Hamas's 'Izz-al- Din al-Qassam military wing said in a leaflet. "If they don't, we will not let them rest in their settlements or feel safe on the roads to their settlements." It also warned that "the leaders of Israel will pay for their crimes sooner or later," and scoffed at the army's ability to prevent the attacks. The leaflet, titled "The Settlers Will Pay with Their Blood for the Massacre," described a five-stage plan of attack. "With each step we will make the Israeli people and settlers cry in blood for their dead, and let them know that our blood is not cheaper than theirs," the leaflet stated. "We have chosen our targets and our living martyrs have been instructed to carry out the suicide operations."
