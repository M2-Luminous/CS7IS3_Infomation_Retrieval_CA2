With an aim to reduce trade deficits against Japan, EU has urged the Japanese Government to positively promote deregulation in various sectors, particularly in telecommunications, the distribution system, and three other sectors. It is believed that this issue will be taken up for discussion at a ministerial-level meeting of Japan and EU scheduled for this weekend. The Japanese Government may be asked to take EU's wishes into consideration when working out the additional package for easing regulations in late June. The ministerial-level meeting between Japan and EU will be held in Tokyo on 22 and 23 April. However, depending on Japan's political situation, there is a possibility of postponement. EU urged Japan through diplomatic channels to give priority to implementing measures for import expansion, promotion of investment in Japan, and liberalization of the market, as well as promotion of deregulation in the telecommunications market, and in the distribution system. EU plans to indicate details of its request in the bilateral ministerial-level meeting. A government source said that with regard to the "telecommunications," EU asks for easing the regulation on the ratio of foreign companies' investment in Japanese telecommunications companies (the ratio should be less than one- third under the present regulation). EU further requests that business licenses should be issued more freely. Concerning the "distribution system," EU demands that Large Retail Stores Law should be reviewed comprehensively so as to reduce regulations drastically, and that the Fair Trade Commission should investigate "distribution control" by the National Federation of Agricultural Cooperatives Associations (Zenno). Regarding the "import expansion measures," EU urges adoption of EU's safety standards for electric appliances in the Japanese market so that companies of EU nations will not have to apply for approval based on the Japanese standards before selling their products in Japan. The surplus of Japanese exports to EU nations over imports was about $26 billion in 1993. Although it dropped for the first time in three years, EU is still dissatisfied, saying the "surplus is still at a high level." Some EU officials said "Japan's trade policies are exclusively U.S.-oriented." EU also shows a critical attitude toward U.S. trade policy. Some government officials said that if Japan succeeds in strengthening cooperative ties with EU nations, it will be advantageous to Japan for checking U.S. hardline attitude toward it.
