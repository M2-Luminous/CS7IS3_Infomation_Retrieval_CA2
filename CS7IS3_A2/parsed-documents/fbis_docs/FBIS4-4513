The statement says Thailand provided assistance to the Cambodians by giving them temporary shelter on humanitarian grounds, hoping that once the situation in Cambodia returned to normal and was safe these people would return home quickly. Subsequently, from 15-27 March the Thai Government sent these Cambodians back to their own country via Ban Saptari, Soi Dao District, Chanthaburi. The repatriation was the same as the action previously taken by the Thai Government and complied with the wishes of the Cambodians, who wanted to return to safe areas. Moreover, the Thai Government absolutely would not allow any armed group to enter Thai territory. The Thai Government (?is ready) to cooperate with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and other international organizations in transiting Thai territory to assist these suffering Cambodians in their own country. On this issue, the Thai Government has appealed to the UNHCR to consult with the Cambodian Government on establishing a safe zone in Cambodia for Cambodians fleeing the fighting in their country. Foreign Minister Squadron Leader Prasong informed Prince Norodom Sirivut, Cambodian deputy prime minister and foreign minister, of Thailand's position during the latter's 28-29 March official visit to Thailand. The Thai Government hopes the international community understands its actions in this matter. Thailand had to shoulder the burden caused by displaced Cambodians for over 13 years, and it does not want such a burden again. The Thai Government has tried to implement its policy on this issue by taking both its international responsibilities and international interests into consideration.
