Troops exchanged artillery and heavy weapons fire during the clash, but government troops said they had "repulsed" renegade fighters of Afghan Prime Minister Golboddin Hektmatyar. They also claimed that "heavy casualties" were inflicted on the troops of Hekmatyar and Uzbek fighters of militia warlord 'Abdol Rashid Dostam, the premier's main battle ally. "The attack started at 7 p.m. (1430 GMT) and reached its peak at 10 p.m. lasting till midnight," a government soldier told AFP in the scarred Microrayan housing estate, situated near the former diplomatic enclave of Wazir Akbar Khan. Rabbani's troops on Kabul's eastern front said troops of Hekmatyar and Dostam's Uzbek warriors attacked them at several points. Hekmatyar's Shiite ally, the Hezb-i-Wahdat faction, also joined the battle, engaging Rabbani's troops at the city's south, the government troops said. Reports of deaths from the clash were not immediately available but the Jamhurriat hospital here said three civilians died of their injuries while a 10-year-old boy with a bullet wound in the chest was in a critical condition. During Friday's fighting a phosphorus shell slammed into the International Committee of the Red Cross complex but did not explode, but it ignited when Western demining experts were extracting the ordnance, relief workers said. A few civilians still residing in the remaining Microrayan apartment estate said they spent the night in makeshift shelters or in the basements as shells whined overhead and bullets scoured homes. Residents in one Microrayon block said only four of the 60 apartments there were occupied as most residents had fled since rival forces turned the residential district into a regular battle ground four months ago. Troops of Dostam, Hekmatyar and Rabbani are battling since January to take control of Microrayon, a sprawling residential enclave built by the former Soviet Union for its Red Army officers after it invaded Afghanistan in 1979. Angry Microrayon residents came out of their homes to hurl curses at the United Nations, Western nations and the Afghan mojahedin for their woes as a lull in the battle set in Saturday, witnesses said.
