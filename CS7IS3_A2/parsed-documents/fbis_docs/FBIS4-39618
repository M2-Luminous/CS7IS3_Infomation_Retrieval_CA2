This was stated at a briefing today by Grigoriy Karasin, director of the department of information and press of the Russian federation Foreign Ministry in connection with the recent deterioration of the DPRK's nuclear problem. "This approach," he noted, "envisions the need for Pyongyang to ensure the IAEA has access to the relevant facilities and information by the agreed deadlines and the convening of an International conference for a comprehensive examination of the problems of security on the Korean peninsula. If these diplomatic efforts are not successful the sanctions proposal will have to be examined." Replying to a question regarding relations and economic cooperation between Russia and North Korea, Grigoriy Karasin said that "relations with the DPRK are developing in a normal way, cooperation is continuing, including on the question of the work of the lumberjacks on Russian territory." During the talks which were held between representatives of the Russian and DPRK Foreign Ministries it proved possible to settle a number of questions, he added.
