FBIS4-36513 "drnes111_o_94007" FBIS-NES-94-111 Daily Report 8 Jun 1994 SYRIA Paper Attacks Jordanian Calls for Israeli Accord Paper Attacks Jordanian Calls for Israeli Accord JN0806142894 Paris Radio Monte Carlo in Arabic 1200 GMT 8 Jun 94 JN0806142894 Paris Radio Monte Carlo Arabic BFN [Report by Sana' al-Imam from Damascus] [Text] Damascus today strongly criticized the Jordanian paper AL-RA'Y, which in recent articles has called on the Jordanian Government to conclude an agreement with Israel as soon as possible to make sure Jordan is not isolated and its role is not marginalized, especially since Arab coordination among the frontline states does not exist, as the paper put it. In its editorial today, the government newspaper, TISHRIN, said that these opinions are preparing the way for the peddling of a really bad plan. The paper added that such a plan would isolate Jordan from the Arab world and tamper with its national unity. These calls are made by hired writers to inject Zionist poison into Arab awareness with the objective of pushing it toward capitulation. The official Syrian newspaper refuted the opinions of the writer of the article, who said that Syria has abandoned Jordan, that it is only considering a separate solution, and that an agreement between Syria and Israel is imminent. The paper said that these statements are prematurely seeking to distort the essence of the Syrian position. This is because Syria has never called for throwing oneself into Israel's arms, and has always announced its commitment to the principle of a comprehensive solution and the need for the implementation of Resolutions 242, 338, and 425, and for Israel's withdrawal to the pre-4 June 1967 border in return for comprehensive peace. The paper wondered: What progress has been achieved to make the Jordanian writer call for expediting the signing of a separate agreement with Israel before it is too late? The negotiations with Israel are still moving in a vicious circle. The U.S. secretary of state has admitted this and said that the gap is too deep between the two stands. Even Rabin said that matters on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks are at a stalemate. TISHRIN said: Arab coordination does exist, and Syria was the first to insist on coordination among the Arab parties. Even Jordanian officials have recently spoken, following King Husayn's visit to Damascus, about the importance of coordination and integration with Syria. This means that the writer of the articles considers the statements of Jordanian officials on their adherence to the principle of a comprehensive solution and coordination with the Arab parties mere maneuvering for local audiences for the time being.
