A slight increase in each automaker's purchase of U.S. parts is due to such factors as the leveling off of local production in the United States and a slump in exports following the yen's appreciation. Although automakers have spelled out a goal of increasing the annual purchase of U.S.-made parts to $19 billion in fiscal 1994, under the current situation it is impossible to also expect a sharp increase this fiscal year. Because it seems difficult for them to achieve the goal, this will likely affect the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, which are now in progress. Fiscal 1993 is the second year of implementing the "voluntary plans" [for purchasing U.S. auto parts], which were announced by each automaker after Japan-U.S. summit talks in early 1992. Nissan Motor Co.'s purchase of U.S. parts reached nearly $3.5 billion in fiscal 1993, a 48 percent increase over fiscal 1992. This increase is the largest among Japanese automakers. Its imports of U.S. auto parts remained at the same level as the previous fiscal year due to a decrease in imports following the yen's appreciation. However, local production in the United States increased by 21 percent thanks to good sales of its popular cars, and the percentage of local procurement of parts increased sharply. Toyota Motor Corporation -- whose purchasing goal for fiscal 1994 accounts for one-third of the "$19 billion" -- purchased U.S. auto parts totalling $4.65 billion in fiscal 1993, a 4.9 percent increase over the previous fiscal year. The increase rate sharply dropped compared with (a 41.1 percent increase) in fiscal 1992. Both Honda Motor Co., and Mitsubishi Motors Corporation purchased more U.S. parts in fiscal 1993 than in the previous year. However, the purchase of U.S. parts by Japanese automakers as a whole increased slightly in fiscal 1993 due to a drop in exports and a slump in domestic sales. It is expected that major automakers' local procurement of U.S. parts in the United States will increase steadily in fiscal 1994, the final year of the voluntary plans. This is because Toyota started operations at its second plant in Kentucky in March and because Nissan intends to start full-fledged operation of its plants to produce 450,000 cars annually in the United States. However, since small automakers are still facing a tough situation, it is observed that "it is difficult for them to increase purchases of U.S. parts to more than $3 billion in total during one year," (according to an executive of a major automaker). During U.S. President Bush's visit to Japan in 1992, the Japanese automobile industry announced that it would target a goal of $19 billion for its purchase of U.S. auto parts for fiscal 1994." Based on the goal, each automaker separately spelled out this March a purchasing plan for fiscal 1996 and 1997. Because the U.S. Government has demanded further increase in Japanese automakers' purchase of U.S.-made parts, a delay in their purchasing plan due to a slump in the Japanese automotive market will likely have a delicate influence on future negotiations between Japan and the United States.
