Gurulea specified that the document stipulating the withdrawal of these troops forces both Russia and Moldova to negotiate with the Ukraine concerning the transportation of the armament on its railways. Anatol Cosciug, chief of the MD Department of Military Policy and Negotiations, declared to BASA that technically all the units of the 14th Army can be withdrawn in the time-frame suggested by the Moldovan delegation, the deadline being 31 December 1995-1 January 1996. Cosciug also stated that the political aspect of the problem is often exaggerated, as the withdrawal of the Russian troops is also conditioned by the socio-political situation in Dniester. The cited source also specified that no alterations were made in the technical aspects of the agreements.
