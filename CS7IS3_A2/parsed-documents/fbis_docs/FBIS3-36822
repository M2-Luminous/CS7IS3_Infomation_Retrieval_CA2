"It is high time to stop dividing and tearing apart the once single space of the former USSR. The party of war, represented by the nationalist opposition, is using the slogan of vital interests as a pretext for provoking a war. The party of peace, to which I attribute myself, on the other hand, intends to build friendly relations with all states of the former Union," the minister said.
