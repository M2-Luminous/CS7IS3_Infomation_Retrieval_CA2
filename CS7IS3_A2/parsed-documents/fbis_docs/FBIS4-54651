On the basis of analyzing this data base and the latest -- April -- data, it prepared the following forecast for the first round of the parliamentary elections to take place on 8 May. The expected participation level (in percentage of people entitled to vote) will be between 56 and 63 percent nationally; the most likely participation level is 58 percent nationally. Participation figures in the various areas (the counties and Budapest) can significantly deviate from the national average in both directions. If the first round is valid in all 20 areas, namely more than half of the people entitled to vote participate in all counties and Budapest then it is most likely that the parties that formed parliamentary groups in 1990, and no other party, will again get into Parliament. It is not completely impossible, but there is very little chance for the Agrarian Federation, the Workers' Party, and the Republic Party to reach the 5-percent limit. If the first round is valid in all areas, then 130 to 135 mandates will be decided on the basis of the area lists. Through this, the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] can get 62 to 68 seats, the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] 22 to 26, the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] 15 to 19, the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz] 12 to 17, the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] five to 10, and the Independent Smallholders Party [FKGP] also five to 10 seats. However, in contrast to 1990, we now have to consider the possibility that the first round will not be valid in all areas because less than 50 percent of the entitled people will vote. Szabolcs-Szatmar-Bereg, Hajdu-Bihar, Bacs-Kiskun, and Jasz-Nagykun- Szolnok counties have the biggest chance for this but, considering a participation at around 58 percent, the most likely scenario is that only Szabolcs-Szatmar-Bereg county will have an invalid first round. If the 8 May round is invalid in an area, the distribution of the area mandates can be significantly different from that indicated above because participation will presumably be much lower in the second round. The size of the difference will naturally depend on which counties will have to hold a second round, and what level of participation will then be reached. In the individual electoral districts, similarly to 1990, the mandates will mostly be decided only in the second round because most of the candidates will not get an absolute majority of votes in the first round. For this reason alone -- regardless of the validity of the voting on the basis of lists -- the mandates of the national lists can only be decided after the second round. Considering the fact that the electoral law prohibits the publication of public opinion polls in the last eight days before the elections, there might even be considerable differences between this forecast and the actual election results because the intentions to participate and the party preferences can still significantly change between the date of the last survey (8 to 18 April) and the day of the elections. Modus In its regular "omnibus" researches, the Modus Economic and Social Marketing Ltd. also poses questions on election preferences. The questions are directed at the level of participation in the elections, primary and secondary voting preferences, and dispreferences. The last of Modus's national surveys took place between 1 and 8 April at 100 collection points, in the form of personal interviews. The sample represents the country's population according to gender, age, level of schooling, and type of dwelling place. The proportion of the people questioned in the sample corresponds to people over the age of 15 living in various regions of the country. The size of the sample is 960. According to their latest surveys, the proportion of those people who would participate in the elections, if they were held today, has increased (73 percent). In their view, this can be attributed to the effects of the campaign. This change took place mainly to the detriment of "I do not know" answers, which allows us to conclude that the campaign mainly convinced the uncertain voters about the need to vote, rather than the citizens who are not interested in politics. Some 69 percent of those who intend to vote named a party. This means that, similar to 1990, the campaign activity of the last few days will have a major effect on the final results. Examining the parties preferred by those who selected a party, the Modus found that the MSZP can expect 36 percent of the votes. It seems that the trend that began in November 1993 is also continuing in the campaign period. The Socialist have a good chance of winning the elections. Preference for the Fidesz is at 17 percent. According to indications, the Fidesz's descent has stopped. Compared to the survey in February, the SZDSZ lost 0.8 percent, which cannot be seen as a significant change. According to the April results, 16 percent of people who selected a party would vote for them. Out of the parties of the current government coalition, the KDNP is the most stable party, its expected result was 9 percent in both of the last two surveys. Sympathy for the MDF and the smallholders is moving in opposite directions: The MDF's is increasing and the smallholders' is decreasing. However, both changes are within the statistical error margin. All parties currently outside Parliament can expect less than 1 percent. Therefore, according to the Modus's assessments, the current parliamentary party structure will only change in its proportions rather than its members. Gallup Gallup's last survey was conducted between 22 and 24 April on a national sample of 1,500 people representing the country's adult population. Fifty-five percent of the people questioned before the elections were very sure about their participation, and a further 18 percent said that they would certainly go to vote. On the basis of this, it is likely that the participation in the elections will approach or even reach 70 percent. According to Gallup, out of those who selected a party, a chsnge of only a few percent in party preferences can be expected during the campaign period. Within the whole population, the proportion of MSZP supporters increased from the March 19 percent to 20 percent, the SZDSZ's from 9 to 11 percent, the MDF's from 6 to 8 percent, while the Fidesz's decreased from 10 to 9 percent. These differences based on the whole population change if we only consider those people who intend to participate in the elections. Among the likely voters, 31 percent of those who already selected a party would vote for the MSZP. Among the absolutely certain participants, this proportion is 33 percent. (This was 35 percent in the previous month.) Among the likely voters, the SZDSZ can expect 16 percent, the Fidesz 13, and the MDF 12 percent. The FKGP would receive 9 percent, and the KDNP 7 percent on the basis of the answers. If only those people went to vote who are very certain about this now, the Fidesz and the MDF would get 11 percent, the SZDSZ 14 percent, the FKGP 9 percent, and the KDNP 7 percent. Eighty-five percent of people who named a party are very certain or certain that they would also choose the party they now prefer on 8 May, and 15 percent are still uncertain about this. Apart from the six parties mentioned above, none of the others are expected to have a chance to acquire 5 percent support. According to the expectations of 30 percent of people, the MSZP will win the elections on 8 May, 15 percent expect the SZDSZ, and 11 percent the MDF. The corresponding proportions were 24, 13, and 10 percent in the previous month. The proportion of people who were unable to answer this question decreased from the 41 percent in March to 31 percent in April. The campaign had more effect on the views on the prime ministerial candidates. Gabor Kuncze's performance is the most striking. In March, if a decision had to be made between [MSZP Chairman] Horn and Kuncze, 23 percent would have selected Kuncze and 46 percent Horn. In April, these proportions changed to 32 and 39 percent. In March, 20 percent named Horn, 19 percent Boross, and 10 percent Kuncze to the question "All in all, whom would you prefer most as the country's prime minister?" In April, 22 percent would welcome Horn, 17 percent Boross, and 16 percent Kuncze as prime minister. (In both months, 18 percent of people were unable to answer this question.) Median According to the Median Public Opinion and Market Research Ltd, no one can claim to offer absolutely precise predictions 10 days before the elections, because even the latest polls were done at least one and a half to two weeks before the elections and no one can foresee what will happen during the remaining days of the campaign. However, in view of the participation in the elections, it is possible to make predictions on the basis of rather clear trends. Participation on 8 May will certainly exceed the 1990 level and can be expected at 74 to 80 percent according to our assessments. It is even more difficult to predict the party results on the basis of lists. The results of the latest survey (this was between 15 and 20 April in the case of Median), the trends preceding this, and background information on the parties have to be taken into consideration. Median weighted the "raw" answers with sympathy figures for the parties, and opinions on the parties' interest representation and problem solving abilities. All in all, Median gave the results in a relatively narrow margin, indicating the minimum, maximum, and most likely values according to their current knowledge. According to this, the MSZP can expect 31 to 38 percent (most likely 34), the SZDSZ 15 to 19 (17), the MDF 9 to 14 (11), the Fidesz 7 to 10 (9), the KDNP 7 to 10 (7), and the FKGP 6 to 8 (9), while the other parties together can expect 11 to 17 percent (most likely 14).
