Replying to the debate in both houses of Parliament on the motion of thanks to the president's address, he termed Islamabad's raising of human rights issue in Kashmir in Geneva as totally uncalled for. The prime minister has said that Pakistan has no locus standi in the state other than that of an aggressor. The motion was later adopted by both the houses after rejecting all opposition amendments, including one by division in Rajya Sabha. In his hour-long reply marked by repeated thumping of desks by treasury benches, the prime minister referred to the resolution on Kashmir passed by Parliament and said it fully reflected the determination of the nation on the Kashmir issue. Referring to the U.S. pronouncements recently, the prime minister said though there is improvement in Indo-U.S. relations in the economic and other spheres, the understanding has to be enhanced in certain areas. He said the home minister's statement in Parliament makes the government's position clear. The prime minister announced that India and China are likely to achieve a breakthrough in resolving confrontation in areas along the Line of Actual Control. The prime minister rejected the idea of carving out new states as it will open a Pandora's box. He, however, said measures have to be taken to remove the interstate economic disparities. Referring to the northeast, the prime minister said peace has been restored in the region except Manipur, where intratribal clashes have taken place. There also the situation has improved after the imposition of president's rule, he said. On the Dunkel proposal, the prime minister reiterated that India has nothing to lose but much to gain as the farmers will be able to sell their produce in the international market and get more remunerative prices. On Ayodhya, Mr. Rao said action will be initiated after the Supreme Court gives its ruling. He promised to take the house into confidence while taking action on this matter. Expressing optimism on the country's economy, Mr. Rao declared that the government will increase investment in rural development by three folds. More than 1 lakh crore rupees will be spent for rural uplift in the next seven years. Stressing the need to increase the power supply, the prime minister said massive investment is being made in the sector. Rejecting the charges that foreign investment is coming only in the consumer sector, the prime minister said about 90 percent of foreign investment is in the core sector. He also reiterated the government's resolve to earmark 6 percent of the national income for education. He said the schemes announced by the government for women and unemployed youth have gathered momentum.
