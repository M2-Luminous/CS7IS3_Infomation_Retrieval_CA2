"The events in August 1991 and in October 1993 are complicated and extraordinary, with uneasy consequences. No one can easily forget them," he told Interfax on Wednesday. "The situation whereby the state is ruined, the president thrown down and the parliament shelled, and all this is forgotten is a bad example and a bad precedent," he said. "In compensation for that, we must be given hope for national reconciliation which alone can justify such steps (the termination of the trial of the 1991 coup leaders -- Interfax). There can be no other justification. Such things are unpardonable," said Gorbachev. Commenting on ex-prisoner of Lefortovo Aleksandr Rutskoy's statement, circulated on Wednesday, Gorbachev described it as "responsible" and "reflecting serious intentions". Rutskoy urged the Russian citizens to maintain peace and national accord.
