The Republic of Angola's flag was once again raised in N'Dalatando today. Izidro Sanhanga reports: I have striven to get the confirmation. After all, it is true. N'Dalatando has been liberated and that is why the people sing. [crowd sings Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola slogans and informal musicians play peace song] The people sing peace and freedom. It looks as if freedom reins. Actually the Republic of Angola's flag has been raised once again. This is now a free land where state administration has been reinstated. There is a great deal more to report about these long months of UNITA's [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] military occupation. Cameraman Boaventura Canjanja has shot whatever he could. So, Cuanza Norte will be in focus in the next news bulletins.
