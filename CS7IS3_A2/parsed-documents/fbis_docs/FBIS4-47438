Vishnevskiy, Moscow] [Abstract] Cell cultures of allogeneic dermal fibroblast were employed as transplants (28-280 cm[.sup]2[/]) and tested for their efficacy in the treatment of burns in 28 13-53 year old patients. In 15 patients with IIIa-IIIb degree burns (12-55% body area), 12 subjects (80%) showed epithelialization within an average of 12.1 days. In 13 patients with IIIb-IV degree burns (4-40% body area) epithelialization was evident in 18-24 days in only 3 cases in whom the transplant was 60 cm[.sup]2[/] or less. In addition, 2 patients presented with graft rejection, and in 3 subjects the transplant was degraded with suppuration. Accordingly, these observations point to the potential usefulness of using transplants prepared from fibroblast cultures in the management of certain second and third degree burns.
