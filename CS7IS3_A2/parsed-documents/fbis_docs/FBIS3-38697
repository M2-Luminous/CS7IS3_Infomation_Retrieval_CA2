[Ahtisaari] Of course, first of all I would like to thank Elisabeth Rehn for a good and fair campaign. I think that is quite an essential factor, for which I want to thank Elisabeth Rehn. I also hope that the people who voted for Elisabeth Rehn can also give their support for me in these new and difficult tasks. At the same time, of course, I want to thank all those who have taken part in my campaign, thousands of volunteers in various parts of Finland. I am very grateful to all of them and to all of you, good friends. Without your work these elections would never have ended as they did. [Reporter] The nation is not divided? [Ahtisaari] I would say that the future president will face very difficult tasks, both in the economy, politics, internationally, and then it is important that the nation is not divided over these issues, and I will insure that I will be seen as the president of the entire country. This is the way I intend to take things forward. In fact, during my entire campaign I have stressed that the Finnish nation must not be divided over these issues. [passage omitted]
