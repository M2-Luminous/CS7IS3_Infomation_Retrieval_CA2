FBIS4-60499 "drnes102_k_94005" FBIS-NES-94-102 Daily Report 25 May 1994 IRAQ Implications of Capacitor Story Disclosures Viewed Implications of Capacitor Story Disclosures Viewed JN2505115994 Baghdad INA in Arabic 0930 GMT 25 May 94 JN2505115994 Baghdad INA Arabic BFN [Text] Baghdad, 25 May (INA) -- AL-JUMHURIYAH has said that now the Thatcher-Bush fabrication of the capacitors charge against Iraq has been exposed, the West's democracy, respect for human rights, and credibility have come into question. In its editorial today, the paper stresses that the British courts' unveiling of the British and U.S. intelligence services' fabrication of the capacitors' story -- or nuclear weapons' detonators -- with the prior knowledge of the then U.S. President and British prime minister, has proved beyond all doubt that Bush and Thatcher wanted to mislead public opinion in the West, especially in the United States, and fabricate justifications to convince legislative and other bodies of the need to launch a war against Iraq. Describing such behavior as a reflection of moral degeneration, the paper notes that Bush and Thatcher were involved in lies at the highest levels and on the broadest and most important fronts. It is noteworthy that a British court yesterday ordered the release of two British Urmak [name as transliterated] Company employees, who are serving five-year prison terms, after the court acquired categorical proof that Thatcher had prior knowledge of the plot and that British and U.S. agencies cooperated to frame the employees, Dagger and Speakman [names as transliterated]. The British court has acquired convincing evidence that the judge who presided over the trial of the two British employees deliberately misled the jury into convicting the defendants of being involved in smuggling nuclear detonators to Iraq. AL-JUMHURIYAH examines the underlying significance of the facts and information that have become available to the British courts about the British and U.S. intelligence and customs authorities' arrangement of the plan to deliver the detonators to the airport and then discover them as export-banned equipment that was on its way to Iraq. The paper says that the aim was to portray Iraq as being effectively on the verge of producing atomic bombs, and that the capacitors were the final step in that plan. The paper is confident that with the charge of attempting to smuggle nuclear detonators to Iraq now exposed, the UN inspection committees' conclusion that there is no move to produce an Iraqi nuclear bomb, as well as facts that are yet to be disclosed, it has been proved that the aggression against Iraq was a basic part of the colonialist West's strategy of hindering the awakening and progress of any Arab country and preventing unity between Arab countries. AL-JUMHURIYAH urges the U.S. and western public in general to stress their respect for democracy and human rights and to adopt clear stands against those who deceived and misled them in order to peddle the plan of killing hundreds of thousands of human beings and torturing millions more in Iraq.
