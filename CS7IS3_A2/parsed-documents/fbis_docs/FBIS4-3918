The reform package is designed to push forward urban reform in a comprehensive manner, instead of focusing on only the business sector, said Guo Shuqing, director of the Comprehensive Department under the State Commission for Restructuring the Economic System yesterday in Beijing. The pilot cities include Changchun, Harbin, Anshan and Shenyang in Northeast China; Tianjin, Tangshan. Xian and Yantai in North China: Nanjing, Ningbo, Tongling and Changzhou in East China; Wuhan in Central China; Chengdu and Chongqing in Southwest China; and Quanzhou and Guangzhou in South China. The reforms to be implemented in these cities will focus on three areas this year. First is the reform of the property ownership system to transform State-owned enterprises into modern corporations. This effort will go hand-in-hand with developing the finance, real estate, labour and technology markets, the official said. The second area will be the improvement of the pension and unemployment insurance systems. At the same time, housing reform will be hastened by selling houses, raising rents and building more houses for ordinary salary-earners. Thirdly, education, science and technology will be reformed in line with the development of a market economy. The pilot cities are also encouraged to move faster to reform government functions. Guo stressed that these cities will not enjoy any preferential treatment. "Preferential policies are counter to the idea of a market economy, which requires competition on equal footing and adherence to international practices," he said. The 17 cities are located not only in the rich eastern provinces, but are also in the relatively poor central and western provinces. "The purpose of this drive is to speed up reforms in inland cities and help them get rid of poverty," Guc added. Guo's commission will be responsible for designing standards for the model reforms and it plans to set up a liaison association for mayors of these pilot cities, which is expected to give them chance to exchange information on their reform experiences.
