Speaking at the Australia-China Business Council in Melbourne this noon, China's State Councilor Li Tieying said that there would be no change in the preferential policies granted to foreign-funded enterprises. He also said that foreign-funded enterprises will gradually enjoy the treatment granted to the Chinese people. Li, who is also minister in charge of the State Commission for Restructuring the Economic Systems, arrived in Melbourne this morning for a nine-day visit to Australia. "We will maintain the continuity of our foreign investment policy by continuing to encourage foreign investment into China," Li told the luncheon in honor of him by the council. "China has always respected and protected the legal rights and interests of foreign businesses," Li said. "Treatment equivalent to that extended to Chinese nationals will be gradually granted to foreign enterprises." Talking about the newly-introduced reforms of foreign exchange and foreign trade, Li said that a system of bank foreign exchange settlement and sales would be introduced for state-owned foreign trade enterprises. "The existing practice will be maintained in regard to foreign-funded enterprises, namely, they can retain their cash accounts to facilitate their operation including import and export," he added. On the reform of China's taxation system, Li said that it "does not, generally speaking, increase the overall tax burden on foreign-funded enterprise." "For some enterprises whose tax burden does increase, corresponding compensation measures have been formulated to allow for the full entitlement of foreign businessmen to the preferential conditions set forth in China's laws and agreements for cooperation in China," Li said. Li stressed that "there have been changes in any of the preferential policies regarding to foreign-funded enterprises." The recent approval of China's foreign trade law will provide a better legal guarantee for foreign investment and trade activities in China, he added. China has so far approved 170,000 foreign-invested projects, with the accumulated directed foreign investment exceeding 60 billion U.S. dollars and over 70,000 foreign-funded enterprises already is [words indistinct].
