Prices here are high, up to 70 German marks (42 US dollars) for one kilogram (2.2 pounds) of coffee, while in Kiseljak, a town Moslems from Visoko besiege in Bosnia's war, the price is eight marks. Cooking oil is 20 marks a litre in Visoko, four marks in Kiseljak. In one of the paradoxes of war, Croats in besieged Kiseljak in central Bosnia are eating better and paying less than the Moslems who surround them. The key is a narrow front the Kiseljak pocket has with Bosnian Serb forces, who continue to allow Croats to move supplies through their lines despite Serb anger over Moslem-Croat rapprochement, UN military officers and a leading Moslem businessman said Wednesday in Visoko, eight kilometres (five miles) northeast of Kiseljak. The Serbs, under international sanctions for being the aggressor in Bosnia since fighting began in April 1992, are too needy themselves to pass up chances for food, fuel or hard currency. An additional irony is that most of the goods coming into Visoko that are not UN humanitarian aid are from Kiseljak. The Bosnian war is between neighbors and there has been a continuous and considerable amount of trading across front lines. Kiseljak is a sleepy, sprawling place of only a few thousand people with two small main streets and a suburban, residential feel surprisingly untouched by the war. Visoko is a small city with a pre-war population of 48,000, now swollen by refugees. Many of its Turkish-style wooden houses with red-tile roofs, built along a curve in the Bosna river, are damaged by shelling. UN Canadian Lieutenant Bruno Vanasse told AFP the Croats bring in a convoy once a week from Split, in Bosnian neighbor Croatia on the Adriatic coast. The convoy detours through Croat-held territory in southern Bosnia to avoid Moslem lines in the center of the former Yugoslav republic. It then approaches Sarajevo from Serb-held territory in the southeast. Somewhere near Pale, 15 kilometres (nine miles) southeast of Sarajevo, the Croats pay their "tax" to the Serbs -- 30 percent of the goods in the convoy, Vanasse said. The convoy enters Kiseljak through a Serb checkpoint just southeast of Kiseljak. Vanasse said this arrangement has not changed despite the Croats and Moslems declaring a ceasefire in their fighting February 28 and moving to create a political federation, which for the moment has isolated the more powerfully armed Serbs against a common front though diplomatic efforts are underway to try to bring the Serbs into the process. Asmir Hodic, a leading Moslem businessman in Visoko, told AFP the Serbs were furious about the Moslem-Croat alliance but were not about to stop the convoys to Kiseljak. The only retaliation they have made is to demand six tons of fuel, instead of the previous three tons, as part of the price of entry to Kiseljak. Hodic is himself an active trader with the Croats, exchanging leather goods made in his family factory and coffins in his funeral business against food. He has become one of the few people to use a UN checkpoint set up last week to guarantee freedom of movement on the road between Kiseljak and Visoko, Vanasse said. Asmir, 27, runs the city funeral parlor in Visoko. He said he gives away most of the food he gets from Kiseljak but does sell some of it on the black market since it is the only way to buy the wood and parts needed for coffins as Visoko's city administration has no money.
