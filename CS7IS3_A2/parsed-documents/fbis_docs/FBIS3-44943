Summing up the work in the past year, the provincial economic work conference, which was held a few days ago, also made arrangements for economic work next year and put new ideas forward. It has been laid down that, in its economic work for next year, Guangdong will make strenuous efforts in three main fields, i.e. deepening reform, laying a good foundation, and raising efficiency. Governor Zhu Senlin stressed: Next year we should emphasize breaking new ground in reform of the enterprise system and breakthroughs on important points to boost the overall situation. We should select five large and medium-sized state enterprises for experiments in establishing a modern enterprise system and coordinate state experiments in 100 enterprises. In terms of reform measures, we must, first, carry out the "Enterprise Law" and the "Regulations" and seriously make good the various powers and benefits of enterprises; second, reform the property rights system and accelerate establishment and amplification of the state assets management structure; and third, continuously expand the scope of experiments in a standardized enterprise joint-stock system and practice in a planned way a corporate system in state-owned enterprises.
