The decrease rate was steeper than the 26 percent fall in the national rice harvest, which totaled 7,834,000 tons, the agency said. This shows a large portion of the harvest is being marketed freely outside government channels, with rice prices surging due to the poorest rice crop last year since World War II, officials said. Of the total of unpolished nonglutinous and glutinous rice inspected, paddy-grown nonglutinous rice decreased 37 percent to 3,778,000 tons.
