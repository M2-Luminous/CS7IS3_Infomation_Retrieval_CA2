ARENA's leader, Dr. Sekou Koressi Conde, told our correspondent Ben Daouda Sylla in Conakry the reasons for this decision: [Begin Conde recording] Indeed, we do not accept the fact that the CEN is an appendage of the Interior Ministry because that is unconstitutional. Second, we believe that we have some obligations toward the people who support our political action. As far as we are concerned, we have an obligation of loyalty toward them which does not allow us to participate in any tricks. We have requested the setting up of a constitutional council and a state council. We accept the fact that the Supreme Court should be the highest body but we also say that we want the setting up of a constitutional council, even if it has consultative functions. The CEN's present composition is outdated, therefore, the ARENA is withdrawing from it. [end recording]
