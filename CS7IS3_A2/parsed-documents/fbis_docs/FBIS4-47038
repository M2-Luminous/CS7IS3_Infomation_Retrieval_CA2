Semenova: "Power or No Power?"] [Text] The first day of the work of the third session of the oblast soviet proceeded in a situation of self-definition--of the status and character of the new representative organ and the style of its interaction with the oblast administration. The debates began in the first hour of work with a discussion of an organizational question--on election of the soviet's deputy chairman. A candidate for this post was actually nominated at the last session. It was A.A. Kiselnikova, who was nominated as an alternate in the election of the chairman. But this time she was not even considered. Soviet chairman A.P. Sychev presented another candidacy for the deputies' consideration--that of V.Ya. Karpov--and he suggested that it be included on the list for a secret vote. The deputies know Vladimir Yakovlevich well, as they say, from the positive side, and no ill-considered questions arose regarding this. Slight confusion was caused by something else--the "list" consisting of one candidate, when we had already become accustomed to a choice in elections. But nobody considered this significant in and of itself. One is one, and if you need to have another one--nominate him. There were no nominations. And perhaps everything would have proceeded calmly to the secret voting booths had V. Karpov not succumbed to the temptation to give a political speech. His role in the soviet leadership is organizational, something like that of the leader of the apparatus, as Deputy K. Komarov observed. And this dictates the demand for a particular qualities in the candidate--the ability to work with all the deputies, regardless of their political image. A rapid-fire discussion followed. Deputy N. Krasnikov "reminded" Karpov of his position when discussing the question of the Agreement on Social Accord, which was not supported by the majority of the soviet, and expressed the doubt that a deputy who did not agree could organize harmonious work. Nikolay Grigoryevich expressed the desire that the soviet not be an arena for political battle but an organ of common sense, since all the deputies had come to the soviet to work on oblast problems. A.G. Chastikin supported his colleague in this by saying--I became a deputy only to finally put an end to the conflicts with Moscow. I do not think that every individual should have to have a position or be able to defend it. Deputies I.A. Lyuzenkov and V.Ye. Kuznetsov spoke in the same spirit. V.Ya. Karpov was elected to the post of deputy chairman of the soviet by an absolute majority of votes. To an outside observer another organizational point was discussed too long and too heatedly--the structure of the apparatus of the oblast soviet. It seemed to me that the fire of passions was kindled by the soviet chairman himself. Meticulously discussing all kinds of shifting of figures from one committee to another and hinting at self-sacrificing readiness to reduce the apparatus which was not exactly bloated in the first place, to shatter the life of a typist or a consultant. It was as though Sychev were inviting the deputies to work with him on the staff roster. But the deputies were too sluggish in getting into the argument and without any enthusiasm voted for the reduction that was actually proposed by Sychev himself. They debated how best to use the funds allotted for the organization of deputy activity--to hire staff assistants for deputies or to distribute these funds so that the deputy could pay for his own one-time assistance within their limits. There is no big difference here. Deputy A. Kiselnikov somewhat "tore apart" the discussion of the estimated expenditures of the oblast soviet. He was put on his guard by the fact that the salaries of apparatus functionaries were very modest; the chairman's, for example, is little more than 300,000. But they actually receive much larger amounts. There is a system of various increments, including bonuses for intensiveness of work, material aid, etc. But in spite of their wishes the deputies were unable to find a great deal of excess in the actions of the soviet apparatus--they approved the estimate of expenditures. There was a more fundamental discussion which lasted both days of the session--about jurisdiction and cooperation between the oblast soviet and the oblast administration. In general Novosibirsk leaders, to their credit, have never become involved in dividing up power. They have calmly adopted the doctrine of separation of powers, dividing up responsibility without grievances. State organs at the regional level have hardly any rights at all. But it was not by their will that the situation changed. The new normative acts, above all the Constitution, without formally abolishing political slogans, including those about separation of powers, actually restructured the state mechanism, concentrating power and distribution functions actually in the hands of one branch--the executive. But what about popular rule? Write it off as a grimace of socialism? Nothing will be written off. It is simply that this concept in the political lexicon has unobtrusively been replaced by a more amorphous one--power not of the people but of representatives of the people. Let this representative power express its interests, but it shall have no active levers of power. But, paradoxical as it may be, at the same time the status of regional representative organs has become greater. Now the soviet's decisions of a legal, normative nature are being adopted in the form of oblast laws that are mandatory for execution, including by the oblast administration. To be sure, the mechanism for this kind of abiding by the law is fairly complicated. In particular, the laws adopted by the soviet at the session are leafed through and okayed for publication, and thus for enactment, by the head of the oblast administration. But not as an official but as a state organ (analogous to the president). Certain points of the Regulations of the Oblast Soviet which were discussed at the session turned out to be vulnerable. This document was certainly not for internal use. The chairman of the committee on legislation and interaction with organs of local self-government, V.Ye. Kuznetsov, defended the regulatory act he submitted for the consideration of the soviet. His cautious reaction to the active participation in the discussion of the document by the first deputy chief of the of administration, V.N. Kiselev, aggravated the situation to a certain degree. Kuznetsov perceived all of Kiselev's attempts to check one or another point of the document against the legal base as a attempt on the part of the administration to patronize the soviet. But Kiselev zealously defended the independence of the administration. The wording "to hear the report from the administration" evoked an immediate reaction: "name the document." Unfortunately, the oversight functions of the oblast soviet today are confirmed by only one law--"On the Kray and Oblast Soviet and the Kray and Oblast Administration," adopted back in pre-October times. It is difficult to understand why V. Kiselev had such a hard time with the word "report," especially to the people's representatives. For behind each deputy stand about 40,000 voters. And certain of them have the population of more than one rayon behind them. The debates with the administration represented by the first deputy chief continued even during the item-by-item reading of the Law "On Supporting the Activity of the Deputy of Novosibirsk Oblast" and they became even more heated upon the adoption of the Law on Legislative Activity in Novosibirsk Oblast. Oblast Procurator V. Tokarev, who often spoke as if in a duet with Kiselev, also reacted very strongly to the second document. "I do not want the soviet to put itself in a ridiculous position," Kiselev explained his rash reaction. But this could also be perceived as an attempt to distance himself from the soviet, assigning it a strictly advisory role in joint activity on oblast problems. But all the passions surrounding power become less respectable and petty when it comes to the budget. What is power without money? Illusion! In order to receive anything at all it is necessary to invest at least something. Before dividing it is necessary to multiply. Or at least save up. Money arises out of the production of goods and services. And in the past two years production has had a steady tendency toward decline. Hence the reduction of receipts into the revenue side of the budget. After all, most of the receipts are from taxes, and from enterprises--profit tax. And although unnatural savings from reducing production have unnatural qualities of a reverse dependency of the volume of production and profit (the lesser the volume, the higher the profit), the absolute amount of profit still decreases. And costs increase. The classical items remain and the exclusively modern, as it were, costs "of keeping body and soul together" are constantly growing. For both the producer and the consumer. In the draft budget submitted by the oblast administration for the consideration of the deputies one can see titanic efforts to reduce the budget deficit. The administration was able to take advantage of the rights granted to it for flexible use of the local taxation mechanism and submitted for the consideration of the soviet the oblast statute "On Rates of Tax on Profit and Tax on Property of Enterprises and Organizations and the State Duty on Registration of Enterprises With Foreign Investments." The oblast soviet approved this statute and gave its okay to further work in this area, in particular, for the development of differentiated taxation and the granting of tax exemptions in keeping with the priority areas of the development of the oblast economy. And the oblast priorities are apparent from the picture of expenditures that was presented. The oblast budget is to receive a total of only R970.461 billion in 1994. This includes transfers from the republic budget. The expenditure side is balanced with the revenue side. The following opinion was expressed at the session: Perhaps it is not worth it to live within our means and we should include all our real needs in the budget. That is, show the deficit in such a way as to complain to the federal authorities. Perhaps then they will bring our per capita consumption up to the average. After all, today all budget expenditures on one person of Novosibirsk amount to barely half of what a person from Omsk receives, and they cannot even be compared to what they get in Kemerovo. Our serious politicians from the oblast soviet decided not to play those cheap games and to conduct themselves in a businesslike manner: to spend what they get. The administration proposed a system of priorities for budget expenditures. Fully in keeping with the amendments to the economic policy and common sense, it suggested supporting the producer with any form of property. And of the producers the agrarians should be rescued first of all. In the draft budget proposed by the administration it was suggested that funds be especially allotted for advance sale of gain from the new harvest and support of animal husbandry so that in the future it would have strength enough to be revived. It was suggested that a subsidy of R100 billion be used for these purposes. Speaking at the session, the chairman of the Committee on Land Questions and Agrarian Policy, Deputy A.A. Stepanov, doubted the feasibility of giving priority to the agrarian sector, seeing in the draft budget further deterioration of the economic and particularly the financial situation of the rural commodity producer. If the consolidated 1993 budget envisioned for agriculture 13.4 percent of the overall expenditure side, in 1994 it was only 6.5 percent. On the whole, the expenditure side of the budget, taking inflation into account, increased 5.5-fold, and subsidies for the production of animal husbandry products--1.6-fold. Stepanov's arguments were knocked down by representatives of the administration, who found other figures for comparison--based on the real production volume, which had dropped sharply in agriculture during the year. But the remark was so out of the context of reality that nobody even bothered to object to Melnikov. The next heated point of the discussion was the allotment of 8 billion from the budget for private entrepreneurship. The deputies had not forgotten the first series of economic acts for support of private business, as a result of which state funds were simply squandered through private pockets. And this is why now the deputies demanded information about the existence of a program for private entrepreneurship. One can understand why the deputies were so meticulous in discussing forthcoming expenditures. As with wisdom: The administration was reminded of what it had "forgotten" and thus shortchanged many areas. Including culture, education, etc. After which followed V. Kiselev's explanation that in nature there are always two kinds of budgets: the budget of development and the budget of current maintenance. And for several years now we have been working exclusively on a budget for survival. But not having an opportunity to work for development, we are curtailing the possibilities of survival as well.
