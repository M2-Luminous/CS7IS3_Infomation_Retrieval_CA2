The favorite of diplomatic fortune, Vitaliy Churkin, having in a fit of temper deafeningly slammed the door, had only just vowed, it would seem, henceforward no more assistance for the cheaters--the Bosnian Serbs--and called once again for a march in single formation with the West before Andrey Kozyrev and Vyacheslav Kostikov hastened without delay to clarify the emotional statements of the Russian special emissary.... Hardly had the connoisseurs of world politics (even the venerable wolf Georgiy Arbatov) heralded in unison the start of a new cold war before Boris Yeltsin, following a night-time telephone conversation with the American President, was hastening to reassure us: There has not been nor is there any crack in the relations of the two countries. Up and down, up and down. The reason for the present "rough air" in Russian diplomacy is, in my view, the fact that some of the interests it is defending are irrational and that it is operating as yet, what is more, according to the "one down, two to carry" principle. This ailment is not new. Around the end of 1989 or the start of 1990 I, totally confused by the unintelligible foreign policy vocabulary, inquired of one of its creators: "How is the fact that the Warsaw Pact is changing from a military-political into a political-military organization to be understood?" "It is not," came the response. It is merely a signal that we are not to be feared." Simply a signal.... Serbia Passions It is hard to find a reasonable explanation or justification for the fact that in some parts of the world, where Russia's real interests are weak, Muscovite diplomacy is demonstrating effervescent activity, in others, on the other hand, where for the sake of the cause dispatch should be shown, an Oblomov-like unruffled composure reigns. Let us take the most burning example--Serbia. Historical ties to it had been erased almost completely in the national Russian memory. Throughout the period between the two world wars, particularly following the rupture of relations in 1948, Yugoslavia was de facto on the periphery of Soviet foreign policy interests. In 1981 the world was in a state of agitation as to whether Soviet troops would be entering a Poland infected by the rebellious spirit of Solidarity. Several years later there was anxious conjecture as to how the Kremlin would react to Budapest's statements of its desire for the disbandment of the Warsaw Pact. An invasion of Soviet tanks was never a serious threat to Yugoslavia, on the other hand, it was considered self-supporting. Its image in Soviet public opinion of the 1960's-1970's remained more symbolic than real: The supporters of a reform of real socialism wanted to see it as the embodiment of the open society and profound transformations, democracy, and prosperity, for the dogmatists, on the other hand, it embodied the betrayal of the socialist idea. Not just Yugoslavia but also other countries, with which we were linked far more closely in both the economic and military-political respects, Poland or Czechoslovakia, for example, were seen by the majority in the same symbolically simplistic manner, come to that. But in time Warsaw, Prague, Budapest receded into the background, into the "gray zone" of Russian interests. The people's orators are not making a clamor even about Bulgaria, Slav, Orthodox, and bound to Russia by historical ties, which currently seems particularly important to some people, nor are the Cossacks straining to go there. Around Yugoslavia, however, which has plunged into the tailspin of an endless bloody war, in which neither the just nor the guilty can any longer be discerned, truly unheard-of passions are raging in Muscovy. It is possible that these passions are so tumultuous for precisely the reason that they have merely a conditional bearing on their subject. Both the communists and the nationalists are pursuing in the new Yugoslavia their own, clearly expressed political interest: Mixing truth with invention, they are stylizing Serbia as the victim of a world conspiracy (imperialist and/or Yid-Masonic, Muslim--these are details according to taste) which has led to the disintegration of a formerly unified multinational state. How everything occurred in actual fact plays exactly no part at all. This is convincingly shown by both the confidences of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, rare in their ignorance, and the response to them of his supporters. They are seeking merely transparent parallels to first emotionally transfer Soviet-Russian reality to Serbia and then "accept the justice of it." And, of course, to bring it back to Russia--in the shape, for example, of "Karadzic's red folder," with which the Duma members are about to be gladdened by their colleague Marychev. After the Third Call Unfortunately, the main motif of the highly active Russian diplomacy in Bosnia also is not so much protection of the peaceful population and an end to the fratricide as, primarily, the self-assertion of Russia as a great power and emphasis of the range of its global interests. What was perfectly obvious previously also was confirmed once again by the comment that fell from Churkin's lips as regards the fact that Russia is not one of your banana republics. When, in the wake of our diplomacy's notorious Sarajevo triumph, the Bosnian Serb aircraft were shot down, this should have served as the "first call" for a conceptualization of the Balkan actions. But two more, loud and resonant, were required: the NATO bombing and Churkin's clash with the Bosnian Serbs over Gorazde, for the Foreign Ministry to take a time-out, and for the news media to pour cold water on Russian diplomacy. Perhaps this will bring it back to the soil of rationality. Although the coming Duma debate on Bosnia--against the background of the struggle for the signing of the Social Accord Treaty--is not all that reassuring in this respect. The question, however, is how this rationality is to be understood and what sort of practical steps ensue from it. It is possible to swing to the opposite extreme and argue: Since Russia has at this time no priority national interests in the former Yugoslavia, it should pull out the peacekeeping formations from there--and the sooner, the better. Since there is nothing there by which we may "profit," let us at least make a show of our pacifism. It is somehow awkward even inquiring: Is it merely a question of the fact that Slavs and Orthodox are dying in Bosnia? The war is carrying away human lives and crippling people's futures. And it is for this reason, not on account of some ideological chimeras or sovereign-power considerations, that Russia should not, of course, abandon its efforts for an end to the war in Bosnia. Whether they require the presence of Russian "blue helmets" or not, how long the presence of Russian soldiers is needed there and on what terms--this derives from the main thing: concerted actions with other countries of the world community attempting to untie the Bosnian knot. Doing this is hard enough as it is, but if, in addition, Russian great-power ambitions come to be interwoven in it, this knot altogether could not fail to become Gordian. An end to the fratricide in the former Yugoslavia is undoubtedly in our interests. Not, moreover, irrational and "perverted" but entirely real--both general and palpable, material--inasmuch as we could in peacetime trade and cooperate without regard to blood and soil--with advantage and in the open (not as now, in secret, under the cover of "third countries"). `Russia in a Crowd' But let us take another problem--the absence for Russia of allies outside of the CIS. Each in its own way, but almost all political forces of the country--particularly in connection with the prospect of the expansion of NATO and the Partnership for Peace program--are speaking about the threat of strategic isolation and about a Black Sea-Baltic cordon sanitaire allegedly threatening to cut Russia off from Europe. This question requires action and serious decisions, but what is not there is not there. Truly, the USSR's former Warsaw Pact allies and the Baltic countries are reorienting at full speed toward the West. Fear of Russia, even if deliberately stoked by politicians, has nonetheless become a phenomenon of the mass mentality, which it would be impermissible simply to brush aside. It is at times so deeply rooted in the national memory that it cannot be simply rationalized just like that, overnight. An example is Poland, which was divided three times, by Russia and Prussia included, and a fourth time by the USSR and Germany, which subsequently swallowed up its eastern neighbor also. The Poles hated and feared the Germans no less than the Russians. But in recent years--and not only on account of the Deutsche mark but mainly owing to the perseverance of the German Government and the public--the picture has begun to change. And Russia? Infrequent and unsuccessful, inadequately prepared visits. Proposals not meeting with a response in society, the absence not only of a formulated policy but even of a real desire to formulate it. And, most important--a dialogue with the United States or Germany over the heads of the small Central European or Baltic countries, to whom their ridiculously insignificant place in world politics is without compunction pointed out at every available opportunity. I quote Andranik Migranyan, a member of the Presidential Council: "...we can no longer be first in line at NATO's doors. These doors are already surrounded by Romanians, Estonians, Slovaks, and Czechs. Ukrainians, Latvians, and Lithuanians are straining to get there also. It would be amusing to see what Russia, militarily still a superpower, would look like in such a crowd, where everyone is shouting about the threat emanating from Russia and for this reason wishes to lean against the powerful shoulder of NATO in the search for a guarantee of his territorial integrity and security.... Russia could hardly be the same type of candidate as, for example, Estonia and Poland, and Russia would hardly have the same commitments to the world community as the countries that have today swarmed all over NATO's doors." Justifying to a group of German and other West European politicians and scholars Russia's desire to obtain special status in the Partnership recently, Duma deputy Vyacheslav Nikonov (Party of Russian Unity and Accord) returned several times to one and the same purely hypothetical situation, which was, he believed, to have demonstrated the absurdity of the desire to put vast Russia on a par with some small country: "NATO decides, say, to stage exercises of a peacekeeping force in Abkhazia. When the decision is being made, what, would the vote of Iceland, merely because the latter is a full member of NATO, outweigh that of Russia?" In the Language of Prince Gorchakov A preoccupation with the dimensions of Russia and a reluctance to evaluate them anew and find some basis for dialogue with the Central European and Baltic countries are irrational and lead, therefore, to an impasse. This, in fact, is the result at which Migranyan also arrives: "The analysts who say that in not having affiliated with the Partnership for Peace program and, subsequently, NATO also we would be condemning ourselves to strategic isolation are absolutely right. But it is just as correct also that in having consented to participate in the Partnership for Peace program with the preservation of the NATO bloc, which would decide who could become a full member of the bloc and when and how, we would find ourselves isolated." There is no solution, apparently, other than a cold war, for from the flight of the sovereign-power bird only NATO and Russia are visible. The rest are not worthy of attention, a trifle thronging around doors and deserving, at best, cross-guarantees. It would be more correct to call such a position not isolation but self-isolation, and self-isolation on account of inordinate great-power arrogance. Are We Condemned to a New Version of the Cold War? In American policy in respect to Russia also elements of irrationality are quite strong: Not all that comprehending of our chaos, the Americans, in defiance of their own rules, are oriented not so much toward structures as toward persons whom they consider influential. One Russian analyst recently even devoted an unusual article to the "Chernomyrdin phenomenon" and to his possible influence on the process of the adoption in the United States of decisions concerning Russia. With this approach the cooling in Russian-American relations, which is pronounced even now, could result in an abrupt and swift deterioration and breakdown. This has not yet happened, and the slide toward a new version of the cold war is not a fatal necessity which cannot be avoided. But a mutual misunderstanding between Russian and European (both West and Central European) politicians and political scientists is growing increasingly distinctly. Some are speaking increasingly often in the language of the geopolitics of the start of the 20th century and even Prince Gorchakov, others, in the language of international law. But even in recognizing strength they refer primarily to economic strength. Irrationality, unpredictability, fraudulent signals--these are the anti-values of the European diplomacy of our day, that which could merely repel the Old World from us. Russia is facing one of the most critical foreign policy decisions in its history. At a fork in the road.
