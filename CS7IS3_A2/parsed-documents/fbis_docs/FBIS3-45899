After Central Military Commission Chairman Jiang Zemin exhorted the vast number of commanders and fighters, especially high-ranking officers, of the armed forces in telling them they must strive to study modern technology, especially high and new technology, the offices of all PLA headquarters, military colleges, and field units alike have all launched programs for studying high technology.
