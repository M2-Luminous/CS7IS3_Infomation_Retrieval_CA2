The text of the document introduced by ANPP President Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada underscores the need to guarantee strict control of the implementation of the national budget at every level: [Begin Alarcon recording] It asks the provincial and municipal assemblies to systematically audit the implementation of the budget in every region and promote the measures necessary to reduce expenses and increase revenues. It charges the ANPP Standing Commission for Economic Affairs, in close cooperation with the Finance and Price Ministry, with directing the fulfillment of this task. It highlights the importance of the accords adopted by the workers assemblies to promote economic efficiency and those accords that will be further developed through the assemblies, to be held from this date on, at work centers. Likewise, it highlights the decisions approved by cooperative workers and those to be promoted by the Farmer's Honor and Pride assemblies, which are about to begin. It determines that deputies, provincial and municipal delegates, and People's Councils are to be closely tied to these processes, and supports them in their contributution to the development of a powerful, effective, and systematic movement of the working masses in order to promote, from the base, collective initiatives to rationally use available resources, increase labor discipline and morale, adopt possible actions to increase efficiency, and audit compliance. Our working people, who honorably confront the current adversities, have expressed their categorical rejection of the unscrupulous activities of those who have become wealthy, or intend to do so, at the expense of the sacrifice of the majority, and have demanded energetic action against those manifestations and their perpetrators. As a result, the ANPP charges the Council of State and Government with adopting, as quickly as possible, every measure necessary, including those that might have an exceptional character, to eradicate those activities in the shortest possible period and exemplarily sanction the people involved. The ANPP, likewise, charges the government with adopting decisions to systematically reduce the subsidies to cover losses of enterprises and other budgeted expenses, as well as increasing state budget revenues to significantly reduce the fiscal deficit. To attain the stability of funds deposited in the People's Savings Bank [BPA] in correspondence with decisions affecting the volume of cash in circulation, while preserving the integrity of the BAP and savings incentives. To establish measures promoting adequate control of the circulation of hard currency in the country, ensuring that the goals for which this circulation was authorized is fulfilled, and corresponding with measures adopted to streamline national finances. To introduce essential production incentive mechanisms to promote an increase in the offer of products and services to the population at appropriate prices to stimulate the streamlining of national finances. To study price and tariff increases on selected products and services taking, into account the feasibility of increasing prices on consumer items -- basically, nonessential products such as cigarettes and alcoholic beverages -- and tariffs in certain service categories such as public food services, transportation, and electricity, as well as charging for gratuities. To gradually implement a new comprehensive tax system, taking into account indispensable elements of social justice to protect the lowest income sectors, stimulate work and production, and contribute to balancing national finances. To study the selective introduction of a tax on personal income, excluding taxes on salary retributions, as well as increasing other taxes, rates, and contributions to state revenues. To also study, in this regard, charging a tax for the use of aqueduct and water service, as well as having the workers contribute to the financing of social security. To examine the feasibility of a change of currency to complement measures to be implemented at the opportune moment. Adopting other measures that, within these proposals, in the opinion of the government, are considered adequate and effective toward streamlining national finances. The actions undertaken, and those to be taken in the future, require the understanding and support of our people. These will lead us to gradually overcome the current difficulties and will allow us to preserve the work created with everyone's effort, assuring for Cuba an even more just and noble future. We call on everyone today to persevere in the heroic resistance, to redouble daily efforts, to continue demonstrating the undefeatable strength of our patriotic and revolutionary will, to continue fighting united to save our fatherland, Revolution, and socialism. National Assembly of the People's Government, 2 May 1994. [end recording] Commander in Chief Fidel Castro gave an address following the approval of the accord.
