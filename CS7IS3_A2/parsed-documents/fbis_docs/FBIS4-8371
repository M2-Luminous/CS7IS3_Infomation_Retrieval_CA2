The Cabinet members take turns in answering journalists' questions. Topics include crime, social welfare, unemployment, foreign relations, the Slovak Government's appeal to heads of district offices, and the progress of parliamentary debate on the government's policy statement. On the subject of Slovakia's relations with Hungary, Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan is asked about an election campaign speech by Hungarian Prime Minister Peter Boross, in which Boross says he is the spiritual prime minister of 15 million Hungarians. A journalist asks Kukan: "What is your view of this stance, this statement, when considering the prospects of the development of our neighborly relations with Hungary?" Kukan gives the following response: "This is one of the easier questions. Elections in Hungary are approaching, and, thus, all opportunities are being used to attract votes, and the issue you spoke about is naturally very topical, given the internal political situation in Hungary. "We have said several times that we are interested in an uninterrupted dialogue with Hungary, in a calm and matter-of-fact dialogue, not an emotional one. I heard about the Hungarian prime minister's statement, and my understanding is that he really means some sort of a spiritual leadership of the Hungarians living abroad. As far as I know, in the same speech, he also said Hungary recognized the existing current borders. From our point of view, this is the decisive thing. "Our view is that the issue of the borders' inviolability is the fundamental question as regards development of our normal, good-neighborly relationship with Hungary. All other questions will start from there. In our diplomatic relations, we have consistently returned to this issue, and we will insist on resolving it in a way satisfactory to Slovakia's interests. We believe we will succeed in resolving this issue in the future, on condition, naturally, that Hungary will meet us halfway because this is what Slovakia is doing--showing willingness to hold talks and not closing communication channels. "If we succeed in resolving the issue of the inviolability of the borders in a way satisfactory to Slovakia's interests, I believe our relations with our Hungarian neighbor will have the space to develop in a normal way."
