[Ruehe] Good evening, Mr. Wickert. [Wickert] Mr. Ruehe, what do you feel, personally, after such an attack [on Sarajevo]? [Ruehe] Already, over the past few days, particularly when I saw the dead children -- I have children of the same age -- I thought this was absolutely terrible. But the massacres are getting worse and worse, and I believe that we will lose our credibility if we do not, finally, implement new measures now. [Wickert] As defense minister, what would you personally like to do now? [Ruehe] The United Nations must determine without a doubt who is responsible for this massacre, and then, I think, the Security Council and the secretary general must consider measures to end those horrendous massacres. We cannot act on our own. Last summer NATO declared its readiness to act on the order of the United Nations, but it is absolutely true that if the international community tolerates such massacres right in the middle of the civilized world, in the middle of Europe, without doing anything about it, then we all lose our credibility. [Wickert] We always hear the United Nations, the United Nations, the United Nations. What would you, as German defense minister, like to do now? [Ruehe] Well, I would not react as you do, because the United Nations is the only organization with the legitimacy to give the go-ahead to military actions. [Wickert] The United Nations is not an anonymous instrument; the United Nations also includes Germany, and for once Germany could exert political pressure. [Ruehe] No, the Security Council, of which we are not part, is called on to act, as is the UN secretary general. I agree, however, that German politicians should make it clear to the United Nations that one cannot simply proceed with the planned agenda after such massacres, and that new measures must be implemented now. [Wickert] What new measures? [Ruehe] I believe the United Nations must threaten military sanctions, and these threats must be carried out in the event of a violation. [Wickert] This means, for example, air strikes. [Ruehe] It may mean that. Air strikes have never been ruled out in the past. I remember that last summer there was discussion about measures being necessary if Sarajevo remained under fire or was being strangled. [Wickert] But they were not implemented. [Ruehe] No, they were not implemented, and after this massacre the credibility of the United Nations is at stake. What else needs to happen before we take action that will truly deter those who commit such horrendous massacres. [Wickert] Are you not afraid that once again nothing will happen? [Ruehe] Actually, I cannot imagine that after this escalation of violence one can simply proceed with the planned agenda, because peace is becoming increasingly difficult. How is there to be a peace treaty? After all, a political solution is the only hope. People have to live together once again in this part of Europe. How is this to be possible, if one does not react clearly to such massacres? [Wickert] Thank you very much, Mr. Ruehe.
