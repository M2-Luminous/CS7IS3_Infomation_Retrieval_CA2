We experienced the first serious conflict with politics in November, as a result of Wieslaw Walendziak's nomination as chairman of the new public television, Sulik recalls. In his view, it is an excessive simplification to perceive the conflict that then began as a war between Lech Walesa and the National Council. There are a number of other strategists and tacticians at the Belweder Palace and elsewhere who are personally engaged in this rather one-sided war. At its roots there lies the characteristically Polish shock of discovery that a constitutional body, born from a law that is democratic in letter and in spirit and as an independent body, may behave and function independently. It transpires irrefutably from the reaction of the Belweder Palace that our decision disappointed their expectations, Sulik claims, referring to the granting of the nationwide broadcasting concession to "PolSat," and stresses that the preferences of the president and his people were never specified by name. It is possible to presume, from incidental evidence, that they would look with favor upon the continued presence in Poland of "Polonia 1" and UFY, that is the German concern of Bertelsmann, now associated with Marian Terlecki's "Antena 1." Instead of having a serious critique of the council's decision or a discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of the various applications, we have a campaign of insinuations, denunciations, and defamation. It is Sulik's judgment that, over a year of activity, the council has surely committed not a few errors, but, in the state's interest, it has bravely skirmished and continues to skirmish with the greedy and ruthless pursuit of personal interests. Sulik appeals to his countrymen who feel anger, if they have maintained the capability to do so, at glaring cases of cynicism in political life, which is how democracy is functioning.
