The stalled Japan-U.S. economic framework talks are likely to resume prior to another round of Japan-U.S. summit talks scheduled for July following informal contacts between the two countries. Recently, the U.S. Government has conspicuously softened its tough trade stand on Japan. If both Japan and the United States agree to formally resume the stalled framework talks after ending a "cooling-off period," this could generate a sense of optimism currently lacking in the minority Hata government, whose future remains uncertain. A top Foreign Ministry official, known for his cautious comments, said on the evening of 12 May: "There has been no fundamental change in the U.S. stand on trade with Japan, but it is seeking to reach agreement with Japan on resuming the stalled framework talks." He also did not deny that the climate surrounding Japan-U.S. relations has taken a favorable turn. He made the comments because the two countries have confirmed the need to try to formally resume the stalled framework talks prior to the G-7 talks (the Naples summit) scheduled for July. Efforts so far include a telephone conversation between Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata and President Clinton, and a meeting between Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa and U.S. Ambassador to Japan Mondale. The situation in the United States has changed the climate surrounding the framework talks. Government officials in charge of the framework talks point out that the United States needs coordinated action from Japan to help stabilize U.S. financial and stock markets. In the United States, prices for the dollar, bonds, and stocks have plummeted. Fearing a crash in the international value of the dollar, Washington has asked Japan and European nations to intervene in foreign exchange markets to halt a further slide in the dollar's value. Through financial policy coordination with Japan and Europe, the United States has managed to avert a financial crisis. Some government officials now say: "For the time being, the United States will not take any steps to further appreciate the yen." The reason, they say, is the fear that appreciation of the yen could spark inflation in the United States and fresh economic friction with Japan. And there is also growing criticism of the Clinton administration's Asia policy in the United States and this must not be overlooked. An incumbent assistant secretary of state has made remarks linking criticism of China's human rights record to the issue of renewing China's favorable trade status, the Clinton administration has mishandled a caning incident involving an American youth in Singapore, and it has taken a tough trade stand against Japan in the framework talks. These issues are each targets of the criticism. The administration has been harshly criticised for its less than adroit handling of diplomacy toward Asian nations and disarray has surfaced within the administration over its Asia policy. Government agencies have been complaining that the U.S. Trade Representative, in charge of handling trade matters, has taken unilateral action without regard for the importance of bilateral relations between Japan and the United States, thereby worsening relations with Japan. A government source says that, as the November, off-year elections draw closer, "The Clinton administration sees it a good policy to proclaim victory in the economic dispute with Japan." Foreign Minister Kakizawa has said: "Our immediate diplomatic task is to patch up sour Japan-U.S. relations." The Japanese Government intends follow this line and capitalize on the softened U.S. trade stand on Japan.
