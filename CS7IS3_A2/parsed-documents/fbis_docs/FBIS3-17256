A number of important bilateral documents aimed at developing cooperation between the two countries were signed on Wednesday evening. At a solemn ceremony in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana Madariga and Vice-Prime Minister Syzdyk Abishev and Foreign Minister of Kazakhstan Tuleutay Suleymanov signed a declaration on the principles of mutual relations between Kazakhstan and Spain, a treaty on mutual encouragement and protection of investments and an agreement on cooperation in the spheres of economy and production. The declaration emphasised that political, economic and social changes taking place within the international relation framework should be accompanied by more closer cooperation between the two states in the interests of ensuring peace, stability, progress and social well-being of their people. The document reflects aspirations of the two countries to develop international cooperation in the spheres of education, culture, protection of the environment and fight against drug trafficking. Addressing a press conference, Solana and Abishev emphasised that the signed documents open new prospects for mutual cooperation in many spheres. Notwithstanding the interest displayed by both sides in the development of trade and economic ties, the turnover between Spain and Kazakhstan was worth only 181.5 thousand U.S. dollars in 1993. This entire sum was spent on imports of foodstuffs from Spain. Only two Spanish-Kazakh joint ventures out of a total 2,000 registered in the republic have been set up. These figures cited by Abishev also had their impact on journalists.
