Frequent concern has been voiced that the trend may delay the economic recovery. However, such views are wrong. The reason is that the cause of rising interest rates is based on the expansion of government spending as part of the comprehensive economic package. Even if the effects of expanded effective demand based on government spending are erased by rising interest rates, we should not experience additional negative effects. In reality, it is not unusual for government spending to cause a rise in interest rates. In fact, that phenomenon conforms with the theory of macroeconomics. In closed economies which shut off transactions with outside economies, rising interest rates lead to constraints on private-sector investments and, as a result, the effects of effective demand created by government spending is erased. This phenomenon is called "crowding out." In open economies such as that of Japan where capital transactions with foreign nations are unregulated, rising interest rates, assuming unchanging interest rates in other nations, causes an inflow of capital. This causes Japan's currency to rise in value and for a shrinkage of international payments surpluses. In other words, the crowding out of foreign demand results in erasure of the effects of effective demand expansion based on government spending. There is the possibility that actual trends will not follow this scenario because U.S. interest rates are rising sharply during this cycle, although there will be the effect that the yen will rise if Japan does not expand its government spending. However, during spring of 1993, the situation developed along the lines of the above theory. First, under the comprehensive economic package a conspicuous increase in public works investments was implemented from the fall of 1992. Increases of 3.4 percent and 7.0 percent were recorded in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 1992 over the same periods the prior year. During that period those increases were in sharp contrast with negative growth in private-sector investments. However, long-term interest rates began to rise in February and the value of the yen rose in foreign exchange markets. And, the international payments surplus shrank substantially by 27.1 percent in the first quarter of fiscal year 1993 below the same period in 1992. Gross domestic product showed negative growth during the period. Thus, in those economies where interest rates float freely, government spending increases do not have an expansionary effect on the economy. Accordingly, there is no significance in expanding government spending for the sake of economic measures, while the same can be said of cuts in income taxes. However, this is not to say that expansions in government spending are unnecessary. The reason is that shrinkage of the international balance of payments surpluses translates into the diversion of capital from overseas investments to domestic capital formation, especially social capital formation. Looking at the situation in Japan today, such a trend is desirable. The reason for that statement is that Japan's social capital is in such a miserable condition. This can be said most aptly in terms of social capital governing lifestyles in urban areas. Sewer systems, road systems, and neighborhood parks are inadequate, while commuter trains provide conditions which are basically inhuman. Fortunately, Japan today has the macroeconomic resources to invest in such areas. The reason for that is that the savings rate is high, which is exemplified by none other than the international payments surpluses. Aging of the population will lead to the rapid decline in those favorable conditions. It is our responsibility in relation to future generations to improve social capital and leave a legacy of quality assets, while the savings rates are still high.
