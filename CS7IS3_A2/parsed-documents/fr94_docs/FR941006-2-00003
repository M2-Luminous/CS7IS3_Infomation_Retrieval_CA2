FR941006-2-00003 FR941006-2-00002 DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Agriculture Marketing Service [DA&hyph;93&hyph;06] Milk for Manufacturing Purposes and Its Production and Processing; Requirements Recommended for Adoption by State Regulatory Agencies AGENCY: Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. ACTION: Notice of intent to amend. SUMMARY: This document proposes to amend the recommended manufacturing milk requirements (Recommended Requirements) by reducing the maximum allowable bacterial estimate and somatic cell count in producer herd milk, and by reducing the maximum allowable bacterial estimate in commingled milk. In addition, this proposal would modify the follow-up procedures when producer herd milk exceeds the maximum allowable bacterial estimate. The proposal to reduce somatic cell count and bacterial estimate was initiated at the request of the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture (NASDA) and was developed in cooperation with NASDA, dairy trade associations, and producer groups. DATES: Comments should be filed by December 5, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should be sent to: Director, Dairy Division, Agricultural Marketing Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, room 2968&hyph;S, P.O. Box 96456, Washington, DC 20090&hyph;6456. They will be made available for public inspection at the Dairy Division in room 2750&hyph;S during regular business hours. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Roland S. Golden, Dairy Products Marketing Specialist, Dairy Standardization Branch, USDA/AMS/Dairy Division, room 2750&hyph;S, P.O. Box 96456, Washington, DC 20090&hyph;6456, (202)720&hyph;7473. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Under the authority of the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946, the U.S. Department of Agriculture maintains a set of model regulations relating to quality and sanitation requirements for the production and processing of manufacturing grade milk. These Recommended Requirements are available for adoption by the various States. The purpose of the model requirements is to promote, through State adoption and enforcement, uniformity in State dairy laws and regulations relating to manufacturing grade milk. In July 1992, the Dairy Division of NASDA passed a resolution recommending that certain milk quality requirements be tightened. The Dairy Division of NASDA requested that the maximum allowable bacterial estimate in producer herd milk be reduced from 1,000,000 per ml. to 500,000 per ml. and that the maximum allowable somatic cell count in producer herd milk be reduced from 1,000,000 per ml. to 750,000 per ml. (The changes for somatic cell count only apply to milk from cows, not milk from goats.) The Dairy Division of NASDA also requested that the maximum allowable bacterial estimate in commingled milk be reduced from 3,000,000 per ml. to 1,000,000 per ml. Their desire to have these changes were further reinforced in a resolution passed in July 1994. In this resolution, the Dairy Division of NASDA requested that USDA expedite the printing of this proposal.
