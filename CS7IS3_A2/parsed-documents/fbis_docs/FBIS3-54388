[passage omitted] Political and media circles in Algeria are asking on the eve of the national conference about the "new successor" of 'Ali Kafi, chairman of the Higher State Council [HCE], whose term terminates on 31 January. Abdelaziz Bouteflika (foreign minister in the days of the late President Houari Boumedienne and member of the FLN Central Committee) is still the name mentioned in official state circles in Algeria, especially after his meeting with the military establishment and his "temporary" nomination to lead the transitional phase. A reliable source has told AL-HAYAH that the military establishment has accepted the conditions set by Bouteflika. They are: 1. To appoint him by the military establishment as president, and that his appointment should not be based on a proposal from the national conference scheduled to be held tomorrow. 2. To grant him all the powers granted to the president of the republic in accordance with the present Constitution. He does not accept the formula for collective power sharing represented in the five-member Higher State Council or the one proposed in the "document on the dialogue terms," which stipulated the existence of one or two vice presidents. 3. To work in accordance with the present Constitution, which should not be amended. And the "document on dialogue terms" should not be adopted as a new constitution. 4. To grant him full powers to appoint or dismiss the prime minister. 5. Not to impose on him the formula proposed in the "document on dialogue terms" with regard to the transitional national assembly appointed by the parties, organizations, and associations participating in the national conference.
