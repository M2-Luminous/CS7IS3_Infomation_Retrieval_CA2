Members of parliament adopted as well an appeal to the Federation Council and the State Duma of the Russian Federation, asking them to "refrain from the ratification of a full-scale treaty between Russia and Georgia until a complete settlement of Ossetian-Georgian relations and not to regard the republic of South Ossetia as part of the Republic of Georgia." In its turn, the Information and Press Committee of South Ossetia circulated today a statement of the republican parliament, which pointed out that the signing of the Russian-Georgian treaty "while the problem of the status of South Ossetia has not yet been resolved, is direct violation of the previous four-party agreements. This infringement on the rights of the Ossetian people will inevitably lead to the escalation of violence in the Republic of South Ossetia and around it."
