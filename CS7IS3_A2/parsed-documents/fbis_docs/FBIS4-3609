Ltd, that he hopes that Mr. Cheng would more actively participate in governmental and political affairs and in making contacts with overseas people. Li, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), made this remark today while meeting Cheng, who came here to attend the second session of the 7th national conference of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce. The chairman, also a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party's Central Committee, reaffirmed that it remains a leading policy that an economy of public ownership co-exists with multiple sectors of the economy with the former as the dominant part, which is an important part of Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. During the past few years, Cheng, also an advisor on Hong Kong affairs, extended his concern and support to the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, which is considered as a representative of non-public economic sectors in China. Cheng said that he will continue his efforts to contribute to China's economic construction and Hong Kong's stability and prosperity. Wang Zhaoguo, vice-chairman of the National Committee of the CPPCC, also attended the meeting.
