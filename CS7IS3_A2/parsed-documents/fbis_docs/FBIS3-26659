In particular, the formal meeting between President Jiang Zemin and President Clinton in Seattle last November has brought about a new and excellent beginning [yi ge xin de liang hao kai tuan -- 0001 0020 2450 de 4104 5328 1170 7030 4551] to the relationship between the two countries, which is of important significance to improving and developing their bilateral relationship. Li Daoyu made the above remarks this evening in his Spring Festival greetings message to Overseas Chinese and Chinese Americans in the United States. He added: "It is our hope that both sides will seize this turning point [qi ji -- 1148 2623], maintain the emerging excellent momentum in the bilateral relationship, and proceeding from the overall situation and long-term interests and through carrying out a dialogue marked by mutual respect and complete equality, further improve and develop the bilateral relationship." When touching on the concern of the broad mass of Chinese Americans and overseas Chinese for the great cause of the peaceful reunification of the motherland, he pointed out that achieving the peaceful reunification of the motherland is the common aspiration of all the Chinese in China and overseas. Creating "two Chinas," "one China, one Taiwan," and "one country, two governments" runs counter to historical trends and to the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation. He continued: "We hope that the Taiwan authorities will stress the great cause of the Chinese nation and will, under the one-China principle, realize the direct contacts between the two sides of the strait as soon as possible, so as to eventually pave the way for peaceful reunification." In the same greetings message, Li Daoyu briefed overseas Chinese and Chinese Americans on China's achievements in reform, opening up, and economic construction last year. He also expressed sincere thanks for the valuable contributions that overseas Chinese and Chinese Americans have made to China's reform, opening up, and economic construction, to the great cause of the reunification of the motherland, and to enhancing understanding and friendship between the peoples of China and the United States.
