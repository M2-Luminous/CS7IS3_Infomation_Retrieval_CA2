So far, no European houses have been broken into but some grenades have exploded against their facades. It appears they are settling a domestic score. In my conversations with others, it appears that there are three warring factions in Kigali at the moment: The presidential guard avenging the president's assassination; the Rwandan Army trying to restore order; the FPR [Rwandan Patriotic Front], which has split up from the CND [National Development Coucil] and intervened in the conflict. The three parties are firing on each other right now.
