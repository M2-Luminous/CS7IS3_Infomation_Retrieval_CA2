On Friday, 22 April, in the Kremlin, President Boris Yeltsin summoned the leaders of the parliamentary factions, the representatives of the church, and government officials. At the meeting, where the draft of an agreement that, as has been envisaged by economists, would soothe political disagreements, and prompt a harmonized Russia peacefully to develop further, Yeltsin's most vociferous opponent, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, took part. Three months have passed since our last conversation on the premises of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR], a dilapidated old house on Stepenkiy Square. He arrived at the party's new headquarters in the Mir Hotel, next to the building of the former CEMA [Council for Mutual Economic Assistance], the current Duma, visibly exhausted by lengthy assembly debates and talks in the Kremlin. Beside the new LDPR headquarters, many things have changed since January. Among his closest aides, who are making a much more civilized impression now, there are almost no old faces. Although his attitudes remain the same, Zhirinovskiy appears to be more composed than before. He is lacking the severity that used to emanate from each movement, word, or look of his. It seems that he is even trying to wash his hands of some of his earlier uncontrolled statements. "Our attitude has always been against any military intervention on any Serbian territory in the former Yugoslavia, particularly against any involvement by NATO," Zhirinovskiy says about the NATO air strikes against the Bosnian Serb positions. "We are explicitly against it, and we have been saying this for four months now. I have said even today to our president that we ought to take a clear stance regarding the protection of our Christian Orthodox brothers in the Balkans and Yugoslavia," he says. [Djuric] You said that if it came to air strikes against the Serb positions, cities of NATO member countries would have to pay the price. Recently it did come to air strikes against the Serbs.... [Zhirinovskiy] That is my personal position. We shall be urging our government to take the appropriate measures. When our delegations come back from Serbia, we shall propose that the Duma lifts the economic sanctions against Serbia. We are ready to exert further pressure on our government to take a firmer stance, to forbid any bombing of Serbian towns. We are sticking to that stance. However, we are an opposition party, rather than the executive body, so we shall be pursuing our policy in the future as well, and we shall not give up. [Djuric] You were a vehement critic of the official Russian policy on the problem of former Yugoslavia. How do you assess the roles of the president and the foreign minister today? [Zhirinovskiy] Their policy has started to change in the last two months. They have taken a stance closer to the Serbs, as much toward the United Nations as toward the Muslims and other participants in the Yugoslav conflict. However, we still consider their stance to be weak, and they should take a firmer one. We have demanded many times that the foreign minister be replaced. I also demanded this in the Duma last week, and yesterday as well, while today I said in the Kremlin that we ought to have a different foreign policy, particularly with regard to the former Yugoslavia. I think that the wrong attitude of our diplomats is best illustrated by Kozyrev's completely unprofessional attitude. The role given to Churkin does not correspond to reality at all. And now the minister's deputy [Churkin] is behaving like an offended little girl. The best and the only way is to lift the economic blockade against Serbia and Montenegro. One should start commercial exchanges, conclude military-political agreements, our army should be sent to Serbia, and only then will the final score be positive for Serbs. There is little use in the negotiations and conferences that Yeltsin is interceding for. So far all the conferences and all the negotiations have eventually collapsed, and the war has continued. Today I proposed to Yeltsin that we could accomplish peace in the Balkans by sending our troops in the region. We have considerable troops in Germany -- 300,000 soldiers and officers. We could send them to the Balkans, rather than back to Russia. In that way the issue would be solved, provided, of course, that the Serbian republics consented to this. [Djuric] Aleksandr Rutskoy and Ruslan Khasbulatov have been released from prison thanks to your party's votes. Have there been any changes on the Russian political stage caused by their release? [Zhirinovskiy] No, their release has not influenced the political situation in Russia at all. However, I think that, from the psychological point of view, the situation is much better if you do not have political prisoners. Khasbulatov has completely abandoned politics, and will not be engaged in it, or involved in any political activities. As for Rutskoy, he is resting. He is at home, and is not influencing political life in any way. [Djuric] Your visits to Serbia and Montenegro have caused many controversies. It has been noticed that no officials received you.... [Zhirinovskiy] We went there on invitations by certain parties, associations, and movements. That was not a part of the program and was not necessary.... We simply visited our Serbian friends, and followed the program that they prepared. The basic intention was to visit different regions, and to make contacts with the local population. That was our first visit, and was highlighted by our participation at several big rallies -- in Vukovar, Montenegro, and Herzegovina. We did what the program anticipated by our friends expected us to do. I see nothing peculiar in this. If parliament invites us (our second delegation went to Serbia following an invitation from parliament, whereas even now our delegation is visiting parliament), we shall also go there. On 8 May we shall be there again, and everything depends on what sort of program is anticipated by those who invite us. [Djuric] In Serbia much attention has been paid to your cooperation with the party led by Zeljko Raznjatovic Arkan, as well as to the so-called secret Elipton weapon that you gave him. Why did you decide to cooperate with that particular man, and why did you give that mysterious weapon to him, rather than to somebody else? [Zhirinovskiy] It is our military experts, our supporters, who were also there with us, who gave him the weapon. We just connected them with Arkan, and we have nothing against their exchange of experience or assistance aimed at improving the defense ability of Serbian territories. We have several naval officers, submarine commanders, who are ready even to deploy their submarines in the Adriatic Sea, and carry out attacks against the NATO air bases from which planes assigned to bomb Serb positions take off. That was the officers' personal initiative. We are a political party, and we do not take part in such activities. However, those officers are so eager to help, that, as far as I know, they already have a plan to carry out counterattacks against NATO bases. [Djuric] Your visit to Zagreb had been announced for a long time. Why did you cancel it, and when will it eventually come about? [Zhirinovskiy] In Zagreb, there is a dispute in the leadership. Some people want me to visit them, others are hesitant. Besides, I am waiting for public opinion to mature. As far as I know, for the time being there is no acceptable solution between the Serbs and Croats, and I would not like the Serbs to think that I want to make some agreements with the Croats. I have plenty of time. If it is their good will and desire, I shall visit them, but my policy remains unchanged -- giving support to our Serbian Orthodox brothers. [Djuric] The state Duma has been discussing the problem of former Yugoslavia for several days. What can be expected after the return of the delegation of the Duma that is now touring the former Yugoslav republics? [Zhirinovskiy] The basic goal of our party is that our activities in parliament result in a decision to lift the sanctions, and in the government's undertaking concrete steps aimed at the improvement of the situation in the Balkans. We shall do anything that we are required to. We were told: If there had not been these latest events in Gorazde, in two weeks the sanctions would be lifted. That is what they are saying now. The fact is that even if there had not been those clashes, the sanctions would probably not have been lifted anyway. It is hard to judge how realistic the option was. But the tendency to speed up the possible lifting of the sanctions does exist. [Djuric] You are saying that you were told that the sanctions might have been lifted. Do you think that the Serbs made a mistake by attacking Gorazde? [Zhirinovskiy] I do not think so, and I cannot accuse anybody here. That is a matter for the Serbs. Still, our experts at the Foreign Ministry believe that if the events in Gorazde had not happened, the question of sanctions would have been settled in the shortest possible time. That is what they are saying now, but, perhaps, they are simply deceiving us. [Djuric] In addition to Arkan's party, which other Serbian political parties do you cooperate with? What sorts of cooperation do you exercise, if there is any cooperation? [Zhirinovskiy] Our relations are the same with all the other parties. We do not interfere in the internal affairs of Serbia. When some parties invite us, we go there, and make contacts.... And whether we have any particular preferences -- no, we do not! Those are internal affairs of Serbia. We have the same attitude toward each of Serbia's political parties.
