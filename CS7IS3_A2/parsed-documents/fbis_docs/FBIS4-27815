"Deregulation will contribute to a swift adjustment of Japan's economy" as structural economic changes proceed worldwide, the central bank in its annual review of monetary and economic developments for the fiscal year through March. It said easing curbs that cause economic inefficiencies will help bring balance to what it called Japan's excessive savings and insufficient investment. That would address the structural element of Japan's large external surplus, it said. Japan has amassed a large external surplus while domestic "social infrastructure and housing stock are relatively poor by international standards," the report notes. As trade expands with the booming economies of East Asia, the report says, deregulation will help allocate resources more efficiently, improving purchasing power through lower prices and expanding business opportunities and new industries, it says. The report notes the hollowing out of Japanese industry, with auto and electrical appliance production shifting to East Asia as the yen surges and those countries augment their low-wage advantages with increased technological capability. Japanese manufacturers are thus under pressure to emphasize "technology-intensive goods production," the BOJ says. The high yen, lower overseas costs and deregulation are forcing prices down in the nonmanufacturing sector, it says. That will boost real household income eventually but force more corporate restructuring, the report says. Adjustments in the global industrial structure, as well as domestic stock and balance-sheet adjustments, have prolonged and deepened Japan's recession, the report says. In judging Japan's economy, the report mirrors other recent assessments by the BOJ and its governor, Yasushi Mieno. "A greater number of economic indicators have recently improved, and the economy appears to have stopped weakening," it says. "The pace of recovery will likely be slow, however, in light of balance- sheet adjustments and the drastic changes in the industrial structure that are underway." With their balance sheets battered by bad loans left from the collapse of the late 1980s speculative "bubble," financial institutions have been less able to take risks, the report says. That apparently contributed to low fiscal 1993 growth in bank lending and money supply, it says. But "the extent to which the balance sheet problem has influenced economic growth is uncertain," the report adds. The BOJ also says banks and other institutions "seem to have become more willing to enhance long-term competitiveness by making active writeoffs" of the bad loans they hold. But it says more time will be needed to finish writing off the bad loans. Rises this year in long-term interest rates reflected a market correction from earlier large falls and the rises were sustained by hopes of economic improvement, it said. The BOJ's own record-low discount rate and other easy money policies have "given underlying strength to the economy" by boosting housing investment and corporate profits and laid the grounds for corporate and financial restructuring, the report says.
