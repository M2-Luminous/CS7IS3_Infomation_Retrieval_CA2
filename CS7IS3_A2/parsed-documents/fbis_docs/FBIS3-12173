What is your position? [Peres] They went too far this time. They want to bring disaster to the Jewish nation. These people represent everything which contradicts the moral stands of Jewish people, not to mention the political stands. In no way should we let this go without a response. We must not be intimidated by them. They must not be given a free hand. The damage they have caused is hard to imagine. You know, on occasion, the settlers compare themselves with those who have been working the land in Israeli kibbutzim and moshavim. In 80 years of our settling this land, there was never an incident such as shooting at university students, at a bus, or at worshipers who pray in the Cave of the Patriarchs from the back. These are terrible phenomena. And what makes the blood boil even more are the pictures of the people who speak with near satisfaction about the incident. This group is a disaster for the Jewish people. They should be barred from having any possibility of using firearms. [Dan] Many practical questions emerge now regarding the means that should be taken against this population. There is talk about disarming them, deporting them, placing them under administrative detention, and so on. What do you think? [Peres] I say that the most far-reaching steps should be taken, naturally subject to legal considerations. This morning, at the cabinet session, I will hear the legal considerations. [Friedman] Meaning that you first want to hear out the attorney general? [Peres] Absolutely. [Dan] Let us be more specific: Should they be disarmed? [Peres] I would not want to engage in this. A minister should not discuss this on the radio; we have a cabinet session for this. I do not believe that every minister should point to his personal position. The government should take a bold, serious, far-reaching stand. The disaster is twofold: One is what they did, the other is our fearing them. This is a disaster as well. [Friedman] Do you regret today the move of a previous government in which you served to set up the settlement of Qiryat Arba' at the heart of Arab Hebron. [Peres] What difference does it make today? The reason to set up Qiryat Arba' was to avoid settling in the heart of Hebron. Eventually, they set up Qiryat Arba' but also settled in Hebron. Everything we were afraid of actually happened. We knew in advance that a settlement in Hebron would lead to bloody events. We knew it was only a matter of time before they take place and cast a shadow on the whole enterprise. Therefore, even if such a decision was made, it was carried out in a twisted manner. [Friedman] And now, Mr. Peres, there is a political process at the end of which, when the negotiations are completed, a Palestinian autonomy will be set up in the territories. Do you believe such an autonomy can be effectively managed in a way that would eventually lead us to a comprehensive peace agreement with the Palestinians, when such a nucleus resides in the heart of Arab Hebron? Or should they be evacuated from there? [Peres] This nucleus will not manage the State of Israel nor the policy of Israel. This is not the first time that Jewish factions depart from the nation. We will not allow such people to manage the State of Israel, on its or on our behalf. The appropriate measures should be taken. We are not a miserable nation. We have the power not to allow murderers to represent the Jewish people.
