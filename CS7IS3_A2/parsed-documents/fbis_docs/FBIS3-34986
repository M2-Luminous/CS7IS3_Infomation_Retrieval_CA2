It also shows the extent of popular resentment to the concessions that were made and to full compliance with Israel's "security" conditions and requirements. While the Cairo agreement's content proves the veracity of the Palestinian democratic forces' analysis of the Oslo-Washington accord and its substance, represented in the redeployment of the occupation--not its withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho--it also clarifies the dimensions of the Oslo accord and the ensuing dangers for the future of the land, the cause, and Palestinian rights. Moreover, it removes all the wrapping from demagogic statements that have sought to present the accord in favorable light and convey the opposite of its content. In return, this grave development in a series of retreats before Israeli conditions opens the way to expanding and organizing the popular movement opposed to the accord through the inclusion of new forces and figures in the ranks of this movement. After the announcement by some forces and personalities, especially the People's Party and Dr. Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi, of their opposition to the Cairo agreement, the DFLP's invitation to them to join the ranks of Palestinian democratic forces and the large national opposition force derives renewed credibility. This invitation aims at establishing the broadest alignment to defend Palestinian national rights and the future of the land, of Jerusalem, and of the people in the homeland and the diaspora. It also has to confront, isolate, and foil the Oslo-Cairo agreement in preparation for providing alternative conditions ensuring a comprehensive solution that responds to the resolutions of Palestinian, Arab, and international legitimacy.
