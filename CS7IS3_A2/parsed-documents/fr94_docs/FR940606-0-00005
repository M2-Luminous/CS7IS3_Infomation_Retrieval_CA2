FR940606-0-00005 FR940606-0-00002 The economic impact on the domestic cattle industry if TB-infected brushtail possums and hedgehogs from New Zealand were imported into the United States would be severe. The annual costs in New Zealand for possum damage (for example, damage to the environment and bovine TB attributable to the brushtail possum), disease surveillance, control and research probably exceed $20 million. According to the Fish and Wildlife Service, there are probably two known importers of brushtail possums and hedgehogs from New Zealand. These importers would be considered small entities under the Small Business Administration criteria. Although the Fish and Wildlife Service could not provide data on the actual number of imported brushtail possums and hedgehogs imported from New Zealand into the United States by these importers, the Service has stated that these animals represent a very small percent of the total number of animals imported into the United States by these importers. Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

This rule: (1) Preempts all State and local laws and regulations that are inconsistent with this rule; (2) has no retroactive effect; and (3) does not require administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court challenging this rule.
