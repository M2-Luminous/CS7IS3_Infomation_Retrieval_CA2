Not Hong Kong's young people, it seems, who quake at the thought of a job in government. No challenge, no prospects, they claim. With rumours rife of a mass exodus from the ranks in the run-up to 1997, more than a few eyebrows in Government House are bound to be raised by a survey suggesting there will not be many willing to fill the void. The Secretary for the Civil Service, Michael Sze, told legislators on Thursday there was sufficient existing talent who could be promoted to fill vacant senior posts. But a poll of 513 people between the ages of 15 and 29 showed more than half had no intention of applying to join the civil service. Only 30 per cent wanted to join, the survey conducted by the Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups showed. "The poll indicates that a smooth transition is still of great concern to the young people in the run-up to 1997," a spokesman said.
