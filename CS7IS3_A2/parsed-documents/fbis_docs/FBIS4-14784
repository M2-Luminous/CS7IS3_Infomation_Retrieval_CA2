The main goal of the visit was to sign an agreement with the Armenian military in accordance with which Armenia's state border [not further specified], which is about 300 km long, will be defended by Armenian troops and Russian border troops. The agreement is the result of repeated meetings and talks between the two sides, and it gives a legal basis to the real state of affairs concerning the border troops. [video shows scenes from the talks, Col. Gen. Andrey Nikolayev being interviewed] [Begin Nikolayev recording] It is very important for the men in uniform, the Russian border guards, and Armenian citizens that they will now be fulfilling this task together, although frankly I would like to say that we began doing this work earlier but that we did not have a sufficiently firm legal basis for this. Today we also examined the question of the material and technical provision and the financing of the groups of border troop units, (?including) the Armenian group. [end recording] The commander added that despite the critical situation in the republic, the Armenian Government is doing everything possible for the normal functioning of the border guards in terms of providing the necessary electric power, fuel, and food. There are sufficient quantities of arms and ammunition.
