On the other hand, he added, naval experts are apprehensive that the document opening the road to understandings on the Black Sea Fleet, can be doomed to the same fate as the Massandra Protocol singed by the two leaders last September, as well as earler understandings on this difficult problem. Incidentally, the protocol had clear benchmarks. Experience showed that the adoption of documents does not mean real moves by the Ukrainian side to settle the fleet's problems. Military sources in Moscow and Sevastopol report that pressure on Russian servicemen continues in Izmail and Ochakov even in the course of ten days which were given to draft an agreement on the division of the Black Sea Fleet, in order to force them to take the oath of allegience to Ukraine. Earlier, similar attempts were made in Odessa and Nikolayev. Military experts believe that the Moscow agreement on the Black Sea Fleet has quite a number of "reefs". They note that, under the agreement, Sevastopol, the main base of the Black Sea Fleet, is not to have facilities of the Ukrainian Navy. But it is highly improbable that Kiev will agree to this, although it understands that the two powerful administrative structures cannot rub elbows endlessly. The cost of the Black Sea Fleet is another difficult problem to be tackled by Ukraine and Russia while settling the destiny of the fleet. One can count on serious progress in this sphere only after the fleet's assessment as well as the calculation of damage inflicted by Ukraine on Russia by "the lop-sided privatisation" of fleet ships (the figure reached 60 in two years' time). Experts stress that the fate of the Black Sea Fleet can be sealed only on certain conditions which Ukraine should fulfill. For instance, it should not take lop-sided actions which will challenge the sincerety of the negotiating process. That was the essence of the warning issued by the Russian president's press secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov on April 16 who said that the Ukrainian side, applying its usual "oozy" manner, started interpreting the understandings reached by the Russian and Ukrainian presidents in Moscow. It began putting forth its own formulas concerning the lease, its periods and places of the fleet's deployment even before talks provided for by the agreement started.
