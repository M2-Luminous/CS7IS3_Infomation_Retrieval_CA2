The source justified this by saying the delegation came to Khartoum on its own initiative, not at the invitation of the Sudanese Government. Sudan had invited irrigation experts in Egypt to discuss a number of cooperation projects between the two countries, but it did not allow the delegation to enter and gave no reason. The delegation returned on the same plane. It is known that Sudan recently seized a number of buildings where Egyptian irrigation engineers lived in the Sudanese capital.
