No. 250␣/␣Friday, December 30, 1994␣/␣Rules and Regulations OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT 5 CFR Part 315 RIN 3206&hyph;AG55 Career and Career-Conditional Employment AGENCY: Office of Personnel Management. ACTION: Interim rule with request for comments. SUMMARY: The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is issuing interim regulations to continue existing requirements under which career-conditional employees acquire career tenure and reinstatement eligibility. At present, these requirements are in provisionally retained chapter 315 of the former Federal Personnel Manual. Issuance of this interim rule will prevent a lapse in Governmentwide requirements when chapter 315 expires on December 31, 1994. DATES: Interim rules effective on January 1, 1995. Comments must be submitted on or before February 28, 1995. ADDRESSES: Send or deliver written comments to Leonard R. Klein, Associate Director for Career Entry, Office of Personnel Management, Room 6F08, 1900 E Street, NW., Washington, DC 20415. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Lee Edwards on 202&hyph;606&hyph;0830, TDD 202&hyph;606&hyph;0023, or FAX 202&hyph;606&hyph;2329. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Regulations covering career-conditional appointments in the Federal service are in 5 CFR part 315. The career-conditional appointment is the initial permanent appointment to competitive service positions. Upon satisfying certain conditions, a career-conditional employee acquires career tenure, which provides higher retention standing and unlimited reinstatement eligibility. Currently, 5 CFR 315.201(a) requires 3 years of creditable service for an employee to acquire career tenure. Section 315.201(b) provides that OPM will publish in the Federal Personnel Manual the conditions under which service may be credited in meeting the 3-year requirement. As recommended by the National Performance Review, OPM abolished the Federal Personnel Manual (FPM) in December 1993. At the time, FPM Chapter 315 on the career-conditional appointment system was provisionally retained through December 1994 to enable OPM to issue regulations to replace needed instructions found only in the FPM, including the conditions under which service is credited toward career tenure. The FPM instructions also specify the conditions under which reinstatement eligibility of career-conditional employees may be extended beyond the 3-year period set in 5 CFR 315.401. Reinstatement eligibility permits an individual to be rehired without competing in a competitive civil service examination. (Career employees and preference eligible career-conditional employees have unlimited reinstatement eligibility.) On October 20, 1994, OPM issued proposed revisions to conditions for acquiring career tenure and reinstatement eligibility (59 FR 52925). Because the comment period ends on December 20, 1994, OPM will have insufficient time to issue final rules on that proposal to be effective January 1, 1995, and prevent a lapse in Governmentwide requirements for career tenure and reinstatement. To assure that employees continue to acquire career tenure and reinstatement eligibility under the same set of conditions, OPM is adopting in 5 CFR part 315 the existing requirements for career tenure that are in section 2&hyph;4, subchapter 2, and for reinstatement eligibility in section 4&hyph;2, subchapter 4, of the provisionally retained chapter 315 of the former Federal Personnel Manual. Changes from the FPM instructions are limited to editorial revisions and inclusion of existing requirements in interchange arrangements with other merit systems that OPM approved under 5 CFR §6.7. Waiver of Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and Delay in Effective Date Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B), I find that good cause exists for waiving the general notice of proposed rulemaking. Also, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3), I find that good cause exists to make this amendment effective in less than 30 days. This regulation is effective immediately to continue existing longstanding rules from the Federal Personnel Manual that determine employees' retention standing and eligibility for reinstatement. It would be contrary to the public interest to allow these Governmentwide rules to expire when the Manual expires on December 31, 1994. The delay in the effective date is being waived to prevent any lapse in coverage of these rules. Regulatory Flexibility Act I certify that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because it pertains only to Federal employees and agencies. List of Subjects in 5 CFR Part 315 Government employees.
