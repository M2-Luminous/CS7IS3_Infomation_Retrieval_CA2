Any final decision on this proposal will take into consideration the comments and any additional information received by the Service, and such communications may lead to the adoption of a final regulation that differs from this proposal. The Endangered Species Act provides for a public hearing on this proposal. The Service plans to conduct a public hearing, and the dates and location will be announced at a later date. Requests regarding a public hearing must be received within 45 days of the date of the proposal. Such requests must be made in writing (see ADDRESSES section). National Environmental Policy Act The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment, as defined under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, need not be prepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuant to section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. A notice outlining the Service's reasons for this determination was published in the Federal Register on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244). References Arnold, R.A. 1981.
