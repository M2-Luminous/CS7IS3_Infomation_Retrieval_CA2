Indeed, the issue has reached the point of laying siege to a Jordan Television [JTV] crew that was trying to film the ships that have been intercepted without encroaching on the security measures required by the Americans. AL-BILAD's information has confirmed that more than one military boat circled the JTV crew and seized their cameras. It was not until a final intervention that the television crew, their cameras, and the rest of their equipment were released. Official Jordanian sources kept the report a secret. However, other reliable sources told AL-BILAD that the case is not over and that upon the request of the Information Ministry, the Foreign Ministry took quick measures that could lead to more tension in the relations between Washington and Amman. This tension was clear in His Majesty King Husayn's statements the week before last when he said that Jordan will not go to the negotiations unless the Americans and their allies find a suitable solution to the inspection operations, which have taken a serious course that encroaches on Jordanian sovereignty.
