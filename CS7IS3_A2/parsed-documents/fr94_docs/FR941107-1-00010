FR941107-1-00010 FR941107-1-00004 Discussion On August 23, 1993, the FAA issued AD 93&hyph;17&hyph;04, amendment 39&hyph;8674 (58 FR 47036, September 7, 1993), applicable to all British Aerospace Model BAe 146 series airplanes, to require repetitive eddy current or ultra high sensitivity penetrant inspections to detect cracking of the upper main fitting of the nose landing gear (NLG), and replacement or repair of cracked parts. That action was prompted by reports of cracking in the main fittings of the NLG. The actions required by that AD are intended to prevent failure of the main fitting, which could lead to collapse of the NLG during landing. AD 93&hyph;17&hyph;04 is applicable only to British Aerospace Model BAe 146 series airplanes. Since issuance of that AD, however, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority for the United Kingdom, has advised that additional airplanes may be subject to the same unsafe condition addressed by the existing AD action. Further analysis has indicated that cracking of the upper main fitting of the NLG may occur on all British Aerospace Model Avro 146&hyph;RJ series airplanes. British Aerospace has issued Revision 2, dated July 10, 1993, of Service Bulletin S.B. 32&hyph;131. The inspection procedures described in this revision are identical to those described in Revision 1 of the service bulletin (which was referenced in AD 93&hyph;17&hyph;04). This revision only expands the effectivity listing to include additional airplanes. The CAA classified this service bulletin as mandatory. This airplane model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of Section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the CAA, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require repetitive eddy current or ultra high sensitivity penetrant inspections, and replacement or repair of cracked parts. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously. This proposed rule would be applicable only to Model Avro 146&hyph;RJ series airplanes. ( Note: The FAA's normal policy is that when an AD requires a substantive change, such as a change (expansion) in its applicability, the ``old'' AD is superseded by removing it from the system and a new AD is added. In the case of this AD action, the FAA normally would have proposed superseding AD 93&hyph;17&hyph;04 to expand its applicability to include Model Avro 146&hyph;RJ series airplanes as the additional affected airplanes. However, in reconsideration of the entire fleet size that would be affected by a supersedure action, and the consequent workload associated with revising maintenance record entries, the FAA has determined that a less burdensome approach is to issue a separate AD applicable only to these additional airplanes. This AD does not supersede AD 93&hyph;17&hyph;04; airplanes listed in the applicability of AD 93&hyph;17&hyph;04 are required to continue to comply with the requirements of that AD. This proposed AD is a separate AD action, and is applicable to all British Aerospace Model Avro 146&hyph;RJ series airplanes.) The FAA estimates that 3 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 2.5 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $60 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $450, or $150 per airplane. The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. The Proposed Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89.
