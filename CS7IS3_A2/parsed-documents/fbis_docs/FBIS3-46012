But government help is needed to further adapt them to the market economy, economists say. A recent survey conducted by the Fixed Rural Observation Post Office (Fropo) under the Agricultural Ministry confirms this view. China set up fixed observation posts 10 years ago in 312 villages. "The posts aim at collecting firsthand information for decision- makers drafting rural policies," said Fropo director Yu Zhan, the survey creator and one of the analyzers of the report. Fropo's survey covered 7,012 rural households in the 312 villages. All the questionnaires were filled out and returned. The survey found 58 percent of Chinese farmers have more decision-making power, allowing them to decide what crops to plant, how many and how to plant. Before the implementation of rural reform, the State told farmers what to plant. It was the sole supplier of production materials and monopolized the purchase of farm products. Thirty-three per cent of the respondents said they have full autonomy over the sales of their crops after fulfilling the State quotas on grain and cotton purchases. And farmers now buy most of their production materials from the market, according to the survey. In 1992, the average rural household spent 756 yuan ($87) on production materials and 90 percent of the cash was spent in the market. The survey also found 61 percent of the households in favour of diversified channels to get farm production materials. They said that it would lower prices, increase product variety and force State dealers to improve service. In addition, the survey found that farmers have more channels to get production funds, instead of taking out loans from banks and credit cooperatives alone. In 1992, the average household borrowed 423 yuan ($49) for production accounting for 21 percent of the cash needed. Of that total, 185 yuan ($21), or 44 per cent of the money, came from banks and credit co-operatives, and the rest came from individual lenders. The survey shows that households engaged solely in farming borrowed the least. Their borrowings accounted for only 16 per cent of the cash they needed in annual farm production. Households which owned land but did not engage in farm production borrowed the most. Their borrowings accounted for 38 percent of the cash they needed in their annual production. Unlike other households they also paid interest to the lenders. They usually lease the land to other farmers and start private businesses of their own, in their hometowns or in urban areas. "The finding reveals that the appearance of non-agricultural sectors has boosted fund circulation in the countryside and that a rural financial market is emerging," Yu said. Before the rural reform, farmers were not allowed to leave the land to look for jobs elsewhere. But in recent years, an increasing number of farmers are migrating from underdeveloped regions to developed areas. "Because China has more people and less arable land, it's necessary for surplus farmers to shift to non-agricultural industries or where they're needed. And rural-urban migration may result in the formation of a rural labour market," said Zhao. But farmers are not all accustomed to the market economy, partly because of poor government guidance and service. According to the survey, in 1992, 13.8 per cent of the decision- makers in rural households were still illiterates, 41.5 per cent were elementary school graduates, 34.5 per cent were junior high school graduates and 10 per cent were senior high school graduates. Only 3.9 per cent of them received vocational training. Poor education and the deep-rooted influence of the planned economy cause many farmers to respond slowly to the market economy. To help farmers enter the market, the government has to offer farmers timely, accurate information and to establish more markets for farm products. The survey shows that information is what farmers need most in the current market economy. "They do not know what may sell well on the market. This often leads to stockpiles," said Yu. According to the survey, in 1992, 38 per cent of crude drugs, 36 per cent of oranges, 30 per cent of hemp, 17 per cent of timber, 15 per cent of oil bearing crops and 13 per cent of corn production were stockpiled because of the information shortage. Because of backward transportation, inadequate warehouses and poor processing skills, many farmers have to sell their products cheap locally. Three hundred and six households which specialized in transporting farm produce to other regions for sales complained about too many roadblocks and wanton charges.
