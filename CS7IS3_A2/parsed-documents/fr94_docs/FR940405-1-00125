Should such training be provided periodically, or would initial training suffice? (3) Is it necessary, as proposed, to require that all employees in the facility be informed of the contents of the standard and of signs and symptoms associated with building-related illness? Why? Why not? Recordkeeping, Paragraph (h) (1) Will retention of records, as proposed, enhance the potential for reducing indoor air quality problems? Will retention of maintenance records, IAQ compliance program records, and records of employee complaints serve as necessary documentation upon which actions and decisions can be made to improve deficiencies found in facility air quality? If so, how will these records serve that purpose? (2) What length of time should the records required to be established under this proposal be required to be retained? Is OSHA's proposed 3-year retention period reasonable? Why? Why not? Should different retention periods be specified for each particular record, and if so, why?

What other mechanisms are available to ensure that the facility-specific records remain at the building or facility in the event of tenant turnover? Dates, Paragraph (i) Is it feasible for employees to fully implement the provisions of this notice within one year of the effective date, as proposed? Why? Why not?
