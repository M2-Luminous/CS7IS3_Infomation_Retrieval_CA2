FR941220-1-00086 FR941220-1-00012 B. Rule 138 Safe Harbor Rule 138 under the Securities Act permits publication of information, opinions and recommendations concerning qualifying issuers by broker-dealers that are participants in a distribution, so long as the reports contain information, opinions or recommendations regarding a specified class of the issuer's securities which is not the subject of the offering in which the broker-dealer is a participant. The rule defines eligible issuers as those that may register securities on Forms S&hyph;2 9 or F&hyph;2. 10 The reference to Forms S&hyph;2 and F&hyph;2 is intended to include issuers eligible to register on Forms S&hyph;3 and F&hyph;3 as well. Questions have arisen as to the availability of the Rule 138 safe harbor for offerings registered on Form S&hyph;3 where issuers have not been subject to reporting requirements for 36 months. The Commission did not intend to change the availability of Rule 138 for those offerings when it reduced the reporting history requirements for Form S&hyph;3 11 and is of the view that Rule 138 is still available for offerings registered on Form S&hyph;3. Rule 138 is proposed to be amended to clarify this point. The Commission is also proposing to amend the rule to clarify that Form F&hyph;3 eligible issuers would qualify for the rule, as would qualifying first-time foreign issuers that meet the alternative offshore trading history test proposed for Rule 139. 12 9 17 CFR 239.12. 10 17 CFR 239.32. 11 17 CFR 239.13 as amended by Release No. 33&hyph;6964 (Oct. 22, 1992) 57 FR 48970. 12 In Release No. 33&hyph;6550 (Sept. 19, 1984) 49 FR 37569 at footnote 26, the Commission stated that ``[b]ecause the markets for nonconvertible senior securities and common stock differ, Rule 138 provides a somewhat broader safe harbor [than Rule 139] in circumstances where the opportunity to condition the market is lessened.'' In addition, in light of the fact that shelf registration statements often register both debt and equity securities (on an either allocated or unallocated basis), the Commission is proposing to add an instruction to Rule 138 to codify the staff interpretation that the rule should be applied on an offering-by-offering basis for issuers which are eligible to use Forms S&hyph;3 or F&hyph;3 and are using the Commission's shelf registration procedures. II. Cost-Benefit Analysis To fully evaluate the costs and benefits associated with the proposed amendments to Rule 138 and Rule 139, the Commission requests commenters to provide views and empirical data as to the costs and benefits associated with such proposals. III.

This certification, including the reasons therefor, is attached as Appendix A to this release. IV.
