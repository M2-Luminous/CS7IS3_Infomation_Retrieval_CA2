Cristiani stated during a news conference that the reports that appeared in the 4 January edition of U.S. daily "THE WASHINGTON POST" which includes recently declassified documents on the past Salvadoran conflict, is based on "unconfirmed" information. The U.S. newspaper pointed out that in May 1984 former President Ronald Reagan sent Vernon Walters, a veteran diplomat and former military officer, to meet with D'Aubuisson, founder of the government party Arena, to warn him that he would be held accountable for any attempt against Pickering. According to the newspaper report, Walters warned D'Aubuisson that any attack on Pickering, who had received threats from right-wing death squads "would result in all U.S. aid being terminated." However Cristiani, although acknowledging that General Walters' visit to El Salvador had taken place, explained that it was to discuss issues related to selecting a provisional president as a result of the crisis taking place at the time. Alvaro Magana was finally selected as provisional president. He added that Walters met with the Major D'Aubuisson, who died in 1992, because as president of the National Assembly he was at the time one of the principal players in national politics and there was urgency to search for a person "agreeable to everyone to occupy the presidency while the constitution was being drawn up." The Salvadoran president regretted that U.S newspapers published only "one-sided information" and added that he has documents declassified by the United States and he could also refer to the thousands of murders involving the former Salvadoran guerrillas. Cristiani criticized an alleged propaganda campaign unleashed against Arena and emphasized that all the documents carry a warning heading to the effect that the U.S. State Department does not guarantee the accuracy of the information, and that it is simply information gathered by chance. In November 1992, U.S. President Bill Clinton declassified a large number of confidential documents related to the Salvadoran conflict (1980-92) which has caused some controversy in El Salvador after being published in U.S newspapers.
