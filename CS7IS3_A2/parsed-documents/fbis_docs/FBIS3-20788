"We do not know that such gold exists at all in our main branch for Serbia, but we will seek an answer and will inform you about it," was the response. Answering the question whether, with the adoption of the new law on the National Bank of Yugoslavia and the transformation of republic national banks into its branches, the former banks of Serbia and Montenegro had merged all their foreign exchange reserves with those of the country, Gazivoda answered tersely: "They have not, in spite of our demands. We will persist with them." Otherwise, the value of the 251 kilograms of gold that Dafina Milanovic deposited at the beginning of 1993 as security for credit at the National Bank of Serbia -- which still existed at that time -- and on the basis of which she received a 450 billion dinar short-term credit, calculated at the average price of gold at the London stock market, is a little less than 5 million German marks.
