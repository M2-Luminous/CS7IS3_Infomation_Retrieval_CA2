They discussed bilateral relations between China and the United States and some international issues. Rong first expressed his appreciation over the important role played by former U.S. President Nixon, who passed away recently, in opening the door of Sino-U.S. relations and in pushing the normalization of formal relations between the two countries. Rong Yiren said: Dr. Kissinger, as an assistant to Nixon then, has also made great contributions in this aspect. Rong Yiren said that China hopes to see a peaceful and stable international environment and that differences between China and the the United States should be solved through discussions and consultations on an equal footing. Kissinger said he hoped that U.S.-China relations would be improved and developed in a constructive way, and the trade between the two countries should also be separated from human rights and all other issues. He believed that the two countries can cooperate in a friendly manner and in a still wider sphere. The meeting proceeded in an extremely warm and friendly atmosphere.
