[Cetin] The Islamic states should do more than they have done so far. We criticize other organizations which only issue resolutions but we in the Islamic Conference Organization [ICO] are also giving the impression that we are only issuing resolutions. We should do more than that. We should take tangible measures. [Dirgham] What kind of measures, in your view? [Cetin] More financial aid, for instance, to enable Bosnia-Herzegovina to move toward solving some problems. We have frequently decided to provide such aid but we never came close to producing important tangible results. We repeatedly made pledges but no satisfactory results or measures have come of it. Another example of what I mean by tangible measures is that we should pay much attention to the current proposals for a permanent peace. There is talk about a four-month cease-fire to push the Serbs toward a peaceful settlement. In that context, we should draw up a plan for having the military embargo practically lifted if that attempt fails. [Dirgham] You mean arming the Bosnian Muslims despite the embargo? [Cetin] If the four-month cease-fire idea does not produce the desired results we should make an active and effective initiative and declare that Article 51 of the UN Charter gives us the right of joint defense of Bosnia-Herzegovina. [Dirgham] What does Turkey want from Iraq? You call for an end to the oil embargo against Iraq on the one hand and you violate Iraqi air space to hit the Kurds in the north on the other, despite the fact that you are partners with the United States, Britain, and France in the air exclusion zone operations in northern Iraq. [Cetin] I do not believe that there is a contradiction there. We have fully explained that we care about the territorial integrity, sovereignty, and safety of Iraq. We attach great importance to their continuity. Turkey has explained to everyone, and to whomever it may concern, that Iraq must remain united and that the present borders will never change. At the same time we believe that the Kurdish groups in northern Iraq should hold a dialogue with the Iraqi authorities to find solutions to their problems. We want that dialogue but the situation in northern Iraq is not stable. The Iraqis have promised us that they will not take any measures against the Kurds but the problem is that we do not know and will never know which party is going to take measures nor do we know the nature of such measures. We do not want to be faced again with the problems we faced in northern Iraq. That is why we are a part of the operation to "provide comfort" for the Kurds in northern Iraq. As regards the question of lifting the oil embargo, our view is that the Iraqi people are suffering as a result of the continuation of the embargo and that Iraq has complied with Resolution 715 (continuous inspection and verification of the Iraqi war machine) but it has to comply with the other resolutions, particularly the one on the border with Kuwait, and it should clearly declare its acceptance of Kuwait as an independent sovereign state in order to leave no pretext for preventing the lifting of the oil embargo. [Dirgham] There is a disagreement or difference between the position of Turkey and that of the Gulf states regarding the question of lifting the embargo. Turkey is trying to convince Washington of the need to lift the embargo in implementation of Article 22 of Resolution 687 and for reasons connected with Iraq and Turkey, but the Gulf states oppose the lifting of the embargo. [Cetin] We have explained that there is no connection between the Security Council resolutions and the authority in Iraq. It is not up to the United Nations or any state to decide who should run and rule Iraq. Only the Iraqis can make that decision. That is why we do not approve of the inclusion of personal aspects in the issue. We believe that there is commitment to the principle which is that the oil embargo on Iraq should be lifted. That is what we say most clearly to the Americans and others. There is no resolution stipulating Saddam Husayn (should stay or go). Furthermore, Turkey is suffering economically as a result of the oil embargo. We and the Iraqi people are being continuously punished through the embargo. [Dirgham] How do American officials react to your views? How do you read their position? [Cetin] If Iraq complies with the Security Council resolutions, they (the Americans) would not be able to stand in the way of the consequences of such a move. [Dirgham] Do you mean implementation of Article 22 which lifts the embargo? [Cetin] Yes. A number of Security Council member states, such as Russia and France, are more inclined toward that idea. Our view is basically that the oil embargo should be lifted when Iraq complies with the relevant resolutions. [Dirgham] The general impression is that Turkey is committing massacres against the Kurds in northern Iraq and that you are exploiting the political situation to serve your own objectives. [Cetin] That is not true. Our relations with (Mas'ud) Barzani and (Jalal) Talabani are very good, and we cooperate with them. What is happening has nothing to do with massacres. Some terrorist groups cross our borders, terrorize and kill people, and then withdraw. [Dirgham] But you are burning villages and killing innocent people. Is that a result of the failure of the policies of the Kurdish leadership represented by Talabani and Barzani? [Cetin] They need our cooperation and we need their cooperation. It is not true that we are burning villages. We are facing terrorist organizations. Every state has a right to deter terrorist practices. [Dirgham] Is Syria cooperating with you to your satisfaction? Your relations with Syria had undergone some tension.... [Cetin] Relations are now better than before. [Dirgham] And with Iran? [Cetin] We have good relations of cooperation and dialogue in the context of combating terrorism. We cooperate closely and there is an effective mechanism between officials in charge of security. We have very good cooperation. With Syria we have a general agreement and the situation is now improving. [Dirgham] Do you mean that relations with Syria have improved but not to a satisfactory level of cooperation? What are the difficult problems between you? [Cetin] I think we have to wait and see what tangible results emerge. There is information that the leader (of the Kurdish Workers Party) is still in the area (of al-Biqa' in Lebanon), but the Syrians are willing to cooperate with us. The Turkish interior minister visited Syria in the middle of this month and returned with very satisfactory results. We continue to tackle this problem in cooperation with our neighbors. [Dirgham] What do you discuss with the Israelis, as far as the roles of Turkey and Israel in the region are concerned? Will your relations with Israel be relations of rivalry, or complementary? [Cetin] It is not a question of rivalry. We believe that we have a special role to play by virtue of our close friendship and fraternity with the Arab states, and our relations with Israel are good at the same time. We seek to play an important part in the context of the peace process for a better future for the Middle East. [Dirgham] Do you discuss with Israel a relationship that would make you share control of the region? [Cetin] Not at all. We intend to cooperate with the other states in the region. When I met in Romania with (Palestinian President) Yasir 'Arafat and (Israeli Foreign Minister) Shim'on Peres, we agreed that it is necessary to cooperate and to ensure wider cooperation among all parties in the Middle East. [Dirgham] It seems that Turkey has failed to have the influence it had hoped to have on international affairs, and you seem to have internal problems preventing you from achieving your objectives. You are weaker than Greece in the European context and much weaker than the Russians as far as influence in Caucasia is concerned. Where is Turkey's power today? [Cetin] Turkey is a big state which emerged after the Ottoman Empire. We have historical links with the states and peoples of the territories which once belonged to the Ottoman Empire. That is why we seek to play a constructive and peaceful role in connection with these states. [Dirgham] It has been claimed that Tansu Ciller's government is not strong and that there are attempts to change it. Are there such attempts? [Cetin] No, we are a democratic state and everything is done on a democratic basis.
