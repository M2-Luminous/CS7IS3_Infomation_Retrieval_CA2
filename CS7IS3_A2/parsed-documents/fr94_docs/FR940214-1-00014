FR940214-1-00014 FR940214-1-00004 (b) Shipping agents. (1) The Cooperating Sponsor may appoint a shipping agent to assist in the procurement of ocean transportation. If a shipping agent is to be used, the Cooperating Sponsor must nominate the shipping agent in writing to the General Sales Manager, room 4071&hyph;S, Foreign Agricultural Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC 20250&hyph;1000. The written nomination shall specify the period of time to be covered by the nomination. A copy of the proposed agency agreement must also be provided. A Cooperating Sponsor may submit a single written nomination for a shipping agent for more than one program or may submit separate written nominations for each program. (2) The shipping agent must submit the information and certifications required by 7 CFR 17.5. (3) A person may not act as shipping agent for a Cooperating Sponsor unless the Assistant General Sales Manager has notified the Cooperating Sponsor in writing that the nomination is accepted. (c) Freight procurement requirements. The following requirements apply when the Cooperating Sponsor arranges ocean transportation and CCC is financing any portion of the ocean freight. (1) Freight invitations for bids must be issued for the solicitation of freight offers through the Transportation News Ticker (TNT), New York, plus at least one other means of communication, to assure the broadest possible market coverage and adequate notice to interested parties. (2) The Cooperating Sponsor must obtain approval of all invitations for bids as specified in the Program Agreement prior to their issuance. (3) Freight invitations for bids must provide: (i) That offers have a canceling date no later than the last contract layday specified in the invitation for bids; (ii) that offered rates be quoted in U.S. dollars per metric ton, and if destination bagging or transportation to a point beyond the discharge port is required, offered rates shall separately state the total rates and the portion of the rates attributable to the ocean segment of the movement; (iii) that any non-liner U.S. flag vessel 15 years or older must furnish, in addition to any other offered rate, a one way rate to be applicable in the event the vessel is scrapped or transferred to foreign flag registry prior to the end of the return voyage to the United States; (iv) specify the procedures for payment of freight, including the party responsible for the freight payments; (v) require, in the case of packaged commodities, that U.S. flag carriers specify whether delivery will be direct breakbulk shipment, container shipment, or breakbulk transshipment and identify whether transshipment (including container relays) will be via U.S. or foreign flag vessel; (vi) provide that vessels offered subject to Maritime Administration approval will not be accepted; and (vii) specify a closing time for the submission of offers and state that late offers will not be accepted. (4) In the case of shipments of bulk commodities, the Cooperating Sponsor shall open offers in public in the United States at the time and place specified in the invitation for bids and consider only offers that are responsive to the invitation for bids without negotiation, clarification, or submission of additional information. All responsive offers received for both U.S. flag and foreign flag service must be presented to KCCO which will determine the extent to which U.S.-flag vessels will be used. (5) The Director, Public Law 480&hyph;OD, or another official specified in the Program Agreement, must approve all vessel fixtures. The Cooperating Sponsor may fix vessels subject to that approval of the Director, Public Law 480&hyph;OD, or such other official. The Cooperating Sponsor shall not confirm a vessel fixture until the Director, Public Law 480&hyph;OD, or such other official, advises the Cooperating Sponsor of the required approval and the results of the Maritime Administration's guideline rate review. The Cooperating Sponsor shall not request guideline rate advice from the Maritime Administration. (6) Non-Vessel Operating Common Carriers may not be employed to carry U.S.-flag shipments. (d) Commissions. (1) Total commissions earned on U.S. and foreign flag bookings by all parties arranging vessel fixtures, when any portion of the ocean freight is paid by CCC, shall not exceed 21/2 percent of that portion of the gross freight attributable to the ocean segment of the cargo movement. (2) Total commissions to a shipping agent shall not exceed 2/3 of 21/2 percent of that portion of the gross freight attributable to the ocean transportation segment of the movement. (3) The Cooperating Sponsor shall require liner carriers to assure that tariffs on file at the Federal Maritime Commission reflect the maximum commissions payable under this paragraph. (4) Address commissions are prohibited. (e) Contract terms. (1) The Cooperating Sponsor shall assure that, when CCC is paying any portion of the ocean freight, charter parties and liner booking contracts contain clauses that implement the following paragraphs: (i) packaged commodities on liner vessels shall be shipped on the basis of full berth terms with no demurrage or despatch; (ii) bulk commodities shall be shipped on the basis of vessel load, free out, with demurrage and despatch applicable at load and discharge ports. Laytime accounts are to be settled between the ocean carrier and export elevators at load port and between the ocean carrier and charterers at discharge ports. CCC is not responsible for resolving disputes involving the calculation of laytime or the payment of demurrage or despatch. (iii) if the Program Agreement requires the Cooperating Sponsor to open an irrevocable letter of credit for ocean freight, the Cooperating Sponsor shall be liable for detention of the vessel for loading delays attributable solely to the decision of the ocean carrier not to commence loading because of the failure of the Cooperating Sponsor to establish such letter of credit. Charter parties and liner booking contracts may not contain a specified detention rate. The ocean carrier shall be entitled to reimbursement, as damages for detention, all time so lost, for each calendar day or any part of the calendar day, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays. The period of such delay shall not commence earlier than upon presentation of the vessel at the designated loading port within the laydays specified in the charter party or liner booking contract, and upon notification of the vessel's readiness to load in accordance with the terms of the applicable charter party or liner booking contract. The period of such delay shall end at the time that operable irrevocable letters of credit have been established for ocean freight or the time the vessel begins loading, whichever is earlier. Time calculated as detention shall not count as laytime. Reimbursement for such detention shall be payable no later than upon the vessel's arrival at the first port of discharge.
