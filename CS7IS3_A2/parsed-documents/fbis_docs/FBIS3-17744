I was told at the Central Electoral Commission that 1,873,805 people -- 58.83 percent of those included on the lists -- participated in the voting. According to preliminary data, candidates for the "Russia" bloc are leading in single-seat districts. The bloc's nominee, incidentally, is Yuriy Meshkov, Crimea's current president. Representatives of the Crimean Communist Party are in second place. Regarding the elections to the Ukrainian Supreme Council, also announced for 27 March, it is too soon to speak even of their preliminary results. As of 1600 on that day, voting papers had been issued to 52 percent of Crimea's citizens. This certainly does not mean, however, that they all ended up inside the ballot boxes: On the eve of the elections many Crimean parties and movements were actively encouraging their supporters to obtain voting papers but not to take them away rather than casting them. On Yuriy Meshkov's initiative a poll of Crimeans on their attitude toward a treaty basis in relations between the Republic of Crimea and Ukraine, dual citizenship, and imparting the force of law to a number of Crimean presidential edicts was held simultaneously with the parliamentary elections. As is known, the idea of such a poll elicited a highly negative reaction from the Kiev authorities, being deemed by them to run counter to the Ukrainian Constitution. Therefore, the Crimean Central Electoral Commission was not involved in organizing the poll. Nor is it involved in counting the votes -- presidential power structures have taken on the fulfillment of this task. I have learned that the majority of those who came to vote replied in the affirmative to the questions put to them, thereby voicing confidence in the president's program for extricating the Republic from the crisis.
