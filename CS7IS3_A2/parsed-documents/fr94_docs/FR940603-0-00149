Where applicable, the regional director will provide information concerning options or suggestions that could be considered for gaining approval. The denial letter will include the procedure for and other information on the credit union's right to appeal the decision. VIII.G_Appeal of Regional Director Decision The procedures for filing an appeal of any actions taken by NCUA regional directors will be followed. If not included with the denial notice, a copy of these procedures may be obtained from the regional director who made the decision. The prospective group may submit substantive new and additional information to the regional director for reconsideration. In these cases, the request will not be considered as an appeal but as a request for reconsideration by the regional director. If the request is again denied, the group may proceed with the appeal process. IX_Service Status Reports Federal credit unions which frequently add select groups to their fields of membership should be prepared to furnish a written summary of the results of their efforts to bring service to the employees or members of the select groups. The regional directors will periodically request that such federal credit unions submit service status reports to NCUA showing, at a minimum, the number of primary potential members of each select group added and the number of persons from each select group who have actually enrolled as credit union members. These service status reports can be enlarged to require information concerning aggregate share and loan activity by select group or participation in other credit union services. In any event, federal credit unions using the select group amendment method should implement an information gathering system early in their amendment/diversification program to track their progress in providing service to the potential members of their select groups. This information will help the credit union to operate more efficiently and will give management the data necessary to make decisions about marketing strategy, new promotions, implementation of new services, etc. The service status reports will enable NCUA to determine which federal credit unions are serving newly added groups, as well as any federal credit unions that are not serving new groups. If the NCUA determines that a federal credit union is not adequately serving new groups, the regional director may restrict further amendments and permit the groups not being adequately served to be overlapped with another federal credit union or remove the select group(s) not being served from Section 5 of the credit union charter. CHAPTER 3_CHARTER CONVERSIONS I_Introduction A charter conversion is a change in the jurisdictional authority under which a credit union operates. A credit union's charter is the instrument granted to the institution by the state or federal government. Federal credit unions receive their charters from NCUA and are subject to its supervision, examination, and regulation; they are incorporated under federal law. State-chartered credit unions are incorporated in a particular state, receiving their charter from the state agency responsible for credit unions and subject to the state's regulator. If the state-chartered credit union's deposits are federally insured it will also fall under NCUA's jurisdiction. A federal credit union's power and authority are derived from the Federal Credit Union Act and NCUA Rules and Regulations. State-chartered credit unions are governed by state law and regulation. There are two types of charter conversions_federal charter to state charter, and state charter to federal charter. Although common bond is not an issue from NCUA's standpoint in the case of a federal to state charter conversion, the procedures and forms relevant to such a conversion have been included. II_Conversion of a State Credit Union to a Federal Credit Union II.A_General Requirements Any state-chartered credit union may apply to convert to a federal credit union.
