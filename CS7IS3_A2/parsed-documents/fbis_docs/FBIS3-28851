Two years after gaining independence, this assessment has yet to bear fruit. It is still wrestling with what is a difficult process: to become a market economy. Nevertheless, its government is committed to bring economic development to the country as quickly as possible. As such, the recent visit of Ukraine's deputy foreign minister of external economic relations to Malaysia is a step in the right direction. The move would help initiate cooperation between the two countries as well as enhance mutually beneficial economic activities. The minister, A.D. Makarenko, said that his country was offering attractive investment incentives to foreign investors. Expanding its foreign trade and deepening the industrial base could perhaps be the right target in providing a boost to the country's economy. Malaysian companies, having the expertise in certain manufacturing operations should take advantage of these incentives through [word indistinct]. This is because, through Ukraine, they could make inroads into the vast export markets of the Commonwealth of Independent States. Ukraine also has a well educated labor force, abundant natural resources, and market accessibility into neighboring countries. Areas of cooperation Ukraine is looking for is in skilled production and electrical-related equipment, or the areas of hotel construction as well as hotel management. Joint ventures could facilitate the transfer of technology. However, whatever cooperation is finalized, should be mutually beneficial. There is a lot the former Soviet state could also offer to Malaysia, including defense technology capability and aircraft manufacture. For example, the world's largest aircraft, the An-225 [word indistinct], space shuttle carrier, and the world's second largest aircraft, the An-124 (Ruslan) are made in Ukraine. Given such credentials, the technology could be used to set up joint ventures in Malaysia to manufacture aircraft parts. At the same time, perhaps it could play a role in lending expertise in Malaysia's development of the space industry. Makarenko has indicated his country is keen to share its expertise in space program and aircraft manufacturing especially in the area of large cargo planes. This being the case, there is definitely room for two-way investments. Malaysia too could offer its expertise in the successful privatization of government agencies. This is timely as Ukraine is in the process of privatizing about 40,000 projects this year. It is hoped that a trade agreement is formalized between the two countries soon. This would pave the way for increased commercial linkages and the setting up of joint ventures. The move would go toward giving the Ukrainian economy a badly needed boost. More than anything else, Ukraine needs a great infusion of economic assistance. Malaysia could very well provide that economic assistance.
