"I hope that this means renouncing violent means, especially war, as a means of resolving disputed issues," Jovanovic said in today's interview with Montenegrin Radio. The opening of an office in Belgrade and Zagreb means precisely that--not more and not less. This is not the establishing of diplomatic relations or the recognition of Croatia, Jovanovic stressed. The problem of the Republic of Serb Krajina should be dealt with in line with the Vance-Owen plan, through direct talks with representatives of the Croatian Government. The Geneva agreement does not prejudice the solution for Krajina, the foreign minister said. The minister of foreign affairs of the Republic of Serb Krajina [RSK], Slobodan Jarcevic said during the same program that the RSK views the agreement between Jovanovic and [Croatian Foreign Minister Mate] Granic only as the normalization of relations between two countries, which he does not oppose. "The RSK adheres to its stance that is must preserve its state, and that it must participate as an equal partner in all agreements on the territory of the former Yugoslavia. If Croatia signed the agreement hoping to return the RSK into its state framework, it is wrong," Jarcevic stressed.
