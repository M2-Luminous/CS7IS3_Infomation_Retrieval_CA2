Most recently the MiG-29 (tactical NATO name "Fulcrum") has been flown in Malaysia and India, and by the German Bundeswehr and the Hungarian Air Force. Only in the Austrian Army, where successors for the Draken interceptors that date back to the 1950's, are currently being considered, is restraint being exercised. For John Gudenus, Freedom Party of Austria [FPOe] deputy, who is himself an Army colonel, this is completely incomprehensible: "There is not even an attempt to negotiate, even though this would be the most elegant way to somehow get back the 54.7 billion schillings in debts that Russia has accrued in Austria." The deal that Gudenus proposes -- weapons in return for a remission of debts -- has been made by others: At the end of last year Slovakia bought Russian weapons for 2.1 billion schillings, including five single-seater and one two-seater MiG- 29's. However, these Russian combat planes (equipped with six missiles and a fixed cannon) have the disadvantage of requiring more fuel and maintenance than modern aircraft of Western standards. In order to counter the high maintenance costs, Slovakia has established its own repair yard, 120 km from Bratislava. Slovakia is reportedly interested in having this yard work to capacity through maintenance cooperation with others who use this kind of aircraft. Gudenus: "Such a procurement would also have the advantage of sending a political signal: It would make it easier for Russia to regain its credit standing and, at the same time, Russia would not constantly be pushed into the role of the evil one." The FPOe expert also advocates buying other weapons and equipment from Russia -- from the S-300 antiaircraft missile to the wheeled armored vehicle (BTR-70, BTR-80) to the Mi-24 combat helicopter ("Hind"). The latter was not taken over by the Bundeswehr from the stocks of the National People's Army (to the displeasure of the German Audit Office), which was justified by pointing to operating costs and a lack of compatibility with NATO equipment. Says Gudenus bitterly: "As long as our Army is not compatible with the European level in terms of defense, we need not be worried about compatibility with the West." In addition, we are more acquainted with Russian components and instruments, because they work with metric measures while U.S. suppliers stick with the imperial scale.
