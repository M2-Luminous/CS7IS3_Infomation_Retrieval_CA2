After a meeting of information with representatives of the Industrialists' Association and of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, talks were conducted with Hellenic Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias, with the defense minister G.Arsenis and other members of the Hellenic cabinet. Offers were made by either party as well as proposals. The evaluations are encouraging. President Ion Iliescu said in his toast proposed at the official dinner offered by Premier Papandreou that "for more than one millennium, the two peoples have lived through the same joys and misfortunes, in a region that has only rarely knew quiet, rather relative at that. The friendship between the two peoples is neither new nor changing. It has been built upon the community of historical past characterized by equal wish for freedom and equal sufferings for getting it. ``Our political, economic, cultural-scientific relations and in other domains of mutual interest have recorded a positive evolution, beneficial to both peoples these last few years. ``The talks conducted have singled out the two countries' potential to intensify the Romanian-Hellenic collaboration. I am thinking especially of the economy, where our collaboration resources are still not taken best advantage of. I am sure that during our visit and, in a few days, during the proceedings of the joint Government Commission in Athens, new ideas will be singled out as well as specific measures to expand the economic collaboration and intensify commercial exchanges. I think you will agree that the total volume of $153 million in 1993 -- which is the value of our commercial exchanges, is rather small. We think nothing prevents us from expecting a far bigger volum.'' The president assessed as exquisite the collaboration between the two countries on a regional and international plane. "This time too, I am emphasizing our satisfaction at the generous support given by the Greek friends to Romania in its efforts for integration in the Euro-Atlantic structures", the President said. "Greece has made an important contribution to the Romania-European Union Association agreement and to our country's admission to the Council of Europe. We are grateful to the Hellenic Parliament, that was the first to ratify the agreement of Romania's association with the European Union." Referring to the very complex situation in the Balkans, the Romanian president singled out the Romanian-Hellenic joint preoccupations and efforts for the cause of peace, stability and cooperation. "The political settlement of the Yugoslav crisis is our common desideratum," Iliescu said. "We think the same of the undeserved tragedy of the peoples in the area of the ex-Yugoslavia, and also the serious upsetting of the stability in the area and even of peace more generally. You too, just like us, have observed the economic embargo imposed on the federal Republic of Yugoslavia -- Serbia and Montenegro - for all tremendous costs our economies have incurred. But, in the spirit of equity, our countries have justly requested that the burden of the sanctions should be shared as equitably as possible. ``Romania is also vitally interested in the development of a viable system of security in the continent, relying upon the institutions of European vocation that have proven their ability to ensure peace and quiet in Europe. We see the NATO decision on Partnership for Peace as an element of consolidating our security, equal security for all states in this part of the continent in the new conditions created by the changes come about in Central and East Europe.'' Referring to the Balkan Region, President Iliescu noted the two countries' mutual wish that once the grave and complex issues faced by the countries there are settled, there should be a comeback to a normal situation allowing for broad regional cooperation, of course, not separately, but as part and parcel of the general processes of Euro-atlantic integration. President Ion Iliescu hoped that the current top-level political dialogue would open a new page in the history of the excellent Romanian-Hellenic relations. "We are very confident in the future of the relations of friendship and collaboration between our countries."
