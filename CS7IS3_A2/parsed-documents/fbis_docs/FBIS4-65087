The aim is to provide a streamlined procedure for dealing with alleged violations under the European Human Rights Convention whose enforcement machinery is in crisis because of a burgeoning workload. Cases are taking an average of five years, and sometimes nine years, to resolve. Without the reforms the delays are expected to worsen as more central and eastern European countries sign the Convention. Under the agreement, known as the 11th Protocol to the European Human Rights Convention, the two-tier system of commission and court for investigating and adjudicating alleged violations will be replaced by a single court in permanent session. It will absorb the role of the commission, deciding if cases are admissible, and if so to investigate their merits, then seek a settlement. If this fails, it delivers an opinion on whether there has been a breach of the Convention. Under the present system, cases can then be referred to the Strasbourg court, which, after a hearing gives a binding judgment on Governments found to be in breach. In the new system, people in the states of the Council of Europe will have direct access to Strasbourg after exhausting domestic remedies. The court will have one judge for each country, elected for six years by the council's Parliamentary Assembly. Most cases will be decided by seven judges. A committee of three will take over the role of the commission in deciding whether complaints are initially admissible. Cases raising important issues of interpretation of the Convention can be referred by the normal seven-judge court for adjudication by a larger "Grand Chamber'' of 17 judges, unless one party objects.
