He affirmed that such measures will not change the stands of the party leadership, which are firm stands over which there can be no bargaining or pressure. Ja'ja' reminded political and judicial authorities of their responsibilities. Dr. Samir Ja'ja' affirmed that what is happening has nothing to do with the measures the state is taking. He pointed out that regrettably the state is doing things that harm Lebanon and hamper its progress. He described this new development as a mere tightening of the noose round the neck of the LF headquarters in Ghidras. He clarified that neither laws, nor regulations, nor the Constitution stipulate that journalists are banned from entering Ghidras or bringing in the necessary equipment they need to cover an event. This [the government action] is not acceptable. If there are any political authorities in the country, they should allow this. If there are any judicial authorities, then all such measures should be decreed by these authorities. Let us listen to part of what Dr. Ja'ja' said in his news conference which he held last night in Ghidras. [passage omitted] [Begin Ja'ja' recording] [passage omitted] I very much regret that the Lebanese authorities, which are our authorities, behave in a manner that strips them of all credibility. This is something that hurts and pains us. These authorities' behavior shows that they have no self-respect. Our hopes and expectations are to have authorities respected by everyone inside and outside the country, but first they should have self-respect. It is unfortunate for the state to be at a stage or time where it allows itself everything, dodges all laws, leaks information, creates news, provides the explanations it likes, ignores facts, deduces and creates things that are not there. It is regrettable that a state would do so. [passage omitted] The authorities cannot be this [word indistinct]. I will ignore what has been said, such as statements that these measures fall within the security arrangements. I do not understand what security arrangements stipulate that a military presence should be deployed at the four entrances of a house that lead only to it. What we are certain of is that we shall stand firm regarding our stand. If some sides think that they will be able to change our stand through their behavior they are very wrong. [passage omitted] [end recording] In an interview with Radio Monte Carlo, Dr. Ja'ja' affirmed that the state is losing its final shreds of credibility, which it could have nurtured to its advantage, without achieving anything. It is widening the gap between itself and its people. This is undesirable and achieves nothing. He clarified that the state is destroying itself through such behavior. [passage omitted] Before the news conference he held in Ghidras, Dr. Ja'ja' asked all citizens and his supporters in various parts of Lebanon not to react to these government measures and to remain calm.
