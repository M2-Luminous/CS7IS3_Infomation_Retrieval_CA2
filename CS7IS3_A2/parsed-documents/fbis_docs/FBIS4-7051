Indeed, it is fighting a losing battle for two reasons. Firstly, Thailand is no longer a frontline state. It is now virtually standing alone vis-a-vis the international community on the Khmer Rouge issue. When the Cambodian leaders decided to take the bull by the horns, alleging Thailand of supporting the Marxist group, they knew they had the world's support. To the world, the Khmer Rouge is the only visible threat to the Cambodian government's current endeavour to rebuild the war-shattered country, therefore any remaining ties with this notorious group, imaginary or real, is unwarranted. Secondly, the threat to use force against Cambodia in retaliation against the Cambodian government's allegations, even though verbal, has already earned Thailand a reputation of being a new "regional bully". In any circumstance, if the tit-for-tat is actually carried out, there will be no sympathy for Thailand. In the absence of national reconciliation in the past eight months in Cambodia, Thailand's decision makers were at a loss. Without any clear policy direction, they resorted to ambiguity -- the traditional way of handling sensitive issues with neighbouring countries. Since the formation of new Cambodian government last September, Thailand has been hoping that the Khmer Rouge would be integrated within the new government. Supposedly, it would be the only acceptable way out for Thailand's diplomatic quagmire. For one thing, Bangkok would be able to maintain the status quo in its relations with the group including trade links, while being accorded legitimacy as the Marxist faction would be part of the government. Unfortunately, the Cambodian government and the Khmer Rouge have failed to reach an agreement. Eventually, the nature of Thailand's link with the Khmer Rouge will depend on how fast the latter integrates with Phnom Penh. As long as they are excluded and resort to the tactics they have chosen to, it is extremely difficult to see a practical termination of Thai-Khmer Rouge ties. Even though the Chuan government and armed forces chiefs have repeatedly assured the leaders in Phnom Penh and the world community that Thailand no longer helps the Khmer Rouge, in compliance with UN resolutions and in recognition of the new Cambodian government, nobody seemed to take Thailand seriously. In private discussions, senior Thai officials always linked the alleged Thai assistance to unruly individuals, some of them in uniform, along the Thai- Cambodian border, who have always taken the law in their own hands. If these individuals remain at large and are able to go against the Thai government's policy, they must be reprimanded immediately. Failure to do so would only strengthen the perception of continued Thai assistance to the Khmer Rouge. Worse, it would also give credit to the claim that Thailand is still playing the Khmer Rouge card as long as the new Cambodian government remains hostile to Bangkok. When the Foreign Ministry issued a six-point protest statement, trying to attract international sympathy and appealing for public understanding, it was an act of desperation. The ministry should have known that, as far as Thai-Cambodian relations are concerned, it is a different ball-game now. It is useless to cry over spilt milk. Certain things can be done to ameliorate the tense situation. The most important would be discussions among top military leaders of the two countries to ensure that there are no rooms for misunderstandings. The planned visit of Thai Supreme Commander Air Chief Marshal Woranat Aphichari would be a good start. Thailand should also consider the possibility of helping Cambodia in certain difficult circumstances in handling the Khmer Rouge. If need be in the future, they can join in a pincer move against the Khmer Rouge. Unfortunately, it would require such a drastic action to convince Cambodia and the world of Thailand's sincerity. Finally, Thailand has to decide whether the survival of a democratically elected Cambodian government or the Marxist group is more important. Thailand cannot have both. If Thailand chooses the first choice, then the country must go all out to support Cambodia without conditions. In case Thailand still wants the Khmer Rouge, then Thai leaders should not complain at all when allegations are levied against them. There is one caveat. Thailand cannot expect Cambodia to be modest. The Cambodian leaders have an enormous task to rebuild the country.
