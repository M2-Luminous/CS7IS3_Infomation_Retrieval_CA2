Implementation of the "Regulations on the Collection of Mineral Resources Compensation Fee" begins April 1, in accordance with an order issued by Premier Li Peng on February 27. The regulations were approved by the State Council on June 29, 1993, said Song Ruixiang, executive vice-minister of the Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources, at a news briefing today. The fee will be calculated on the basis of the value of the minerals mined, but for the next year or two will be fixed at 1.18 percent "in consideration of the financial difficulties of some mining enterprises." The rate will be raised to 5-7 percent between 1996 and 2000, and then to about ten percent. "Ten percent is what it should be," the official said. The "eventual rate" resulted from calculations on the value of 21 mineral ores including gold, manganese and phosphorus. "Even ten percent is lower than such rates in foreign countries," the official said. At the rate of 1.18 percent, the government expects to collect an annual average of one billion yuan and use it on geological prospecting, "especially prospecting involving risks and involving resources for China's strategic reserves," he said. Even more important, however, is that collection of the fee is meant to uphold state ownership of mineral resources in accordance with the constitution and the "mineral resources law" and make such ownership real by an economic method, Song said. "Unpaid-for mining means free transfer of state property rights to a mining enterprise, and this does not conform to law and causes loss of state-owned assets," Song said. "All countries collect mineral resources compensation fees in one or another form," he noted. "Moreover, the market economy necessitates compensation for the consumption of mineral resources." In their overseas operations, Chinese mining companies duly pay mineral resources compensation fees in observation of laws of their host countries, Song noted. "Foreign companies seeking investment opportunities in China's mining sector agree to pay such a fee, which demands that there be legislation on its collection," the official said. The latest State Council regulations cover "mineral resources of all types throughout China, on China's land territory and within the maritime territory under China's jurisdiction." All mining enterprises have to pay the fee, whether they are owned by the state, or collectively or individually owned and whether they involve foreign investment. In line with government decrees previously published, foreign companies engaging in oil and natural gas operations in China, onshore or offshore, will continue to turn over to China a prescribed percentage of the products as fees on the use of the operation areas.
