To borrow a metaphor from tennis, it can be translated as: while Beijing sets the rules of the game, Guangdong draws the lines of the court. When Beijing last December announced a capital gains tax with a maximum tax rate of 200 per cent starting this year, the initial reaction from Guangdong officials was that it was not applicable to the southern province. And two months later, provincial cadres knew how to play the new game. Instead of bouncing the tax law back to Beijing, local cadres admitted that the new regulation, signed into law by premier Li Peng last December, was as good in Guangdong as in other provinces. But on the other hand, they also reminded foreign investors as well as Beijing that any laws -- not just the capital gains tax -- must take into consideration the concept of "local reality". The reality, as Guangdong officials described it, is an insatiable demand for property -- both residential and commercial. To catch up with other developing Asian economies in 15 years they must go full steam ahead to develop its property market. For example, under the Great Metropolis Development Plan announced by Guangzhou Mayor Li Ziliu, the provincial capital will expand to three times its present size reaching a total area of 550 square kilometres by 2010. A total of 3.43 million square metres of new houses will be needed by the end of this century. In addition, the city Government will be responsible for finding accommodation for the 38,000 couples expected to marry over the next six years. The market temperature was heated further by a commercial boom in Guangzhou last year. Hong Kong real estate giants such as Cheung Kong and New World Development have already queued up for contracts in the city. Such "reality", Guangzhou officials contend are a very good reason why the city should be treated differently under the new tax rule. In a recent interview with the SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST, Jin Yiguo, Director of the Market Administration Department of Guangzhou Real Estate Management Bureau, said there were "questions" over how the new tax rule could be implemented in the regions. First, there is the question of the nature of the capital gains tax. According to Mr. Jin, there was no clear definition whether the new tax was a central government tax or a revenue earner for the local authorities. "My understanding is that it is the opinion of the city (Communist Party standing committee) that first the law will be enforced in Guangzhou. "Second, (we) must enforce it in accordance with the actual situation in Guangzhou...and fully take into consideration that we have already collected a land price from the investors, he said. "In principle, we should not add an extra (tax) burden on investors and this is as much I can say (about the tax law) at this moment," he added.
