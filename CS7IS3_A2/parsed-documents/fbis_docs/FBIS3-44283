"Only in this way can the reunification of China bring good fortune, happiness and glory to the Chinese people," Li said in his New Year's message delivered in a grand ceremony at the presidential office marking the beginning of the 83rd year of the Republic of China [ROC]. "We clearly understand that the greatest problem between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait is the lack of genuine mutual understanding. The two sides interact, but their is no mutual trust," the president said. "Therefore," Li said, "we sincerely call upon the Chinese Communist authorities to attach great importance to the welfare of the people on both sides of the strait, renounce their hostile and confrontational attitude, cherish the brotherhood of people on both sides, and work toward nurturing mutual understanding and trust in the new year." Li also called on people here to strive for greater achievements in the new year so that the Chinese nation can be really proud of itself in the 21st century. "Even though this is a year most full of hope for us, it is also a year in which we must struggle most," Li said. He emphasized the importance of seeking a significant breakthrough in economic development. "The strength nurtured by our economic development has allowed us to improve the life of our citizenry and stand firmly in the international community," the president noted. Li said the government has introduced a set of stimulus measures designed to resolve the problem of slackening economic growth. The measures include increasing spending on public works, encouraging private investment and promoting the building of an operational center for the Asia-Pacific region. Li also pledged to expand Taiwan's foreign relations, saying, "we will expand our participation in international activities, fulfill our obligations to the international community, win international goodwill and develop practical relations, all for the purpose of building up the international status due us." Li described 1994 as the year when people here must further advance Chinese culture with new vigor. "At a time when the ROC is achieving outstanding successes, both politically and economically, we must make greater efforts to raise the quality of our spiritual life and make progress in our cultural life." On the third-phase constitutional reform, Li said, "it will have to take into account the collective wisdom and the consensus of the people, the fundamental framework of the five-power Constitution, the present state of our constitutional development and the future needs of national unification." Li concluded by saying that the longer term welfare of the public demands the joint concern of everyone, and a promising future for our national demands the joint efforts of all to help set in motion.
