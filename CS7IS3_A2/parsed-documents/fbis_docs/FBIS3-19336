The country will be formed of cantons with Muslim and Croatian majorities respectively. The office of the head of state is to alternate annually between a Muslim and a Croat. However, the problem lies in the details: Everything now depends on whether the Muslims and the Croats really do cooperate -- or whether the former are just waiting to outmaneuver the latter, and the latter, for their part, see the Bosnian solution just as an interim step toward joining the Republic of Croatia. The biggest factor of uncertainty are the Serbs. The U.S. hopes that the Serbs will participate in the Bosnian federation. However, there is the danger that including them might blow up the building. The Serbs do not want Bosnia -- they want a Greater Serbia. If the bilateral Muslim-Croat federation comes about, then something like a new Yalta line will be drawn between the Serbs on the one hand and the Muslims and Croats on the other. Whatever is on the western side of the line is influenced by NATO and the European Union. Whatever is to the east of it -- that is, Serbia and the territories conquered by the Serbs -- will be under Russian protection. The Croats and the Muslims derive one satisfaction from all this: This time they are on the "western side." The first World Bank loan of $700 million has already been prepared for Croatia.
