FBIS4-5100 "dreas067_k_94003" FBIS-EAS-94-067 Daily Report 6 Apr 1994 Laos Travel Restrictions for Foreigners Removed Travel Restrictions for Foreigners Removed BK0604030694 Bangkok THE NATION in English 6 Apr 94 p A2 BK0604030694 Bangkok THE NATION English BFN [By Kunlachada Chaiphiphat] [Text] Vientiane -- To stimulate its tourism industry, Vientiane has dropped an almost two decade-long restriction on the movement of foreigners, allowing them to travel anywhere in Laos except for areas considered restricted and dangerous. Tourists can also apply for entry visas at Laos' international checkpoints besides Laotian embassies. Those international checkpoints are Vat Tai and Tha Nadeua at Vientiane in central Laos, Ban Houai Sai in Bokeo province, Sanakham in Sayaboury province in northern Laos and Ban Viang Savan in Savannakhet, all of which border Thailand. Another international checkpoint in Savannakhet's western frontier is at Ban Non Savan bordering Lao Bao in Vietnam. Laos expects a hike in the number of foreign tourists, especially in the coming months after the opening of Mittaphap Thai-Lao bridge. The relaxed tourism measures did not mention new freedom of movement for foreign diplomats in Vientiane. Vientiane-based diplomats from western countries have been restricted to within six kilometres of the capital and could travel to other provinces only with prior notification from Vientiane authorities. To promote domestic tourism, Vientiane will also allow its citizens to travel within the country using only their identity cards. Before, they had to apply to provincial authorities for passes to other provinces. However residents without identity cards will still have to seek passes from the provincial authorities. The newly-formed National Tourism Organization has devised a motto, "Lao travel in Laos", to encourage domestic tourism. To foster its new tourism plan for this year, the organization has divided the country into three zones. In the northern zone, destinations being touted are Bokeo, Oudomsai, Houaphan, Xiang Khouang and Luang Prabang. In the central zone are Vientiane, Vientiane Municipality, Khammouane within a parameter of 20 square kilometres and Savannakhet in the orbit of Route 9, while in the southern zone are Champassak and Saravane. The steps are being taken to prepare for a Laos Tourism Year, which Vientiane hopes will be in 1995. The new set of immigration measures were approved by an intergovernment committee comprising representatives of the Foreign and Interior ministries and chaired by Minister of the Prime Minister's Office Phao Bounnaphon. The announcement was made on Monday in the VIENTIANE-MAI WEEKLY, five days ahead of the inauguration of the Mittaphap Thai-Lao Bridge set for this Friday. The newspaper said all authorities concerned in the provinces have been informed of the new regulations. The move followed considerable debate over the past year between reformists and conservatives within the Lao People's Revolutionary Party over whether to relax immigration controls.
