"We cannot be indifferent to Slovaks abroad, as the Hungarian Government cannot be indifferent to Hungarians living outside Hungary," Moravcik added. The ethnic Hungarians in Slovakia number about 560,000 people, or 11 percent of Slovakia's population. The ethnic minorities issues should be involved in the Hungarian-Slovak agreement, Moravcik said. This was agreed upon during his recent meeting with executive deputy chairman of the Hungarian Socialist Party Imre Szekeres, he added. Moravcik noted that the present government was ready to settle the "signpost" law on the bilingual names for towns and villages in the ethnic language, rejected last week for the second time in parliament. This time the signpost law should be submitted as a private member's bill, only on condition that it will be submitted by a simple majority of Slovak deputies, Moravcik explained. If the law were rejected for the third times, it would not be "pleasant" because of domestic and international situation, he said.
