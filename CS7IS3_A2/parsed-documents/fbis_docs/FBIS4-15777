"It may cause an allergic reaction among the people," he was quoted as saying. At present, the TPERP is the first officially registered party in Tajikistan since January 1993 when all political parties and movements, except for the Communists, were banned. According to Bobokhonov, the TPERP basically encompassed young entrepreneurs, scientists and economists. The party's main goal is to promote the economic revival of Tajikistan and the establishment of peace in the republic. To achieve this goal, the new party will cooperate with all social and political forces of the Republic, Bobokhonov said. Asked about the party's economic program, Bobokhonov said its top priority was to create a nongovernment pension fund to protect all layers of society. He hoped the Tajik leadership would support this initiative. Commenting on the presence of Russian troops in Tajikistan, Bobokhonov said it was necessary at the moment to guarantee peace and security in the region.
