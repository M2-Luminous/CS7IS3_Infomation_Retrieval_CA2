Ferhat: "Faced With a Resurgence of Assassinations and Acts of Sabotage, the State Reacts: The National People's Assembly (ANP) on the Spot"--first paragraph is LIBERTE introduction] [Text] It is reported that major antiterrorist measures will soon be considered. The country's authorities are, it seems, firmly determined to put every chance on their side to conduct the national dialogue under the best security conditions. According to well-informed sources, major decisions are reported to have been considered in this regard at a recent three-day meeting of top military leaders. A beefing up of security forces is reported to have been decided upon. So the main units and barracks are reported to have been put on a state of alert and received major reinforcements of men and materiel. Information reporting the deployment of military units and troop movements in the interior of the country and around the capital would tend to corroborate this on-site return by the state. According to our sources, the meeting of the heads of military staffs is also reported to have studied the eventual need for a partial mobilization of reserve forces so as to enhance the presence of the National People's Assembly [ANP] in urban centers and villages. This last measure would have more of a psychological than a military import. Terrorist propaganda does not cease pummeling people's minds with rumors suggesting that they hold the country in their grip. This reassertion by the state will also be seen through a more decentralized logistic system in the antiterrorist fight. It will be implemented at the national and regional levels, especially in each major city and at local coordinating military headquarters combining the ANP, the national gendarmerie, and the police. This system will allow for a better flow of security information but also for greater efficiency and speed in operations. The justice system also has its role to play in this new strategy. So sentences and general capital punishment orders in the special jurisdictions will henceforth be carried out speedily. It was probably with this in mind that the special court, following several weeks' worth of postponements of major trials, restarted its sessions, handing down six convictions carrying the death penalty. It would appear that in the future terrorists, in particularly those picked up who are armed, will be punished in exemplary fashion. Among other measures that have been mentioned, the heads of the national defense force are reported to have discussed ways of eliminating the armed groups' support and arms supply networks. The issue of closing the borders with Morocco was reported to have been brought up. The country's vast border areas, owing to the contraband trade, are indeed being used to bring in subversive elements and documents but in particular weapons, despite the vigilance of the gendarmerie and the customs service. The deterioration of the security situation is such that even a state of emergency has been considered. It was, according to our sources, supposed to have been instituted before 24 March, but developments on the political scene and in particular the restart of the national dialogue have, it would seem, helped postpone this measure. It remains to be seen whether these decisions will be enforced in one overall step or gradually. However, it develops from this redeployment by the state that the overall security formula has not been completely abandoned. That formula will be used in parallel with "the political solution," in other words discussions with political and social forces. The government, which has increased its appeasement gestures (closing the camps in the south, freeing Boukhamkham and Djeddi, and suspending executions), has been poorly understood, if we may put it that way, by the terrorists. The latter have interpreted the government's attitude as a sign of weakness and stepped up the violence. The policy of concessions has given them the illusion that the reins of power were within their grasp.
