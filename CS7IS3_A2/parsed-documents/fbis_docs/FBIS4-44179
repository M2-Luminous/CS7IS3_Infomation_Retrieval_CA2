The armies from Belgium, the Netherlands, Great Britain, and Germany participate with one brigade each in this "Multinational Division-Central" [MND(C)], announced Lieutenant Colonel Ernst-August Petermann, the press officer. Each of the four countries involved provides a quarter of the staff members, and the position of the commander in chief is subject to the principle of rotation. The first commander in chief is Major General Pieter Huysman from the Netherlands. His deputy is from Great Britain. Depending on the kind of operation, the MND(C) can comprise up to 20,000 men, Petermann pointed out. It is designed for various kinds of operations: humanitarian aid, disaster aid, safeguarding of peace, and "peacemaking measures if need be" -- that is combat missions -- the press release stated. Petermann considers putting the division into service a "political issue." He admitted that international operations will continue to be controversial in Germany until the Constitutional Court passes a ruling on the participation of the Bundeswehr in out-of-area operations. In the event of a negative ruling, "we might have to kick the Germans out again," Petermann told FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU. The lieutenant general would consider it "extremely embarrassing" if the division one day had to be deployed without German soldiers. Above all, the lack of a quarter of the leadership would cause big problems, he stated. The Bundeswehr has placed the 31st Airborne Brigade from Oldenburg at the disposal of the MND(C). According to Petermann, this brigade also includes a normal number of conscripts. The main parts of the division are easily transferrable. The Netherlands provides artillery, Belgium combat helicopters, and Germany transportation helicopters and a service battalion. Petermann announced that NATO has been planning to set up such a force since the middle of the 1980s. At the time of the East-West confrontation it was intended as a mobile reserve unit in the event of an attack by a Warsaw Pact state.
