FR940830-1-00022 FR940830-1-00002 (a)(1) *␣*␣* (2) An economically disadvantaged full-time manager must hold the position of President or Chief Executive Officer in the applicant or 8(a) concern. (3) One or more disadvantaged individuals determined to manage the applicant or 8(a) concern on a full-time basis must be present and available during normal working hours at the place of business of the applicant or 8(a) concern. (4) Any disadvantaged individual upon whom 8(a) eligibility is based who is engaged in the management and daily business operations of the 8(a) concern and who wishes to engage in outside employment must notify SBA of the nature and anticipated duration of the outside employment and obtain the written approval of SBA prior to engaging in such employment. SBA will review any request for outside employment for compliance with the requirement of day-to-day management and control of the 8(a) concern. SBA will deny a request for outside employment which could conflict with the management of the firm or could hinder it in achieving the objectives of its business development plan. (b) The socially and economically disadvantaged individual(s) upon whom eligibility is based shall control the Board of Directors of an applicant or 8(a) concern, either in actual numbers of voting directors or through weighted voting (e.g., in a concern having a two-person Board of Directors where one individual on the Board is disadvantaged and one is not, the disadvantaged vote must be weighted_worth more than one vote_in order for the concern to be eligible for 8(a) participation). (1) The powers to appoint, remove, and replace directors (e.g., through ownership of voting stock) is not sufficient to satisfy the requirement that one or more disadvantaged individuals actually control the Board of Directors. (2) Non-voting, advisory, or honorary Directors may be appointed without affecting the control of the applicant or 8(a) concern to allow the firm to have a varied and experienced Board of Directors, provided they cannot negatively control the concern. (3) All arrangements regarding the structure and voting rights of the Board of Directors must comply with applicable state law. (c) Individuals who are not socially and economically disadvantaged may be involved in the management of an 8(a) applicant concern, and may be stockholders, partners, officers, and/or directors of such concern. Such partners, officers, directors, and/or more than 10 percent stockholders of the applicant concern, their spouses or immediate family members who reside in the individual's household may not however: * * * * * (2) Have an equity ownership interest of more than 10 percent in an applicant or 8(a) concern where such individual is an officer or director or more than a 20 percent owner, stockholder, or partner of another firm in the same or similar line of business as the applicant or 8(a) concern, except that a principal of a former Program Participant may have an equity ownership interest of up to 20 percent in a current 8(a) concern in the same or similar lines of business as the former Program Participant. * * * * * (d) *␣*␣* (3) The nondisadvantaged individual or entity provides critical financing or bonding support to the 8(a) concern which directly or indirectly allows the nondisadvantaged individual to gain control or direction of the 8(a) concern. * * * * * 15. Section 124.105(c)(1) would be amended by redesignating the second sentence and remaining text as paragraph (c)(2) and by revising paragraphs c)(1), introductory text of newly redesignated (c)(2) and newly redesignated paragraph (c)(2)(v) to read as follows: §124.105 Social disadvantage. * * * * * (c) Individuals not members of designated groups. (1) An individual who is not a member of one of the groups presumed to be socially disadvantaged in paragraph (b)(1) of this section must establish his/her individual social disadvantage on the basis of clear and convincing evidence. (2) A clear and convincing case of social disadvantage must include the following elements: * * * * * (v) The individual's social disadvantage must have negatively impacted on his or her entry into and/or advancement in the business world. SBA will entertain any relevant evidence in assessing this element. In every case, however, SBA will consider the experiences of the individual, where applicable, in education, employment and business history. Failure to establish disadvantage in any one of these components will not prevent an individual from meeting this requirement as long as the totality of the circumstances experienced by the individual demonstrates his/her disadvantage in entering into and/or advancing in the business world. * * * * * 16. Section 124.106 would be amended by revising the last sentence of paragraph (a)(1)(i), by changing ``$250,000'' to ``$300,000'' in paragraph (a)(2)(i), by changing ``$750,000'' to ``$900,000'' in paragraph (b)(2), by revising the fifth sentence of paragraph (a)(2)(i)(A)( 1 ), by revising paragraph (a)(2)(ii), and by revising paragraph (b)(1), introductory text, to read as follows: §124.106 Economic disadvantage. (a) Economic disadvantage for the 8(a) program. (1)(i) *␣*␣* In determining economic disadvantage for purposes of 8(a) program eligibility, SBA will compare the applicant concern's business and financial profile with the profiles of other small business concerns in the same business area which are not owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. * * * * * (2) *␣*␣* (i) *␣*␣* (A)(1 ) *␣*␣* Assets which an individual claiming disadvantaged status has transferred to a non-applicant immediate family member (or to a trust the beneficiary of which is an immediate family member) within two years of the date of application to the 8(a) program will be presumed to be the property of the individual claiming disadvantaged status for purposes of determining his/her personal net worth. However, such presumption shall not apply to transfers to a spouse who is subject to a legal separation recognized by a court of competent jurisdiction. *␣*␣*
