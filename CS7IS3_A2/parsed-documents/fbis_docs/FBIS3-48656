Kim Yong-sam the traitor has made himself the enemy not only of the South Korean people but also of the whole nation by seeking dependence on outside forces and North-South confrontation and bartering away the dignity and interests of the nation to outside forces to gratify his greed for power, notes the paper in an article. The author of the article says: He earned himself the hatred and grievances of the South Korean people by establishing "civilian" fascist dictatorship which is little different from the preceding military dictatorship. While waxing eloquent about "civilian politics," he extended in actuality the military fascist dictatorship of the "Fifth Republic" and the "Sixth Republic" without modification. It is clear to everyone that the reactionary rulers who suppress the people and encroach upon their interests are rejected by the popular masses. The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique landed itself in a hopeless isolation by committing treacheries against fellow countrymen. The traitor has trampled upon the agreement with nonaggression as its core and the joint declaration on denuclearisation by seizing power after the adoption and effectuation of these historic documents between North and South. And he has broken up the North-South dialogues, which had continued even in the days of the regime of military dictatorship, raising a hue and cry over "suspected nuclear development" by the North. And he resumed the "Team Spirit" joint military drill which had been suspended toward the end of the "Sixth Republic" and staged a chain of North-targeted nuclear war exercises codenamed "Ulchi," "Ulchi Focus Lens," "Foal Eagle-93," "Hwarang," etc., thus aggravating the North-South relations and leading the situation to the brink of war. Out in front in the nuclear clamor raised by the imperialist reactionaries to stifle the DPRK, the traitor Kim Yong-sam sought "an international cooperation system" and displayed feverish activities to have "sanctions" taken against it. When countries and nations were advancing toward independence in the international arena, he entreated the United States to shelve its "troops cutback program" by offering a burden share to the tune of more than 3,000 million dollars for their maintenance and "protect" South Korea with the "nuclear umbrella" and, in the relations with Japan, he absolved the Japanese imperialists of their crimes in aggression on Korea and sought tieup with the Japanese reactionaries, thus standing naked as a pro-Japanese lackey. In a little more than ten months of his office, Kim Yong-sam stripped himself bare to reveal his ugly color as "a civilian puppet," "a civilian fascist," "a civilian separatist," "a civilian warmaniac" and "a civilian traitor." He is doomed to be thrown into a dustbin of history like his predecessors.
