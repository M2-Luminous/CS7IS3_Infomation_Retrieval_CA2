The idea of forming such a group had been mooted long ago, but only in recent years, mainly thanks to efforts by Turkey, it has attracted wide recognition which was implemented with the signing of the relevant declaration by leaders of 11 countries on 25 June 1992. That day in effect became the founding date of the ChES; among the founding members of that organization, in addition to Ukraine, were Azerbaijan, Albania, Bulgaria, Armenia, Greece, Georgia, Moldova, the Russian Federation, Romania and Turkey. Most of those countries fully support the concept of the ChES and have serious, although sometimes dissimilar, intentions to build the necessary legal foundations for economic integration, growth of trade and implementation of joint investment projects. For instance, the position of Greece, Romania and Bulgaria on investing ChES organizations with considerable powers and creating special favorable conditions for economic cooperation in the region has been cautious and reserved. As to creating the appropriate legal foundations, modifying existing foreign trade regimes and establishing a free trade zone and other institutional structures, all this would seriously impact their status in another, for them more significant organization: the European Union (EU). (Greece is its full member and Bulgaria and Romania hold associate membership.) Ukraine has its own interest in this, and its candidacy as a leader of the ChES could become an acceptable compromise. (Initiatives to that effect are the responsibility of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.) Other solutions are also possible: representatives of different states could hold this position by turns. While discussing the role of Ukraine in the ChES, it should be mentioned that on Turkish initiative our country was chosen as the site of a parliamentary session of that organization at the start of December. Analysts have noted that the ChES parliamentary session, which took place in Kiev, was very productive. Sometimes one hears doubt whether attention should be focused on the problems of Black Sea cooperation if for Ukraine, as well as for other countries in the region, the geopolitical goal is to become integrated into the EU, or whether hopes to bring together dissimilar member states within the ChES might not be Utopian. Responding to the first of these general questions, we should note that it would be irresponsible to define the issue in either-or terms. For Ukraine to claim a full EU membership status that would allow it to participate in its integration processes and make use of all the related advantages, subsidies and a wide range of favorable opportunities for economic development would be impossible for many years to come. Yet, the task of overcoming a severe socio-economic crisis is already facing our country today. Moreover, strengthening cooperation with other countries of the "European underbelly" as a way toward Brussels would only give us more weight in the eyes of desirable partners. Incidentally, these considerations are very important for Turkish politicians. Thus, we think that Ukraine should look at the problem more broadly, in the context of its officially declared intention to seek widest possible geographical ties and to overcome distortions resulting from a one-sided orientation. Clearly, it would be much easier to build economic cooperation in the Black Sea region as a series of bilateral projects or broader geographical projects focused on a single industry. But this does not preclude the possibility, or removes the need, to build a system of multilateral cooperation, which would encourage many forms of localized cooperation while, on the other hand, assuming a much broader form. During negotiations within the ChES, member states expressed their interest in cooperating in such areas as construction and modernization of highway and railway networks; rational utilization of Black Sea fishery resources; construction, modernization and improved use of Black Sea ports; improvement of telecommunications links between ChES members and laying of the fiber-optic cable between Turkey, Romania, Bulgaria and Ukraine. On its part, Ukraine expressed an interest in working within the ChES framework on modernizing oil refining plants, building terminals on the shores of the Black Sea for receiving shipments of oil and liquefied gas, cooperating with foreign companies on the development of non-traditional energy sources, technical retooling of metallurgical plants, building new capacities, implementing a multilateral program to produce electronic equipment for various sectors of the economy using semiconductors produced in Ukraine, etc. At this stage, Ukraine must develop a general conceptual vision of its economic interests in the ChES, set a target level for integration into ChES and its organizations and find practical ways to achieve expected results. The latter task is related to the need to find out, at last, who is responsible for what in the context of goals being considered, since it must be acknowledged that, as a rule, the Ukrainian side does not generate initiative in developing various business proposals, and that in our country those who are responsible for this are often insufficiently active or incompetent. This is why we must now start serious analytical and organizational work at state organizations and enterprises. The future of Ukraine is closely linked to the Black Sea region and at the early stages it is important not to err in selecting strategy and tactics, for in no time at all we may find ourselves on the "dustheap of history."
