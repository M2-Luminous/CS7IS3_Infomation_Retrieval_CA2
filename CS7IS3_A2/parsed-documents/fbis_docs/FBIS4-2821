The two countries have sent many delegations to visit each other since the normalization of relations between the two parties and two countries. This helped promote the bilateral relationship and heralded a new stage in bilateral relations. Nong Duc Manh said: "My recent goodwill visit to China at the head of a Vietnam National Assembly delegation was a success. We saw with our own eyes the Chinese people's great achievements that were brought by adherence to the policy of reform and opening up under the CPC's leadership. A rosy picture of development prospects is now spread before the Vietnamese and Chinese peoples." PRC Ambassador to Vietnam Zhang Qing was present at the meeting. China's NPC Financial and Economic Committee delegation arrived in Hanoi on 9 April. The delegation held talks with Vietnam's National Assembly Economic and Financial Budget Committee delegation and visited the Vietnamese Finance Ministry, Trade Ministry, and State Cooperation and Investment Committee. The Chinese delegation will also visit Ha Bac, Quang Tri-Hue, Quang Nam-Da Nang, and Ho Chi Minh City.
