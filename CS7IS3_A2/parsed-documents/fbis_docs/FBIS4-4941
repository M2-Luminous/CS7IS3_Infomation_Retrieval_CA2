According to the paper, North Korea has developed long-range missiles with modern technologies from China. China, in return, is exporting missiles and other arms to the Middle East region via North Korean ports. The source said that the China North Industries Group and Poly Technologies Incorporated are working in close military cooperation with North Korea. Both manufacture and sell arms and are directly controlled by the People's Liberation Army. The source added that the bilateral relations of cooperation between China and North Korea have been maintained for a long period of time through these organs. In particular, the China North Industries Group has recently provided modern missile technology to North Korea, enabling it to complete the development of long-range missiles, the paper reported. The paper pointed out that chances are very slim that China, which accounts for 85 percent of major imported goods to North Korea, will take part in practical sanctions against North Korea, even if it abstains when the UN Security Council votes on economic sanctions against North Korea.
