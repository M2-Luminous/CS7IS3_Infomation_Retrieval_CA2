He said: [Chuan] It is my great pleasure and joy to have the honor of attending the seminar opening today, held in an atmostphere of cooperation between Vietnamese and Thai businessmen, who have a very important mandate to promote bilateral cooperation and investment. Thailand and Vietnam are two close neighbors with historical ties of friendship. Now that the situation has changed and has become much better than in the past, the two countries must bring about improvements to achieve closer ties, especially on the issue of investment and trade cooperation on the basis of mutual benefit. I would like to compliment Vietnam for the economic growth it has achieved since the introduction of its renovation policy in 1987. Its economy has achieved tangible development. I believe that with their abundant natural resources and their determination, the Vietnamese people can achieve rapid national growth through economic development. The Thai Government is ready to cooperate with Vietnam in achieving that goal. The establishment of the Thailand-Vietnam Cooperation Committee provides a fine basis for the development of cooperative bilateral relations. This cooperation committee has met twice and its latest meeting was in November 1993. This reflects the goal of both countries to develop increasingly durable and closer ties. In the area Thai-Vietnamese trade relations in particular, the Thai Government has totally supported and encouraged the development of free bilateral trade. The volume of bilateral trade has increased from 2.876 billion baht in 1990 to 4.916 billion baht in 1993. In addition, the two countries have reached a consensus that they will set up a trade subcommittee under the cooperation committee to promote bilateral trade. The Thai Government has agreed to provide long-term credit for Vietnam, to begin from December last year. All this shows that trade cooperation has become ever closer and has enjoyed opportunities for development, particularly in terms of investment. Thai investors are showing increasing interest in Vietnam. From 1987 to 1991, Thai investors had 27 investment projects with a total capital of over $6 million licensed. This ranks them 12th in the list of countries with investments in Vietnam, and shows Thailand's growing interest in Vietnam. As far as I see it, my exchange of views with His Excellency Vo Van Kiet yesterday has helped to create confidence for increased bilateral trade ties. The Thai Government has tasked its investment committee with the duty of creating favorable conditions for Thai businessmen wishing to invest in Vietnam. In 1992, the Thai Investment Committee and the Vietnamese Committee for Cooperation and Investment signed an agreement on investment cooperation. The Vietnamese Committee for Cooperation and Investment has cooperated with Thai Government agencies in various areas in the past. It has on several occasions welcomed many Thai delegations seeking investment opportunities and disseminated information on investment. I would like to emphasize here that it is the goal of the Thai Government to encourage Thai investors to invest in Vietnam on a mutually beneficial basis in line with the socioeconomic policy of each country. On this occasion, allow me to thank his excellency the minister of state in charge of Vietnam's State Committee for Cooperation and Investment for having created opportunities for Thai investors to invest and do business in Vietnam. I also hope to have Your Excellency's support and attention for the period ahead to create confidence in Thai investors wishing to invest in Vietnam. I hope this seminar will help promote the rapid growth of bilateral cooperation and investment. During my exchange of views with His Excellency Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet, we also stressed the need for the two sides to create conditions for the development of bilateral cooperation and investment. I also briefed his excellency the prime minister on the difficulties Thai investors now face, and expressed the hope that the Vietnamese side would create conditions for the quicker development of bilateral cooperation. During my meeting with General Secretary Do Muoi, I also exchanged views with him. The general secretary said he would pay attention to creating the conditions for and help resolve the problems that have been held up. It is hoped that investment and trade cooperation between Vietnam and Thailand will develop further.
