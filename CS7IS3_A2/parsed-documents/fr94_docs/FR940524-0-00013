Subpart F contains the general rules and requirements governing the competitive bidding process for narrowband PCS initial licenses. Subpart G contains general rules and requirements for processing applications. Applicants are required to file certain information so that the Commission can determine whether the applicants are legally, technically and financially qualified to be licensed. Affected members of the public are any members of the public who wants to become a licensee. The foregoing estimates include the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collections of information. Send comments regarding these burden estimates or any other aspect of the collections of information including suggestions for reducing the burden to the Federal Communications Commission, Records Management Division, Paperwork Reduction Project, Washington, DC 20554 and to the Office of the Management and Budget Paperwork Reduction Project, Washington, DC 20503. Summary of the Third Report and Order Introduction 1. In this Third Report and Order, we adopt service-specific rules for competitive bidding on licenses to be awarded for Personal Communications Services in the 900 MHz band (``narrowband PCS''). We conclude that because of the significant interdependence among narrowband PCS licenses and the relatively high expected value of such licenses, most narrowband PCS licenses will be awarded through a sequence of simultaneous multiple round auctions. We will also adopt a system of preferences designed to enhance access to narrowband PCS spectrum and achieve the congressional directive that our competitive bidding rules ensure the opportunity of small businesses and businesses owned by women and minorities to participate in the auction process.
