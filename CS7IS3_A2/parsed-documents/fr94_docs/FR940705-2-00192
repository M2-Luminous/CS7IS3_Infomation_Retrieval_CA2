FR940705-2-00192 FR940705-2-00091 Appendix E&hyph;V. Streptomyces Appendix E&hyph;V&hyph;A. Streptomyces Host-Vector 1 Systems The following Streptomyces species: Streptomyces coelicolor, S. lividans, S. parvulus , and S. griseus. The following are accepted as vector components of certified Streptomyces Host-Vector 1 systems: Streptomyces plasmids SCP2, SLP1.2, pIJ101, actinophage phi C31, and their derivatives. Appendix E&hyph;VI. Pseudomonas Putida Appendix E&hyph;VI&hyph;A. Pseudomonas putida Host-Vector 1 Systems Pseudomonas putida strains KT2440 with plasmid vectors pKT262, pKT263, and pKT264. Appendix F. Containment Conditions for Cloning of Genes Coding for the Biosynthesis of Molecules Toxic for Vertebrates Appendix F&hyph;I. General Information Appendix F specifies the containment to be used for the deliberate cloning of genes coding for the biosynthesis of molecules toxic for vertebrates. The cloning of genes coding for molecules toxic for vertebrates that have an LD 50 of <100 nanograms per kilograms body weight (e.g., microbial toxins such as the botulinum toxins, tetanus toxin, diphtheria toxin, Shigella dysenteriae neurotoxin) are covered under Section III&hyph;B&hyph;1 and require Institutional Biosafety Committee and NIH/ORDA approval before initiation. No specific restrictions shall apply to the cloning of genes if the protein specified by the gene has an LD 50 "100 micrograms per kilograms of body weight. Experiments involving genes coding for toxin molecules with an LD 50 of <100 micrograms per kilograms and >100 nanograms per kilograms body weight require Institutional Biosafety Committee approval and registration with NIH/ORDA prior to initiating the experiments. A list of toxin molecules classified as to LD 50 is available from NIH/ORDA. Testing procedures for determining toxicity of toxin molecules not on the list are available from the Office of Recombinant DNA Activities, National Institutes of Health, Building 31, Room 4B11, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, (301) 496&hyph;9838. The results of such tests shall be forwarded to NIH/ORDA, which will consult with ad hoc experts, prior to inclusion of the molecules on the list (see Section IV&hyph;C&hyph;1&hyph;b&hyph;(2)&hyph;(e)). Appendix F&hyph;II. Cloning of Toxin Molecule Genes in Escherichia coli K&hyph;12 Appendix F&hyph;II&hyph;A. Cloning of genes coding for molecules toxic for vertebrates that have an LD 50 of >100 nanograms per kilograms and <1000 nanograms per kilograms body weight (e.g., abrin, Clostridium perfringens epsilon toxin) may proceed under Biosafety Level (BL) 2 + EK2 or BL3 + EK1 containment conditions. Appendix F&hyph;II&hyph;B. Cloning of genes for the biosynthesis of molecules toxic for vertebrates that have an LD 50 of >1 microgram per kilogram and <100 microgram per kilogram body weight may proceed under BL1 + EK1 containment conditions (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus alpha toxin, Staphylococcus aureus beta toxin, ricin, Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A, Bordetella pertussis toxin, the lethal factor of Bacillus anthracis, the Pasteurella pestis murine toxins, the oxygen-labile hemolysins such as streptolysin O, and certain neurotoxins present in snake venoms and other venoms). Appendix F&hyph;II&hyph;C. Some enterotoxins are substantially more toxic when administered enterally than parenterally. The following enterotoxins shall be subject to BL1 + EK1 containment conditions: cholera toxin, the heat labile toxins of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, and other related proteins that may be identified by neutralization with an antiserum monospecific for cholera toxin, and the heat stable toxins of Escherichia coli and of Yersinia enterocolitica. Appendix F&hyph;III. Cloning of Toxic Molecule Genes in Organisms Other Than Escherichia coli K&hyph;12 Requests involving the cloning of genes coding for molecules toxic for vertebrates at an LD 50 of <100 nanograms per kilogram body weight in host-vector systems other than Escherichia coli K&hyph;12 will be evaluated by NIH/ORDA in consultation with ad hoc toxin experts (see Sections III&hyph;B&hyph;1 and IV&hyph;C&hyph;1&hyph;b&hyph;(2)&hyph;(e)). Appendix F&hyph;IV. Specific Approvals An updated list of experiments involving the deliberate formation of recombinant DNA containing genes coding for toxins lethal for vertebrates at an LD 50 of <100 nanograms per kilogram body weight is available from the Office of Recombinant DNA Activities, National Institutes of Health, Building 31, Room 4B11, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, (301) 496&hyph;9838. Appendix G. Physical Containment Appendix G specifies physical containment for standard laboratory experiments and defines Biosafety Level 1 through Biosafety Level 4. For large scale (over 10 liters) research or production, Appendix K supersedes Appendix G. Appendix K defines Good Large Scale Practice through Biosafety Level 3_Large Scale. For certain work with plants, Appendix P supersedes Appendix G. Appendix P defines Biosafety Levels 1 through 4_Plants. For certain work with animals, Appendix Q supersedes Appendix G. Appendix Q defines Biosafety Levels 1 through 4_Animals. Appendix G&hyph;I. Standard Practices and Training The first principle of containment is strict adherence to good microbiological practices (see Appendices G&hyph;III&hyph;A through G&hyph;III&hyph;J). Consequently, all personnel directly or indirectly involved in experiments using recombinant DNA shall receive adequate instruction (see Sections IV&hyph;B&hyph;1&hyph;e and IV&hyph;B&hyph;4&hyph;d). At a minimum, these instructions include training in aseptic techniques and in the biology of the organisms used in the experiments so that the potential biohazards can be understood and appreciated. Any research group working with agents that are known or potential biohazards shall have an emergency plan that describes the procedures to be followed if an accident contaminates personnel or the environment. The Principal Investigator shall ensure that everyone in the laboratory is familiar with both the potential hazards of the work and the emergency plan (see Sections IV&hyph;B&hyph;4&hyph;d and IV&hyph;B&hyph;4&hyph;e). If a research group is working with a known pathogen for which there is an effective vaccine, the vaccine should be made available to all workers. Serological monitoring, when clearly appropriate, will be provided (see Section IV&hyph;B&hyph;1&hyph;f).
