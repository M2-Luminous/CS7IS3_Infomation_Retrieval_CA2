Since C.F. Koo, chairman of the Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), and Wang Daohan, chairman of Beijing's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), met April 27-29 in Singapore for the first "direct formal" talks between Taiwan and the Chinese mainland since 1949, three other SEF-ARATS "business" talks have taken place. The three "business" meetings were held in August, November, and December in Beijing, Xiamen and Taipei respectively. Although the talks did not result in any definite agreements, the two sides arrived at a consensus that a negotiation channel for direct talks between the two semi-official intermediary organizations had been established. During the three-day "Koo-Wang" talks in April, the two organizations signed four agreements, including the agreement on the establishment of systematic liaison and communication channels between SEF and ARATS which stipulates that SEF and ARATS officials at the level of deputy secretary-general or department director should hold talks every three months on either side of the Taiwan strait. Under the Koo-Wang talks joint accord, the two sides were to hold talks during 1993 on such issues as repatriation of illegal immigrants, fishing disputes, crackdown on crimes on the sea, judicial assistance, and intellectual property rights protektion. With a communication mechanism linking SEF and ARATS established by the "Koo-Wang" talks, SEF and ARATS officials met three times in 1993, but all talks ended without agreement. Even though "official" relations between the two sides made little progress, private ties, especially two-way trade, continued to grow during the past year. According to Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) statistics, indirect two-way trade between Taiwan and the mainland reached US$6.39 billion in the Jan-Sept period last year, up 21.2 percent from US$5.28 billion in the same period of 1992. In terms of civilian visits, 1993 saw a faster growth for the mainland than Taiwan, MAC said. Mainland residents made 16,000 visits to Taiwan during the first 10 months of 1993, up 36.96 percent from the corresponding period of 1992. Taiwan residents, meanwhile, paid 1,230,000 visits to the mainland, compared with 1,280,000 visits registered a year earlier, MAC statistics showed. During the past year, a MAC official said, a "white paper" published by Beijing in August concerning its relations with Taiwan was an undeniable setback in the course of cross-strait relations. A spate of 10 hijackings in 1993 also had an adverse effect on the development of cross-Taiwan strait relations, the official remarked. Nevertheless, MAC, SEF, and all related government agencies have determined to try harder in the next years to reach the goal of final reunification of China, said MAC Spokesman Kao Koong-lien.
