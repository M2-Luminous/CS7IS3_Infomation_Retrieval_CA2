In statements to the Spanish Radio Broadcasting Company, Serra said that the 33d Socialist congress "gave its support, by 96 percent, to theses and a leadership team vastly different from the previous one, which will carry out those theses because it is perfectly attuned to Gonzalez and because it is a team of people with influence in the party and the ability to mobilize it." The deputy prime minister also highlighted the support that the party gave at the congress for the government's activity. "The government's policy, including the labor reform policy, our proposals for emerging from the crisis, the democratic impetus proposal -- all this was fully endorsed at the congress. The new Federal Executive Committee is better able to coordinate activity with the government and to listen in the government." Support Gonzalez In Serra's opinion, the congress is an extremely clear step forward toward cohesion in the party, which acquires a powerful and representative Executive Committee that supports the secretary general's decisions. "I believe that for many years we have not had a means to resolve the problems that arise in any party," he added, referring to the new Executive Committee. Brand-new Organization Secretary Cipria Ciscar also assessed the congress' consequences on the following day. Ciscar said that he prefers "to be called a Socialist as such, and that is enough. I do not consider exactly the numbers in the Executive Committee, because that committee has people who are very representative of the party," he said. Ciscar agreed with Serra that at the Federal Congress "Felipe Gonzalez' arguments won, since renewal went ahead, and there were important changes; he wanted party integration and cohesion, and that is what won." In statements to Onda Cero, Ciscar also stated that "we must be glad that we all believe that we won, because that also shows that there is a desire to work satisfactorily." Ciscar said that the formation of the Executive Committee was "an important change," and added that there was a "basic renewal in the sphere of ideas, which establishes a clear connection between party and government policy." The new organization secretary stated that Jose Maria Benegas, his predecessor in the post, "is somebody who has worked hard and has his own political significance," and added that he "is glad about that," but this "causes no complex." He asserted that there have been problems over the past two years and that the precongress process was "lively," but following this congress, he added, "I believe that the agreement that occurred and the commitment to work in the Executive Committee are sincere, and it should be loyal."
