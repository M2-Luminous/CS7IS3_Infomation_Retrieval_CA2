FR940105-1-00011 FR940105-1-00004 14 CFR Parts 27 and 29 Future Harmonized Rotorcraft Rulemaking; Normal Category Maximum Weight; Meeting AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of public meeting. SUMMARY: The FAA is announcing a public meeting to discuss the use of Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Commission procedures in future harmonized rulemaking. Once specific rulemaking topic that will be discussed is a proposed increase in the current maximum gross weight limitation of 6,000 pounds for certification as a normal category rotorcraft. DATES: The meeting will begin at 9 a.m. PDT on February 2, 1994. ADDRESSES: The meeting will be held at the Anaheim Marriott, Ballrooms E and G, 700 West Convention Way, Anaheim, California 92802, telephone 714&hyph;750&hyph;8000 (headquarters hotel for the Helicopter Association International Heli Expo '94). FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Eric Bries, Manager, Rotorcraft Standards Staff, ASW&hyph;110, FAA, Rotorcraft Directorate, Fort Worth, Texas 76193&hyph;0110, telephone (817) 222&hyph;5110 or fax (817) 222&hyph;5961. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Rotorcraft Directorate, has recently completed a series of harmonization meetings with the Helicopter Airworthiness Study Group (HASG) of the European Joint Airworthiness Authorities (JAA). The meetings were supplemented with joint authorities and industry meetings. These meetings resulted in the issuance of European Joint Airworthiness Requirements 27 (September 1993) and 29 (November 1993), which are in basic harmonization with Federal Aviation Regulations parts 27 and 29 (FAR 27 and 29). Current rulemaking using the Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee (ARAC) is intended to amend FAR 27 and 29 to complete the harmonization process for existing rules. To assure future rotorcraft rulemaking is harmonized to the greatest extent practical and to provide information on rulemaking using the ARAC, the FAA believes that a public meeting is warranted. The public meeting will also be used to discuss draft revisions for Advisory Circular (AC) 27&hyph;1, Change 3, and AC 29&hyph;2A, Change 2 (58 FR 67893, December 22, 1993). Future Harmonized Rotorcraft Rulemaking_General Status reports on the current harmonization efforts will be made by American and European authorities and industry representatives. A presentation on the ARAC will be made. Discussion will follow the presentation and will focus on the following items: _ARAC _International Harmonization of rulemaking _Future rotorcraft rulemaking_general Normal Category Maximum Gross Weight of 6,000 Pounds Since 1956 the FAA has based the primary and obvious distinction between normal and transport category rotorcraft certification requirements on the maximum certificated gross weight of the aircraft. The upper gross weight limit for normal category rotorcraft was set at 6,000 pounds, based on existing and anticipated designs. All rotorcraft above the 6,000 pounds maximum certificated gross weight are required to be certificated in the transport category. Recently the FAA received two requests for exemptions from this criteria and numerous recommendations for varying degrees of changes to the airworthiness standards. The FAA recognizes that helicopters, and their operational roles, have evolved since the 6,000-pound rule was established in 1956, and therefore some changes may be warranted. Based on this recognition, the FAA developed an issue paper entitled ``Certification Categories for Civil Rotorcraft.'' This paper will be used to facilitate discussion at the public meeting. Copies of the paper have been mailed to interested parties. Additional interested parties who have not received a copy of the paper by January 1, 1994, may obtain a copy by contacting the person listed under ``FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT.'' Meeting Procedures The meeting is being chaired by the Rotorcraft Directorate. Participants will include FAA representatives from Flight Standards, Legal Counsel, and the Office of International Aviation; JAA representatives from engineering and operations; and industry groups from the U.S. and Europe. The following procedures will be used to conduct the meeting: 1. Registration will be from 8&hyph;9 a.m. PDT on February 2, 1994. There will be no registration fee. Preregistration is recommended and may be accomplished by contacting the person listed under the caption ``FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT.'' 2. The meeting will be recorded by a court reporter, and transcripts will be available for purchase directly from the court reporter. 3. Statements by the FAA will be made to facilitate discussion and should not be taken as expressing a final FAA position. 4. The FAA will consider all material presented at the meeting by participants. Handouts will be accepted at the discretion of the chairperson; however, enough copies should be provided for distribution to all participants. Issued in Fort Worth, Texas, on December 20, 1993.
