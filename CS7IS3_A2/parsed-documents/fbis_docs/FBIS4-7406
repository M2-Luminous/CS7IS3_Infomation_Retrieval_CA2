FBIS4-7406 "dreas083_d_94003" FBIS-EAS-94-083 Daily Report 23 Apr 1994 South Korea IAEA Plans To Send Inspection Team 24 Apr IAEA Plans To Send Inspection Team 24 Apr SK2304023694 Seoul YONHAP in English 0224 GMT 23 Apr 94 SK2304023694 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Washington, April 22 (YONHAP) -- The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will form two inspection teams to witness the changing of fuel rods at North Korea's 5-megawatt nuclear reactor in Yongbyon and plans to send the first one Sunday, diplomatic sources here said Friday. As North Korea has already notified the IAEA that it will soon change fuel rods at the 5-megawatt reactor, an advance team leaves Vienna on Sunday and is to arrive in Pyongyang Tuesday to prepare for the refueling procedure. The second team will depart for Pyongyang around Wednesday to push for full-fleged inspections including observation of the refueling, according to the sources. The second team's inspection activities, however, might be limited because North Korea is still resisting IAEA demands for additional checks such as collecting samples at a radiochemical laboratory, saying only that it will allow the inspectors to witness the fuel-rod change. The United States will hold a working-level contact with North Korea next week to discuss the teams' scope of inspection duties in witnessing the refueling as well as additional checks of the radiochemical laboratory. They are also expected to discuss meeting the conditions for a third round of high-level talks. The sources expected that the U.S. Government will hold a senior officials' meeting to chart a course on the nuclear issue and that it will urge North Korea to accept further checks to ensure that the next round of dialogue takes place. Meanwhile, State Department spokesman Mike McCurry said Washington can only hold the third round of talks with Pyongyang when the Feb. 15 agreement on the continuity of safeguards at North Korea's seven declared sites is implemented. McCurry added, "... IAEA inspectors must be present to monitor the unloading and storage of this spent fuel. And we've made it clear from the very beginning that if the IAEA is not allowed to do this, we would have no choice but to end our dialogue with North Korea and return the issue to the Security Council."
