FR940106-1-00011 FR940106-1-00004 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Parts 52 and 81 [TX&hyph;22&hyph;1&hyph;5738; FRL&hyph;4821&hyph;9] Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plan Texas State II Program AGENCY: United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: The EPA is taking action to approve the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission State II State Implementation Plan (SIP), which includes a SIP Supplement dated September 30, 1992, and Regulation V (31 TAC Section 115 Subchapter C: Volatile Organic Compound Marketing Operations), as a revision to the Texas SIP for ozone. On November 13, 1992, Texas submitted a SIP revision request to the EPA to satisfy the Clean Air Act, as amended (1990). This SIP revision requires owners and operators of gasoline dispensing facilities to install and operate Stage II vapor recovery equipment in the four Texas ozone nonattainment areas classified as moderate or worse. This revision applies to the Texas counties of Brazoria, Chambers, Collin, Dallas, Denton, El Paso, Fort Bend, Galveston, Hardin, Harris, Jefferson, Liberty, Montgomery, Orange, Tarrant, and Waller. DATES: Comments must be received by February 7, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should be sent to James F. Davis at U.S. EPA Region 6, (6T&hyph;AP), 1445 Ross Avenue, Suite 700, Dallas, Texas 75202&hyph;2733. The State submittal and the technical support document (TSD) are available for public review at the above address and at the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission, Stage II Program, 12124 Park 35 Circle, Austin, Texas 78753. Interested persons wanting to examine these documents should make an appointment with the appropriate office at least 24 hours before the visiting day. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: James F. Davis at (214) 655&hyph;7584. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Under section 182(b)(3) of the Clean Air Act (CAA), the EPA was required to issue guidance as to the effectiveness of Stage II systems. The EPA issued technical guidance in November 1991, and enforcement guidance in December 1991, to meet this requirement. 1 In addition, on April 16, 1992, the EPA published the ``General Preamble for the Implementation of Title I of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990'' (General Preamble) (57 FR 13498). The guidance documents and the General Preamble interpret the Stage II statutory requirement and indicate what the EPA believes a State submittal needs to include to meet that requirement. 1 These two documents are entitled ``Technical Guidance_Stage II Vapor Recovery Systems for Control of Vehicle Refueling Emissions at Gasoline Dispensing Facilities'' (EPA&hyph;450/3&hyph;91&hyph;022) and ``Enforcement Guidance for Stage II Vehicle Refueling Control Programs.'' The EPA has designated four areas as ozone nonattainment in the State of Texas. The Houston/Galveston/Brazoria ozone nonattainment area is classified as severe and contains the following eight counties: Brazoria, Chambers, Fort Bend, Galveston, Harris, Liberty, Montgomery, and Waller. The Beaumont/Port Arthur ozone nonattainment area is classified as serious and contains the following three counties: Hardin, Jefferson, and Orange. The El Paso ozone nonattainment area is classified as serious and contains the county of El Paso. The Dallas/Fort Worth ozone nonattainment area is classified as moderate and contains the following four counties: Collin, Dallas, Denton, and Tarrant. The designations for ozone were published in the Federal Register (FR) on November 6, 1991, and November 30, 1992, and have been codified in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). See 56 FR 56694 (November 6, 1991) and 57 FR 56762 (November 30, 1992), codified at 40 CFR sections 81.300&hyph;81.437. Under section 182(b)(3) of the amended CAA, Texas was required to submit Stage II vapor recovery rules for these areas by November 15, 1992. On November 13, 1992, Governor Ann W. Richards submitted to the EPA Stage II vapor recovery rules and a SIP Supplement dated September 30, 1992, which were adopted by the State on October 16, 1992. By today's action, the EPA is proposing to approve this submittal. The EPA has reviewed the State submittal against the statutory requirements and for consistency with the EPA guidance. A summary of the EPA's analysis is provided below. In addition, a more detailed analysis of the State submittal is contained in a TSD, dated June 25, 1993, which is available from the Region 6 Office, listed above.
