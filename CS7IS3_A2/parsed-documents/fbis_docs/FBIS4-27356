Matsushita is introducing their forte of AV technology into personal computers, and further strengthening their information home electronics field. The shipment of personal computers for multimedia which can process graphics and audio in addition to character data is expanding year by year, and IBM Japan, NEC, and others are also planning to introduce products which have a television function. If a communications service for both is begun in the future, there also are expectations that the "television personal computer" will become the favorite multimedia terminal within the home, and competition has begun between home electronics and personal computer manufacturers concerning the new market. The DOS/V specification personal computer "Woody" which Matsushita Electric Industrial is putting on sale is standard equipped with audio multiplex television tuner, stereo speakers, and a CD-ROM device (read only memory using compact disk). Besides being able to see television on a 14-inch personal computer screen, CD-ROM, music CD's, and "photo CD's" that store photos on CD's also can be enjoyed. Television programs can be received even while operating the personal computer. For example, a news program is shown in a corner of the screen while preparing a document with word processing software. In order to digitize the analog television video, the necessary scene is made into a static graphic and introduced as data video in the document, and can be stored on a hard disk. Use by beginners is assumed and recording of graphics is performed by a simple button operation. The price is 358,000 yen for the model which carries a 170-megabyte hard disk, and 398,000 yen for the 340-megabyte model. They are set at a rather high price compared to multimedia personal computers equipped with a CD-ROM device. "The target is the young age group of students up to 31 years old. Rather than enjoyment by the whole family, demand for one machine per person is expected." (Mutsuo Miyake, manager, Computer Division, Matsushita Electric Industrial) They are scheduling yearly production of 50,000 machines. IBM Japan soon will put on sale a television personal computer carrying a television tuner with "PS/V vision" as the basis. With price on the mid-300,000 yen level, it will directly run up against the new products of Matsushita Electric Industrial. NEC also believes that "The color screen of a personal computer can be applied to television, telephones, and facsimile. We will be steadily introducing information equipment in the home" (Director Yuki Takayama). The time has not yet been decided, but it appear that they will introduce a television personal computer within the year. It seems that they will proceed quickly in the future with "making a personal computer home appliance" that incorporates various functions such as a telephone and facsimile.
