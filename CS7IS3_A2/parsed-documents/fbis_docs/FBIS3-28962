Leader Yi Chong-chan and member Chang Kyong-u of the New Korea Party, New Party for Political Reform Chairman Pak Chong-chan, Han Yong-su of the United People's Party and independent Yang Sun-chik will get together to try and iron out their differences in organizing a third group. Under the law, a negotiating group is eligible only if it contains more than 20 lawmakers. Currently, the floor is limited to the ruling Democratic Liberal Party and main opposition Democratic Party. Initially, 21 concerned lawmakers were to hold a meeting on Monday to officially announce the idea and register the new floor group on the following day, when the ad hoc National Assembly session opens. But the schedule has become unclear as a few lawmakers are now saying there is no hurry. "Although we may not register immediately, we will hold the meeting on Monday as scheduled," Yi of the New Korea Party said. "The date is a bit too close for comfort and I say we take our time," independent Yang said, adding that he will think about attending Monday's meeting.
