FR940826-1-00071 FR940826-1-00009 47. We propose therefore to allow women and minority-owned firms the following options. First, they may satisfy the general definition set forth in the Second Report and Order , which requires the minority and/or female principals to control the applicant, own at least 50.1 percent of its equity and, in the case of corporate applicants, hold at least 50.1 percent of the voting stock. Under this option, other investors may own as much as a 49.9 percent passive equity interest. As noted above regarding eligibility to bid in the entrepreneurs' blocks, passive equity in the corporate context means only non-voting stock may be held, or stock that includes no more than fifteen percent of the voting interests. 42 For partnerships, the term means limited partnership interests that do not have the power to exercise control of the entity. We ask commenters specifically to address whether the proposed fifteen percent voting interest limitation strikes the correct balance, or whether a higher percentage would facilitate capital formation without unduly contributing to a proliferation of shams. In addition, the Second Report and Order , all investor interests would be calculated on a fully-diluted basis, meaning that agreements such as stock options, warrants and convertible debentures generally would be considered to have a present effect and would be treated as if the rights thereunder already have been fully exercised. 43 We recognize that the requirement that other investors own only passive interests would be a departure from the definition of a minority or women-owned business adopted in the Second Report and Order , but because of the very significant financial contribution that may be made by such other investors in designated entities, we believe that the passive equity requirement may be appropriate as an additional safeguard. In addition, we seek comments on whether these rules as currently framed may affect the ability of legitimate designated entities to obtain the capital needed to participate in the auction. 42 For example, under this option, a corporate applicant with two classes of issued and outstanding stock, 100 shares of voting stock and 100 shares of non-voting stock, could sell to a single non-eligible entity 49.9 percent of the applicant's equity, consisting of 5 shares of the corporation's voting stock and 94 shares of its non-voting stock. Under this scenario, eligible minorities or women, in order to retain at least 50.1 percent of the value of all outstanding shares of the corporation's stock, must own all of the corporation's remaining shares of stock; that is, 95 shares of voting stock and six shares of non-voting stock. 43 As also noted in the Second Report and Order, we will consider departing from the requirement that the equity of investors in minority and women-owned businesses must be calculated on a fully-diluted basis only upon a demonstration, in individual cases, that options or conversion rights held by non-controlling principals will not deprive the minority and women principals of a substantial financial stake in the venture or impair their rights to control the designated entity. See Second Report and Order at Â¶277. 48. As a second proposed option, women and minority-owned firms would be able to sell up to 75 percent of the company's equity, provided that no single investor may hold 25 percent or more of the firm's passive equity, which is defined in the same manner as above. For example, a corporation with 100 shares of voting stock and 100 shares of non-voting stock, with the 200 shares representing the total outstanding shares of the company, could qualify as a minority or women-owned business under the following circumstances. The minority or women principals would have to own at least 51 shares of voting stock, which satisfies the requirement that they have voting control and, in this case, also meets the requirement that they hold at least 25 percent of the equity. Two other investors could each own 34 shares of non-voting stock and fifteen shares of voting stock, which represents 24.5 percent of the company's equity for each of the shareholders. A third investor could own the remaining 32 shares of non-voting stock and fifteen shares of the voting stock, or 23.5 percent of the equity. The remaining 4 shares of voting stock may be sold to other investors. 49. Whichever option is chosen, we would require establishment of a ``control group'' for women and minority-owned firms in much the same way we did for purposes of eligibility to bid in the entrepreneurs' blocks. Specifically, winning bidders, transferees or assignees would have to identify on their long-form applications a control group (consisting entirely of minorities and/or women or entities 100 percent owned and controlled by minorities and women) that has de jure and de facto control of the applicant and holds either at least 50.1 or 25 percent of the applicant's equity, depending upon which option is elected. 50. We believe that a modification of our 50.1 percent equity requirement would best achieve the Congressional objective of providing effective and long-term economic opportunities for women and minority-owned firms in narrowband PCS. At the same time, we propose to maintain strict enforcement of the requirement that actual control reside with the qualified designated entities. Thus, to establish their eligibility for tax certificates, enhanced installment payments, bidding credits and relaxed cellular attribution rules, women and minority-owned applicants electing to use the 25 percent equity option could not in any instance allow an individual investor who is not in the control group to own more than a 25 percent passive equity interest. This restriction would apply even in circumstances in which allowing an investor to exceed these limitations would not result in the applicant's exceeding the gross revenues and other financial standards that apply to other bidders in the entrepreneurs' blocks and other situations involving financial caps. These structural safeguards, as well as the general requirement that other investors hold only passive interests in women and minority-owned applicants, would help to ensure that control truly remains with the women and minority designated entities.
