"We will invest approximately $500 million more in China over the next three to five years," said Jeffrey Gannon, President and CEO of GE China in an exclusive interview with CHINA DAILY over the weekend. The figure excludes investment by GE Capital, a specialized investment arm of the company, which has total assets of more than $211 billion. GE Capital has over $1 billion invested in Chinese aircraft and container leasing operations, which it has run for several years. It is planning to upgrade its representative office into a wholly owned branch later this year, Gannon said. GE plans to set up seven major new enterprises in China, either wholly owned or in joint ventures, by 1996. They will be in the areas of lighting, plastics, locomotives, hydropower, gas and steam turbine generators, appliances, and financial services. "We are planning for the next 100 years in China, and we want to be a Chinese company, an insider of the Chinese economy," Gannon said. The best way to achieve that goal is to localize GE's business in China, he explained. Despite the dispute between China and the United States over the most favoured-nation (MFN) issue Gannon said GE has decided to increase its presence in China "without hesitation. "We have confidence in this country and, even without MFN, there will be significant trade flow between GE and China." he said. According to him, the withdrawal of MFN will have a short-term impact on GE's business in China, but the company is looking at the Chinese market on its own merits. GE has reached final agreement with a partner in Shanghai and is awaiting approval to set up what will be China's largest lighting manufacturing plant. GE will hold the majority interest. Gannon said a certain part of the joint venture's products will be exported to balance its foreign exchanges. GE has also set up a wholly owned plant in Guangdong Province. The construction of the facility started 1 April. The plant, which involves a $50 million investment from GE, will be the first to produce hi-tech engineered plastics in China when it comes on line . GE is also negotiating to form a joint venture for local service and training for its aircraft engines sold in China. To date, GE has captured about one-third of the Chinese aircraft engine market. Gannon predicted that the share could increase to more than a half in the near term. As for the power sector, GE is planning to localize the production of gas and steam turbine generators, as well as hydro equipment. "We expect GE's annual sales (plus orders) in China to reach more than $2 billion by 1996 or 1997, up from $1.1 billion last year," he forecast.
