They were introduced in response to the cancellation of last year's program for transition to civilian rule and the ousting in November of the civilian-led interim government. But now Nigeria's Army chief of staff, who has been visiting troops serving in Somalia, has called for the sanctions to be lifted and he even suggested that if they continue they could interfere with Nigeria's future contributions to UN peacekeeping operation. On the line to Lagos, Akwe Amosu asked the chief of staff's spokesman, Colonel Okon, if the sanctions were really hurting the Nigerian Army. [Begin recording] [Okon] It does hurt in the sense that we source our equipment and other war material from the Western world. And to be effective and to be continuous in answering to UN calls for peacekeeping operations, we need to replace this equipment to be able to be effective all the time. [Amosu] Do you actually need to replace large numbers of weapons now? [Okon] Not necessarily large numbers if the effectiveness is continuous. What the Nigerian Army is saying is that, over the years, the Nigerian Army has been called upon by the United Nations to take part in peacekeeping operations in troubled areas of the world. And, whenever it's been called upon, it normally, usually, reacts swiftly. [Amosu] So, would you say that your capacity to continue such missions overseas is compromised by the sanctions? [Okon] Well, naturally, if an army is out of equipment, then certainly its performance will be diminished. [Amosu] The point is that, as you well know, the sanctions were in fact imposed as a criticism of the Nigerian Government for failing to introduce democratic change fast enough and for reneging on promises to move to civilian rule.... [Okon, interrupting] So.... [Amosu, interrupting] And, the question that everybody will be asking when they hear you say this is: What have you done to merit having the sanctions lifted? [Okon] Yes, well, the Nigerian military did not just scuttle the democratic process for the fun of it. What happened is, in the circumstances of the situation, the Army had to intervene to prevent the nation from total disintegration, which might have followed the events in the country. And, right now, what the chief of Army staff...[pauses] our people...[pauses] he assured the international community that the present administration has already commenced in earnest the process of democratization with the full aim of returning the country to complete civilian rule. [Amosu] Well, he has said that, but there is very little evidence on the ground so far that it is happening. The people who imposed the sanctions will want to see concrete evidence before they take them away. [Okon] Well, if he says it at that level, you just have to believe that that is what has been done. [Amosu] Is Nigeria threatening to withdraw from international peacekeeping work unless the sanctions are lifted? [Okon] No, no, no, that is not what it has done. No. [Amosu] So, this is just a friendly request from Nigeria to the rest of world to stop getting on our backs and just [words indistinct]? [Okon] Naturally, it can't do it by force. [end recording]
