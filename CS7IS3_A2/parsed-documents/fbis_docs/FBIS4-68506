According to the Russian Federation Goskomstat [State Committee on Statistics], in 1993 foreign investment in the Russian economy amounted to $2.9 billion (including $2.6 billion in direct investment, which includes the right to participate in managing the enterprise). The regions that have been most attractive for foreign investors are Moscow, where 26.2 percent of all money has been invested; Krasnoyarsk Kray--14.2 percent; Omsk Oblast--8.1 percent; Arkhangelsk Oblast--7.9 percent; Yevreyskaya Autonomous Oblast--5.9 percent; the Republic of Mari El--5.0 percent; Belgorod Oblast--4.1 percent; and the Komi Republic--3.6 percent. No official statistical data has been reported on the placement of the remaining 25 percent of investment in 69 regions of Russia. Looking at the territorial aspect of placement, one notices the absence among the leaders of such seemingly attractive territories as Tyumen Oblast, as well as the industrial part of the Urals and Volga economic regions. A high degree of development in these regions is combined with an urgent need for a flow of capital into the modernization and reorientation of production. However, foreign capital is in no hurry to meet this need, and the only reasonable explanation for this phenomenon is the existence of restrictions of a noneconomic nature caused by the desire of some local producers to preserve a monopoly on management and not allow competition on the part of the world market. Aspirations of this kind are not always unjustified from the standpoint of the interests of the state. Suffice it to point out the high ranking of Yevreyskaya Autonomous Oblast, which is poorly developed in every respect. A considerable part of foreign investment in this territory is a graphic example of Chinese capital making inroads in the Russian border zone. The structure of foreign investment by sector is much more interesting than by region. According to Goskomstat, of the total volume, the following has been invested in: --machine building and metalworking--23.2 percent; --fuel industry--16.3 percent; --trade and public catering--15.2 percent; --construction--5.3 percent; --woodworking and pulp and paper industry--4.5 percent; --construction material industry--3.8 percent. Goskomstat does not report on the distribution of the remaining 31 percent of investment; indirect sources indicate a rather considerable investment of foreign capital in the production of various consumer goods. A comparison of the structure of attracted foreign investment with available data on the structural restructuring of the Russian economy leads to certain conclusions. The most promising sector today is the fuel industry. As a result of lesser price disproportions as compared to those that existed in the centrally planned economy, we now can judge the significance of some or other sector by industrial statistics--the share of its production in the total volume of industrial production expressed in current prices. For the fuel industry this indicator reached 17.5 percent in 1993, but this is an understatement since it is an export-oriented sector and world prices for its output are considerably higher than domestic ones. Meanwhile, in the volume of foreign investment the fuel industry ranks only second, while first--and with a considerable lead at that--is machine building and metalworking. The inefficiency of this group of sectors has led to a situation whereby they were damaged most by the development of market relations. The proportional share of machine building and metalworking has dropped over the period of reform by five percentage points, but because of considerable state support and thanks to an insignificant--for Russia--gap between domestic and world prices, still remains very high (20.3 percent of industrial production in 1993). Currently it is precisely machine-building and metalworking enterprises that are hurting most from the distribution crisis and are the least competitive. Nevertheless, this particular sphere, which overall does not have favorable prospects, is attracting the greatest attention of foreign investors. A similar situation exists in another pair of sectors. The woodworking and pulp and paper industry, whose presence in the economy has dropped by 1.7 percentage points (which is quite a lot considering that its share in industrial production in 1993 comprised 3.9 percent), has attracted considerably greater attention on the part of foreign investors than the construction materials industry, which has increased its share in production by 0.2 points--to 3.3 percent. There is one single visible cause: The sectors that are increasing their significance in the Russian economy (which in an environment of overall production decline does not preclude a drop in their output), are strong enough not to let foreign capital in, so they do not have to share control over their enterprises. Those sectors, however, where the situation is becoming critical, and where their very survival is already at issue, are relinquishing control for the sake of self-preservation. As a result, the sectors that are accessible to foreign investors are those undergoing serious difficulties. This has its positive side, since foreign capital provides nourishment for those who need it most. The problem is that, as the development of oil production shows, our monopolists have a tendency to keep out potential competition even in circumstances where they are unable on their own to sustain not only development but even mere maintenance of the sector at a normal level. They prefer to count on state support, the probability (let alone expediency) of which is in serious doubt, but which does not hold the threat of either competition or of losing sole control over production for the current monopolists.
