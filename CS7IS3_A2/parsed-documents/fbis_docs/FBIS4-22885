Environmental degradation, or ``stress,'' was broadly defined as anthropogenic or natural ecological deterioration sufficient to interfere with normal human activity. Different sets of criteria were developed and elaborated for land, marine, and river ecosystems. These criteria were not considered exhaustive. The different regions were ranked on a scale of 0 to 5, with 0 representing environmentally pristine regions, and 5 representing regions with severe environmental problems. None of the regions were considered environmental disaster areas. An analysis of the map yielded the following conclusions: 1) Most of Russia is not suffering from appreciable environmental degradation, including the northern zone of European Russia; 2) No regions were given a ranking of 5, with the exception of some major reservoirs; 3) Regions with a ranking of 4 were found only in European Russia; 4) Regions of moderate environmental stress (up to a ranking of 2) were found in territories that were otherwise considered to have few or no environmental problems. Analogical conclusions were drawn for river systems, inland seas, and coastal waters. A considerable number of geographical locations were explicitly identified, regardless of the degree of environmental damage. No direct correlation was found between human morbidity indices and the degree of environmental degradation, with the exception of areas with exceptionally high morbidity rates, the causes of which were too complex for the scope of this study.
