Lt Rawi's comment followed a report from a government MP early last month that Saudi Arabia would offer 60,000 jobs to Thai workers. At about the same time, Saudi Arabian Charge d'Affaires Mohamed Said Khoja said Thai workers were welcome to apply for visas to go to his country. Riyadh has stopped issuing visas to Thai workers since relations soured some four years ago following the murder of three Saudi embassy staffers and a businessman in Bangkok as well as the theft of jewels from the Saudi royal palace. According to Lt Rawi, no clear-cut policy on Thai workers has emerged from Riyadh, where two separate ministries--Home Affairs and Labour-- deal with questions of visas and work permits. Lt Rawi also noted that wages in Saudi Arabia had dropped significantly, with workers from India, Pakistan and the Philippines being paid only half the amount that Thai workers used to earn.
