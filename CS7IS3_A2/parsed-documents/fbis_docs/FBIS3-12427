The officer said a clip for the Galil 5.56 mm assault rifle clip holds 35 bullets. "If a man is properly trained, he can change a clip in a few seconds," he said. The Galil, brought into service at the end of the 1970's, is considered heavy and less accurate than the M-16 and used only by tank units now. "With a gun like that in a closed space you can kill more than 100 people." It weighs 3.75 kilos and has a theoretically ability to fire 750 bullets a minute. The army said a sole killer, 35-year-old Barukh Goldstein, opened fire in a packed Hebron mosque at dawn on Friday. Palestinian doctors said 53 people died and dozens were wounded in the carnage. However several Palestinian witnesses said up to five Jewish settlers aided the American-born doctor with links to the anti-Arab Kach movement. He either turned the gun on himself or was shot by someone else, military officials said. Yet another Palestinian who said he was in the mosque told Israeli television that Goldstein was alone and re-loaded his rifle with at least three of four or five bullet clips he carried. Police announced that a ballistics test would be carried out to verify if all the bullets in the mosque came from the same gun. Police said they were contacting witnesses to take their testimony.
