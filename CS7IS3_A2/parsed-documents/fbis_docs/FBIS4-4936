The Cambodian issue, particularly the process towards peace between the warring factions, was the political agenda par excellence throughout the late 1970s and 1980s. The issue of free trade and the multilateral round of trade negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) have superseded that political agenda during the present decade. There is no better testament to this than the more than 10,000 pages of key documents resulting from the Gatt negotiations which will lead to the establishment of the new World Trade Organization. Has there been sufficient intercourse with other issues beyond politics and economics? There has been a gradual shift towards broadening the relationship. For example, on a positive front, Thailand has become more committed to environmental issues under the UN umbrella. This orientation is seen in Thailand's own participation in the concretization of international instruments on the promotion and protection of the environment. These include the 1987 Montreal Protocol on Substances that deplete the ozone Layer, and the various treaties and declarations resulting from the 1992 Rio Conference on Environment and Development. The latter include the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Convention on Climate Change. On another front, the issue of human rights, democracy and development -- and their interrelationship -- have come more strongly to the fore. This was evidenced by Thailand's participation at the 1993 World Conference on Human Rights held in Vienna. Together with other countries, it adopted the World Declaration and Programme of Action on Human Rights which called for the adherence to and implementation of international human rights standards at the local level, including effective national mechanisms for the protection of human rights. Yet, there are certain realities which undermine Thai-UN relations. The shortcomings may be highlighted as follows: 1. In Thai foreign policy, there is inadequate emphasis on democracy, and this is exemplified by its attitude towards the political situation in Burma. Although the various forums of the UN, including the UN Human Rights Commission, have called for reversion to democracy and release of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and other elected leaders in Burma, Thailand has preferred to shun the issue of democracy in its relationship with Burma. It has been more willing to accommodate the Burmese military junta under the Thai and Asean policy of "constructive engagement" rather than distance itself from that element of authoritarianism and promote the cause of democracy. This is a serious anomaly, as the present Thai Government was born of a democratic movement and owes its legitimacy to democratic underpinnings in 1992. Morally, it is obliged to uphold the flag of democracy internationally. 2. Foreign policy-making in Thai governmental circles tends to be bureaucratic; it is not sufficiently participatory. The presumption among key governmental entities is that it is they who should shape policy-making and the interrelationship with the UN. Interestingly in several delegations sent to international meetings, the composition of the delegates is drawn purely from governmental circles rather than an admixture of people derived from non-governmental and governmental settings. Non-state actors, such as non-governmental organizations (NGOs), the business sector, community groups and concerned individuals, are not sufficiently consulted and granted adequate attention. This is particularly related to the question of access to and from NGOs in setting the agenda for foreign policy, especially in regard to life and death issues such as democracy, development, human rights, the environment and peace. Are there any public hearings/enquiries on foreign policy-making, and if so, how transparent and accountable are the authorities? 3. On many issues of concern to Thailand and the UN, the response on the pan of the Thai authorities is reactive rather than proactive. This is exemplified by the inadequate participation of Thai representatives in several UN forums. In the key setting of the UN Human Rights Commission, Thailand is merely an observer rather than a full-fledged delegate. This implies that events are likely to shape Thailand rather than the reverse. This creates an imbalance, as the response from the authorities tends to be too late, and negative repercussions will ensure unnecessarily. 4. The policy at the national level is more curative than preventive on many issues. For example, while Thailand complains that it has many Burmese refugees on its soil, it fails to deal sufficiently with the root causes of such displacement, especially the undemocratic regime in power in Burma, as part of preventive action. Likewise, the recent debacle concerning 25,000 Cambodian refugees who sought refuge on Thai territory to escape from fighting between the Khmer Rouge and Cambodian government forces in the Pailin area was a situation where international censure could have been prevented. In pushing those refugees back to Cambodia without international monitoring and transparency, Thailand incurred the reprimand of the international community. The damage could have been avoided if the authorities had allowed the refugees to stay in Thailand temporarily and had worked towards transparency of conduct in the search for humane solutions. 5. The argument of national security and the executive entities vested the powers to deal with national security issues in Thailand are both obsolete. They are the ideological vestiges of the Cold War days, which are imbued with vested interests often aimed at self-perpetuation. Precisely because foreign policy and Thai-UN relations are at times shaped by such obsolete residues, the Thai response to several international issues is parochial rather than international. A key example is the persistent argument used by the parochial approach to claim that refugees are merely "illegal immigrants" without rights in Thailand. This flies in the face of the international perception of refugees, namely those fleeing for well-founded fear of persecution and other dangers in their country of origin, and the fact that refugees have guaranteed international rights, such as the right not to be pushed back to areas where they may fear persecution and other dangers. The international scenario has changed radically and the notion of "security" now being advocated has to be based more upon issues of human security, development, democracy, human rights and peace. 6. Thai relations with the UN are still searching to grapple with transnational issues, such as cross-frontier environmental degradation, diseases (e.g. Aids), human rights violations, criminality such as the sale and trafficking of women and children for sexual purposes and armed conflicts. Evidently, unilateral action does not suffice, and international cooperation is a key to both prevention and cure. However, precisely because Thai foreign policy is reactive rather than proactive, the likelihood of damage looms large. 7. The Thai-UN relationship is more often than not bifocal; it concentrates on politics and economics rather than a broader range of social and other issues. The latter include the concerns of marginalized groups, and the lack of equity and social justice both locally and internationally. There is inadequate attention for the issue of income distribution and resource reallocation to help those who are poor and peripheralized. Gender and racial discrimination also rears its head in many circles, both national and international. It is precisely this neglect that renders Thai foreign policy and its intercourse with the UN less than comprehensive. For the future, the Thai-UN agenda should address the above failings by underlining the following components: -- democracy, development, environment, peace and human rights as key underpinnings of Thai foreign policy, -- a more participatory and pluralistic process for formulating and disseminating foreign policy, especially with the cooperation of non-state actors and the institution of public hearings/enquiries, -- a more proactive approach in and beyond the UN, as well as more emphasis on preventive action and early-warning against possible violations of international standards, -- more accession to international treaties on human rights and effective implementation of international standards to counter undue nationalism and parochialism, -- a more humane and people-centred vision of national and international security, shunning the vestiges of the ideological past, -- a more effective response to and an agenda on transnational issues, -- a more concrete insertion of social and non-political/economic issues in the priorities of foreign policy. The impact on Thai-UN relations can be reinforced by activities within and beyond the UN as follows: Multilateral level: -- establishment of an agenda for peace and security with a more people-based vision -- adoption of an agenda for social development in a more pluralistic setting -- promotion of the linkage between democracy, development, environment, peace and human rights, and transnational action Regional/sub-regional/bilateral levels: -- incorporation of issues of social development, for example a social development agenda, into all regional and other forums that deal with economic, political, peace and security issues (e.g. the Asean regional forum and Asean Free Trade Area, and bilateral joint commissions) -- establishment of independent and accessible human rights system to prevent and remedy human rights abuses -- enhancement of the linkage between democracy, development, environment, peace and human rights in the national and transnational setting National/local levels: -- establishment of human rights units in all government ministries to promote human rights and its linkage with the other issues noted above -- adoption of national plans of action on human rights and their linkage with other issues -- institution of a national human rights mechanism which is accessible, independent and transparent With these orientations in mind, we can work towards ensuring that the discourse is not relegated to the realm of lip services, and that it becomes a forward-looking interaction well into next century.
