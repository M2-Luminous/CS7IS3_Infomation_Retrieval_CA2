The special properties of these materials, such as high temperature resistance, hardness, corrosion and wear resistance, make sample digestion difficult. The Max Planck Institute (MPI) for Metal Research (Bunsen-Kirchhoff-Strasse 13, 44139 Dortmund) has developed an alternative digestion method, which works with fluorine gas as digesting agent. As reported by Rainer Garten of the MPI, gaseous fluorine is suitable for many reasons for digesting resistant materials. The gas reacts with many materials as early as temperatures between 400 and 600� C, and it can be purified by distillation. The fluoridation products created in the digestion are volatile and can therefore be studied with gaseous analysis systems. Despite these advantages, sample digestion with fluorine has been little used so far. This is due to the difficult handling of the elements which reacts very easily and to the so far still limited availability of pure fluorine. Now, however, the element can be produced in sufficient quantity and purity. The digestion takes place in an apparatus made of pure steel and monel. The reactor, in which the fluorine gas reacts with the sample, is of pure nickel. Fluorine combines with the nickel into a nickel fluoride protective layer resistant up to a temperature of 700� C, which protects the reactor material. The fluorine gas, condensed through cooling with liquid nitrogen, is added to the reactor through vacuum pumps. Subsequently, the reactor is heated to between 400� and 600� and the sample digested. In so doing the pressure in the reactor increases up to 12 bar. The fluorine-containing reaction gases are drawn off through a titanium dioxide absorber. The fluoridated reaction products can then be analyzed according to the degree of their volatility. Fluoridated nonmetals and semiprecious metals are often volatile and can be analyzed with spectrometry methods. Most fluoridated metals are not volatile and are analyzed after dissolving them in mineral acids. Digestion with fluorine has proved itself particularly for analyzing content materials. Studying purity is especially important for this group of materials, since the properties of the ceramics is greatly influenced by impurities. Conventional digestion methods are either very time-consuming or falsify the analysis through impurities which occur during the digestion process. But other materials, such as glasses, ferobor, cast iron, plasma spray powder and tantalum silicate, can also be successfully digested with the Dortmund method, it is reported.
