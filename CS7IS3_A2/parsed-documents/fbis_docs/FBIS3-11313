[passage omitted] [Begin recording] [De la Calle Lombana] Many friends told me that there was a possibility I would not qualify for office in 1998 and that therefore I should fight that possibility by all means. In the end I reached the conclusion that Colombia and the PL are above everything. [applause] [passage omitted] [Unidentified reporter] Do you think that your decision now will take credibility away from you, and if that is the case, how can you recover it? [De la Calle] I do not think so, because I was sincere when I said I was not aspiring to the vice presidency. That was what I felt at that time. At this time, I now feel that it is necessary to set aside personal interests and take action for the benefit of Colombia and the PL. This is not the time for being selfish or having personal ambitions. [end recording] [passage omitted]
