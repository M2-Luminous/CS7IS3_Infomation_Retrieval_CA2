The president held two meetings on Tuesday, one at 1000 with the current foreign minister and another at 1200 with Ruiz de Vielman, after which time he decided to make the cabinet change. Mrs. Ruiz de Vielman, who is married to well-known banker Julio Vielman, has specialized in international affairs and is an expert in GATT issues. She is Guatemala's permanent negotiator to the EC on banana issues. She has held that post through three governments, during which time, in turn, there have been eight foreign ministers. This is because her work has been technical and satisfactory for official circles, according to the source who disclosed President de Leon's decision. The source, however, requested his name not be disclosed. Mrs. Vielman has been a member of the board of directors of the Guatemalan Association of Lawyers and Notaries (1986) and president of the Association of Women Lawyers and Notaries. Currently, she is a member of the board of directors of the Guatemalan-American Institute and a member of the Center for the Defense of the Constitution. She will take the oath of office next Wednesday [19 January], and the president of the Republic will officially announce her appointment on 15 January. The Coordinating Committee of Agricultural, Commercial, Industrial, and Financial Associations leadership met yesterday with President Ramiro de Leon Carpio to discuss the current economic situation and the results that could be obtained from the referendum. It was learned that during the meeting with the business leaders, the president announced his government's plans for reactivating the economy for 1994-95 as well as some changes in his work team. Other changes announced by the president include: Finance Minister Richard Aitkenhead will be replaced by economist Ana de Molina, who is the private secretary of the presidency of the Republic, and banker Eduardo Gonzalez Castillo will become the minister of economy. De Leon Carpio also told the businessmen he was optimistic about the results of the referendum because he is sure the yes vote for constitutional reforms will win, and that the changes will improve the economic, political, and social picture of the country. The meeting was held at the presidential palace.
