Anton Hrnko added that it should be in the political parties' interest to prevent the fragmentation of political entities so that the situation of the 1992 elections does not recur when a movement supported by one-third of voters gained almost one-half of the seats in the National Council of the Slovak Republic. Hrnko, who attended the elections in Hungary as an observer, noted that they took place in a calm and fair atmosphere and were distinguished by a minimum of advertising. He said that the NDS proposes that changes to the election law focus on increasing the number of constituencies from four to seven and on imposing a strict limit on campaign spending (a sum of about 20 million Slovak korunas was being considered in the Coalition Council, on the basis of U.S. and French experiences). At today's meeting of the Coalition Council, which will discuss the further orientation of privatization, NDS representatives (Minister Milan Janicina, Vladimir Miskovsky, and Andrej Findo) will push for the use of a combination of privatization methods and a flexible solution to individual specific cases. However, they will assert that coupon privatization is their own contribution to this discussion, Findo said, adding that they want to achieve that citizens receive an average of 30,000-40,000 Slovak korunas worth of property per coupon book.
