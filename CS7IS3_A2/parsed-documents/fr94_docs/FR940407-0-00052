FR940407-0-00052 FR940407-0-00011 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background States with final authorization under section 3006(b) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (``RCRA'' or the ``the Act''), 42 U.S.C. 6929 (b), have a continuing obligation to maintain a hazardous waste program that is equivalent to, consistent with, and no less stringent than the Federal hazardous waste program. Revisions to State hazardous waste programs are necessary when Federal or State statutory or regulatory authority is modified or when certain other changes occur. Most commonly, State program revisions are necessitated by changes to EPA's regulations in 40 CFR parts 124, 260&hyph;268 and 270. Modification to the Federal program, due to statutory and regulatory changes, requires subsequent modifications to the State authorized program. Until the State is authorized for such modifications, EPA is responsible for implementing and enforcing the modification in the State. Further, if the State law which forms the basis of the federally authorized State program is amended, the State must promptly seek revision authorization for those provisions. Until the amendments to State law are authorized by EPA, the regulated community must ensure compliance with both the federally authorized State program and the non-authorized Federal program. The regulated community may also need to comply with current State laws in the situation where State law has been amended after Federal authorization has been granted. B. North Dakota North Dakota initially received final authorization in October 1984. North Dakota received authorization for revisions to its program on August 24, 1990. On February 23, 1994, North Dakota submitted a final program revision application for additional program approvals. Today, North Dakota is seeking approval of its program revision in accordance with 40 CFR 271.21(b)(3). In the previous revision authorization published on August 24, 1990, EPA included authorization of the direct action against insurers, HSWA section 3004(t) provision to North Dakota. It was later determined this provision is not delegable. Therefore, EPA is clarifying with this notice that the direct action against insurers to North Dakota is withdrawn. The Federal cause of action provided by RCRA 3004(t) remains in effect in authorized states. The State law equivalent to 3004(t) operates separately from the Federal law and, in this situation, the North Dakota law which provides for a direct cause of action against insurers operates as an additional authority to the Federal authority.
