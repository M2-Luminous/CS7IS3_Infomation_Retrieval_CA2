In the overwhelming majority of these regions, additional elections needed to be held to fill local assemblies as a result of voters' passivity the first time around. [passage omitted] In the Chuvash Republic, elections took place in 28 out of 47 constituencies; in Voronezh Oblast -- in 35 out of 45; in Kemerovo Oblast -- in 30 out of 35; and in Nizhnyy Novgorod -- in 32 out of 45 constituencies. As an illustration of how politicians were more active then voters, it was noted that in Belgorod Oblast, there were 104 candidates for 21 seats; 198 for 48 in Kirov Oblast; 187 for 30 in Omsk Oblast; and 210 candidates for 50 seats in Orel Oblast. Only 19 percent of candidates in the elections had stood on party tickets. The Communists were the most active party. In the 27 March elections, 34 Russian Communist Party members were elected to local assemblies, out of 200 candidates. Former oblast Soviet chairmen were elected as deputies in Kemerovo, Tambov, Voronezh, Novosibirsk, and other Oblasts.
