Rugova called on the Americans to intervene in Kosovo, "because that would be a natural thing to do, after the biased Russian intervention." Rugova talked with AL-HAYAH by telephone from the headquarters of the Albanian Democratic Alliance [Democratic Alliance of Kosovo], which he heads in Pristina. In his capacity as president of the Kosovo republic, elected by the Albanian majority in accordance with a popular plebiscite held in the region two years ago, Rugova said: "Kosovo is an independent neutral country. I cannot bow to pressures and agree to self-government within the Serbian Republic, even if it were to a maximum extent." Albanians, who constitute 90 percent of Kosovo's population, consider Rugova president of the republic, which they unilaterally proclaimed. Rugova went on to say that "independence is the best solution for our problem. We shall not retreat from this position, after the experience we have had with the Serbs for more than 80 years, during which they practiced every form of arbitrary behavior, persecution, and ethnic cleansing against us." The Albanian leader considers the situation in Kosovo as different from Krajina during the previous Yugoslav regime, "because Krajina was a autonomous unit within the Yugoslav Federal Union, which gave it the right to self-determination, just like parts of the other federation." Rugova would not object to studying general ties within the scope of the Balkan region, "on condition that this were to come about after Kosovo is freed from direct Serbian domination and can determine its own fate." Violence and Terror Rugova described the current conditions in Kosovo as distressing. "There is no open warfare, but there is violence and terrorism toward Albanian citizens. This makes it necessary to prevent a tragic catastrophe as occurred in Bosnia-Herzegovina, especially since we lack any internal or external protection, including even the presence of international observers, after the Serbian Republic demanded their withdrawal at the end of last year." Rugova considers the heavy Serbian military presence in Kosovo, especially the internal security force that implements the state of emergency, as most dangerous, an ominous indicator that an eruption or outbreak of real war could happen at any moment, "despite the fact that we are still trying not to react to provocations and violence, in order to avoid conflict or even worse consequences." Rugova revealed a plan he had submitted to the United States and several European Community nations to resolve this very sensitive issue in stages, "beginning with temporarily placing Kosovo under international protection. We would prefer U.S. forces under UN supervision. During this period, Kosovo's future can be studied with the parties involved in this issue." He stressed that during his meetings with American and European officials, he called for "linking the present international embargo against Yugoslavia (Republics of Serbia and Montenegro) with a settlement of the issue of Albanians in Kosovo." Partition of Kosovo Rugova has rejected all plans aimed at partitioning Kosovo into Serbian and Albanian states, especially since this idea was first presented by the Serbian opposition. It was then endorsed by the previous Yugoslav (Republics of Serbia and Montenegro) president, Dobrica Cosic, and repeated by many others at other times. "However, it is unacceptable, because there is no clear ethnic Serbian part of Kosovo, with the exception of certain villages. The other parts are Albanian. One should note that Serbian plans are to gain mastery over those areas that are rich in resources." He added that partition would not solve the problem, "because a million Albanians would remain in Serbian areas, which would result in a continuation of the present situation and the absence of a permanent solution." Regarding negotiations with authorities in the Serbian Republic, Rugova emphasized that they stopped when contacts failed a year ago concerning studies in Albanian schools. "We want to resume them and continue the dialogue, but the Serbs present crippling conditions that have previously been submitted, in order to get us to relinquish our goal of independence and recognize Serbian authority over Kosovo in all political areas in the region." Russians Are Biased Rugova criticized Russia's totally biased position vis-a-vis the Serbs. He considered the Russian delegations' visits to Kosovo as a kind of direct provocation against the Albanians, since the Russian parliamentary (Duma) delegation, which came to Kosovo last week, showed outright extremism, to such a degree that it tried to spread fear and panic among the Albanians. "However, we made it clear to them that we no longer feared anyone, after we dhqna al-amrin [words as transliterated] from the Serbs." Rugova explained that American intervention in the Albanian issue in Kosovo would be natural after the Russian activities. "We made our position clear to both sides. We call for direct American intervention in this issue." He indicated that the Kosovo Albanians would welcome any agreement in the Balkans that would contribute to relieving the tension in the region. "At this point, we salute the federation between Bosnian Muslims and Croats."
