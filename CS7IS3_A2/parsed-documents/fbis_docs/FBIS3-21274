His Excellency underlined this call in his recent speech at the Police Academy and described at length the dangers facing the country as a result of instability. We do not disagree with the president about the need for stability, and reject any attempt to undermine it. But we fully disagree with the president when he says that terrorism is the only cause of instability and that ending it will lead to stability. This is a simplification of the problem. It disregards the real reasons for and deep roots of the problem. The real reason for instability is not terrorism, but the ruling dictatorship that created terrorism. The bullets were not fired from a vacuum, but due to a painful reality produced by the dictatorship and its bad policies and abnormal actions. Had there been a flourishing economy, social justice, and equality before the law, no crisis would have developed, suffering would not have increased, and corruption would not have spread. All these factors created the atmosphere which led to violence and the spread of terrorism. They established terrorism as the basis for the bloody way of dealing with the ruling authority. Terrorism, if the president would like to know, is not the direct reason for instability, but the natural outcome of the regime's dictatorship. Why confuse cause and effect? Is the purpose of this confusion to prompt the political parties to stand behind the president against terrorism? If this was the purpose, it will only achieve something that already exists, because the parties reject terrorism and have often announced this rejection on every occasion. What more does the president expect from them? Does he expect them to go down on the streets to fight the terrorists? Or does he expect them to find work for every unemployed person? There is a home for every naked person; there is treatment for every sick person; and there is a punishment for every criminal. The opposition can do nothing more than reject terrorism and alert people to its dangers. It will not be able to contain or end terrorism, whatever means it may have, as long as the reason for the problem continues to exist. What is the purpose of this repeated call to defend stability? Why do they deliberately disregard the factors that threaten stability? Any observer of the regime's actions on ordeals and crises can only conclude that the purpose and goal of the call for a dialogue is to achieve stability for the regime itself, and not to achieve stability, security, and peace for Egypt--unless we maintain that the ruling regime is a democratic one that depends on the popular will and heeds it. In such a case, the regime's stability or instability would be considered Egypt's stability or instability. But the reality is that there is an organic separation between the ruling regime and the broad popular base. The regime is in one valley and the people in another. Any attempt to link the regime with the popular base is bound to fail because the interests of the masses and their daily sufferings are not taken into consideration by the regime, except in its propaganda. The only solution is for the regime to admit that there is something wrong and start correcting it. This, in short, means recognizing the need for political reform and accepting the need for direct talks with the national forces about the steps to move toward democracy, and about the substance, measures, and timetable for this transformation. This transformation is the natural prelude to the achievement of the desired economic and social reforms. [passage omitted]
