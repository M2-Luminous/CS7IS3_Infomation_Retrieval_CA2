Chamber Chairman Vladimir Petrus addressed the rally. [Begin Petrus recording] What should also be asked is: What is the reason for this state of affairs? The laws are imperfect, the linkage between the laws is poor, there is a perceptible lack of jurisdiction governing administrative and labor affairs. Other necessary laws that could prevent these phenomena and developments from taking place are clearly absent, too. These are the problems that you, the government and the parliament, should focus on; this is the area where your efforts should be targeted. But do not look for enemies and extremists in the trade unions. [applause] All of the extremes, foreign and domestic ones alike--Zhirinovskiy and his supporters, no matter where they may be--are alien to us. For this very reason, we consider it our civic duty to speak up and say that we have had enough, that things cannot go on like this, that people's dissatisfaction is looming over us, and that it is inadvisable to play around with this dissatisfaction. [applause] [end recording]
