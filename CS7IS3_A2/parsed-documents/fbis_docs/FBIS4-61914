FBIS4-61914 "drsov091_a_94007" FBIS-SOV-94-091 Daily Report 11 May 1994 RUSSIA INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Kozyrev Views Russian-German Ties Kozyrev Views Russian-German Ties LD1005204394 LD1005204394 BFN [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in Russian at 1625 GMT on 10 May 1994 broadcasts the 10-minute prerecorded series "Details," which is devoted to Russian-German relations in the context of Yeltsin's 11 May visit to Germany. Announcer Sergey Dorenko asks: "Why is Yeltsin going there? What do the Germans want from him?" After reminding viewers that the Germans have problems of their own to deal with, without being too concerned about those of Russia, Dorenko focuses attention on the fate of Chancellor Kohl. He says: Most people think he will lose the October elections, so maybe Yeltsin is going to talk to a lame duck. Perhaps the visit is a waste of time. Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, who then appears on screen, disagrees: "If we are talking about the figure of Chancellor Kohl himself, I should not be in any hurry to say that there is bound to be a change of leadership in October. We are nowhere near the elections yet. Before the elections, there is still the G-7 meeting. Before the elections, there is still the troop withdrawal, which is to be not only a line drawn under the past, but also the definite start of something in our future relations. So there is plenty to work on before October." In any case, as Dorenko points out, Yeltsin will be able to meet Kohl's possible successor. He will be talking to members of the opposition. This was, in effect, confirmed by Kozyrev, who says: "We always meet representatives of all parties -- always." The main bone of contention at the moment is the question of how the Russian troops will take their leave of Germany. Presidential adviser Dmitriy Ryurikov says: "The troop withdrawal and the farewell to the troops is a very important symbol, a symbol of the great period that is coming to an end and a symbol of what we hope will be the still more significant period that lies ahead. So, such symbols must be very carefully thought out and fine-tuned, and they can be discussed. President Yeltsin and Chancellor Kohl will have enough time for discussion. Probably both for the Germans and for the Europeans, a troop withdrawal and a farewell to the troops in Berlin is the most understandable symbol." Dorenko then reminds viewers that the Germans wanted the farewell to the Russian troops to take place 350 km from Berlin [in Weimar] and a week before saying goodbye to the Western allies in Berlin. General Matvey Burlakov, commander of the Western Group of Forces, is not happy, Dorenko says, but is prepared to give way. As Burlakov puts it: "We will take part in the function, but, of course, if you like, maybe with a slight feeling of bitterness in that we cannot carry it out properly." Dorenko then suggests, over video of Russian troops loading their equipment on to a train, that a compromise had been worked out, but no one was saying anything so as not to steal the leaders' thunder. "The compromise will be that the ceremony will take place in Berlin, but still earlier than the other allies, because the mechanics were worked out in Gorbachev's time, and Yeltsin won't be able to do anything about that legacy from Gorbachev." In a further sequence from the pre-recorded interview with Kozyrev, Dorenko asks the foreign minister: "Is that scenario already being discussed, or are they preparing for you to arrive angry and then, you know, they will suddenly step aside while you charge on into empty space?" Kozyrev replies: "No, I don't think they want us to arrive angry. They want there to be very serious summit talks. It is very important to sense what your partner is thinking. It is very important to understand your partner's logic, not just your own truth, but to see the other person's truth." The final topic is that of the G-7 group. Was it on the way to becoming the G-8, with Russian participation? Although Russia's economic situation is far removed from that of the Germans, maybe the neighboring Germans would be able, after the summit, to explain to the distant Americans exactly what was going on in Russia. "That is the real benefit that we can derive from the visit," Dorenko comments. Kozyrev reappears and says: "We have a sufficiently advanced understanding on that subject with our partners, which has been expressed in the fact that a Russian representative has been invited to all stages of the preparatory process of the discussion of these political issues. In other words, it is not only the president who will work in an eight-leader format, but also, already at the preparatory stage, a group of eight experts on quite a high level are essentially at work, and they are preparing all these issues for discussion. I think that this is a very significant step toward turning the G-7 into the G-8." Dorenko's final point is that no Russian officials have spoken to the program about economic cooperation, although it is of great concern to the Germans. When speaking to him earlier, Dorenko says, a group of German businessmen poured scorn on Russia's investment tax. "Imagine that you are a German," he cited one as saying, "and you are investing $100 million in Russia. For that piece of folly, you will also have to pay $32 million to the state. Meanwhile, President Yeltsin will almost certainly, as he did two years ago, urge representatives of business circles in Germany to come to our country with their money," Dorenko concludes.
