The issue has taken on particular relevance in view of the fact that there will be a series of elections this year and the campaigns of candidates of all persuasions are in full swing. Naturally, to prevent the use of funds and resources of illicit origin, provisions have been made for campaigns to be financed according to very explicit standards and controls. But the infusion of hefty sums of money into these campaigns, money whose origin has not really been established, has given rise to complaints about its use. Two specific cases have already been reported in the departments of Cauca and Atlantico. There is no question of accepting the accusations at face value without conducting the necessary investigation. But it is appropriate, indeed imperative, that the Office of the Treasury Inspector, which has such a propensity to become distracted by other matters that appear to be an abuse of authority, devote its energies to the rigorous oversight that is incumbent upon it in these cases, as many have urged it to do. Any possibility that election campaigns, and political campaigns in general, may be using resources of illicit provenance should be confronted, investigated, and stopped at the earliest opportunity. Radical action must be taken; there is no excuse for any delay whatsoever. If there are any signs pointing to this possibility, the situation must be clarified immediately to ensure that campaigns are absolutely clean. The Office of the Prosecutor General, for its part, should be equally vigilant to make sure the appropriate legal standards are strictly upheld, and that penalties for violations are imposed without leniency. We understand how difficult it is to pinpoint hot money. But it is easy to smell it, to feel it: an excessively lavish campaign carried out by someone who is not that wealthy, someone who just manages to live on his salary or his inheritance, someone who is in no position to afford to spend fabulous sums to get elected. When that happens, "something is rotten in the state of Denmark." The voters can, should, and must grasp these subtle nuances in politics, because if the initial election is corrupt, what happens afterwards will definitely be harmful. The watchword of democracies in the world today should be to defeat corrupt or hot money, whatever you want to call it. Otherwise, democracy will have a hard time surviving.
