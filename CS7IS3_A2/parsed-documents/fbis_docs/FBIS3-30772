The delegations were led by Czech Industry and Trade Minister Vladimir Dlouhy, Hungarian Minister for International Economic Relations Bela Kadar, Polish Minister for Foreign Economic Cooperation Leslaw Podkanski and Slovak Economic Minister Jan Ducky. The introductory evaluation of the Central European Free Trade Association's [CEFTA] agreement, for the short time which it has been in force, confirmed that the mechanism was effective in its support of the aims of the contracting parties, and was thus contributing to the development of international trade and the world economy. The report announced the near completion of the negotiations which had been taking place in the last few months on the further lowering of tariffs and other obstructions for industrial products and the extending of concessions for agricultural products, in the interest of the continuing liberalisation of trade. During today's meeting, ministers expressed willingness to continue in attempts to also remove the remaining tariff and non-tariff obstructions to trade, including obstructions in the agricultural sector. The delegations firmly believe that by the end of 1997 a free-trade zone will be formed for the 65 million inhabitants of the CEFTA countries. The CEFTA agreement was a good example for the liberalisation of trade, the ministers said, adding that they welcomed the process of negotiation and implementation of bilateral agreements on free trade between the individual CEFTA countries and third countries. Association agreements with the European Union, as well as the agreements on free trade with the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) were the basic means by which the obstructions to a considerable amount of trade would be blown away in a relatively short time, and were important milestones in the integration process of CEFTA countries into international trade, the ministers said. They expressed the hope that in the future no measures with protectionist elements would be passed, such as anti-dumping measures, if these were not fully justified. As far as the results of the Copenhagen summit of the European Community were concerned, the ministers praised the additional trade concessions offered to the CEFTA countries, although they also said they expected the European Union to extend the trade concessions further. The ministers praised the individual and joint initiatives and the measures approved by the Organisation for European Cooperation and Development (OECD) which improved the accessibility of their markets to goods from CEFTA countries. They said they also believed that the very sober appliance of protective measures was of great importance for the maintenance of the dynamics of development, the integration of national economies and the liberalisation of trade within the CEFTA agreement. The ministers also expressed their great pleasure at the declared interest of the United States to further liberalise trade with the CEFTA countries, adding that during further negotiations with the United States they expected to be able to improve conditions for access to U.S. markets. The CEFTA agreement countries expressed satisfaction at the successful end to the Uruguay Round of GATT talks, whose results represented an important step in the direction of the further liberalisation of goods and services. Confidence in the international trade system had been increased by the agreement concerning the establishment of the World Trade Organisation, the ministers said.
