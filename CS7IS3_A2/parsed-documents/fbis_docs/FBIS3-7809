[Fiala] Many people associate your visit to the United States with your remarks about the lists of State Security agents. What, in fact, was the aim of your visit to the United States? [Payne] I was invited on behalf of U.S. President Clinton and his wife to a traditional prayer breakfast to which people who try to assert certain Christian values are invited. Some are politicians, others are involved in charity work, and so on. Within the framework of this invitation, I tried to use my visit to the United States to hold further meetings in the U.S. Congress and the [State] Department. This is, in essence, in compliance with the idea that we should try to provide more information about the Czech Republic abroad. Each contact of this kind creates a special platform for us. For example, one day it will be necessary to vote on certain issues of fundamental interest to the Czech Republic, so this creates a better setting for us. [Fiala] Who did you meet in the United States? [Payne] Within the program arranged for the extra days of my visit, I visited the Security Committee, where a debate was taking place on expanding NATO in the presence of the U.S. ambassador in NATO from Brussels; I met the chairman of the Congress Foreign Affairs Committee, Lee Hamilton; I met the distinguished Senator Lugar, who is known for being very well informed about Central Europe because he deals with this region; and I also met with other members of Congress. I would describe Partnership for Peace and our reaction to it as the main topic we discussed. It was the same at the State Department. [Fiala] Did you discuss economic issues with anyone? [Payne] I tried to make use of a few more days on the basis of urgent appeals from our honorary consul in Florida, Alan Becker, to visit this area and meet with business circles who are already doing business in the Czech Republic or are interested in doing business there. I have to say that these meetings were very useful and that, during my talks with our honorary consul and while going over certain data, we came across extensive areas where our business activity could be expanded. It is significant that hundreds of thousands of tonnes of Czech goods pass through the port of Miami, and so it seems that this is really a contact, a place, that is very important for us because of its trade links to Latin America, the United States, and Mexico, and, from this point of view, I think that we should look into the fact that we can single out new opportunities for our exports in this area. [Fiala] What did you discuss at the meeting with compatriots? [Payne] We briefed them on the situation in the Czech Republic. Minister Lux briefed them on agriculture, Mr. Kasal on the general work in parliament, and I gave them a rough outline of the basic priorities of our foreign policy, which was the main theme of that evening. Then, we answered a whole series of questions, which were asked quickly one after the other; the atmosphere here was very relaxed. [Fiala] You mentioned that making contacts and holding talks abroad forms part of your specific idea about foreign policy. Could you be more explicit? [Payne] I have discussed this with a number of colleagues, and we even view it as one of the priorities of the work of the Chamber of Deputies because at times the situation arises that members of other parliaments have insufficient information about the Czech Republic or they are given somewhat imprecise information. Therefore, we consider this activity to be very important. In this context, I would like to cite the following example: We worked for about a year on formulating the conditions for the approval of the European Agreement in the European Parliament. I had many meetings with European Parliament deputies within the framework of this activity, and the upshot was that the approval was given in just under three weeks, which is quite unique in European history. I have to emphasize that this was due especially to the endeavor of the rapporteur on the European Agreement, Mr. Sakallariou, and others. Apart from this, our Association or European Agreement was approved by such a percentage of votes that everyone voted in favor except, I think, three deputies who abstained and one who was against. In my opinion, this is the reward of such lobbying. Of course, if the economic, political, and other prerequisites had not been created, we would never have achieved such a result. On the other hand, if they have been created, it is necessary to make the maximum possible use of them.
