Accordingly, no more than approximately one-third of 20% of the Trust's total net assets currently will be affected by any one Sub-Adviser change. In the future, because the amount of the Trust's total net assets represented by the Multi-Managed Assets may increase or decrease in a manner described in paragraph 3 above, any one Sub-Adviser change may affect a greater or lesser amount of the Trust's total net assets, but never more than approximately one-third of the Trust's total net assets. 7. In addition, each new sub-advisory agreement would contain substantially the same terms and conditions as the existing sub-advisory agreements for the Multi-Managed Assets. A new Sub-Adviser's fee can be no higher than that provided in the Trust's three existing sub-advisory agreements. In the event that fees under the new sub-advisory agreement are less than in the existing agreements, the difference will be passed on to the Trust through a corresponding reduction in the fund management fee payable to LAMCO. 8. None of the Sub-Advisers has any affiliation with the Trust or LAMCO other than as Sub-Adviser. The responsibility of the Sub-Advisers under their respective sub-advisory agreements is limited to the discretionary investment management of the respective portions of the Multi-Managed Assets assigned to them by LAMCO from time to time, and related record keeping and reporting. The Multi-Managed Assets are and will be allocated and periodically rebalanced so as to maintain an approximately equal allocation of such assets among the Sub-Advisers. Applicants' Legal Analysis 1. Section 15(a) of the Act makes it unlawful for any person to act as an investment adviser to a registered investment company except pursuant to a written contract, whether with such registered company or with an investment adviser of such registered company, which has been approved by the majority vote of the outstanding voting securities of such registered company. Section 15(a)(4) also requires that the investment advisory contract provide, in substance, for its automatic termination in the event of its assignment. 2. Rule 15a&hyph;4 under the Act permits an investment adviser to an investment company to act under an agreement not approved by shareholders for up to 120 days after the termination of an investment advisory agreement resulting from certain specified events. Applicants claim, however, that rule 15a&hyph;4 does not provide adequate relief to the Trust. For one thing, a change in Sub-Advisers may occur more than 120 days before the next regularly scheduled annual meeting, resulting in the necessity of a special meeting of shareholders. In addition, rule 15a&hyph;4 does not apply at all to an investment advisory agreement entered into following a termination of the prior agreement caused by an assignment in which the investment adviser or its controlling person receives an economic benefit. 3. Applicants submit that requiring shareholder approval consistent with section 15(a) before changing a Sub-Adviser or before continuing the services of an existing Sub-Adviser following an assignment of its sub-advisory agreement results in substantial delay or expense to the Trust, without any corresponding benefit in terms of shareholder protection. 4. Applicants assert that, because of the lack of affiliation between LAMCO and the Sub-Advisers (unlike conventionally structured single-manager investment companies), LAMCO has no interest other than the efficient and effective functioning of the Trust's multi-manager methodology and the enhancement of the Trust's investment performance when recommending the replacement or addition of a Sub-adviser or the continuation of the services of the Sub-Adviser following an assignment of its sub-advisory agreement. Furthermore, Applicants represent that neither LAMCO nor any of its affiliates will be parties to the acquisition or other transaction giving rise to the termination and assignment of the sub-advisory agreement and, consequently, will not receive any economic benefit in connection with such transaction. 5. Applicants also assert that the terms and conditions of the Trust's ``employment'' of its Sub-Advisers will in effect have already been approved by shareholders because any new sub-advisory agreements will be identical in all material respects to the existing agreements which have been approved by shareholders, with no increase in expense to the Trust.
