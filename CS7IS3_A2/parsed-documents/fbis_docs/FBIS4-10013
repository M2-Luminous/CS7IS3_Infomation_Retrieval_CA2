Coordinators of Luis Inacio Lula Da Silva's campaign believe that Cardoso, supported by the Liberal Front Party and by the Brazilian Labor Party, will be the elite groups' candidate and that, therefore, a polarization of the election is inevitable. The PT will intensify its attacks on the economic plan and on Cardoso as the main target of its criticism. Until former Sao Paulo Governor Orestes Quercia is confirmed as the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party presidential candidate in May, the PT will not make any attacks on him. Lula's campaign coordinators believe Maluf's decision not to run could have stemmed from a behind-the-scenes accord with Quercia. PT campaign official Greenhalgh believes Maluf has backtracked because those who always supported him have endorsed Cardoso's candidacy. "All the partners of Paubrasil [which contributed to Maluf's campaign] have been consulted," he ironically said. Until now, the PT has harshly criticized Maluf. From now on, the PT tone will change and its criticism against Cardoso will intensify. The PT no longer considers Cardoso the third alternative, having moved up to second place and become Lula's main adversary. Greenhalgh added: "Cardoso has time and again disappointed the people by telling them to forget what he said earlier and by deciding to run without worrying about the future of the plan." He was thus anticipating the PT line of attacks against Cardoso. Within this new strategy, the PT will insist on securing the support of Rio de Janeiro Governor Leonel Brizola, (Democratic Labor Party).
