The meeting was attended by nine notables, including Faysal al-Husayni, Hebron Mayor Mustafa al-Natshah, and Hanan 'Ashrawi. It should be noted that the meeting at the U.S. Consulate in Jerusalem was held at the request of the Palestinians. At the end of the meeting, Faysal al-Husayni said that in it the Palestinians raised their reservations with the Gaza and Jericho agreement, two days before it is to be signed in Cairo. [Al-Husayni, in English] We have two problems: One problem concerning the implementation and the attitude of the Israeli side on the ground, especially on the isolation of Jerusalem; and we make it clear that if such a policy will going on, and if it will not be stopped, it can be the element which can kill such opportunity to sign for such opportunity to implementation of any kind of agreements. [Ayalon translates and continues] The Palestinians also fear the practical implementation of the agreement by Israel on the ground. It is impossible, al-Husayni argues, that Rabin and 'Arafat agree to decide on the size of the Jericho area, while in practice, Israel has already started erecting a fence around it. [Al-Husayni, in English] We do not like the idea that they are saying that the size of Jericho will be decided between Rabin and 'Arafat, and then we are watching now that the Israelis are already building and putting this borders. We do not like it. [Ayalon] The secretary listened to the reservations, but did not comment. Earlier, Christopher met President 'Ezer Weizman, but the two decided not to disclose the content of the meeting.
