This does not constitute a violation of the law, he explained, since the latter does not deal with missiles being taken off combat alert, but only with them being withdrawn from Ukrainian territory. "It is better to take missiles off combat alert. Then they will not be used by anyone because the nuclear button is in Russia and no mention of that fact is made by those talking now about law violation." The issue of compensation and security guarantees, in the president's words, will be provided for in a trilateral agreement between Russia, Ukraine, and the United States. "This agreement will put none of the states in an awkward position," said Kravchuk.
