The draft laws envision a change in the government's structure, making the posts of voivods political, as well as the establishment of an apolitical corps of state officials. "Prior to today's government session, there were three options: The government could have adopted the draft laws reforming the central administration as soon as today, it could have repealed the draft laws, or it could have referred them for further consideration" -- said Minister Michal Strak after Tuesday's Council of Ministers session. "And so, the government chose the third option, which -- bearing in mind the complex nature of the issues that the draft laws deal with -- satisfies me completely." In two weeks, the government will again debate the draft laws discussed on Tuesday. Regarding the proposed law on the Council of Ministers, it is being suggested -- among others -- that a change be made in the ministries' structure, from a "branch-oriented" structure, to a "task-oriented" one. The prime minister would be empowered to appoint ministers, and to assign specific tasks to them. He will not be restricted by the individual ministries' strictly defined powers, the way he has been up to now. "We are suggesting that new Council of Ministers committees be established. Up to now, we have only had the Economic Committee, the Socio-Political Committee, and the Defense Issues Committee -- all of them being committees of the Council of Ministers" -- Strak said. "The government will only decide the most important issues, while all the details will be debated during the committees' sessions." The law on territorial administrative organs would increase the powers of voivods by making voivodship special administration offices, subordinate to voivods. The provision aroused controversy among the ministers because they had doubts as to whether the need to consult voivods regarding each and every directive given to special administration organs -- which are territorial offices subordinated to the ministries -- "will improve the work of the ministries or of voivods." But the law on civil state service, did not arouse major controversy. It envisions the establishment of an apolitical corps of state officials. The political corps on the other hand, would be composed of the ministers and deputy ministers. Voivods would also be political posts -- they would be under an obligation to resign in the case of the government's dismissal. The government did not, however, deal with the Foreign Ministry's statute. The issue will be debated at a future session, along with the statutes of two other ministries.
