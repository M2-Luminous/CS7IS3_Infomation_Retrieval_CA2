The text provides for speeding up of the privatization process, but National Alliance Senate floor leader Giulio Maceratini hurried to say that he had never seen the text presented at majority floor leaders' meetings, and that therefore it was "apocryphal." Nevertheless, we list here some of the salient points of the text which is being circulated. -- Abolition of income tax on incomes up to 10 million lire. -- Tax rebates for companies creating new jobs. -- Rapid introduction of institutionalized temporary work. -- Work and training contracts amended to provide more favorable terms for businesses. -- Full deregulation of workforce contracting, including nominal employment offers, for companies with more than three and less than 15 employees. -- Urgent unfreezing of financing for the south of Italy. -- Suspension of Article 6 of law 537/93 on tendering contracts, a regulation which was introduced by the latest Finance Bill. -- Electoral reform introducing a majority system, abolishing the 25-percent proportional quota. -- Introduction of a constitutional regulation for the budget. -- Application of only two VAT rates. -- Review of the law on pension funds. -- Introduction of "household allowances" for families with low incomes and children. -- Review of personal income tax rates to help large families.
