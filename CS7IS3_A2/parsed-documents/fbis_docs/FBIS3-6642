They have contributed immensely to the restoration and development of the country and nation toward peace and prosperity under the clear-sighted initiative of His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk, our highly revered king. Over the past few months, many KRAF officers and troops and all levels of administrative officials have made great sacrifices and achieved a lot in carrying out their duties, both in the country and in remote areas along the common border in the Phnum Chhat, Anlung Veng, and Palin regions. As heads of the royal government and KRAF co-commanders, I, Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh, first prime minister, and Samdech Hun Sen, second prime minister, would like to express sincere and warmest admiration for the patriotic spirit and the brilliant achievements the officers and men of all KRAF units and all levels of our administrative officials have made to overcome and achieve in this noble cause. The royal government and the KRAF co- commanders consider that the great sacrifices recently made by the KRAF and our officials are a precious contribution to the cause of peace, national unity, national unification, and creating conditions for the restoration and development of our country and nation and to end the disaster of innocent people throughout the Kingdom of Cambodia. We would like to bow and pay respect to the souls of officers and men who have courageously sacrificed their lives in carrying out this noble duty and would like to express and share sad and most regretful condolences with their families. We would also like to affirm that your noble (?sacrifice) will be engraved in the golden book of the nation's history. We wish those who are hospitalized a quick recovery so that they can return to their families and units. Please accept the five Buddhist blessings of longevity, social prestige, happiness, strength, and enlightenment. [Signed] Norodom Ranariddh, five-golden-star general Hun Sen, five-golden-star general [Dated] 19 March 1994
