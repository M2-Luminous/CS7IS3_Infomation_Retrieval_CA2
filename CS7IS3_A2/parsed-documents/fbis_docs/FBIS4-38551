During the visit, he will meet with Belgian leaders and European Union [EU] and NATO officials. Before he left, he explained to our correspondent in Moscow the purpose of the visit and the limits on the cooperation he envisages with the twelve. Kyrgyzstan, he said, wants to be a bridge between East and West. [Akayev] Kyrgyzstan is currently taking only its first steps on the road toward a market economy, democracy, and integration into the world community. I am still convinced that we will see fruitful cooperation between our two countries. With NATO, Too [Toumanov] What do you expect on the practical level from your contacts in Brussels with the EU and NATO? Does your country plan to participate in the Partnership for Peace? [Akayev] A few days ago, the EU and Kyrgyzstan initialed the agreement on partnership and cooperation. Kyrgyzstan is keen to develop cooperation with the military-political union of NATO, especially in the field of technical aid and environmental conservation and protection. We believe the Partnership for Peace to be an important document contributing to the efforts toward consolidating peace and security on the Europe-Asia continent, and that is why Kyrgyzstan intends to participate in this initiative. [Toumanov] You are virtually the only leader of a CIS state to support the proposal to transform the CIS into a Euro-Asiatic union running along the same lines as the EU. At the same time, many observers explain Moscow's frosty welcome for this initiative because of its strictly egalitarian nature which runs counter to the "assembly of lands" logic that currently dominates Russian politics. Do you think this trend endangers the processes of integration within the CIS, and how do you see the Community evolving in this context? [Akayev] We support any initiative likely to consolidate the CIS and we consider that the creation of bilateral or multilateral unions in the community contributes greatly to this. As far as the "assembly of lands" logic is concerned, I must point out that Kyrgyzstan is in favor of a tighter union of the new independent states. In any case, it is no longer possible to return to a union based on the criteria of the old totalitarian system. Between Russia and China [Toumanov] Since Kyrgyzstan became independent -- while maintaining its traditional relations with Russia -- it has been unable to avoid the influence of geopolitical factors, such as the fact that it borders on China. What role does this fact play in regional policy? Is your country concerned about the geographical proximity of the nuclear range of Lob Nor? [Akayev] Russia is still our privileged partner in the economic, military, and political domain, and we want to strengthen and develop this cooperation in the future. However, we enjoy excellent and good-neighborly relations with China. Kyrgyzstan's geopolitical situation means that we have to play a positive role as a bridge linking East and West. As for the Lob Nor range, our action is based on the criteria of the international conventions directed toward putting a global end to nuclear testing. [Toumanov] What role do you think the "Islamic factor" has to play in the civil war in neighboring Tajikistan? Does it represent a real threat to stability in Central Asia? [Akayev] The main reason for the civil war in Tajikistan is the fight for power between the clans, a war that began far back in history. The religious factor has never been anything more than an instrument of this rivalry to which the servants of Islam often fall prey. The "Islamization" of the newly independent states is very unlikely to become a danger for Central Asia whose stability is, on the contrary, above all threatened by the lack of a suitable culture and a suitable legal basis for relations between the states of the region.
