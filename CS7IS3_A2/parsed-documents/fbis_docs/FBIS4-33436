An Education Ministry report shows that in the summer of 1994, 3,460 youths from America, Asia, Africa, and the Near East will complete courses in medical technology, primarily in the fields of teaching, medicine, and stomatology. Since 1965, when the first students in the program arrived, 26,027 foreigners have graduated from the country's institutes and universities. Lazara Aguirre, a Cuban Foreign Ministry employee in charge of the program, explained that changes throughout the world and economic problems on the island forced changes in certain aspects of the program in order to maintain their profoundly humanitarian projection. However, although economic support has been reduced, the authorities have continued to provide support and adopt measures to guarantee commitments, which means that the foreign student plan will be maintained at least until the year 2005, when the final group that is currently in Cuba will complete their studies. Aguirre also pointed out that graduates can practice teaching at centers akin to the careers they studied. Most of the foreign scholarship holders in Cuba come from Sub-Saharan African states (2,754), the American continent (400), North Africa, the Near East (94), and Asia (36). Angola is the country with the most students in Cuba (910), followed by Mozambique (422) and Nicaragua (249). With regard to graduates from 1965 through 1993, Angola also holds first place with 4,764. It is followed by Nicaragua (3,428), Ethiopia (3,070), Mozambique (2,184), and Congo (1,236). The fall of socialism in Europe intensified the U.S. blockade which, according to conservative estimates, has cost Cuba over $40 billion over the past three decades, but, in spite of this, free education has been maintained. Although with unavoidable restrictions and a shortage of teaching equipment, all of Cuba's schools and educational institutions have remained open, which shows that the country's authorities consider education a priority.
