The three vocal opposition politicians are former construction minister Taku Yamasaki, former chief cabinet secretary Koichi Kato and former posts and telecommunications minister Junichiro Koizumi. The name YKK trio is based on the initials of their family names. "The group new century," headed by Kato, aims to "reform the party, create politics suitable for a new era and open up a new frontier for the future Japan," according to the group's constitution. The group, which brought together over 60 LDP lawmakers, openly lashed out at Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party), the core ruling party headed by Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata but widely believed to be controlled by Ichiro Ozawa, the chief coalition strategist. It blames Shinseito for inheriting the money-drenched politicking style of the LDP and for trying to manipulate the coalition government from behind the scenes. The foundation of the new group within the LDP may accelerate moves toward a major reconfiguration of political parties in Japan, political sources said. As the YKK trio are deemed as the critics of the current LDP leadership, led by President Yohei Kono, the group new century may also help proliferate an antileadership sentiment within the party, the sources said.
