Within the majority, opinions differ from your own.... [Martino] I said what I believed. I have been saying what I believe for the past 51 years, and I am not going to change now. [Lalli] Your position seems closer to the Left than to the opinions that a member of the present government would be expected to hold. [Martino] Well, you know...(Martino smiled -- LA REPUBBLICA editor's note) this sort of thing happens when you think with your own head. You may then find yourself closer to others than to your own natural friends. [Lalli] However, what are the grounds for this, so to speak, "extreme liberalist" position? [Martino] To begin with, let us draw a difference in our minds between two very different issues. When I speak of immigration, I am referring to the opportunity for people to find work in other countries than the one where they were born. This issue must not be confused with that of foreigners who come here without a job, as tramps, or who carry out activities which are possibly illegal. This is not the problem we are referring to. This is a law-and-order problem which concerns foreigners, and Italians too. I believe that, if we manage to keep the two issues distinct -- the law-and-order problem concerning vagrancy, and the other problem -- as regards immigration, we can follow a less egoistic policy than the one suggested by the EU. [Lalli] Why is this? [Martino] First, for an ideal reason. I believe that if you believe in freedom, this must include the freedom to move. The fact that I may wish to live in another country forms part of my freedom to move. Secondly, on economic grounds. Migration has been a major factor in the production of wealth. Milton Friedman (the ultraliberal economist who led the "Chicago school" -- LA REPUBBLICA editor's note) said: "Every immigrant brings along a mouth to feed, but also two arms." That is to say, he contributes more to production than to consumption. Today, speaking at a Senate commission meeting, I again recalled the fact that, in 1870, Australia was an empty continent with the highest per capita income in the world. The United States was also an empty continent. From 1870 to 1926 the United States followed an open door policy, whereas Australia followed a selective immigration policy. Australia remained an empty continent, whereas the United States become a world power. In short, immigration is a factor contributing to a country's wealth. The greatest resource consists of men and their skills. Immigrants -- when they have a regular job, and so on -- make the country wealthier, contribute to its wealth. [Lalli] What is your reply to your allies in government who are saying that, on the contrary, immigrants steal jobs from Italians? [Martino] I reply that all the available sociological investigations show that these two groups of workers look for jobs in completely different markets, there is no competition between foreign workers and Italian workers. The typical immigrant's profile is that of a worker with few formal qualifications, whereas the typical unemployed person is highly qualified. [Lalli] What should the Italian Government be doing to tackle this problem? [Martino] I believe that the Martelli law [on immigration] must be reviewed, that a distinction must be drawn between illegal immigrants entering the country without a job (and sometimes giving rise to problems which people rightly deplore), and immigrants coming here to work, and I believe that foreigners who wish and manage to get a job in Italy ought to be allowed in. [Lalli] Even though this may involve according them a different treatment as regards social security benefits? [Martino] You see, the problem is the following: If we establish the same type of treatment for these workers, we will in fact be preventing many of them from finding work in Italy.
