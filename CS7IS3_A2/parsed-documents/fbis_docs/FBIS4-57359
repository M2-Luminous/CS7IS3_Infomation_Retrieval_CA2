After signing some treaties and agreements, both foreign ministers met with reporters. Salvadoran Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Salaverria was asked the most questions by journalists. They questioned him about various topics of national and international interest. [passage omitted] [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] I have a question for both foreign ministers. Regarding the situation in Haiti, would your government support an armed intervention? [Paredes] We believe in democracy, and we hope Haiti will soon return to democracy. We believe all necessary steps must be taken within the framework of respect for the will and self-determination of peoples for the return of democracy. We believe the de facto rulers of Haiti and President Jean Bertrand Aristide are greatly responsible for ensuring the country's return to a democratic system. We in Ecuador do not believe in armed intervention. We believe in the free will of the people, and we hope that the pressures that have been applied will be enough to make the de facto authorities act sensibly and allow that country to live in democracy. [Reporter] The same question for the Salvadoran foreign minister. [Salaverria] We are thinking along the same lines. The use of force is increasingly less necessary. Once we have an international market that adheres to the GATT, I believe the pressures that may be applied in the area of trade might be stronger and more effective than a military force. An embargo has been tried in Haiti, and it has not yielded results. Other methods are being tried out to make it work, however. As the foreign minister said, de facto military rulers have a huge responsibility to their people and to the international community. The position they have maintained cannot be kept up much longer.
