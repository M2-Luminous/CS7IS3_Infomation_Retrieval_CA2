An appeal to the leaderships of Georgia and Abkhazia, which was issued on Saturday [26 March] through Foreign Ministry channels, expresses the hope that both sides involved in the conflict will not allow the resumption of bloodshed and will remove obstacles in the way of negotiations. A few days ago the Georgian leadership requested the Russian president and defense minister step up their efforts to settle the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict. Otherwise, Eduard Shevardnadze said speaking on Georgian television, events in Abkhazia may become uncontrollable and a fresh escalation of the conflict unavoidable. Today's appeal by the Russian Government expresses a readiness to redouble its efforts to help the opposing sides achieve mutually acceptable accords.
