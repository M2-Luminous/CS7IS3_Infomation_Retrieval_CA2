It came in response to yesterday's allegations by Krasimir Premyanov MP of the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), member of the BSP top leadership, that Bulgarian Turks were arming themselves. The DPS described Premyanov's allegations as a "provocation" and "a flagrant anti-constitutional act aimed to stir up interethnic hatred in the Bulgarian people." The DPS leaders believe that certain elements in the BSP want to play the nationalistic card again, Yunal Lyutfi, spokesman for the DPS parliamentary group, told the press. Such lies and provocations could be of benefit only to those who do not care about the country's future, Lyutfi said. The parliamentary group of the DPS discussed a possible motion for stripping Premyanov of immunity but no decision was taken. The matter will be further debated tomorrow, Lyutfi said. The Interior Ministry said today that police authorities have no information on organized arming of the population in areas predominantly populated by ethnic Turks or elsewhere in the country, nor have they discovered illegal arms caches. The regional directorates of the interior in Shumen and Razgrad (towns in a mixed-population region in northeastern Bulgaria) also denied Premyanov's allegations. The Razgrad Regional Directorate of the Interior has no information about stockpiling of weapons in the area under its charge, Major Atanas Atanasov, chief of the directorate, said today. The leaders of the Shumen Directorate of the Interior were even more categorical in their denial of the allegations. "I spoke in a private capacity yesterday and what I said does not bind the parliamentary group of the BSP, its leadership and the party leadership," Premyanov told a regular BSP news conference today. He confirmed the credibility of the information he disclosed yesterday as well as of the tip-offs, some which had been addressed to him and some of which were highly credible. Premyanov said he would wait for the competent authorities to pronounce on some of the tip-offs. Premyanov stressed that in his statement he had not identified any political force or leader. "I daren't claim that this is being done on an ethnic or a clear-cut political basis," Premyanov said. He said that on his initiative the BSP had contacted the interior minister and the chief of the National Security Service to give them the witnesses' whereabouts and the exact locations. "I would very much like this undertaking to be unconnected with the context of the Balkan region," Premyanov said.
