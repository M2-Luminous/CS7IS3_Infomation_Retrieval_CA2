"The Romanian state campaigns for the strict observance of the norms of international law and of the international standards regarding the minorities and makes every effort to secure the rights of national minorities in Romania." Teodor Melescanu mentioned that "as seen by the Romanian Foreign Ministry, the principle of truthfulness and respect of the Romanians living abroad to the states whose citizens they are make the keystone of our policy with the communities of Romanians everywhere and the way to follow in order to avoid any tension and disagreement in bilateral relations with other countries". As regards Ukraine, the Romanian chief diplomat opined that "the emotional side and the sensitiveness of the situation of the Romanian population in that neighbor country consequent to the tragic events generated by the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact (1939), necessarily require the further taking of steps apt to secure conditions for the preservation, expression and development of national, linguistic, cultural and religious identity of the Romanians". In this respect, Melescanu stressed: "We assess as necessary the improvement and development of the tuition in Romanian existing in that country, the provision of facilities for the training in Romania of teaching staff and experts from among Romanian ethnics, the granting of assistance in setting up libraries, clubs, publishing houses, printing houses for Romanian- language publications, the redemption of buildings that belonged to Romanian spirituality, the securing of free flow of persons, especially for the youth who want to learn in Romania. I cannot watch indifferently the degradation or destruction of Romanian vestiges and historical monuments in Ukraine's territory and the measures that prevent the free expression of the Romanians' opinions, as is the case of the PLAI ROMANESC [ROMANIAN LAND] newspaper", said Teodor Melescanu. He stressed that "the problems of the situation of Romanians in Ukraine and of Ukrainians in Romania are a matter of official talks at the level of the two Foreign Ministries pursuing the signing of official documents". The territories in today's Ukraine inhabited by Romanians are parts of Bessarabia and Bucovina -- ancient Romanian territories -- annexed by the former USSR in 1940 pursuant to the Ribbentrop- Molotov pact which has been disavowed these last few years.
