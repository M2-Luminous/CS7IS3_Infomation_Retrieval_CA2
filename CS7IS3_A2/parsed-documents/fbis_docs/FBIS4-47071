The decline in production remains significant. Overall it amounted to 21.7 percent of the level of the first quarter of last year. Eighty enterprises, 60 percent of the total number, had a reduced volume of production. Of the 95 kinds of output considered in the regular reporting, the production volume increased for 21 items (agricultural machinery, knitted and sewn goods, bed linen, canned fruits and vegetables, groats, mixed feeds, and others) in comparison with the analogous period in 1993, it declined for 62 items, and there was no output at all for 9 items (machine tools, medical equipment, road signs, canned meat and meat-vegetable products, and wine). There was a decline in production in all basic branches with the exception of the electrical power industry. The total volume of production in the fuel and energy complex exceeded the level of the first quarter of last year by 1.2 percent and amounted to 81.5 million tenge in current prices. The output of electrical power for the city declined by 4.6 percent and the production of thermal power fell by 3.2 percent. In the machine building complex, the volume of production declined by 22.4 percent relative to the corresponding period of last year. The largest decline in production is seen in the woodworking branch--44 percent. In the building materials industry, output declined by 29.8 percent in comparison with the first quarter of last year, including by 35.7 percent for the production of prefabricated reinforced concrete structures and products. In the first quarter of the current year, fixed capital amounting to 585 million tenge was put into operation, of which 41.3 percent was for production facilities. In the current year, 16 start-up facilities and capacities are under construction. In the first quarter, 59.5 million tenge were assimilated, or 16.7 percent of the annual funding allocated from the fund for the transformation of the economy. There was a significant decline in the volume of conveyances with all kinds of transport. Communications enterprises provided services to the population amounting to 15.5 million tenge. The number of basic subscribers increased by about 2,200 over the year and the increase in the number of telephones installed in apartments was almost 1,800. The economic crisis that has affected all branches of the national economy could not fail to be reflected in the financial results of the enterprises and organizations. In the first two months of the current year, the city registered total losses of 217.7 million tenge. Of 629 enterprises and organizations, 94 (15 percent) suffered losses amounting to 387.7 million tenge. Wholesale prices of industrial enterprises exceeded the level of the corresponding period of last year by a factor of 18.5; in the first three months, prices increased by a factor of 2.7; in March, they increased by a factor of 1.4 in comparison with the preceding month. In the first three months of the current year, the prices for foodstuffs increased by a factor of 2.4. For nonfood items, the cost of paid services to the population increased by a factor of 2.2. In the first quarter in comparison with the corresponding period of 1993, the production of consumer goods declined by 14.7 percent, including by 15.2 percent for foodstuffs (despite the fact that in March the total production of consumer foodstuffs increased by 66.6 percent over February). There was a decline in the production of almost all food products except canned fruit and vegetables, macaroni products, packaged natural tea, margarine, bread, and baked goods. The volume of meat production was only 72.5 percent of the level of the first quarter of last year, that of sausage products was 63.1 percent, mayonnaise 46.2, whole-milk production 86.5, confectionery 60.8, animal oil 41.7, and semifinished meat products 64.3 percent. The population of the city was provided with adequate quantities only of bread, baked goods, and macaroni products. In March, the per-capita cost of a selection of vitally necessary food products was 323 tenge compared with 290 tenge in Febuary. The production of nonfood commodities declined by 19.2 percent in the first quarter in comparison with the same period last year. In comparison with the corresponding period of last year, the volume of production of knitted goods increased by 9 percent, leather footwear by 3.9 percent, sewn goods by 24.9, bed linen by 1.4, and leather goods by 2.1 percent. The production of textile goods amounted to only 8.6 percent [of the level of last year], televisions 10.9, and washing machines, 34.9 percent. The average monthly wage in January-February increased by a factor of 11 in comparison with the corresponding period of last year and amounted to 446 tenge, whereas in Febuary it was 475 tenge (an increase of 26.2 percent over January). Above average for the city was the average monthly wage for workers in transport, communications, construction organizations, material-technical supply, housing and municipal services, and nonproduction kinds of domestic services for the population. For workers in commercial activities, it amounted to a little over 800 tenge, whereas for workers in the credit industry and in state insurance it was more than 1,200 tenge. Below the average for the national economy was the level of wages for workers in public health, physical culture. social security, and science, where it was lower by a factor of 2.3, and scientific services, where it was one-half the level for the national economy. Since the beginning of the year, 2,376 persons appealed to the employment service and jobs were found for 1,142 of them (48.1 percent). As of 1 April of the current year, there were 144 persons officially registered as unemployed in Almaty, of whom 115 (79.9 percent) are receiving unemployment assistance. As we see, overall the situation in the branches of the economy remains unsatisfactory. In the coming months, one may more likely predict a worsening rather than a stabilization of the situation in industry, because with the insolvency of enterprises the increase in prices for power sources will lead to a shutdown of many production capacities.
