This morning, an all-out artillery barrage is being directed at the region in and around Zuc, which the [Serbian] aggressor is targeting with howitzers, tanks, mortars, and other heavy artillery from several positions. The residential areas in the northwestern part of the city have also been targeted, while shells carrying chemical charges have landed on Glavica. Everything points to the fact that infantry attacks could follow, so citizens are warned to restrict (?their movements). The general alarm has been sounded and citizens are asked to exercise maximum caution.
