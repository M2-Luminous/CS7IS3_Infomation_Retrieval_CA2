FR940513-0-00138 FR940513-0-00034 The Commission has determined that the final labeling rules should require that all the specified disclosures be based on operation at 120 volts, but that it should not require disclosure of voltage unless the design voltage is other than 120, since all required lamp disclosures will be based on a uniform voltage. 68 For the vast majority of purchasers in the country, lamps will be operated at 120 volts, regardless of the design voltage designated by the lamp manufacturer. For these purchasers, who represent 90% or more of the market for these lamps in the U.S., therefore, disclosures of the lamp's performance in watts, lumens, life and energy efficiency at a different voltage, such as 125 or 130 volts, would misrepresent the performance they receive in actual use. 69 The Commission realizes that, for those purchasers whose line voltage is other than 120 volts, disclosure of these performance characteristics at 120 volts will not represent the lamp performance they will experience. These purchasers, however, represent a small minority in the marketplace. For lamps with a design voltage of 130, but expected to be operated at 120 volts, the disclosures will be accurate. 70 68 See 16 CFR 305.11(e)(1)(C) in Text of Amendments, below. If a lamp's design voltage is other than 120 volts, the lamp's required disclosures of wattage, light output, and life must each be followed by the phrase ``at 120 volts.'' Manufacturers of such lamps may also disclose the lamps' wattage, light output and life at the design voltage. In such cases, the disclosures of wattage, light output, and life must each be followed by a phrase indicating the voltage at which the additional disclosures were measured, e.g. , ``at 125 volts.'' 69 See note 53, above. 70 See Angelo (Tr.), 63: (P)eople may choose life or lumen output but if it's tested at 120 then there's no reason to go through the deception of saying it's a 130-volt lamp. It's simply enough to say that this lamp is going to produce less lumens[,] meaning it's going to have a different filament and it has really nothing to do with design wattage, it has to do with life and lumens. So in the circumstance of the people who were buying it for that reason, why go through a deception? Why not just tell them [it's] at 120 and let it be billed as a 120-volt lamp with less lumens and more life? The final rules, therefore, require that the disclosures of watts, lumens, and hours of life be based on operation of the lamp at 120 volts. Because medium base compact fluorescent lamps compete directly with incandescent lamps, purchasers often will compare these different lamp types when making purchasing decisions. Therefore, the Commission also is requiring that the performance disclosures for medium base compact fluorescent lamps be based on operation at 120 volts. The labeling rules, however, allow manufacturers who distribute lamps with different design voltages to provide additional information based on the design voltage of the lamps when operated under those other voltages. Because the Commission is allowing manufacturers to provide additional information to purchasers whose line voltage varies from 120 volts, there is no reason to believe that manufacturers will cease production of lamps designed to operate at different voltages, as NEMA speculated. 71 See §§305.11(e)(1)(A)(ii) and 305.11(e)(1)(C) in ``Text of Amendments,'' below. 71 NEMA (Supp.), G&hyph;10, 21. b. Wattage. Watt ratings on lamps refer to the unit of electrical power that the lamp will consume. 72 In the NPR, the Commission proposed requiring that watts be disclosed. There was no disagreement during the proceeding regarding the need for or appropriateness of requiring disclosure of wattage on labels for general service incandescent (nonreflector) lamps and compact fluorescent lamps. 73 This information is often used by residential purchasers as the basis for selecting a lamp because they often associate light output with the wattage ratings of the general service incandescent lamps they currently use. But, wattage information also is important to know for safety reasons. Lamp fixtures often are marked with the maximum wattage lamp the fixture is designed to use. For incandescent lamp fixtures in particular, use of a lamp with a higher wattage than that marked on the fixture can result in a safety hazard created by the higher heat output from the higher wattage lamp. Purchasers, therefore, need wattage information in addition to lumen output when selecting the appropriate lamp to meet their requirements. 72 The term ``watt'' (a unit of power) is defined as the power which in one second gives rise to energy of one joule. NIST Special Publication 330, at 18. In EPCA, as amended by EPA 92, the term ``lamp wattage'' means ``the total electrical power consumed by a lamp in watts, after the initial seasoning period referenced in the appropriate IES standard test procedure and including, for fluorescent, arc watts plus cathode watts.'' 42 U.S.C.A. 6291(30)(O) (West Supp. 1993). 73 The Light Bulb Rule already requires a wattage disclosure for incandescent lamps. 16 CFR 409.1(a)(1). Accordingly, the Commission is requiring disclosure of watts on packages. In addition, to help purchasers understand the meaning of watts, the Commission is requiring that the phrase ``energy used'' precede the wattage number and term ``watts.'' The juxtaposition of the ``watts'' and ``energy used'' disclosures, in conjunction with the ``lumens'' and ``light output'' disclosures, discussed in Part IV.C.1.c.i, below, can help educate purchasers on the relationship between the amount of light a lamp produces and the amount of energy used to produce the light. These disclosures, along with the Advisory Disclosure described in Part IV.C.2.c, below, will enable purchasers to select the most energy efficient products that meet their lighting needs. At the same time, the combined disclosures will provide retail purchasers with the ``watt'' information they may be most accustomed to using as the basis for their purchasing decisions, and which they may need to avoid purchasing a lamp product that is inappropriate for the lamp fixture in which it will be used. See §§305.11(e)(1)(A)(iii) and 305.11(e)(1)(B) in ``Text of Amendments,'' below.
