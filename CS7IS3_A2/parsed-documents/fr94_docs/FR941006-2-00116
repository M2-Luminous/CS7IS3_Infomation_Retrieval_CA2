FR941006-2-00116 FR941006-2-00084 [Release No. 34&hyph;34758; File No. SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;94&hyph;49] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of a Proposed Rule Change and Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 to the Proposed Rule Change by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., Relating to Listing Standards for Selected Equity-Linked Debt Securities (``SEEDS''). September 30, 1994. Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby given that on August 31, 1994, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I and II below, which Items have been prepared by the NASD. The NASD filed Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change on September 2, 1994, and Amendment No. 2 on September 9, 1994. 1 The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change, as amended, from interested persons. 1 In Amendment Nos. 1 and 2, the NASD proposed to make certain clarifying amendments to the proposed rule language, as more fully discussed herein, to more closely conform the listing standards for SEEDS to the listing standards for equity-linked debt in place on the New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE'') and the American Stock Exchange (``Amex''). Amendment No. 1 also eliminates the minimum holder requirement for securities that are listed pursuant to Article III, Section 2 of the NASD Rules of Fair Practice but which are traded in thousand dollar denominations. See Letter from Robert Aber, Vice President and General Counsel, NASD, to Brad Ritter, Attorney, Office of Market Supervision (``OMS''), Division of Market Regulation (``Division''), Commission, dated September 2, 1994 (``Amendment No. 1''); and Letter from Robert Aber, Vice President and General Counsel, NASD, to Brad Ritter, Attorney, OMS, Division, Commission, dated September 9, 1994 (``Amendment No. 2''). I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The NASD is proposing amendments to Schedule D of the NASD By-Laws to provide listing standards for the designation of Selected Equity-Linked Debt Securities (``SEEDS'') 2 as Nasdaq National Market securities. The NASD also proposes to amend the Policy of the NASD Board of Governors issued under Article III, section 2, of the NASD Rules of Fair Practice to highlight members' obligations to deal fairly with their customers when making recommendations or accepting orders concerning SEEDS. The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, NASD, and at the Commission. 2 ``SEEDS'' and ``Selected Equity-Linked Debt Securities'' are service marks of the NASD. II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NASD has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change Under section 2(e) of Part III of Schedule D to the NASD By-Laws, the NASD may designate as Nasdaq National Market securities financial instruments which can not be readily categorized under traditional listing guidelines for, among other instruments, common and preferred stock, bonds, debentures, and warrants. 3 The NASD is now proposing to amend Section 2 of Part III of Schedule D to the NASD By-Laws to provide listing standards for SEEDS, a specific type of hybrid security. As with the more general hybrid product listing standards, all SEEDS will be designated as Nasdaq National Market securities. 4 In addition, SEEDS will be treated as equity instruments for, among other purposes, margin requirements. 3 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32988 (September 29, 1993), 58 FR 52124 (October 6, 1993). 4 The NASD notes that the Commission already has approved comparable listing standards for Equity-Linked Debt Securities (``ELDS'') listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE'') and Equity-Linked Term Notes (``ELNs'') listed and traded on the American Stock Exchange (``Amex''). The NASD states that with two exceptions, as discussed herein, the NASD's proposed standards are virtually identical to the NYSE's and Amex's listing standards for ELDS and ELNs, respectively. See Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 32343 (May 20, 1993), 58 FR 30833 (May 27, 1993) (order originally approving the listing of ELNs); 33328 (December 13, 1993), 58 FR 66041 (December 17, 1993) (order approving revised market capitalization and trading volume requirements for the listing of ELNs); 33468 (January 13, 1994), 59 FR 3387 (January 21, 1994) (order originally approving the listing of ELDS); 33841 (March 31, 1994), 59 FR 16671 (April 7, 1994) (order approving revised market capitalization and trading volume requirements for the listing of ELDS); 34545 (August 18, 1994), 59 FR 43877 (August 25, 1994) (order approving the listing of ELDS linked to securities issued by non-U.S. companies) (``Exchange Act Release No. 34545''); and 34549 (August 18, 1994), 59 FR 43873 (August 25, 1994) (order approving the listing of ELNs linked to securities issued by non-U.S. companies) (``Exchange Act Release No. 34549'') (collectively, ``Equity-Linked Note Approval Orders'').
