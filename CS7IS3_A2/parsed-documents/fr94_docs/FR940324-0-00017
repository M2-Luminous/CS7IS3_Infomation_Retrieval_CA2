Discussion Effect of Flight Control Systems on Structure The SAAB Model 2000 incorporates certain fly-by-wire (FBW) electronic flight control systems (EFCS). The rudder system includes a yaw damper, rudder limiter, and an auto-trim function which can affect loads. The follow-on design for the elevators has many similar features. System failures can lead to design load conditions not envisioned by the certification rules for transport airplanes. These special conditions are issued to ensure the same level of safety by providing comprehensive criteria in which the structural design safety margins are dependent on systems reliability. Discussion of Comments Notice of Proposed Special Conditions No. SC&hyph;93&hyph;7&hyph;NM for the SAAB Model 2000 airplane was published in the Federal Register on December 9, 1993 (58 FR 64700). One commenter (an organization representing professional pilots) responded. ``Our comments are fundamentally in support of the proposed special conditions. However, one commenter is concerned regarding the reliability of providing hydraulic power by the two back-up pumps mentioned in the `Background' information. This apprehension stems from the fact that both back-up pumps are powered from a common motor with shear out features. The commenter questioned this system as redundant or a single point where the `system' could break down and not provide the required hydraulic power necessary to operate the rudder. The commenter's concern extends to the elevators if a similar design is used.'' The commenter's concern is addressed in the SAAB 2000 design. The SAAB 2000 can be flown without hydraulic power to the rudder for most hydraulic failure conditions. However, if during takeoff, one engine fails, hydraulic power is necessary to maintain control of the airplane. With this in mind, the SAAB design provides the rudder's two hydraulic actuators with power from two independent hydraulic circuits. One actuator with one functioning circuit is capable of driving the rudder if the other hydraulic circuit is lost. Each hydraulic circuit is supplied by an engine driven pump, and for a short duration, power can also be supplied by accumulators. Each circuit is isolated fore and aft by fuses in case the circuits are severed by engine debris. Each circuit, aft of the fuse, has a back-up pump and an accumulator. The back-up pumps, driven by a common electric motor, are activated by low hydraulic pressure in either hydraulic circuit. To protect the independence of the two hydraulic circuits and to eliminate the single point where the ``system'' could break down, as expressed by the commenter, a shear out feature is provided between each back-up pump and the common electric motor. As a further precaution, the AC motor is automatically started (tested) as part of the preflight reliability check. Regarding the commenter's concern for the elevator system, that system will have three hydraulic systems which have many of the same features provided for the hydraulic systems supporting the rudder. Conclusion This action affects only certain unusual or novel design features on one model of airplane. It is not a rule of general applicability and affects only the manufacturer who applied to the FAA for approval of these features on the airplane.
