The Foreign Ministry assesses that the visit contravenes all relevant Security Council resolutions and documents which confirm the sovereignty and integrity of the Republic of Croatia. It will also have negative repercussions on the implementation of the above mentioned documents and on diplomatic efforts directed toward normalization of Croatian-Serbian relations and the peaceful reintegration of the occupied areas into the constitutional and legal system of the Republic of Croatia. This is why Mr. Akashi was asked to do everything within his power to prevent any future occurrence of such events which seriously threaten peace in this region. Niko Bezmalinovic, ambassador of the Republic of Croatia to the Russian Federation, has sent a similar protest letter to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
