[Yatom] A very grave incident occurred in the Cave of the Patriarchs this morning. We are still holding debriefings. I came here to investigate with the other commanders. What we know at this moment, which is not everything, is the following: At about 0530 this morning, a Jewish resident, an Israeli citizen, entered the prayer hall in the Cave of Patriarchs where several hundred Palestinians were praying, opened fire in all directions with a Galil rifle, killing a number of Arab worshipers, and wounding others. Later, he apparently committed suicide by shooting himself. As I said, the event is extremely grave. It is an horrendous act by an armed man at a group of absolutely innocent worshipers. I would like to take this opportunity not only to denounce what happened, but also to express my condolences to the families of the fatalities and to wish the wounded a speedy recovery. [Litman] General, do you know what the current situation in Hebron is? We are receiving reports about disturbances not only in Hebron but throughout Judaea and Samaria, and about additional Arab casualties due to IDF [Israel Defense Forces] fire following many stoning incidents and riots. Can you confirm this? [Yatom] That is inaccurate. In Hebron, there are no disturbances at the moment. I am not saying there will not be any, there might be later on, because the Arabs are in a state of high tension. We are sending forces into the area in order to restore calm as much as possible. To that end, we imposed a curfew on Hebron city. There are attempts in several other places in Judaea and Samaria to disturb the peace. IDF and security forces are being sent in to prevent disturbances. There are no additional casualties among the Arabs. A Palestinian in Hebron hurled a firebomb at a member of our forces a few minutes ago. He was shot in the leg, wounded, and captured. [Litman] General Yatom, what can you tell us officially about the number of fatalities in the Cave of Patriarchs massacre? [Yatom] I do not have an official count. The number of fatalities is 10, 16, or even more. Neither we nor the Palestinians have yet succeeded in counting the number of fatalities and making a full report on the number of casualties. I hope the figure will be as low as possible. The act was the initiative of a single person who carried out a despicable act by shooting at an innocent crowd. I can understand the outrage among the Palestinians in Judaea and Samaria. I cannot agree to disturbances. I do not think a new situation has been created. We will take action to restore calm and to make sure there are no disturbances. [IDF Radio's Netan'el Semrik] Did the Israeli assailant operate on his own? [Yatom] The Israeli acted on his own, and as things appear now, it was the initiative of one man. I do not know what happened to him, but there is no doubt that it was the act of a crazy man. We increased protection on the Palestinian and Jewish populations in the Hebron and Qiryat Arba' vicinities. I did not recommend in the past and I still do not recommend that the Jewish public avoid travelling. I would like to say what I said in the past: Whoever has to travel on Judaea and Samaria roads in order to do whatever he thinks he has to do, can do so. We will provide the necessary security, especially in this area. [Unidentified correspondent] We have different figures on fatalities. [Yatom] You have data, and I have data. I do not know if information is accurate. I very much hope that my reports are correct and yours are inaccurate. I cannot promise anything. I checked after some of them were published in the media. We gave clear instructions to the forces to avoid as much as possible opening fire on disturbers of the peace or on crowds. The order is to open fire only if the lives of soldiers and security forces are endangered. In all other cases, the instructions are clear, and unequivocal: Do not open fire. We will disperse the disturbances and demonstrations using other means. [Litman] General Yatom, will you change the orders in the Cave of the Patriarchs, a sensitive location, where Jewish and Arab worshipers pray together? [Yatom] Jews and Arabs have been praying together at the Cave of the Patriarchs for many years. The prayer arrangements permit both the Jews and the Muslims to express their religious feelings. The prayers sessions there are definitely complex because the prayers often take place simultaneously -- in different halls, but at the same time. There is no doubt that this is a charged place. I do not know if in the wake of this grave action we will have to issue new instructions. The risk is that friction between Jews and Arabs will break out due to close contact between two groups of worshipers. This danger has been with us for many years. [Corespondent] General Yatom, were there IDF soldiers in the Cave of the Patriarchs during the bloodbath, and should the instructions be changed so that only unarmed people enter the cave? [Yatom] IDF soldiers were in the vicinity of the Cave of the Patriarchs this morning, as they always are, since an IDF force has been deployed at the cave for many years and its job is to safeguard the place, especially externally. The prayer arrangements permit the Muslims and Jews to enter, often at the same time. For many years, the Israeli worshipers have entered the Cave of the Patriarchs with their weapons. We make sure that the weapons are emptied of their ammunition. There is no doubt that we will have to review the situation. I cannot say whether following the review we will issue new instructions. I would like to add that we offered all our assistance to the Palestinians in this grave incident. At one stage, a request was made to provide helicopters to transfer some of the gravely wounded Palestinian casualties to hospital. I approved it immediately, but the Palestinians withdrew their request. They preferred to evacuate them in a different way. [Litman] General, you are also the prime minister's defense secretary. Did you report to him on what happened in Hebron and can you tell us what is happening in other areas of Judaea and Samaria, which are under your authority? [Yatom] I am now the Central Command's commander and I report to the prime minister only via the chief of staff. As I have said, except for reports about disturbances and riots in the Bethlehem area, I have no other reports, which means there are no other disturbances. In reference to the assailant, his identity is known to us. I can say that he entered the place wearing an IDF uniform with his rank insignia from the reserves. He is an officer in the reserves. [Correspondent] General, in the General Staff and Central Command consultations will a decision be made to sharpen the divisions between the Jewish and Arab public, to impose curfews, and perhaps even a closure? [Yatom] I do not want to go into these things now. As I said, this event will force us to study the present arrangements, especially where Jews and Arabs coexist. We will study the issue and then act.
