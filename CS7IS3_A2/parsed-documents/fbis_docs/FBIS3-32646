Armed Forces Criticized PY1102230794 La Paz HOY in Spanish 4 Feb 94 pp 6, 7 PY1102230794 La Paz HOY Language: Spanish Article Type:BFN [Excerpt] In reference to a comment made by a Honduran military official, Armed Forces Commander General Fernando Sanjinez Yanez said on 3 February that the U.S. attempt to have the armed forces of the Latin American countries disappear to impose its predominance does create concern. For Gen. Sanjinez it is not possible that the U.S. Government would have that intention when its Armed Forces were also born, like those of other nations, "inspired by independence and freedom for the Republic." Sanjinez said the U.S. Government should understand that "respect for someone else's rights means peace," and that for this reason a dominance of this nature -- which according to the Honduran military official is already in process -- should not occur. He added: "Our armed forces did not come to life as instruments of a long process of conquest. They are the product of the historic need for freedom our people had and still have." According to the contents of the "Bush Plan," the United States has the main objective of abolishing the armed forces in Latin America to impose its dominance and will in detriment to the sovereignty and independence of the region's countries. Sanjinez Yanez pointed out that an attitude of aggression by the United States "would be like ignoring the influence of the culture of peace in the evolution of history." He believes the position of the Bolivian military is shared by its Latin American colleagues whose representatives have reacted several times to this delicate issue. [passage omitted]
