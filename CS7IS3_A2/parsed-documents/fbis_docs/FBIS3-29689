There are no obstacles at all. Vietnam's membership is not the issue now, he told reporters who approached him and Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam as they emerged from a three-hour meeting at the Government Guest House here Monday evening. When a reporter pressed on whether in that case, Vietnam could even join ASEAN today itself, Ajit Singh said the issue now was the question of timing. Cam interjected and said the timing of Vietnam's entry was for further discussion by ASEAN member natioms -- Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, the Philippines, and Brunei. Ajit Singh was also asked whether ASEAN felt that the lifting of the United States' trade embargo on Vietnam early this month made it necessary more than ever for the communist country to join the grouping. He replied that ASEAN has always regarded Vietnam as part of the region and its granting of an observer status to the country was a recognition of this fact. Cam was asked whether there was consensus among Vietnam's traders that their country should join ASEAN immediately. He replied by referring to Vietnam Communist Party Secretary-General Do Muoi's statement in Thailand last year that Vietnam would join ASEAN at an appropriate time. This means that the timing of Vietnam's entry into ASEAN depends on the agreement between Vietnam and ASEAN, he said During his six-day visit to Vietnam, the first by an ASEAN secretary-general, Ajit Singh is also scheduled to tour Dalat, Hue, and Ho Chi Minh City.
