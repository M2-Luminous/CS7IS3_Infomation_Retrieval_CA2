Gavriil Popov, chairman of the Russian Movement for Democratic Reforms, addressing a meeting of the movement leadership on Saturday, said the president could have forestalled the amnesty decision of parliament by putting before it his own draft resolution laying down conditions on which those involved in last October's conservative revolt could be released, one of which could be a ban on any political activity for a specified period. Parliament's amnesty resolution could prove to be "either a step towards national conciliation or a step towards the aggravation of the situation," Popov said. He said the prosecution of the organizers of the 1991 coup attempt and of the October 1993 rebellion had proved "the total helplessness" of Russia's law enforcement system. The Prosecutor General's Office needs "purging from top to bottom," he said. At the same meeting, Popov described NATO's plan to carry out air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs as "the first attempt of the West to provide a legal basis for Russia's expulsion from the number of great powers." He said the fact that the case of the Ames couple, charged with espionage for Russia, was given publicity at a time when the Serbs were withdrawing their heavy weapons from around Sarajevo looked like "an attempt to discredit in the eyes of the Americans the first independent step of Russia." "Surely America could not admit that its policy in Yugoslavia had fallen through," Popov said.
