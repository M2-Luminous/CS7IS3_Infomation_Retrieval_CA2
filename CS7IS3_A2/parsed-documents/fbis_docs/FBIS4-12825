U.S. foreign policy under Christopher was said to have been undynamic and a disappointment to the White House. The perception was that the previous republican administration would probably have been tougher and assertive if it remained in power. Foreign Report said that President Clinton had been unwillingly drawn into foreign policy issues instead of being allowed to concentrate on domestic affairs. Some issues had been delegated to Vice President Al Gore rather than Christopher and more recently, the secretary of defense, Bill Perry, seemed to have been making the running on foreign policy. Whether Talbott, the former Washington bureau chief of TIME magazine and long-standing friend of Clinton, makes American foreign policy, the weekly intelligence publication said, remained to be seen. Although the deputy secretary of state knows Washington well and is a student of relations with Russia, he has held no personal experience of high office before.
