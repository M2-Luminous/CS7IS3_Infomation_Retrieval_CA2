The firm has also signed an agreement with Kymmene Oy [of Finland] to help improve production there. This cooperation pact also involves marketing of products other than packaging cardboard. The privatization process is already half completed, but the company has aimed at a 20-percent ownership share, a spokesman from Tetra Pak stated on Tuesday [7 June]. With this, the firm would assure cardboard supplies for its plants making packaging materials in Kuban in Russia and Kiev in Ukraine. The pulp and paper kombinat in Svetogorsk is one of Russia' largest and most modern forestry industry units. The kombinat in its origin was a Finnish construction project carried out by Finn-Stroi during the middle of the 1980's. Production capacity is around 420,000 tons of pulp and 220,000 tons of paper annually. The packaging plant's yearly capacity is currently 60,000 tons, and could -- with slight additional investment -- be raised to 100,000 tons. Operations in Svetogorsk recently have been at a low level because of raw material shortages. One of the cable papermaking machines in Svetogorsk has been converted so that it can now produce cardboard for liquids packaging. Investments of almost 60 million [Finnish] markkas have been financed by Tetra Pak. These new investments are a direct consequence of Tetra Pak's concentration on the Russian market. Over the past few years the firm has invested close to 700 million markkas in Russia. The firm has four separate production facilities for processing machines, filling machines, and packaging materials for foods in liquid form. The company employs almost 1,500 persons.
