He said Kim Yong-sam's promise in his election "commitments" to adopt a policy for the farmers was a lie to fool them. Noting that Kim Yong-sam, disclosing his true color, has taken today the road of totally sacrificing agriculture and farmers with the measure of rice market opening, he declared that Chonnong would resolutely turn out in the struggle to defend "our rice, our agriculture".
