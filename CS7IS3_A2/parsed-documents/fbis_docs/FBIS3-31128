Do you not think that we should put this very important issue on hold until a new constitution is enacted? [Milewski] No, I do not think so because the lack of statutory and constitutional provisions in this area is quite troublesome--I would even say it is dangerous--for the country's defense system and its security. This should--and can--be remedied as soon as possible so as not to leave the issue hanging in the air until the new constitution is enacted. What is this all about? The goal is to achieve a certain coordination in the functioning of various state executive organs in this area, and also to make their mutual measures coherent with one another, and to make them unanimous. We are aware that the president of the Polish Republic is the supreme state organ in these issues; in accordance with Article 34 of the Small Constitution he exercises general leadership in the area of the country's internal and external security. But it is not defined anywhere in what way he is supposed to exercise the aforementioned leadership. In addition to that, the Law on the Popular Defense Obligation continues to include the definition of a National Defense Committee [KOK], which is a legacy from the previous [presumably communist] period. The Law says that KOK is the appropriate organ in issues of defense and security, and it is supposed to function in consultation with the Council of Ministers, but it is not known how that is supposed to come about in practice, nor is it known what KOK is supposed to be dealing with. Apart from that, the Small Constitution also provides a definition of a National Security Council [RBN] as the president's advisory organ in areas of defense and security, but it is not defined anywhere what the relationship is supposed to be between RBN and KOK, nor is it defined generally speaking what the relationship is supposed to be between the organs I just mentioned and the Council of Ministers. [Swiac] But are you not afraid of disturbing a certain balance existing among the different authority components? [Milewski] There is no such balance right now, and so one must simply achieve it, and that was the idea behind the proposal, which by the way was submitted jointly by the defense minister and the National Security Bureau [BBN] during the most recent KOK session. Let me remind you that KOK's composition includes the prime minister, four ministers--defense, internal affairs, foreign, and finance--as well as the chief of the General Staff, Sejm and Senate speakers, the minister of state from the Office of the President of the Republic of Poland, the president as the group's chairman, and myself as secretary. Now, the proposal was debated by the group of people I just described, and it was approved. The goal for us is to move for an amendment to the Small Constitution which would go in the direction of granting executive powers--and not just advisory ones--to RBN which will replace KOK which had existed up to now; KOK will be dissolved through appropriate amendments to the Law on the Popular Defense Obligation. We suggested the establishment of a permanent, interministry working group under the leadership of the defense minister who will be dealing with preparing all materials and issues discussed both by the Council of Ministers' Defense Issues Committee and by RBN. Right now, there are different ad hoc committees within the government and in its close environment; there are also anticrisis committees and committees dealing with specific topics. Such committees are established, nobody knows how they function or when they are supposed to cease to function. By contrast, we would have [under the proposal] a permanent group established, with which, by the way, BBN would cooperate on a regular basis. [Swiac] In your view, do these planned changes not conflict with the Partnership for Peace program which is based on the assumption of a democratic and civilian supervision over the Army? [Milewski] The changes that we are proposing include a division of powers between a civilian defense minister and a chief of the General Staff who would be a military--he is the highest-ranking military in the Polish Republic. That division of powers does not exist right now since the Law on the Popular Defense Obligation which is currently in force, continues to be adapted to the old situation when the defense minister was at the same time the highest-ranking officer of the Polish Army since he was an active general or admiral. So we proposed these changes to have them implemented at the same time as dealing with issues of higher importance. The appropriate drafts of amendments were prepared and submitted to the Office of the Council of Ministers so that the Council of Ministers may debate them, and so that they may be later introduced in parliament on the government's motion, not on the president's. Such a decision was made at the most recent KOK session.
