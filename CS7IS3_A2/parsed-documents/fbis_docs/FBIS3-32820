The charges involve the cutting of trees in the forests of El Choco Department. According to investigations, the minister and 20 other officials of the Choco [word indistinct] Company, CodeChoco, authorized the indiscriminate cutting of over 200,000 hectares of forest in 1980. Investigations reveal that Rodriguez Becerra, who was the director of Indirena [Institute for Development of Renewable Natural Resources] at the time and a member of the CodeChoco Board of Directors, did not control or verify the permits of five companies, including (Barza 1 and Barza 2), for exploiting the lumber in the (Chajerado) area. The new minister feels that the Codechoco Board of Directors are not responsible for that ecological crime. [Begin Rodriguez Becerra recording] I did not directly participate, nor am I responsible for the exploitation of lumber in the Indian territories. [end recording] Nevertheless, the Attorney General's Office has said the exploitation authorized by CodeChoco led to the extinction of over 10 animal species, contamination of the Atrato River, and the expulsion of Indian communities from southern Choco.
