The promulgation of such tax regulations as the PRC Interim Regulations on Value Added Tax is a mark that China's tax reform has already entered a new stage. An important task before leaders at all levels on the economic front is to correctly understand the great significance of tax reform at this time, smoothen the changeover and transition from the old taxation system to the new, and enable enterprises to meet the needs of the new situation as soon as possible, enter the market, and participate in fair competition. I. It is Necessary To Fully Understand the Great Significance of Tax Reform A. Putting into practice the tax division system whereby tax revenues are shared by central and local authorities is conducive to breaking regional barriers and forming a unified market. Developing a socialist market economy demands a unified and open market. The various systems currently practiced in all localities whereby local governments are responsible for their own finances have played a great role in changing the traditional planned system of centralizing control over revenues and expenditures and in developing their economies. But as reform is deepening and the socialist market economy is developing, this type of system -- which delineates financial revenues in keeping with the administrative subordination of enterprises -- has to some extent strengthened the government's administrative interference in enterprises and weakened the tax-revenue regulating function, and easily causes unequal distribution and enlarges the gap of economic and social development between regions. Practicing the tax division system is conducive to breaking the man-made boundaries, establishing fair exchanges of commodities between different regions, and promoting the formation of a nationwide unified market. B. By unifying the income taxes of home enterprises, we have changed the practice of setting tax categories according to the nature of ownership, and this is conducive to fair tax sharing and to promoting fair competition. There are now four categories of income tax for enterprises in China. For large and medium enterprises, we levy a proportional tax which is 55 percent of their revenues. We also levy the regulatory tax on some of these enterprises. For small enterprises and collective enterprises, we use the eight-step progressive rates levied on income in excess of specific amounts, with the highest tax rate being 55 percent. For private enterprises, we levy a proportional rate which is 35 percent. The income tax rate for foreign-invested enterprises is 30 percent plus 3 percent of local additional tax. The income tax rate for enterprises in special economic zones and economic and technological development districts is 15 percent. The income tax for productive enterprises in the old urban areas of coastal open cities is 24 percent, plus 3 percent of local additional tax. In this way, different tax categories have been set in accordance with different forms of ownership in a way that tax rates and preferential treatment differ, causing enterprises to shoulder unfair tax burdens. The tax reform this time has unified the income taxes levied on home enterprises and standardized the before-tax deductions and expenditure criteria [lie zhi biao zhun 0441 2388 2871 3294]. On the basis of preventing the tax bases from being eroded, it has lowered the nominal tax rates for state-owned enterprises; canceled the fund for key energy and transportation construction projects, the budget readjustment fund, and the regulatory tax levied solely on large and medium state-owned enterprises; and standardized the distribution relationships between the state and enterprises, thus creating conditions for enterprises with different forms of ownership to share taxes fairly and to participate in fair competition. C. We have adopted the circulating-tax system which is comparatively standard internationally and which takes the value-added tax as the main body, thus reducing the repeated levying of taxes and encouraging the optimum allocation of resources and specialized coordination. At present, China's circulating taxes for home enterprises and foreign enterprises are inconsistent. They are very much graded and their tax rates vary greatly. For instance, the value-added tax rates for home enterprises range from 8 percent to 45 percent and are divided into 13 grades, product tax rates range from 3 percent to 60 percent and are divided into 21 grades, business tax rates range from 3 percent to 15 percent and are divided into four grades, and the industrial and commercial consolidated tax rates for foreign enterprises range from 1.5 percent to 69 percent and are divided into 40 grades. Many of these tax rates were set for regulating the irrational price differences under the planned economy. Following the gradual lifting of price restrictions and the development of the market economy, the current taxation system must be reformed. In keeping with the practice of most countries, China's new taxation system has adopted the circulating tax system whose main body is the value-added tax. It embodies the principle of fairness, neutrality, universality, and simplicity. "Fairness" means it standardizes the circulating taxes on home and foreign enterprises and specifically regulates a small number of commodities by levying the consumption tax. "Neutrality" means that we take the amount of value added as the taxable object and that in calculating taxes, we deduct the transfer value of the means of production in the course of commodity production, deduct the amount of collected taxes on the goods purchased and already put to use, thus avoiding the repeated levying of taxes so that the same product will not shoulder different taxes as a result of the different organizational modes of enterprises and of the difference in the number of transactions made. "Universality" means that the value-added tax covers the entire process of commodity production and circulation and forms a tax system which exists ubiquitously whether in production and circulation. "Simplicity" means thoroughly simplifying the tax rates and setting only one basic tax rate and one low-grade tax rate. These principles meet the objective demands of socialized large-scale production and of developing market economy and are conducive to the optimum allocation of resources and to converging with the international market. The direction of the tax reform this time is completely correct. Following the deepening of reform and the increasing degree of marketization, the significance of the tax system reform will become more and more fully manifested. II. Strengthen the Study, Understanding, and Grasping of the Basic Spirit and Main Contents of Tax Reform Many contents of the current tax reform are totally new. Many enterprises do not have much understanding of the specific contents or a basic knowledge of tax reform. They are comparatively unfamiliar with how the new taxation system operates; for example, the calculation method for the new value-added system, the new ways of tax collection and management, and the management of receipts. Therefore, the most important thing at the present time is to study and really understand the basic spirit of tax reform and make great efforts to grasp its specific contents. Moreover, it is necessary to enable vast numbers of staff and workers to understand and grasp the following points: -- On the whole, the current tax reform does not increase the tax burden on enterprises. Tax reform has a direct bearing on the interests of vast numbers of enterprises and staff and workers. The tax reform plan embodies the principle of not increasing the tax burden on enterprises, as has been repeatedly stressed by leading comrades of the State Council. According to the data of a general survey by the Ministry of Finance, the average tax-sharing rate of industrial enterprises is basically the same before and after reform. The results of a preliminary survey of 282 industrial products across the country show that 73 of them have their taxes increased, or 26 percent, and 209 of them have their taxes lowered, or 74 percent. This shows that most trades' and enterprises' tax burdens will not be increased following tax reform. Of course, enterprises and their products differ greatly, the current tax categories and tax rates are numerous, and deductions and preferential policies differ. After a change to the new tax system, the increase or decrease of taxes on every enterprise differs completely. But the tax increases in some areas can be alleviated through mutual regulation. For example, in the case of commodity circulation, it is predicted from the data of a general survey by the Ministry of Finance that after the tax reform, wholesale enterprises will have their taxes increased by a 0.44 percentage points, while retail enterprises will have their taxes lowered by 2.5 percentage points. Although wholesale enterprises' taxes have been increased, due to the retail trade's tax decreases, the final retail prices which are directly shouldered by consumers should not fluctuate greatly as a result of tax reform. Moreover, it can promote the integration of production, wholesaling, and retailing. All in all, since the circulating tax burden has not increased, retail enterprises should not thus increase prices. Industrial and commercial enterprises should look back at themselves, make the best use of the policies adopted for them as well as the measures intended to lighten their burdens, strengthen management, and lower costs. They should never increase prices in such a way as to increase consumers' burdens as a result of tax reform. -- To smoothly put into practice the tax reform plan, the state has also adopted some policies to lighten the tax burden on enterprises. It has simplified and merged the enterprise income taxes, lowered the rate rates, and lowered the nominal income tax rates for state-owned large and medium enterprises from 55 percent to 33 percent, and canceled state-owned enterprises' regulatory tax; exempted the fund for energy, communications, and key construction projects and the budget readjustment fund (called the "two funds" for short), which account for 25 percent of the after-tax profits retained by enterprises, which has had to be turned over to the state previously, and which is now retained by enterprises. The after-tax profits of old state-owned enterprises are not to be turned over to the state in the near future and are retained by enterprises for their use. For enterprises making low profits, we adopt such measures as levying for two years two grades of transition tax ranging from 27 percent and 18 percent. All these measures are intended to lighten enterprises' tax burdens. Enterprises should make the best of the above policies, enhance their stamina for future development, and improve their competitiveness on the market. -- We will use the method of differentiating new and old loans and measures to lighten enterprises' burdens and enhance their ability to repay the loans. At present, most enterprises are worried about the question of how they are going to repay loans after tax reform. We should say that through measures of lightening enterprises' burden, enterprises' ability to repay loans will be enhanced. However, considering the present situation of enterprises, the state has formulated two different repayment methods for old and new loans. Enterprises making good profits can have their ability to repay loans enhanced by counting depreciation and long-term interest as costs. As for enterprises shouldering a comparatively heavy debt burden which has been left over from the past, the state is studying and formulating some transitional measures to gradually clear the irrational debts incurred for external reasons. III. Smooth the Transition and Changeover From the New Taxation System to the New One and Ensure the Smooth Implementation of the New Taxation System A. It is necessary to smooth the transition from the contracted responsibility system to a unified tax system. Of our industrial enterprises, 80 percent practice the contract management responsibility system. This form of management was a invention by vast numbers of enterprises and staff and workers in the course of implementing reform. It has played an important role in bringing into play the initiative of enterprises and staff and workers and in developing productive forces. The introduction of the new tax reform has radically changed the foundation on which the contract responsibility rests, because after the taxation system is reformed and after the tax division system is practiced, the value-added tax, which will become the largest tax category and which is shared both by the central and local authorities, is collected by the State General Administration of Taxation. Therefore, it will no longer be practical to continue with the contract responsibility system on a large scale. Moreover, since the cost structure has changed following the implementation of the "two sets of regulations," the book profits of enterprises have decreased by a comparatively large margin and many enterprises have no profit target to overfulfill or to contract on. All this reflects that the nonstandardized distribution relationships cannot meet the needs of the market economy. Faced with this situation, we must further explore ideas for reform and should not merely find the way out by readjusting the distribution relationships between the state and enterprises, but should actively explore new ways of invigorating enterprises. We should change from the contracted responsibility system to a unified tax system on our own initiative. To guarantee the transition from the contracted responsibility system to a unified taxation system, the state has adopted a special policy for those contracting enterprises that have obtained the approval of the State Council or the provincial people's government to contract on overall input and output before the "No. Six Document of 1993" was issued. According to the policy, for a transitional period of two years, localities will be assigned taxes first and then reimbursed. These enterprises should make the best use of the policies in the last two years of the Eighth Five-Year Plan, attach great importance to technological transformation, conscientiously strengthen their stamina, greatly replenish their own circulating funds, and enhance their rejuvenating functions. Enterprises should cherish this transition period and remove the burden on their own initiative. B. Adopt flexible transitional methods in keeping with different situations. Although regional preferential taxation policies do not fully conform with the fair tax-sharing principle, considering the fact that coastal regions are the windows on China's reform and opening up, if we cancel the regional preferential taxation treatment it will affect the investment environment and will be nonconducive to their further reform and opening up. For this reason, the state has adopted transitional measures. For example, we can adopt the transitional measure of tax reimbursement [shui shou fan huan 4451 2392 6604 6703] for taxpayers in special economic zones and in coastal areas which are enjoying preferential taxation treatment. After the value-added tax is universally levied on home and foreign enterprises, we can use the method of reimbursing foreign-invested enterprises for their actual increased taxes at the end of each year, or many times in different years so as to guarantee the stability and continuity of the foreign-related taxation policy. Moreover, the State Council will use transitional methods for some special enterprises that were originally exempt from taxation. All these measures are conducive to the smooth transition from the old taxation system to the new. C. We will pay good attention to publicizing tax regulations and formulate and introduce policies related to the changeover from the old taxation system to the new so that enterprises are prepared and will dispel unnecessary misunderstandings. Practicing the new taxation system is an overall reform of the old taxation system and is an important step toward the market economy. But putting into practice the new taxation system involves many specific questions. As for the question of how to deduct taxes this year from the stocks of enterprises' raw materials and finished products that were already taxed last year, the State General Administration of Taxation has already made specific regulations regarding this and has fully considered the actual situation of enterprises, and it will not happen that enterprises bear an abnormally heavy or abnormally light tax burden. For some specific questions in some special trades, we still need to formulate specific methods. IV. Enterprises Should Adapt to the New Situation As Soon As Possible and Should Enter the Market and Participate in Fair Competition A. Change concepts and make efforts to meet the new needs of the market economy. The great reforms in finance and taxation, banking, investment, and foreign trade will cause a profound change in enterprises' external environment. Enterprises should further emancipate the mind and change concepts in the following aspects: First, it is necessary to change the idea that state-owned enterprises are units for state budgeting and are directly under governmental supervisory departments and foster the new idea that they are "taxpayers" that possess independent corporate property rights. Like all other enterprises, state-owned enterprises should operate independently, assume sole responsibility for losses and profits, be levied taxes according to the law, enter the market, and participate in fair competition. Second, it is necessary to change the traditional practice whereby the state has had too much control over state-owned enterprises, foster the new idea that the survival of the fittest is the objective law of market competition, and the idea that enterprises that make losses for a long time and that are unable to repay debts should go bankrupt according to the law. This will strengthen the sense of urgency and the sense of crisis of enterprises in striving for survival and development in the face of market competition. Third, it is necessary to change the thinking that enterprises merely demand tax reductions and profit concessions during enterprise reform and focus on changing the mechanism and bringing innovations in the enterprise system. It is necessary to strengthen enterprises' competitiveness through establishing a new enterprise system. B. Conscientiously implement the "two sets of regulations" and properly reappraise the stocks and assets of enterprises, laying the groundwork for enterprises to enter the market and compete fairly. From 1 July 1993 onward, all enterprises must implement the "two sets of regulations." In reappraising the stocks and assets of enterprises next year, we should continue to increase experimentation. These two jobs are to support the new tax reform to be introduced soon. They are, as we can say, the foundation for the new taxation system. If properly used, the 10-point policy laid down in the Ministry of Finance's "Circular on the Question of Convergence Regarding the Implementation of Enterprises' New Financial System" (Financial Work Document Number 199 of 1993) and the 10-point policy laid down in the State Council General Office's "Circular on Relevant Policies for Increasing Experimentation With the Reappraisal of the Stocks and Assets of Enterprises" (Number 29 issued by the State Council General Office in 1993), in particular, will be conducive to reappraising the property being used by legal entities and digest part of the hidden losses, laying a foundation for state-owned enterprises to lighten their historical burdens, enter the market, and participate in fair competition. C. Quicken the readjustment of the product mix and the organizational structure of enterprises. After the financial and taxation systems have been reformed, enterprises with good performance will probably have a better financing environment, while those with bad performance, especially those that have made operational losses, rather than those that incurred losses as a result of policy, can no longer survive on subsidies. We will probably make substantial progress in the structural readjustment, which we have stressed for many years, under the conditions of market economy. At present, we are preparing to call the National Work Conference on Structural Readjustment in the first quarter of 1994 and plan to take a larger step in the following three areas: First, support state-owned large and medium enterprises that are really strong in developing large, transregional, and intertrade enterprise groups whose major link is property rights, and bring into play their role in promoting structural readjustment, improving the scale merit, quickening the development of new technologies and new products, and strengthening international competitiveness. Second, vigorously promote reform of the property rights of medium and small enterprises, invigorate the stocks of state-owned assets, and shift them to profit-making industries through a variety of forms including contracting, leasing, selling, and mergers. Enterprises that are making great losses and are insolvent at the due date should resolutely be forced to go bankrupt. Third, gradually settle the question that enterprises look after almost all matters in society. Large and medium state-owned enterprises should gradually withdraw from the function of doing social service, change to tertiary industry, and gradually sever relations with their original enterprises. D. Change the management mechanism of state-owned enterprises and positively and steadily introduce a modern enterprise system: Establishing a modern enterprise system is the direction for the reform of China's state-owned enterprises. We must change the administrative subordination of state-owned enterprises to the state to the relationship whereby they are linked by assets, establish a mechanism within enterprises by which the owners, managers, and staff and workers check and restrict one other, settling the question of the inseparable functions of government and the enterprise once and for all. At present, we should mainly implement the Regulations on Changing the Management Mechanism and the Regulation on Supervision which is to be introduced soon, and quicken the change of the management mechanism of state-owned enterprises. The Regulations on Changing the Management Mechanism are the cornerstone for establishing socialist market economy. We must ensure that the powers and responsibilities conferred by the Regulations on Changing the Management Mechanism are 100 percent delegated, laying the groundwork for establishing a modern enterprise system. The Fifth Session of the Eighth NPC approved China's first Company Law, which is a big event in China's economic life. It is the legal basis for us to establish a modern enterprise system in a planned way and systematically and to reorganize state-owned enterprises to the corporate system. We must quicken the change of the management mechanism and the establishment of the corporate system in line with the spirit of the decision and the provisions of the Company Law so as to enable enterprises to become the main body in market competition and to bring out their new vitality and vigor in a competitive environment where tax is shared fairly.
