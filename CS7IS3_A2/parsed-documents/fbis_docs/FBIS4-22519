FBIS4-22519 "jpusr038___94048" FBIS-USR-94-038 JPRS FBIS Report: Central Eurasia 1 April 1994 RUSSIA ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL AFFAIRS FCS Considers Terrorist Threat to AES's FCS Considers Terrorist Threat to AES's PM0104113394 Moscow IZVESTIYA in Russian 1 Apr 94 p 2 PM0104113394 Moscow IZVESTIYA Russian BFN [Igor Andreyev article: "If Terrorists Capture an AES, There Will Be No One To Liberate It"] [Text] The collegium of the Federal Counterintelligence Service [FCS] (which, we would remind you, was set up last December to replace the abolished Ministry of Security) devoted its first session specifically to the security of Russia's strategic installations. Among other things the problem of nuclear electric power stations [AES's] was vociferously discussed in some alarm since the FCS thinks that they may fall prey to criminal, terrorist encroachments. In the opinion of Colonel Leonid Semenov, a leading FCS expert and head of a Strategic Installations Directorate section, the first symptoms of trouble with crime at AES's appeared in the eighties. As was said at the time, "offices" received letters from personnel at the Kursk and Novovoronezh AES's and some AES's on Ukrainian territory. For all their differences, the messages boiled down to one thing: If you don't solve my problems (housing, and so on), I will not spare myself, I will blow an AES to kingdom come. Inspection of the "complaints," Semenov said, showed that the writers were suffering from psychological disorders. The FCS believes that, since the early nineties, the socioeconomic preconditions for attacks on AES's have been compounded by political ones. According to the latest figures, which have not however been confirmed by documentation, extremists from the Ararat Valley made threats against the Armenian AES, while the most rabid separatists in Chechnya seem to have threatened the Balakovo and Kursk AES's. The Lubyanka believes that both groups saw the AES's as a potential means of putting political pressure on the Union and Russian authorities. In Col. Semenov's view, there is an equal danger from arbitrary actions by AES personnel trying to get the government to resolve various social problems. Like, for instance, the hunger strike and picket of the Kursk AES this March by staffers protesting nonpayment of wages since December. In the opinion of counterintelligence personnel, extremists may exploit such situations, as well as the power generation operatives' just discontent, and events may quite possibly end up seriously out of control. Although every AES has an FCS subunit working there, whose duty is to know everything and promptly gather information about likely attacks on AES security, legal norms no longer make provision for rigorous scrutiny of job applicants. Surprisingly enough, candidates for jobs as nuclear power generation personnel do not take a mental fitness test and are not vetted, as is the case throughout the civilized world, for reliability -- at least in human, civic terms. The once tightly sealed 30-km zone around AES's has long been open to all comers. Today anyone, including criminals, can come and register or even live here without a stamp in their passport. There are no legal grounds for refusing people work at an AES, nor are there grounds for getting rid of extremists working at a power unit's control panel. The Law on Atomic Energy, the draft of which, according to Leonid Semenov, enshrines "cadre" norms, is one of those that legislators have failed to adopt since 1987. So, imagine the worst case scenario: The reasonable organizers lose control of some quite peaceful demonstrations at an AES, and determined people, ready for anything, fishing in troubled waters, become the masters of the situation. Or some outside terrorists take crack AES staff hostage, keep them in their sights to get through the guards, and dictate terms to the government: Immediate sovereignty for the Verkhnevzdyblenskaya [imaginary name, akin to Ruritania] Republic]. Earlier, even a couple of months ago, the country had the now-notorious "Vympel" to cope with that eventuality, whose superfighters were used at AES's since 1987. Each of them knew all the AES's like their own home and during exercises got through the seemingly impenetrable utilities' layouts to reach the power unit, a feat that amazed even AES specialists. Thanks to the exercises, incidentally, the AES guard system was perfected; they are guarded by Internal Troops and this system has been tightened up year after year. "Vympel" no longer exists now -- it has been transferred to the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] and effectively devastated. The FCS is hoping to re-create something similar, but these unique skills take years to cultivate and who can say that the crack detachment's combat experience and knowledge will not be needed today or tomorrow? I got the feeling from my talk with Col. Semenov that the problem is not just one of a fighting force, capable of combating "nuclear" terrorism. For good or ill, no one in the past doubted the special services' right (and qualifications) to play the prime role in an emergency. That is, the forces assembled by various departments in a "hot spot" to counter a serious danger always had a natural, universally recognized hierarchy to guarantee unified command of an operation. No one muscled in, everyone knew their place, their rights, and duties. Regrettably, last December's action against the terrorists spilling dollars over Dagestan showed that there was no sign of the former unified command, since the presidential edict winding up the Russian Ministry of Security erupted precisely 21 December. My interlocutor in the FCS once again sees the Law on Atomic Energy, which has thus far not been adopted, as the solution to this power struggle. According to him, this law clearly sets out the rights and duties of each of the departments that oversees nuclear power generation. There has not yet been a tragedy, there is time, but the price of delay may be far more terrible than Chernobyl, which, as you know, blew up without any malicious intent on the part of those who caused the catastrophe.
