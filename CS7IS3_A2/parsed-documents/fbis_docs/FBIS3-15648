This statement will undoubtedly win you more votes in the elections. However, people that have even a slight idea about professionalism would laugh at this, saying that having looked for Polubotok's gold in England [reference to claims that Ukraine should try to recover the money once deposited by a Ukrainian nobleman in a British bank]; now we will wait to receive $18 billion from Switzerland. Where is your list? Where are the facts and documents acknowledged by foreign financial bodies and governments that can help recover at least one "dirty" dollar? [Omelchenko] Let me explain something. The mass media carried not very precise reports about the news conferences on the results of the international seminar on fighting the spread of money laundering, held in Kiev on 15-17 December 1993. Speaking at that news conference, I pointed out that foreign media had cited experts and written about $15 or even $18 billion belonging to Ukrainian citizens, commercial, and state structures and deposited in Western banks. According to our experts, that figure is exaggerated and the actual sum is $7 to $8 billion. What makes us think so? Let me cite some figures. In 1992, some 1,500 licenses were issued in Ukraine for exporting various products and raw materials. Not taking into account barter operations, those products were worth more than $5 billion. However, the hard currency fund of Ukraine received only $97.7 million. In the first half of 1993, more than $4 billion worth of products and raw materials were shipped out of Ukraine, while the budget received only a little more than $100 million. By summing up these figures we can deduce the volume of foreign deposits. I spoke about this at the news conference. Given that almost two-thirds of Ukraine's hard currency is being kept in Swiss banks, I have asked the chief of the Swiss Federal Ministry of Justice Criminal Department a couple of questions. The questions concerned the possible ways to carry out an investigation of the legality of Ukrainian citizens' currency operations. In particular, I wanted to know whether Switzerland would answer our official legal motion to provide information about concrete Ukrainian deposit-holders suspected of violations of the law. With regard to recovering the "dirty dollars," our "Godfathers" have nothing to worry about. The laws of the Swiss "bank empire" are very liberal for people like them. Remember that even after the International Court in the Hague confirmed the validity of Philippine claims on the $20 billion embezzled by former dictator Marcos, the money remained in Switzerland. However this does not mean that Ukraine should hold off on ratifying the Council of Europe convention on the laundering of money, and the search, arrest, and confiscation of illegally acquired profits. Since 1992, the Ukrainian Secret Service leadership has repeatedly requested that the Supreme Council discuss this issue. [passage omitted]
