Wu Bangguo, secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, said that government offices located in The Bund have begun moving out. The office building of the municipal government will be leased out through bidding, said Wu, who is here attending the annual session of the National People's Congress. He invited overseas investors and bankers to tender bids. According to Mayor Huang Ju, all the proceeds from the bidding will be used for local infrastructure construction. In the 1930s, Shanghai served as a financial center in the Asia-Pacific region. Then some 130 high-rises housed in The Bund major Chinese and foreign banks and consortiums. Now, government departments concentrate in The Bund. The building of the municipal government used to house the head office of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. A new company has been set up in Shanghai to handle matters related to moving and bidding. Though the offer for leasing the municipal government building will exceed 100 million U.S. dollars, a number of investors have expressed their interest. The new site of the municipal government building will be in the People's Square in downtown Shanghai. The Municipal Bureau of the Space Industry moved out of The Bund in December, earlier than any other government agencies. The bureau's building now serves as the site of the National Foreign Exchange Trading Center. Shanghai now has 30 branches of foreign-funded banks. Last week the Citibank of the United States moved its Asian head office from Hong Kong to Shanghai.
