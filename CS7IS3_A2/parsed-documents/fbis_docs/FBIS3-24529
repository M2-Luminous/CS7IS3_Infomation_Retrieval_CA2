Transformation of E. coli with plasmid pMAL-C bearing the mst-1 gene yielded approximately 40 mg of recombinant metastasin from 5 g of wet cells. The recombinant product was longer than the native peptide by an additional 13 amino acid residues on the N-terminal end. However, its ability to bind calcium ions was not affected. Thus, the tertiary structure of the recombinant metastasin appears to differ little from the native protein and should be suitable for biological investigations, including the generation of poly- and monoclonal antibodies.
