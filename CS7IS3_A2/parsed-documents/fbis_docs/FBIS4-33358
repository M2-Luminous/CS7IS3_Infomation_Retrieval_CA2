The proposal for this donation was made by the Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI] deputies, and it was immediately backed by the legislators of the Party of the Democratic Revolution [PRD]. Regarding this cooperation, deputy Rodolfo Becerril Straffon said "it is of a symbolic nature, regardless of how much is collected" and "it implies Mexican congressional solidarity with the Cuban people." In yesterday's session, the PRD bench denounced the fact that a former president of the National Association of the Processing Industry, Vicente Gutierrez Camposeco, is probably trying to secure votes illegally, and for this reason the General Council of the Federal Electoral Institute has been asked to carry out an investigation "to establish where its financial resources come from and whether such financing represents an electoral crime." Deputy Jesus Martin del Campo said Gutierrez Camposeco sent a personal letter to businessmen urging them to bury their "political paralysis" and encourage their workers to vote "to avoid postelection conflicts." Gutierrez also sent the businessmen a biographical sketch of PRI presidential candidate Ernesto Zedillo. Regarding President Salinas' visit request, the PRD bench said it agrees with the trip, but Deputy Martha Maldonado Zepeda made the following observation: "We believe it is necessary for the Mexican Government to change the ritual practiced by four administrations: a presidential visit to Cuba at the end of the six-year-term in office, when it cannot have any domestic weight and is a mere formality." The PRD bench proposed that Salinas should discuss the need to fully reincorporate Cuba into the inter-American system as befits the new dynamics of international relations at the Fourth Ibero-American Summit to take place in Colombia." Maldonado also said that "our solidarity must be expressed with specific and congruent actions, regardless of how small they might look." Deputy Maldonado noted that not permitting Cuba's integration to the San Jose Pact does not contribute to strengthening a modern international relations framework. The authorization granted by the Chamber of Deputies allows the chief of state to be absent from the country, as of 10 June, for five days. It has been reported that in Cuba, Salinas will meet with Fidel Castro and, in Colombia, he will participate in the Fourth Ibero-American Summit where the issues of trade and integration as elements for development in the continent will be analyzed. Regarding the presidential trip, the first to take the floor was Popular Socialist Party [PPS] Deputy Martin Tavira Uriostegui who referred to the recent visit of U.S. Congressman Roberto Torricelli to Mexico. He said: "In a cynical fashion, Mr. Torricelli is demanding that the Mexican people junk their nationalistic spirit, which is the result of lengthy battles for liberty and independence. He has come here to see what benefits he can derive from the country at a moment when we face some political problems, problems that only we can resolve, with sovereignty and nationalism." In expressing the PPS' support for the presidential trip, Tavira said Salinas' visits are to promote economic, scientific, technological, and cultural integration with Cuba and Colombia. In responding to the PRD comment, Deputy Becerril said Salinas' trip to Cuba "is not a ritual, it is a demonstration of congruence with and allegiance and fidelity to foreign policy principles and norms that have for many years prevailed in Mexico's foreign policy."
