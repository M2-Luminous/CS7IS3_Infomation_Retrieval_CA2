FBIS4-31284 "dreeu110_k_94004" FBIS-EEU-94-110 Daily Report 7 Jun 1994 CROATIA Krajina Leader on Talks Krajina Leader on Talks LD0706222094 Belgrade TANJUG in English 2205 GMT 7 Jun 94 LD0706222094 Belgrade TANJUG English BFN [Text] Knin, June 7 (TANJUG) -- Prime minister of the republic of Serb Krajina Borislav Mikelic on Tuesday [7 June] assessed as positive the talks with a United States (U.S.) non-government delegation and said he was confident that its members would leave with quite different opinions about the Serb people of Krajina than they had as a result of the anti-Serb proganda abroad before their arrival. Mikelic met with the U.S. delegation in Krajina's political center of Knin on Tuesday. The delegation included many prominent former U.S. ambassadors to the United Nations, influential diplomats and representatives of the U.S. mass media, headed by the editor-in-chief of Time magazine. Mikelic and national security advisor to the Krajina president General Mile Novakovic informed the visitors about the current political situation in Serb-Croat relations and about the genesis of the armed conflicts in the territory of former Yugoslavia. The purpose of this visit was to review the realization of the ceasefire agreement with Croatia and the withdrawal of forces, and the conditions, efficiency and type of work done by the members of the United Nations peace force in the field. The republic of Serb Krajina was formed in 1991 in Serb-populated parts of former Croatia in answer to Croatia's secession from former Yugoslavia and attempts to reduce the Serb people to a national minority. Since March 1992, Krajina has been a U.N.-protected area, which however, did not prevent Croatia from attacking the area on four occasions, razing some twenty Serb villages and killing more than a thousand civilians. The agreement on a ceasefire and separation of forces, which was signed by Krajina and Croatia at the Russian Embassy in Zagreb in late March, became effective on April 4.
