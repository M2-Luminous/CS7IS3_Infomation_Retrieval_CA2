It is developed on the basis of the so-called red mercury. British television has every right to select films for screening and advertise the show, but it would not be wrong to familiarize the film-makers and viewers with what Russian specialists and scientists think about it all. ``It is impossible to create a neutron bomb on the basis of red mercury,'' Professor Sergey Yakimov, deputy director of the Kurchatov Institute, said in an interview with ITAR-TASS. Commenting on Western media reports alleging that Russian scientists have made a new discovery, Professor Yakimov said ``this does not correspond to reality, for one simple reason: Red mercury does not and cannot exist in nature. It is a cyanic acid, the formula of which can be found in school chemistry books. It has nothing to do with radioactive components and cannot be used in any branch of atomic production.'' According to Yakimov, two years ago the West was put on tenterhooks by rumors about cold thermonuclear processes, but a simple scientific verification procedure revealed it was no more than bluff. ``I have no doubt that today's sensation is in for a similar end,'' he said.
