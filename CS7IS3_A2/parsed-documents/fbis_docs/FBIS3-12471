The meeting was attended by Sa'id Kamal, the Palestinian ambassador in Cairo. Afterward, Dr. Sha'th said he gave Minister Musa a message from the Palestinian leadership to President Husni Mubarak. He said the message deals with developments following the abominable and criminal massacre committed by Israeli settlers with the support and backing of Israeli army units in the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron, developments to come in relation with this issue, and the Palestinian leadership's insistence on providing security for the Palestinian people under occupation until the Israeli withdrawal is effected according to the peace agreements. Sha'th added that it is impossible now to proceed with the negotiations with the Israelis without clear-cut and effective measures to disarm the settlers, secure international protection, and reconsider the settlement issue. He noted that this is an important issue without which it is difficult to build a real base for progress in the talks, as the Americans demand.
