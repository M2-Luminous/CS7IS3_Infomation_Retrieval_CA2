Beirut AL-ANWAR in Arabic publishes on page 1 an approximately 800-word editorial signed by Rafiq Khuri, the newspaper's chief editor, under the headline "Some Anger and Some Thinking." Contending first that "there is nothing worse than the Hebron massacre except the policies leading to it," Khuri says reaction to the killings "needs more than Rabin's 'sense of shame,' 'Arafat's 'anger,' the Security Council's 'elegies,' and the world's 'condemnation.'" He maintains: "The forces that planned and perpetrated the crime were carrying out an organized political act, not an act of revenge or 'gratuitous killing' as was said." Khuri says he believes: "What matters now is not what Rabin and 'Arafat say, but what they do. The world is awaiting not hot public reaction, but cool action behind the scenes." The writer notes that opponents of PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat and the peace process are calling for halting the negotiations and adopting armed struggle to liberate the occupied territories, while the United States, Europe, and many other concerned parties believe that the best reaction to the massacre is to speed up the peace process. Commenting on this, Khuri says: "The call for armed struggle needs different circumstances and different balances of power" and the call for accelerating the peace process "needs different American and Israeli policies." He explains: "When Israel wants to take settlements, peace, security, and share water and resources without giving up the land, then this is not a solution. And when Washington plays the role of a spectator at negotiations between a strong side and a weak side, then this is not a just and comprehensive settlement." Khuri concludes: "The problem has two sides: While war has no horizon, the road to peace is long, very difficult, and planted with massacres and dangerous policies. What is required is an aggressive U.S. position and some Arab anger and thinking." In an approximately 500-word front page editorial in the Beirut paper AL-NAHAR in Arabic entitled "The Big Question," Chief Editor Ghassan Tuwayni describes the Hebron killings as "the second Dayr Yasin" [a Palestinian village that witnessed killings in 1947]. The paper poses its "big question:" "Does the Israeli mentality accept peace with others, Muslims or non Muslims, Arabs or non Arabs, or Palestinians or non Palestinians?" Referring to talk of peace and normal relations with Israel, the paper asks: "What kind of normalization do they want if the Israeli Government, no matter how strong, remains unable--assuming it wants to do something--to confront the madness of instinctive killing?" Continuing to cast doubt on the possibility of peace with Israel, the paper asks whether the massacre means there is only room for terrorism and fundamentalism in Israel and whether the only dialogue with Israel is that of extremism, hatred, killing, and terrorism. Beirut AL-SAFIR in Arabic publishes on page 1 an approximately 1,000-word article by chief editor Talal Salman headlined "Palestine Has No Reference Other Than Its Blood." Salman laments that Palestine and its people are left alone to face the "Israeli ghoul." He notes that the world dealt with the massacre as "a security incident" in Israel concerning only the Israeli Government. Salman criticizes the "impotent" Palestinian leadership and says peace with Israel is only an illusion: "Israel is Israel, Palestine is Palestine, and the divide between them is the edge of the sword. The spilled blood washes away the barriers and drowns the illusions of an impossible settlement between the executioner and the victim." Salman maintains that the Israeli Government, army, settlers, and people are one and the same thing. He concludes: "Israel is Israel. It did not change. It won't change unless we grow strong and force it to change."
