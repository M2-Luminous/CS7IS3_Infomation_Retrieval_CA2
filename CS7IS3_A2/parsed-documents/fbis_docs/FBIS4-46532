Finished Leningrad Higher Combined Arms Command School imeni S. M. Kirov, the Frunze Military Academy and the General Staff Military Academy. Served in positions from platoon commander to commander of a naval infantry division in the Black Sea and Pacific fleets. Commanded an army corps. Since September 1991 has been first deputy chief of the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense Main Cadres Training and Assignment Directorate. [End box insert] [KRASNAYA ZVEZDA] Valentin Alekseyevich, we live in a difficult time, a time of trial and error, a time of "polishing" laws and establishing young Russian statehood. Not everything is turning out for us for now as we would have liked, as was planned and as was promised the people, and above all, perhaps, in the social sphere, which fully affected people in shoulderboards... Letters and complaints come to state authorities, to the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense and to KRASNAYA ZVEZDA from servicemen and military retirees concerning a violation of their rights to privileges established by laws in force. Therefore permit me to converse with you on behalf of our readers, a portion of whose letters you familiarized yourself with the day before. Here is the most typical one. It came from Lieutenant A. Yemelyanenko, who serves in the Baltic. The officer justly complains that he is not being paid an interest-free loan and the so-called appointment allowance. Officials refer to the fact that his personal file has not arrived in the unit from his previous duty station and it is impossible to give out the money. The lieutenant concludes the letter with a question: "Why do I have to fulfill contract terms and the Ministry of Defense does not?" [Yakovlev] Naturally we could not ignore this letter. First of all we contacted the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense Main Military Budget and Finance Directorate and received appropriate explanations. In particular they clarified that an interest-free loan for initial acquisition of household goods has been paid since March 1993 in accordance with the Russian Federation Law "On the Status of Servicemen." It is paid for three years in an amount up to 13 times the base pay and allowances. As of today it is over 1.5 million, which, you will agree, is no small amount for young officers for the present difficult times, although, of course, sad blunders also occur. In addition to this, we phoned the unit where Lieutenant Yemelyanenko presently serves and learned that by this time the personal file already had arrived, about which the officer has been informed. Funds will be paid him according to the prescribed procedure. [KRASNAYA ZVEZDA] Letters from Lieutenant V. Tovmach, Senior Lieutenant S. Levkov and Major A. Dadykin contain uneasiness over the uncertainty of social guarantees to servicemen performing contract military duty. You will agree that there are questions here too, as they say... And the main one is Did we introduce contract service a little early? [Yakovlev] The organization of performance of contract military service matured long ago in the midst of our society. As of today it is a very important element in elevating Russian Federation Armed Forces combat readiness, democratizing the Army (Navy) environment, and strengthening discipline and law and order in military collectives. It is also without question that this system can operate effectively only on condition that the interested parties (a specific serviceman on the one hand and the state in the person of the Ministry of Defense on the other) comply with their commitments fixed in the corresponding contract. Unfortunately, the reality is such that the mechanism of mutual responsibility does not always operate, through the fault of both parties. Take just time periods for concluding contracts. Social guarantees are given officers for the entire transition period, which is established until 31 December 1994, but this should not at all mean that those servicemen who wish to continue military service invariably will sign an application about their desire to serve the homeland further on the last day set aside for this procedure. Circumstances force us to take many factors into account which influence this situation. First is the accounting of officers on whom one can plan for replacement, for appointment to a higher position, and for schooling. Naturally we cannot consider those who vacillate and have not determined their choice as being potential candidates. Therefore explanatory and organizational work continues vigorously--not forcible actions by commanders (supervisors) to conclude contracts with those who have not yet concluded them. Some military district commanders issued orders on this account. This also was done in particular in the Ural Military District, from which Major Dadykin's letter arrived. The deputy chief of the Ural Military District Cadres Directorate reported that a contract for performing duty under paragraph "a" for a period of 5 years already had been concluded with the officer based on his application. [KRASNAYA ZVEZDA] Valentin Alekseyevich, there are many letters in which officers are perplexed as to why the Ministry of Defense permits them to conclude contracts only under paragraph "a," although other forms of contracts had been proclaimed at one time. Air Force Captain A. Andryushkin from Pskov Oblast, Captain A. Kochetkov from Maritime Kray and many others ask about this. [Yakovlev] The decision on having officers conclude contracts only under paragraph "a," part 1, Article 33 of the Russian Federation Law was made by the Russian Federation Minister of Defense based on the right granted him to establish forms of contracts and the procedure for concluding them (paragraph 6 of Russian Federation Supreme Soviet Decree No 4983-1 of 19 May 1993 "On Certain Measures Connected With Use of the Russian Federation Law On Military Obligation and Military Service'"). This was substantiated by the need to maintain a proper level of troop strength with the Russian Federation Armed Forces reform and a large number of officer reassignments. Officers who enter military service from the reserve can conclude contracts under paragraphs "b" and "c." [KRASNAYA ZVEZDA] We also linked great hopes for solving acute social and everyday problems with the Russian Federation Law "On the Status of Servicemen," which entered into force on 1 January 1993. I recall that entire lines of people wishing to purchase pamphlets with this and other legislative acts formed in our editorial offices. And what happened? Many provisions of this very necessary law are not in effect. Moreover, there is talk of revising the others... [Yakovlev] Let us dot the "i's." The main portion of provisions of this document, which is really very important for strengthening the Armed Forces, succeeded in being implemented immediately after it was adopted. Above all this concerns norms of pay and allowances and certain other supplementary payments. At the same time, it is impossible to disagree with servicemen's concern over further delay in putting certain rules of this law into effect (transportation privileges, payment of monetary compensation at the moment the serviceman and his family go on leave, property insurance and so on). It is the responsibility of the Russian Federation Government to develop a mechanism for implementing these privileges, but necessary government decisionmaking has dragged out unjustifiably despite the fact that the Ministry of Defense has made proposals on this score. The main reason is the extremely difficult economic situation in the country and absence of finances for implementing the Law "On the Status of Servicemen." But the law exists, and any arguments contradicting it naturally are not recognized (either in military collectives or by military courts at various levels) as sufficient for "freezing" established privileges. People ask for what is due them, but there is no possibility of satisfying their requests. Voluntarily or not, the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense ends up in the role of hostage. The situation which has formed in this area cannot last indefinitely. Unhealthy sentiments on this score are ripening in the troops (fleets). There also is open speculation in the example of some not too respectable servicemen (especially among young officer graduates of military schools), who figure on leaving the Armed Forces in this way with maximum advantage to themselves. [KRASNAYA ZVEZDA] But is any kind of solution at all seen here? [Yakovlev] Several options for solving the problem are possible theoretically. The first and most radical one is to legislatively repeal privileges which did not come about as unsupported by necessary appropriations. It is not hard to predict the consequences of such a step: exacerbation of the sociopolitical situation in military collectives. Servicemen will consider this as nothing other than fraud on the part of the state. The Armed Forces will suffer not only moral, but also military-political harm. The second way is for fastest implementation of all rules of the law without consideration of the Armed Forces' real economic capabilities. That approach outwardly is attractive, but at the existing and planned level of financing of defense expenditures it will only drive the "disease" inside the body. The Army and Navy economy simply will not bear up under this additional load. In my view, the talk today can and must be about phased implementation of the law's rules that have not yet been put into effect, with specific financing of these measures from the federal budget, and this has to be resolved at the legislative level. [KRASNAYA ZVEZDA] Military service is a special kind of state activity. A person in shoulderboards is bound by many restrictions and is largely unprotected. Higher pay and privileges are called upon to stimulate military service of officers and warrant officers and compensate for all possible material and moral costs. This is covered by laws, but it is different in real life. Officers V. Kozin and V. Raskatov of the Tambov garrison and others write that this hits the prestige of military service hard and prompts young officers to "flee" to "civilian life." How great is this outflow? [Yakovlev] Yes, servicemen's insufficient social protection and comparatively low standard of living contribute to a drop in prestige of service and to disillusionment of a considerable portion of the youth in selecting a military profession. As a result there is a drop in Armed Forces manning and a continued outflow of young officers from the Army. More have begun to be discharged both among those who are rather experienced but who have lost prospects in service and among those from 31 to 40 years of age needed in the Army and Navy. As a result, military service as a special kind of activity is not the most prestigious profession today. Let us take a civil aviation pilot and military pilot for comparison. Both experience similar mental stresses and have identically high responsibility, but the aircraft commander at Sheremetyevo-2 receives up to 3 million rubles a month, while an aircraft commander who is a major and a first class pilot with 15 years or more service receives approximately 400,000 rubles, i.e., 5-6 times less. This is just one example, but many can be found, and the comparisons will not favor servicemen. It is not surprising that competition for military educational institutions continues to fall. In 1992 it was 1.6 persons per slot and in 1993 it is already 1.4, and that is for schools providing free education in specialties that are in short supply under civilian conditions. This trend is most noticeable in Air Force and Navy military educational institutions, where competition essentially was absent in 1993. As a result the schools are forced to accept civilians who are on the borderline of professional suitability. A trend also has become apparent toward an increased number of cadets expelled immediately before signing a contract. The basic reason is lack of desire to learn and disillusionment in choice of a military profession. Over 50 percent of all cadets who have left school have been expelled from military educational institutions for these reasons. In this situation, further delay in placing into effect even a portion of privileges proclaimed by law can lead unavoidably to a final fall in prestige of military service, which will not enable manning the Army and Navy to the extent which permits keeping combat readiness at the proper level. In conclusion I will emphasize that there has to be a precisely adjusted, long-range social policy with respect to the Army. Only this will permit removing many acute questions which KRASNAYA ZVEZDA readers ask.
