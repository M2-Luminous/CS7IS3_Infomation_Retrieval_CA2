The poll, conducted by KYODO NEWS SERVICE on 100 companies which close the books for the business year ending March 31, says many corporations want to enhance corporate structure by adjusting employment amid the yen's surge and escalated price competition. Of the companies polled, 21 firms said they will reduce the number of employees even though the economy will recover, while 46 said they will maintain their current stance of scaling down the workforce for the time being, the poll said. Ricoh Co., a major office automation equipment producer, said in the poll that they will cut back their workforce because a sharp sales rise will be unlikely amid the current tendency for stable economic growth. All Nippon Airway Co. said they want to boost competition ability by streamlining management arms. During the 1993 business year, 48 companies increased the number of employees by 9,993, while 49 companies decreased 39,973 employees. For the current fiscal year, however, only two firms said they will boost their workforce, while 52 companies plan to trim the number of workers, it said. By sectors, such industries as steel, nonferrous metals, textiles, chemical, telecommunications and transportation will step up their workforce reduction plans, it said. For the reasons of scaling down employment, a majority of companies want to strengthen competition in and outside Japan against falling product prices amid the yen's surge and the global economic slowdown. They also said rising job operation efficiency needs less employees than ever before, the survey said.
