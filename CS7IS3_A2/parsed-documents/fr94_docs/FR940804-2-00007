FR940804-2-00007 FR940804-2-00005 On April 28, 1994, counsel for Shanghai Perfumery and CFTD submitted public information concerning surrogate values for factors of production for coumarin. On May 20, 1994, petitioners provided the Department with Indian prices for certain factors used in the production of coumarin, and on July 15, 1994, counsel for the remaining participating respondents submitted information regarding surrogate values. On May 13 and 19, 1994, the Department issued supplemental questionnaires to all producers and exporters in the investigation except China Tuhsu. On June 9, 1994, counsel for Shanghai Perfumery and CFTD advised the Department that it was withdrawing its representation of the companies. On May 27 and June 9, we received responses to our supplemental questionnaires from all respondents except Shanghai Perfumery, CFTD, and China Tuhsu. On June 23, 1994, Changzhou Chemical submitted minor revisions to its factors of production data. On May 27, 1994, the Department issued a questionnaire to all respondents except China Tuhsu regarding the issue of separate rates. Responses were received from Jiangsu Native, Tianjin Native, and Tianjin Chemical on June 13, 1994 (see, ``Separate Rates'' section below). On June 20, 1994, petitioners, pursuant to section 353.16 of the Department's regulations, amended the petition in this investigation to allege the existence of critical circumstances with respect to imports of coumarin from the PRC. On June 22, 1994, the Department sent letters to Jiangsu Native, Tianjin Chemicals, and Tianjin Native requesting information on volume and value of shipments of the subject merchandise to the United States. We received their responses on July 12, 1994. On July 15, 1994, we sent supplemental ``Separate Rates'' questionnaires to Jiangsu Native, Tianjin Chemicals, and Tianjin Native. Scope of Investigation The product covered by this investigation is coumarin. Coumarin is an aroma chemical with the chemical formula C 9 H 6 O 2 that is also known by other names, including 2H-1-benzopyran-2-one, 1,2-benzopyrone, cis-o-coumaric acid lactone, coumarinic anhydride, 2-Oxo-1,2-benzopyran, 5,6-benzo-alpha-pyrone, ortho-hydroxyc innamic acid lactone, cis-ortho-coumaric acid anhydride, and tonka bean camphor. All forms and variations of coumarin are included within the scope of the investigation, such as coumarin in crystal, flake, or powder form, and ``crude'' or unrefined coumarin ( i.e. prior to purification or crystallization). Excluded from the scope are ethylcoumarins (C 11 H 10 O 2 ) and methylcoumarins (C 10 H 8 O 2 ). Coumarin is classifiable under subheading 2932.21.0000 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS). Although the HTSUS subheading is provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this investigation is dispositive. Period of Investigation The period of investigation (POI) is July 1, 1993, through December 31, 1993. Separate Rates Jiangsu Native, Tianjin Chemicals, and Tianjin Native have each requested a separate, company-specific rate. Their respective business licenses each indicate that they are owned ``by all the people.'' As stated in the Final Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value: Silicon Carbide from the People's Republic of China (59 FR 22585, 22586, May 2, 1994) (``Silicon Carbide''), and the Final Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value: Sebacic Acid from the People's Republic of China (59 FR 28053, May 31, 1994 (``Sebacic Acid''), ``ownership of a company by all the people does not require the application of a single rate.'' Accordingly, these three respondents are eligible for consideration for separate rates. To establish whether a firm is sufficiently independent to be entitled to a separate rate, the Department analyzes each exporting entity under a test arising out of the Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Sparklers from the People's Republic of China (56 FR 20588, May 6, 1991) (``Sparklers'') and amplified in Silicon Carbide. Under the separate rates criteria, the Department assigns separate rates only where respondents can demonstrate the absence of both de jure and de facto governmental control over export activities.
