'Arafat was met at Oslo's Fornebu airport by Foreign Ministry advisors Terje Rod Larsen and Mona Juul and Norwegian PLO representative Omar Kitmitto. He was sombre on his arrival. "I have come to say good-bye to a good friend," was his only comment upon his arrival at the SAS Scandinavia Hotel where a large gathering of Norwegian and international journalists greeted him. Holst helped broker the Palestine-Israel peace deal last year in a series of secret meetings in Norway. He died last week of a stroke at the age of 56. The PLO leader will also hold talks with Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and US Secretary of State Warren Christopher during his stay in Oslo in a bid to resolve the stalemate plaguing the Middle East peace process. Israel and the PLO have reached deadlock in their negotiations on border crossings between the Gaza Strip and Egypt and between Jericho and Jordan. They also disagree on the size of the proposed autonomous city of Jericho. On Friday evening 'Arafat was due to meet with Peres who arrived earlier in the day. No talks are planned for Saturday as Peres must respect the Sabbath and not work. Christopher was also expected to arrive in Oslo late Friday.
