The Belgian UN troops, who are taking about 15 armored vehicles with them, are expected to arrive in Central Bosnia next Tuesday, Belgian military sources revealed on Sunday. The decision to send Belgian troops to Bosnia follows a call for more troops from British General Michael Rose, the commander of the UN troops in Bosnia, who had requested reinforcements following the conclusion of a peace agreement between the Muslims and Croats there. No final decision has yet been made on where the Belgian troops will be stationed. The front between Muslim and Croatian troops is 350 km long. An advance party of Belgian soldiers already left the Baranja region on Saturday, and is due to arrive Monday in Bosnian Santici in order to reconnoiter. Shortly afterwards a decision will be made as to where the Belgian troops will be stationed.
