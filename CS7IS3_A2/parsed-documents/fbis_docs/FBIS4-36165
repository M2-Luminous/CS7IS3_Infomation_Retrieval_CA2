They discussed many issues about the Yemeni homeland and safeguarding its unity. They also considered developments in the national arena in light of the war ignited in the homeland by both the secessionist gang and the rebellion and in view of the declaration of secession made by the traitor and agent al-Bid, and also in light of issuing UN Security Council Resolution 924 on the situation in Yemen, and in view of the final statement issued by the meetings of the foreign ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council on the situation in our country, in addition to the speech delivered by Saudi Foreign Minister Sa'ud al-Faysal on Yemen. The brother chairman indicated the importance of this meeting which groups the political parties and organizations in the national arena, so they can responsibly rise to national duty in terms of confronting the schemes hostile to unity. He said: We are meeting under the extremely important and crucial circumstances through which the Yemeni homeland is passing. This homeland is now experiencing severe regrettable events fabricated by the rebellious secessionists in order to involve the homeland's sons in fighting and implement their secessionist scheme. The brother chairman reviewed the scenario and aspects of the destructive secessionist plan that have brought the homeland to the point it is at. He also pointed to the fact that this gang stockpiled weapons, vehicles, and military hardware, fabricated crises in the homeland, and ultimately exploded the situation militarily and caused fighting between the homeland's sons and their Armed Forces in Abyan and later in Harf Sufyan, Shabwah, 'Imran, Dhamar, and Aden in addition to this gang's suspect moves abroad in order to evoke others' hostility to both Yemen and its unity. The brother chairman asserted that this criminal secessionist gang in the [Yemeni] Socialist Party [YSP] leadership plotted against the YSP itself and against unity. He explained the concessions and sacrifices offered to prevent this gang from implementing its conspiracy against the homeland and unity. This gang either sought to unilaterally rule Yemen or fragment the homeland and reinstate the partition to achieve its own narrow interests, he added. The brother chairman said: We sought dialogue and its continuation in order to keep the homeland away from war. This gang, however, continued to implement its criminal scheme by igniting war and imposing it on the homeland in order to shatter unity. We were thus forced into defending the homeland and confronting the scheme designed to fragment it. The brother president explained that the Yemeni unity was realized through peaceful and democratic means, and was not imposed by force. He said this unity is an expression of the free will of the Yemeni people, demonstrated in the referendum on the Republic of Yemen's Constitution and the elections of 27 April 1993, and the setting up of constitutional establishments. The Yemeni people have always been one people who stick to their unity, and they will not relinquish it because they are aware of the consequences of separation, and they have paid a high price during past divisive conflicts. He added that the secessionist and rebellious gang dreamt of restoring its dictatorial and totalitarian rule. It does not accept democracy or participation with others, and it does tolerate different opinions. Therefore, it sought to circumvent democracy and the results of the legitimate and constitutional elections. The brother Presidential Council chairman emphasized that the Republic of Yemen's policy is that of democracy and political pluralism, freedom of the press, respect of human rights, and building of modern civilian establishments, free economy, and social justice. He said this policy will not be relinquished, and will continue to be the choice to which we will adhere to embody the aspirations for building a new Yemen, the pillars of which we laid down on 22 May 1990, and there will never be a return to the totalitarian separatist system. The brother Presidential Council chairman urged leaders of parties and political organizations to close national ranks, and form a broad national front in which efforts are mobilized to confront the challenges imposed on the homeland, its unity, and sovereignty. He said building and protecting the homeland is everyones responsibility, and that we should unite and rise above all differences and sensitivities of the past in order to keep the dangers away from the homeland and safeguard its unity, and support all nationalist constants. The brother president expressed appreciation for the nationalist and responsible position of the political parties and organizations, unions, popular organizations, and all political and social figures in the national arena for confronting the secessionist plan and their rejection of al-Bid's separatist proclamation, and their support in face of the elements and perpetrators of this plan. He said the challenge the Yemeni homeland faces at present is the real test of all the homeland's sons, led by political parties and organizations, in order to prove the credibility of positions and commitment to national responsibility. The brother president hailed the heroic performance of our valiant Armed Forces, the forces of unity and legitimacy, which respond to the people's will with high nationalist determination to defend unity and democracy, and safeguard the constitutional legitimacy, security, and stability in the homeland.
