As a result, the government is about to take away from physicians the task of prescribing the morphine-like substance to drug addicts. Instead, this responsibility will be placed on public authorities. This is indicated in the government's latest report on drug policy, which is expected to be published in its entirety in the near future. WEEKENDAVISEN in is possession of a draft of this report, which is a result of cooperation by the Health Ministry, the Social Welfare Ministry, and the Justice Ministry. The report paves the way for a change in the controversial methadone treatment: ``Practicing physicians have made a significant and skilled effort in methadone treatment, but it has been difficult for many physicians to continually make sure that the methadone they prescribe is taken by the addict to whom it is prescribed and delivered and that the addicts maintain contact with the social treatment system, in part due to a lack of available treatment.'' As a result, the government wants to take the following step: ``All methadone treatment, including prescription, distribution, and monitoring, will occur at special units under county supervision.'' Ole Svendsen, chairman of the Practicing Physicians Organization (PLO), does not reject the basic idea in the government's report, even though it goes against the sacred principle of a doctor's right to prescribe drugs, but he does believe it would be unwise and impractical to remove all prescribing of methadone from the practicing physician. WEEKENDAVISEN learned that there has been a softening of the government's position on methadone. The report will not be as categorical in its final form. But the main message is the same. Svendsen said, ``There will be cases in which it will be completely impossible to force drug addicts to a central unit to receive methadone. This is true of closet drug abusers who otherwise live a stable life. They would see this as being branded as addicts. But we are willing to give up drug addicts who are a heavy burden on our general practice.'' According to the government's plan, in addition to methadone, addicts will receive ``supplemental treatment opportunities, so that an individual treatment plan will be decided on in each case.'' If the goals of the report are achieved, there will be a clear change in today's drug policy. It is estimated that about 4,000 drug addicts are now undergoing methadone treatment and the great majority of them receive no other form of public help. In 70 percent of the cases, methadone maintenance is handled by practicing physicians or private clinics. Experts in the field are satisfied with the government's plan, but they say the changes will live or die by extra appropriations: ``In the vicinity of the capital alone we will need at least ten new centers for controlled methadone distribution by trained personnel who are capable of handling the medical and social aspects of treatment,'' said Peter W. Jepsen, chief physician at Copenhagen County Hospital. But there is also money to be saved, Copenhagen city medical officer Claus Lundstedt said. Expenses can be reduced considerably by bringing addicts together to these centers. In this way, the costly apothecary stage can be eliminated as a public expense. At the same time, the cost of the methadone itself will be much lower as a result of purchasing in large quantities. ``Most important, the change will mean that the methadone ends up in the right stomaches,'' Lundstedt said. Misuse of doctor-prescribed methadone has had a fatal outcome for a growing number of addicts. Methadone is involved in just under a third of all deaths among drug addicts. The report on drugs also promises changes at harshly criticized private clinics in Copenhagen that are run primarily by younger physicians. Even many physicians have criticized these clinics, where drug addicts pay 250 to 500 kroner per month in the form of membership fees. Health Minister Torben Lund (Social Democrat) has said he personally believes that there will be a ``need for additional efforts and capacity in the area of treatment.'' He has not stated, however, whether counties with responsibility for drug treatment will also be given additional funds.
