FBIS4-60511 "drnes102dd_94012" FBIS-NES-94-102 Daily Report 25 May 1994 Palestinian Affairs Al-Quds Radio Says Israel Jamming Operating Waves Al-Quds Radio Says Israel Jamming Operating Waves JN2505174194 (Clandestine) Al-Quds Palestinian Arab Radio in Arabic 1630 GMT 25 May 94 JN2505174194 (Clandestine) Al-Quds Palestinian Arab Radio Arabic BFN [Text] Brothers: Our national newspapers have published a report that al-Quds Palestinian Arab radio in Arabic on the path of liberating land and man is jamming the enemy radio's Arabic broadcasts. To clarify matters, the Technical Division of al-Quds Radio wishes to explain the following: 1. General Rabin used to jam al-Quds Radio. He has designated several radio stations to jam most of our operating waves. Our masses in the homeland and the diaspora have been aware of this fact since the beginning of our transmission. 2. To face the enemy's jamming of al-Quds Radio, we are obliged to change our frequencies from time to time, particularly those on the medium waves. 3. Whenever the enemy increases its jamming of al-Quds Radio, especially during signing ceremonies of treacherous and humiliating agreements, to prevent our voice from reaching our people's masses, we change our main medium wave and choose a frequency that is close to that of the enemy's radio so that jamming will also affect the enemy's radio. 4. Edmond Sehayek, head of the Zionist enemy Radio's Arabic Department, is the first to know about the jamming his equipment is carrying out against al-Quds Radio, the Palestinian Arab Radio on the path of liberating land and man. Edmond Sehayek, head of the Zionist enemy Radio's Arabic Department, whose radio usually changes facts, uses equipment to jam our radio, contrary to his published allegations. At the same time, he keeps silent over Rabin's decision to continue jamming of al-Quds Radio because he knows that al-Quds Radio is the radio of the Palestinian masses in the homeland and the diaspora and the radio of those who have no voice and who fear that its voice will reach people. Therefore Sehayek jams our operating frequencies. [Signed] The Technical Division of al-Quds Radio
