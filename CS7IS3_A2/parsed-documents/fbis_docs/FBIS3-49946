Good evening, let us hear your assessment of the course of negotiations today? [Izetbegovic] Good evening, I wish you all the best. According to the information that I have, the city [of Sarajevo] seems to be somewhat peaceful today. I am glad to hear that, you need some rest from that shelling. We have had two very tempestuous days, two hard days. I could say that the talks here, the first round of talks ended in a draw, to use a chess expression. I am personally pleased with what we here today, I cannot say achieved, but I am pleased with the outcome of this round of talks. We reiterated our demands for the return of territories, we said that we do not wish just any kind of peace, that we want a just peace. However, the Serb side was not ready to offer any concessions. There was a proposal to let a series of questions remain open and be handed over to an arbitration commission which would work on their resolution for one to two years. However, we did not accept that. The open questions referred to the issues of Visegrad, Zvornik, Rogatica, Brcko, Sanski Most, Bosanski Novi, and so on. We did not accept that. We said that we could not allow these questions to remain open, they have to be resolved; otherwise the conference would be considered unsuccessful and would go back to the beginning, back to the UN Security Council. This was our stance, and consequently this proposal on the arbitration was rejected. In order to salvage this peace process, the co-chairmen put forward a proposal that in the meantime the fronts should quieten down, hot-lines be introduced and talks be resumed on 10 February. We believe that the talks, the peace process, should not be extinguished. Its extinguishing would not be in the interest of Bosnia-Herzegovina and our people. We ought to continue with further negotiations. Of course, we are not restricted in any sense, we are not going to accept a rotten compromise to the detriment of Bosnia- Herzegovina. This is approximately our stance. [Mufid Memija, Sarajevo radio-television editor] How do you perceive the agreement between Serbia and Croatia in view of the general course of the Geneva negotiations? [Izetbegovic] Serbia and Croatia had their own agreements parallel to these talks. They reportedly made some progress in this respect, they agreed on the opening of missions. Some tend to see this as the first step toward recognition. I, personally, do not see things that way, that is not what it was all about. I believe that mutual recognition is still a rather remote prospect. However, regarding our own problem, I would like to say that some headway has been made. This might not only be a modest achievement, we will see later on. The Serb side agreed to UN administration of Sarajevo over the next two-year period -- something it had persistently rejected or made conditional in the past. This was accepted unconditionally this time -- we consider this to be progress. This is a point we scored in this competition. This is the best solution for Sarajevo at this moment. It would bring about the lifting of the blockade of Sarajevo, the removal of the [Serb] artillery and an end to the shelling, as well as to a certain kind of opening of the city. This would not be a real opening of the city, but it would certainly be a new situation that would enable us to find the best solution within this two-year period in conformity with the aspirations of Sarajevo's citizens. This was a result we scored in these talks. [Rajkovic] But Mr. President, let us talk about the negotiations in global terms. [Izetbegovic] Of course, as they would say in politics, and this applies to the negative aspects of the negotiating process, nothing has been agreed if everything has not been agreed [as heard]. Therefore, this is only one of many elements making up the mosaic of some future agreement. Such a solution would be acceptable if an agreement is signed. This was one of our demands, something we insisted on in order to avoid the division of the city and find a solution in a more normal kind of atmosphere and give maximum prominence to what the citizens of Sarajevo want for their city and its future. [Rajkovic] We have learned that you were invited to visit Brussels tomorrow. [Izetbegovic] I was invited not to the European Union headquarters but to visit the NATO headquarters. I will do this tomorrow on my return from here. Unfortunately NATO Secretary General Woerner has been admitted to hospital. I will be received by his deputy, as Woerner is seriously ill. However, I will go there to hold talks in the NATO headquarters. I think it will be a useful visit even though I do not expect any (?major) results. This is something which could, as people say [words indistinct], to visit NATO and hold talks with officials in charge. [Rajkovic] After that you are going to Malaysia where Bosnia will also be discussed. [Izetbegovic] Yes, Malaysia has organized three parliamentary conferences on Bosnia-Herzegovina with international parliamentarians taking part. The intention was to make the cause of Bosnia-Herzegovina more popular, to make the world more interested in Bosnia-Herzegovina. One conference was held, as far as I remember, in Bonn, one in London and this one will take place in Malaysia. I was invited to be one of the speakers along with the Malaysian president at the two-day conference. I will probably stay there for one day. Maybe I will make a one-day visit to Indonesia and Brunei. Then I will return, in order to make my trip as short as possible. I think that this visit to Malaysia will be useful because it will be a chance to present the situation in Bosnia- Herzegovina in that part of the world in the presence of numerous parliamentarians from Europe, the United States, and of course from the Far East.
