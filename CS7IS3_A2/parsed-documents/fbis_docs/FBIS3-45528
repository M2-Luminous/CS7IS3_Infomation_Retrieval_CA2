As a Communist, Chen Wensong always bore in mind the lofty responsibility and mission on his shoulders. He said: "I am primarily a party member, then a director." His strong enterprising spirit, selfless devotion, style of being upright and honest, and his broad vision of attaching importance to solidarity and taking the overall situation into consideration were precisely the embodiment of a high-level party spirit. Chen Wensong's sterling character and fine style are in the same strain as the numerous heroes and models in our party history. As a contemporary intelligent entrepreneur, Chen Wensong had his own characteristics of the times which differed from those of past heroes and models. Facing new problems and new tests, he did not flinch and nor did he waver. He courageously met them face on and learned the art of swimming in the sea of the market economy, while improving his talent in the practice of reform and opening up. His strategic eye stood high and saw far and his superb and wise decisionmaking and managerial abilities enabled him to successfully lead the enterprise out of the valley and, furthermore, dash toward the world market, eventually joining the advanced ranks in the world shipbuilding industry. Every one of our cadres who are party members should follow the example of Chen Wensong and inherit the party's fine traditions, while continuously absorbing the rain and dew of the times to continuously renovate themselves and always stand at the forefront of the times. From a secular angle, Chen Wensong was very poor, did not have rich properties, nor had he been given the senior professional title to which he was entirely entitled and nor could he have enjoyed more warmth and happiness in his family reunion; nevertheless, from the concept of life value, he was very rich -- he possessed a cause he cherished and had undeniable successes; he had won the party's trust as well as mass support and devotion and the spiritual heritage he has left people is invaluable. Here, we should like to strongly appeal to the many Chen Wensongs striving at the forefront of economic construction: For the cause of the party and the people, for your enterprises as well as your families, please prize your own health and lives, for your health and lives do not belong to yourselves alone. We should like to strongly appeal to the various relevant leading organizations: Do please prize and do your best to protect the Chen Wensongs who are going all out to work for the party and the people with selfless devotion!
