His chairmanship had consciously oriented the FhG toward entrepreneurial goals. The FhG's mission as the link between science and industry was of growing importance. In the FhG, Germany had a successful model for breaking down barriers between its roles as a scientific country and an industrial country. The FhG was thus making a major contribution to raising the productivity of the German economy. The rapid conversion of outstanding basic research findings into products on markets was a priority aspect of research and technology policy in the Federal Republic for the coming years. A glance at the FhG's business trend gives impressive evidence of its success: The number of institutes rose from 15 in 1965 to the current figure of nearly 50. Its overall budget rose from 20 million German marks [DM] in 1965 to the current sum of nearly DM1 billion. The FhG now faces the task of consolidating and building on this business success over the coming years. This will mean raising the industrial earnings share of the FhG's overall budget above the current figure of about DM200 million. The FhG has made a considerable contribution to the creation of a unified research scene in Germany since 1989. The Federal Government welcomes the decision that the FhG Senate took on 27 October 1993 to make 16 of the total of 22 Fraunhofer institutes and regional branches in the new federal laender eligible for funding on an indefinite basis at this early date, thus safeguarding over 1,000 permanent research and development posts. The FhG facilities in the new federal laender fully lived up to the expectations placed in them in 1992. With 22 percent of earnings, they exceeded the 15 percent target assigned to them by a long chalk. The institutes scored a great success with the acquisition of project funds totaling approximately DM24 million, primarily from the Federal Government but in part from the governments of the new laender as well. Their high rate of participation in joint projects shows that these facilities are capable of holding their own against competition from their western counterparts as well. The Fraunhofer facilities' performance of DFG [German Research Association] projects and participation in special research programs in particular also provided proof of their scientific quality. The Fraunhofer facilities were also successful in obtaining contracts from private industry: Of their overall contract earnings totaling DM14 million, two-thirds came from western companies and one-third from firms in the new federal laender. The Fraunhofer facilities have become a major factor in the R&D infrastructure in the new laender, where they are contributing to reconstruction.
