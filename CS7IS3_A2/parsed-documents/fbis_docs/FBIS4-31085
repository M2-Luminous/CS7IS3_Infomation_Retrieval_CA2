Our leading politicians have dissociated themselves from his visit. However, I have to admit that I perceive their repeated assurances that they have nothing to do with his visit as proof of their embarrassment and an attempt to shake off a certain share of responsibility. [Havel] I do not think I am trying to shake off any share of responsibility. I am not the one who issues visas; I have not issued a visa for him. I have simply learned from newspapers that Mr. Pinochet is here. He is not a man to my liking. He is simply the man who organized a putsch against a democratically elected government. On one hand, his name is linked to an economic miracle, but he is also linked to much cruelty and rages by secret police. This man is not to my liking. I have simply acknowledged that he has made a visit here, as on occasions a number of people I do not like will probably do. [passage omitted] In this context I would like to say one more thing. I am an essentially nonideological or anti-ideological person. I do not think people should be assessed according to on which side of the barricade they are said to be standing. It has always made me angry to hear Communists saying that Stalin stood on the right side of the barricade, that he fought for a better world, and that he just made some small mistakes. It is the same when somebody says nowadays that Mr. Pinochet stood on the right side of the barricade and that he just made some small mistakes in the form of murdering and persecuting people. This is an ideological vision of the world that can, step by step, totally detach itself from the basic humanistic assessment of actions, from the basic respect for a state ruled by the law.
