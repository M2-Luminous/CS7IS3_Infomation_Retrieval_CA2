He said that behind his faction's decisions was the wish to secure an additional vote in the State Duma, not inner rifts. The principle of forming up the State Duma's Council were preliminarily discussed by the leaders of the parliamentary factions and State Duma speaker Ivan Rybkin on Saturday. The Council is to consist of the speaker and his deputies, and the faction leaders. Each faction will have one vote irrespective of its membership. The State Duma's biggest faction Russia's Choice has 76 members. The minimal number of members required for the registration of a faction is 35. Some of the Russia's Choice members believe therefore that Russia's Choice centrist and more radical members may form up two independent factions, said Yushenkov. It is not ruled out that some of this faction's embers will join the Union of December 12 faction, led by Moscow's Vice Mayor Alexander Braginsky and entrepreneurs Irina Khakamada and Viktor Bushmin. This group has only 23 members for the moment and needs a replenishment of 12 members to get registered.
