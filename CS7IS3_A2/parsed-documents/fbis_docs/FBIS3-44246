For two weeks opposing factions of the army, one from the Makoanyane barracks and the other from defense headquarters, have been fighting each other around the capital, Maseru. It all began with a pay claim, but there have been fears of it developing into a coup against Ntsu Mokhehle's elected government. Yesterday a meeting of southern African leaders in Gaborone was talking of a task force to be sent by Botswana, Zimbabwe, and South Africa. They could find the door shut. But today, Commonwealth representatives have been meeting the two sides in Maseru. The foreign minister was there too, and it seems some progress was made. On the line to Maseru Robin White asked Mamelo Maurison of the MORNING STAR newspaper what the outcome of the meetings had been. [Begin recording] [Maurison] Well, the outcome of the meetings is that the foreign informed the Makoanyane side of the army that they should nominate 10 representatives who will seat for extensive discussions with the 10 from RLDF [Royal Swazi Defense Force] tomorrow under the chairmanship of the Commonwealth team. [White] And they will try and flush out some kind of deal tomorrow? [Maurison] The foreign minister said they should be prepared, they should prepare their agenda, including the 100-percent demand and everything that worries them to be in the agenda for tomorrow's meeting and that all these complaints will be looked at with the assistance of the Commonwealth team. [White] And I gather that some kind of promise was made that there will be no action taken against those that have been causing trouble? [Maurison] Yes, the foreign minister said he was passing the message from the prime minister, who is also minister of defense, that no recriminations will be taken against any of the soldiers for any of their actions in the last few days, and that they must rest assured that nothing will happen to anyone of them. [White] Even to those who killed people? [Maurison] He said whatever has happened, nothing will happen. [White] So, is it your feeling that they might be on the way now to some kind of deal? [Maurison] It will depend largely on whether the two sides will indeed appoint their representatives, and whether the representatives, when they seat under the auspices of the Commonwealth, will be willing to talk out their differences, but by the look of things, it may take some bit of time.
