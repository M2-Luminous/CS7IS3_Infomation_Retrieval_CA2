BUJKU rightly deplored this news. As is well known, after the disintegration of AVNOJ [Antifascist Council for the National Liberation of Yugoslavia] Yugoslavia, many states of Europe and the United States withdrew their ambassadors from Belgrade, at the same time requesting the withdrawal of the Yugoslav ambassadors from their countries. Respecting this stand by other countries, the Republic of Albania acted likewise by withdrawing its ambassador from Belgrade and asking for the withdrawal of the Yugoslav ambassador in Tirana. A few days ago, the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] Government issued a request for the revival of talks with the democratic Republic of Albania at foreign-ministerial level. We have not been informed of the response of the Albanian side. How these possible talks will develop is not the concern of this article. What interests the Kosovar Albanian public today is the appointment of Zivorad Igic as ambassador to Tirana. If the governments of the FRY and Serbia really do have a sincere intention to renew relations of any kind with the Republic of Albania, they must also think about the choice of the person who will contribute toward promoting these relations. Zivorad Igic is not such a man. His appointment to this high-level diplomatic post in a country with whom relations have cooled for well-known reasons has been taken as a serious provocation by the Albanian people of Kosova. We do not believe that the state and political authorities in Yugoslavia and Serbia are unaware of this. And this is why.... Zivorad Igic, once a village schoolteacher (nothing wrong in that) grew up almost in the Albanians' lap. He was "distinguished" as an "ardent" supporter of the idea of "brotherhood-and-unity and togetherness." From being a journalist and media editor, at the end of Yugosiavia's existence he "jumped" to the post of the (final) chairman of the Kosova Socialist Alliance [SAWP]. After purging this organization of Albanians at an early stage, he at the same time sought the most drastic and brutal state measures against them. After the final destruction of the League of Communists [LCY] and the SAWP, Igic joined the Socialist Party of Serbia [SPS] and assumed high office. In the first pluralist parliamentary elections (in which the Albanians did not take place for well-known reasons), he was elected a deputy to the Serbian Assembly. After the events of 1981, Zivorad Igic had slowly, but systematically and in the most perfidious fashion, following the "LCY line," involved himself in the anti-Albanian campaign. Following the outbreak of the anti-Albanian national-chauvinist popular hysteria and especially after 1987, Zivorad Igic devoted himself heart and soul to this campaign. In his articles in several Yugoslav newspapers, his appearance on LCY, SAWP, and other political rostrums, on the floor of the parliaments of Serbia and self-styled Yugoslavia, Zivorad Igic, more than anyone else from Kosova, lied, slandered, and spat out chauvinist gall against the Albanian people, accusing them of treason, of destroying Yugoslavia, and of allegedly visiting "violence," "terror," and "genocide" on the Serbian people in Kosova and beyond for more than a century. In these articles and speeches, Zivorad Igic insistently demanded the abolition of Kosova's autonomy, the suspension of all its educational, cultural, academic, health, and even economic institutions, and the total destruction of the Kosova economy and its subjection to that of serbia. The total destruction of all these institutions and of the Kosova economy is the indisputable "contribution" of Zivorad Igic, who, as a deputy of the Serbian parliament, voted for all the necessary measures. Zivorad Igic, a Kosova-born Serbian intellectual, not only failed to raise the voice of reason against the most brutal violence, terror, and genocide on the continent of Europe, visited upon the Albanian people in Kosova by the present Serbian regime, but, in his articles, appearances, and behavior in the service of this regime, has powerfully aided anti-Albanian policies, showing himself to be a sworn enemy of the Albanian people. Finally, one must mention another matter of principle of which the FRY Government is aware, but which it ignores as something "nonexistent." It is well known that the Republic of Albania has accepted the Republic of Kosova. The choice of the Albanians of Kosova is well known both to Yugoslavia today and the world. Despite the efforts of the Yugoslav and Serbian Government to treat the Kosova issue as a Serbian internal affair, this issue has become internationalized, and the Albanians have no intention of accepting a solution without the presence and guarantee of an international factor. Zivorad Igic's appointment as the FRY's representative in Tirana, or anywhere else, at this phase of tense Albanian-Serbian (and Yugoslav) relations, cannot be understood by the Albanians as anything other than an intentional provocation. Sensible policies would not permit such a thing. The Albanians of Kosova are vitally interested in good, friendly, and sincere Albanian-Yugoslav relations, but they can only come about after the question of Kosova is conclusively solved. The appointment of the FRY ambassador from Kosova suggests that the FRY Government wishes to quietly sweep under the carpet Kosova as a free and independent entity, while the Republic of Albania will be left "holding the baby," because, if it fails to accept this ambassador from Kosova, it will be accused of "destabilizing" the situation in the Balkans.
