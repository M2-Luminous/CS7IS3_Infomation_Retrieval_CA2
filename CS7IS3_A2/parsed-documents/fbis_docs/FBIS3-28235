The ASAHI SHIMBUN and MAINICHI SHIMBUN criticized Hosokawa over the plan, announced at a news conference in the early hours of Thursday. A leading business daily, the NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN, was also critical, saying the net tax increase from the proposal will not help the sluggish economy to recover. But the YOMIURI SHIMBUN threw firm support behind the prime minister, and the SANKEI SHIMBUN offered qualified support. In an editorial titled "An Absurd `Decision' by the Prime Minister," the opinion-leading ASAHI said, "What on earth is the matter?" alluding to "unprecedented turmoil" among the government and ruling coalition parties over Hosokawa's tax reform plan. The ASAHI asked, "what was the point of Wednesday's talks among the coalition and the prime minister's early Thursday news conference?" "We cannot understand why the new tax plan was launched so abruptly," the ASAHI said, adding that there are too many unclear points about the plan. "It cannot be overlooked that not only the Social Democratic Party [SDP] but even Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura did not know about the new tax plan until just before the announcement," it said. The MAINICHI SHIMBUN said Hosokawa failed to respond to questions on why the consumption tax must be changed to a national welfare tax or why the new indirect tax must be imposed in April 1997. "Is it a wise choice to impose the new tax in three years' time and set the tax rate at 7 percent," the MAINICHI asked in an editorial titled "The Premier's Decision Is Too Abrupt." The largest national daily, the YOMIURI, said it was "basically in support" of Hosokawa's tax plan, which it called a sweeping tax reform that follows the imposition of the 3 percent consumption tax five years ago. The YOMIURI said, "a large income tax cut is necessary to escape from the present prolonged recession. But a tax cut without a revenue source is nothing more than political irresponsibility." It urged the SDP and the main opposition party, the Liberal Democratic Party, to help the government enact legislation on the tax reform plan based on Hosokawa's announcement. The YOMIURI's editorial said the planned issuance of deficit-financing bonds without the backing of revenue sources for redemption is very dangerous, noting that the cumulative balance of national bond issues at the end of March 1995 will reach 200 trillion yen. The NIHON KEIZAI said tax reform must be neutral, but Hosokawa's tax plan will produce as much as 3.5 trillion yen of net tax increases. It said, "Needless to say, this will sharply offset effects from income tax reductions...an advance tax cut will be meaningless. Of course, people will not support it." The SANKEI SHIMBUN urged Hosokawa to "conduct tax reform in a fair manner." Hosokawa's decision basically complies with the direction of tax reform that calls for imposing taxes appropriately on income, consumption and assets and for taxpayers to share the burden fairly. But questions remain, the SANKEI said. "Why could the prime minister not propose an increase in the consumption tax rate?" It also questioned why a 9.5 trillion yen tax increase is necessary to offset a 6 trillion yen tax cut.
