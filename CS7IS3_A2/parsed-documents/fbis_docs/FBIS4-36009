This is part of the hysterical and adventurist behavior on the part of the head of the military regime in Sanaa. Our air, naval, and ground forces resisted these aggressive attacks with rare heroism on all fronts, striking deadly blows on the invading enemy forces, whose operations today resembled the fighting of remnants, thieves, and infiltrators. Our forces inflicted on them heavy human and material losses. On the Abyan axis, eight enemy tanks were destroyed while two others were captured. On the Tawr-al-Baha-al-Khattabiyyah axis, 10 enemy tanks were destroyed, with three other tanks captured. Four (BNB) armored cars and two Katyusha rocket-launching vehicles were also destroyed. On the Kharaz-al-Mandeb axis, five enemy tanks were captured and three others captured. One enemy aircraft was shot down. On all these fronts, the enemy forces retreated to their rear positions leaving behind hundreds of dead and wounded. Many of the officers and men of the attacking forces have surrendered. In the Shabwah Governorate, the enemy forces attempted to repeat their attacks, but our Armed Forces and the masses of the people resisted, striking crushing blows against them. We shall bring you more information in a subsequent communique about the front in the Shabwah Governorate.
