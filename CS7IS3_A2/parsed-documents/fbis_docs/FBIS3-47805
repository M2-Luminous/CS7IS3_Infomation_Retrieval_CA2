The resumption of the Team Spirit nuclear fire game, which is known as the largest-scale joint military exercise in the world, was followed by various war exercises in South Korea named Ssangyong, Ulchi, Ulchi Focus Lens, Hwarang, and Eagle. This turned South Korea into a virtual land of gunsmoke, where the roar of guns and smell of gunpowder were ceaseless last year. Under the pretext of the North's nuclear threat, the warmongers with war frenzy did not hesitate to even have the wild outburst of virtual declaration of war by saying that they were prepared to take military countermeasures. Traitor Kim Yong-sam, who had been proud of being in civilian clothes, unlike the preceding military dictators, visited frontline troops at the end of last year, wearing combat attire of the puppet Army, and bolstered the war mood of northward invasion. This enables everyone to easily guess the level of the civilian warmongers' war mania. The puppet Kim Yong-sam clique has extremely aggravated North-South relations and pushed the situation of the Korean peninsula onto the brink of war by conducting adventurous war disturbances with outside forces, ignoring the fellow countrymen's peace proposal for achieving national reconciliation and unity. This is an intolerable, antinational crime. The puppet Kim Yong-sam clique's indiscreet playing with fire aimed at invoking a fratricidal war did not bring them good results. The appearance of those who were mobilized to war disturbances staged by the civilian warmonger was pitiful. A helicopter of the puppet Naval Command of Operations crashed in Kumsu-myon, Songju County, North Kyongsang Province last year, and some 10 puppet soldiers died in vain in this accident. Another tragedy occurred in Chungwon County, North Chungchong Province. An F16 fighter plane of the puppet Air Force exploded in mid-air during a war disburbance and fell on a mountain in the county. The destiny of those who were frantically engaged in a provocation against fellow countrymen in the air faced a disastrous end. This reminds us of the maxim that those who show mercy to others shall enjoy mercy from others. According to the material presented by the South Korean puppet Defense Ministry to the National Assembly last year, many puppet soldiers died during war exercises against the North. Many soldiers died during the merciless and harsh disciplinary training in the South Korean puppet military or committed suicide, unable to endure any longer their lives of employed soldiers. South Korea's Chungang University gazette carried an editorial, which pointed out that the Team Spirit exercise is a U.S. war disturbance that has no relation to the national interest and that South Korea is in bad shape for willingly providing the United States with a place for it. The editorial also noted that the meaning of this exercise became clear under the situation, in which the right to control operations, a key element of sovereignty, has been handed over to the United States, and denounced the exercise of pointing guns at fellow countrymen, saying such a thing can never happen. The South Korean people have branded the puppet Kim Yong-sam clique as a group of civilian warmongers. The puppet Kim Yong-sam clique has expressed its plan to continue the nuclear war disturbance this year, too. It would be quite absurd, however, if the puppet Kim Yong-sam clique intends to gain something by staging fire games and lighting the fuse of war of northward invasion. The South Korean puppets should better act discreetly, being clearly aware that the nuclear war disturbance will only result in their own ruin.
