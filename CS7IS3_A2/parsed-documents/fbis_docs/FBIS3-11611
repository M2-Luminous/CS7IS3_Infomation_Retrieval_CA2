This has all occurred at a time at which the United States insists on classifying Guatemala as a country that is risky for foreign tourists. Regarding this matter, President Ramiro de Leon Carpio has said: [Begin De Leon Carpio recording] This is something that has not really been defined yet. The travel advisory has not really been established yet. What they have said is that a warning was issued because of the problem with stealing children, the smuggling of minors, and other illegal activities involving Guatemalan children. It is exclusively for that reason. It is exclusively for the United States because somehow some U.S. individual was involved. A travel advisory has not been officially established. On the contrary, I read an interview with the Guatemalan president in THE MIAMI HERALD today. Comments on this were completely favorable, especially those by the executive director who was here for the Inter-American Press Association meeting. He spoke about the advantages of Guatemalan tourism. So those reports are not true. There has been some exaggeration on this topic, not here but abroad, specifically in the United States.
