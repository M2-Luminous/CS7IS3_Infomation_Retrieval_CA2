While Syrian sources spoke of the negotiations' entering "a new and fundamental phase dealing with minute details," well-informed sources in New York told AL-HAYAH that Christopher had carried to the Syrian leadership a new Israeli offer which represents "an integrated deal" that covers all the elements concerning the Syrian-Israeli relationship, beginning with security through to details of a specific timetable for withdrawal from the Golan, as well as Hizballah's future in southern Lebanon. The sources added that the new Israeli offer stipulates a phased withdrawal to be completed in five years, not eight years as mentioned in the first offer. The Israeli proposal "assumes" "full" withdrawal from the Golan, linking this with the other elements in the deal, first and foremost security, not only with regard to the Golan but in southern Lebanon as well, since disarming Hizballah represents one of the deal's elements. U.S. and Israeli diplomatic sources expect "difficult and protracted negotiations" with the Syrians. They point out that, if the Syrians and the Israelis want to reach an agreement, this agreement should be reached within a year, that is before Israeli elections begin. [passage omitted] In Damascus, well-informed sources expect Christopher to return to the Syrian capital to convey Israel's position on the Syrian plan and to resume his role in bringing views closer. They told AL-HAYAH that Damascus is still awaiting the "password" from the Israelis. "We are still awaiting the word `full' withdrawal from the Golan. When they agree to it, all possibilities will open to discuss all the other questions that follow that." [passage omitted] Syrian sources have said that the peace process has entered "a new and fundamental phase" with Christopher's conveying of the two sides' views of peace. They added that Christopher's decision to return to Damascus "means that there are extensive U.S. efforts aimed at steps to help the parties to move closer to one another and make progress on the long road toward peace." They went on to say that Damascus "welcomes the U.S. endeavors and hopes that the U.S. secretary's tour will result in a fundamental and constructive breakthrough, in order to advance the peace process and consolidate the constants of a peaceful solution." The sources reemphasized that "the condition needed to make Christopher's mission a success is Israel's response to full withdrawal from the Golan." [passage omitted]
