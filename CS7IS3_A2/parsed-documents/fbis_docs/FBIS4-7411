"The root of the cause to the present tension and instability of the Korean peninsula is in North Korea's nuclear suspicion," a Foreign Ministry official said in a commentary, "therefore, resolution of the nuclear problem is the priority task." "North Korea should not attempt to blur the core of the problem at the present stage and fully cooperate in solving the nuclear problem," the official said. Pyongyang leaders have recently stepped up their campaign to replace the armistice pact with a peace agreement, urging the United States to sit down for negotiations. The armistice was signed at the end of the fratricidal 1950-1953 Korean war, and the two Koreas are technically still at war in the absence of a peace treaty. Pyongyang insistently refused to talk to Seoul about the replacement, reasoning that South Korea was not a signatory to the armistice. The Ministry official reminded that South and North Korea already agreed at their prime ministers' talks in 1992 that the two sides will work together to transfer the armistice into a peace pact. Until then, the inter-Korean agreement says the two sides shall abide by the present military Armistice Agreement. "The issue of establishing a new mechanism guaranteeing peace as proposed by the North is one that should be settled by South and North Korea as directly involved parties, based on the aforementioned agreement," the official said.
