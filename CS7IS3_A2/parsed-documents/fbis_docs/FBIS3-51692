Sound familiar? These are the titles of a number of editorials frequently appearing in the Japanese press. After learning the results of the referendum, leading economic news daily NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN was even more dramatic: "Fujimori deserves Japan's help in continuing his revitalization of Peru." It is a good sign. In 1989 and 1990, Peru was always linked with news about terrorism, cocaine, and Machu Picchu. Since the election of the "Nisei" president, Peru has merited a special place in the media. Every event brings in correspondents and sets off a wave of frantic telephone calls requesting information. In terms of editorials, Fujimori and Clinton are neck-and-neck. Nevertheless, Japan's interest is more sentimental than real. The government has not funded enormous loans and businessmen do not view Peru as an immediate investment possibility. Nor have Tokyo's bureaucrats done much for Peru. Following the killing of three Technical Cooperation engineers by terrorists, the government suspended its technical exchanges with the JICA [Japanese International Cooperation Agency] program. As for loans and the remission of debts, Japan conducts its negotiations through the IMF and World Bank, organizations in which Japan maintains an economic presence but has no decision-making power, as a result of which its ability to apply pressure in favor of a country such as Peru is limited. Japan could also be accused of favoritism and thereby create problems with its trading partners if it defends Peru. There remain the nonrepayable cooperation loans, which are minimal and used to guarantee sales of Japanese products in Peru. In such cases, Japan loans money to Peru in order to enable it to buy products from Matsushita or NEC. It is just a form of insurance for those companies' sales abroad. Nor does business offer any brighter prospects. Although Keindaren, the Federation of Economic Organizations, has publicly stated its interest in Peru, businessmen say privately that the best policy for the time being is to see what happens. Annual meetings of Japanese and Peruvian businessmen have also been organized, the site alternating between Japan and Peru, but enthusiasm has not grown. This is but a reflection of the trend with respect to Latin America. In 1991, Eximbank, Japan's Export-Import Bank, did a survey of 115 leading Japanese businesses to ascertain their investment plans for 1992 and 1993. Some 26 percent said they would channel their investments to Europe, another 25 percent to Asia, and 19 percent to the United States. Only 3 percent were considering investing in Latin America. In addition, Peru is rapidly forgotten when the Japanese view Chile as a growing market and Colombia as the central pole for the expansion of telephone systems in South America. Mexico is creating great expectations as a result of its participation in the Free Trade Agreement with the United States and Canada. What are the determining factors for Japanese investment abroad? The prime factor worldwide is the advantages to be derived from ownership, meaning large-scale economies, technological advantages, and high-level administrative training. In second place are locational factors, i.e., barriers to export markets and the availability of cheap labor and natural resources. Ranking third are factors relating to internationalization, meaning the possibility of controlling the risk of losing technological control, easy terms for the repatriation of capital, and administrative simplification for setting up systems similar to the Japanese keiretsu. Based on these elements and leaving the United States and West Europe aside, Southeast Asia meets all the requirements mentioned, followed by the former Socialist satellite countries, Latin America and, lagging far behind, Africa. In Latin America, the Japanese are less demanding. Before investing, their demands can be summed up in three additional conditions: 1) economic stability, meaning low inflation, the obtainment of development plans, and low or "manageable" trade union activity; 2) security against terrorist action aimed at companies as well as individuals; and 3) political stability, mainly meaning strong governments that can guarantee stable rules of play in medium- and long-range terms. Business's perception is that Peru was on its way to meeting the first two conditions, but still had a way to go on the third, about which doubt remained. Shigeo Osonoi, professor at the Toyama University of Foreign Studies and formerly a Japanese diplomat in Peru, thinks the Japanese are very cautious and hopes the United States and Europe will go in first to test the waters. Japan always goes in later. If the Americans are enthusiastic about Peru, the Japanese will get on the band wagon, Osonoi adds. Economic relations have been maintained--not expanded--but the figures show that they do not amount to much. For Peru, Japan is the second-ranking buyer of Peruvian products after the United States. As a seller, it comes in fifth after the United States, Argentina, Brazil, and Germany. Japan's imports from Peru total less than 1 percent and its exports amount to 5 or 6 percent (Chunanbei Shokoku Shiran 1992, Latin American Company, Tokyo). Although in historical terms, Japanese accumulated investments are sizable (from 1950 to 1990, Peru ranked fifth in Latin America, with $41.48 million), the situation has grown stagnant. From 1985 to 1990, the figure amounted to a scant $20 million, which comes out to 0 when the total statistics are calculated. From 1990 to 1992, rather than speaking of investments, one would refer to the reinvestment of the profits of companies already operating in the country (Panorama of Industry and Japanese Economic Cooperation 1992, Latin American Company, Tokyo). While the economy has not been a very active channel between Japan and Peru, diplomacy has endeavored to fill the vacuum. Japan is the country that has put the most pressure on Fujimori to restore legal order and constitutional rights after the imposition of special powers [autogolpe]. The reason is clear: Japan feels a certain degree of responsibility to Peru, but does not want to suffer in the international community for supporting a regime that could carry its authoritarianism to extremes. Japan has always seconded the United States on international issues. Only in three cases--all of them in Latin America--has it opposed it: In Panama with Noriega, Japan did not impose sanctions despite the American request to do so. During the war in the Falkland Islands, it did not suspend commercial trade with Argentina until events were well under way. Finally, in the case of the "Fujicoup," it strongly resisted pressure to break off relations. Such a defense implies risks. If there are excesses, Tokyo could find itself in the delicate position of having to defend the government before the international community, endangering its possibilities of winning a seat on the UN Security Council, damaging its relations with the United States, and hurting its prospects of heading up a power bloc in Asia. At Japan's suggestion, Kabun Muto, then minister of foreign relations, went to Venezuela in April to help restore relations between Peru and Venezuela and, speaking off the record, expressed the need for Fujimori's government to "legitimize itself" by restoring Parliament so as not to be seen as a civilian dictator. It is to be hoped that in the diplomatic field, Japan will continue to maintain a low profile while adopting a wait-and-see attitude. Obviously, feelings count for very little in international policy. Japanese capital and the official aid accompanying it are governed by the simple laws of profitability. In Chile, the minister of economy is also Japanese, but it is obvious that that is not the reason why the main investments are channeled in that direction. If political and economic stability can be achieved in medium-range terms and if the government forms a base of support by managing to rallying a certain social consensus, the investments will flow. For Japanese private capital, that is the most convincing argument. For the time being, the only thing anyone knows for sure is that Peru will continue to make the front page of Japanese newspapers. [Box, p 47] Peruvians in Japan: Nontraditional Export In 1992, Peruvians working in Japan (the descendants of Japanese) sent home to Peru anywhere between $80 million and $150 million. For the past five years, Peruvian labor has been the main nontraditional product exported to Japan. It is an enormous sum for Peru. For example, in 1992, the value of Peruvian products exported to Japan amounted to approximately $600 million. Some 80 percent of those products were minerals, 15 percent agricultural products such as coffee and cacao, and 5 percent manufactured products, basically textiles. Since the mid '80's, trade in the so-called nontraditional exports has wavered between 5 and 8 percent. The amount of money Peruvians send home to Peru could exceed the revenue obtained from exporting coffee or textiles to Japan. According to unofficial sources in the Peruvian Embassy, some 70,000 Peruvians are living in Japan. According to the Immigration Office in Lima, 60,000 have left. In 1989, that figure was 10,000. This means that the number has risen by 8,000 a year! Over half of the so-called dekasegui send--or were sending--anywhere between $350 and $1,500 a month to Peru. All of these figures are approximate because no statistics exist. According to some estimates, over the past four years, Brazilians (now numbering around 150,000) have sent a total of $2 billion to their relatives. It is hoped that the amount of money sent will drop drastically in the months ahead. As a result of the recession, there is no work in factories, forcing many to return to their native countries.
