Stability Extricates Lebanon from Intensive Care"] [Text] Beirut, AL-HAYAH -- Syrian Vice President 'Abd-al-Halim Khaddam has said that "Lebanon can recover its economic role and prosperity within a short period if it has complete stability coupled with the existence of a state supported by everyone." He added: "Lebanon is still in intensive care and will not be able to be moved from it unless stability is achieved. And the Lebanese people's interests lie in the building of a strong and capable state." He stressed that "Syria has no ambitions in Lebanon." Khaddam was speaking to a delegation from the [Lebanese] Chamber of Commerce and the Lebanese Banks Association headed by 'Adnan al-Qassar, which visited Damascus the day before yesterday [12 January] at the invitation of the Syrian Chambers of Commerce and Industry Federation to discuss ways of reinforcing economic relations between the two countries in the implementation of brotherhood, cooperation, and coordination. The Syrian vice president pointed out that "there are many things which prompt the Lebanese and the Syrians to cooperate. And if peace is established in the region, Israel's aim will be to control economic, tourist, and other resources; the Arabs will become a consumer market for it; and it will become an agent for the big economic establishments. In the West there are no friendships, but interests, and the quarter close to the West's interests is Israel." Khaddam said that "the big loser from that will be those who have money and Lebanon, because Lebanon is the most competitive country, and if Israel hits this center, the scene will become vacant for it. This is why attempts to strain the situation in Lebanon cannot be excluded from this context." He said: "But if peace is not established in the region, the world economic situation is moving toward forming blocs and economic groupings, while our problem in the Arab states is that we behave as though each state is a world superpower. If we had established a common Arab market when the idea first emerged, we would have attained unity by now. And if Lebanon and Syria can proceed together -- even through a modest experiment -- in this connection, this would serve the interests of the two countries and the other Arab states. We are open to anything that achieves this aim." He added that "Syria has achieved major advances in 25 years, even in the petroleum field, because we know what we are doing and what we are going to achieve. We have no ambitions in Lebanon. We must take the interests of the two countries into account and act on that basis. Our common interests are in our Arab affiliation. If we do not correct our relations -- political and economic -- there will be no Arab homeland." He pointed out that "Lebanon can recover its status and prosperity quickly, because of the Lebanese people's flexibility and broad experience. But that cannot be achieved without the existence of a state. This state cannot be brought about unless everyone contributes to bolstering it. There are attempts to disrupt the situation in Lebanon. Recent security bombings are part of these attempts. In the end they all serve Israel's interests. Lebanon is still in intensive care, and today we see in it for the first time a serious attempt to build a state and enable the institutions to play their roles. The Lebanese people's interests lie in building a strong and capable state. If Lebanon does not have the stability, it will not be able to move out of intensive care." He stressed "bolstering the Lebanese state and putting Syria's capabilities at its disposal to restore stability and begin the building stage in Lebanon." He said that "any cooperation between the private sectors in Lebanon and Syria is a national demand which we support with all our capabilities."
