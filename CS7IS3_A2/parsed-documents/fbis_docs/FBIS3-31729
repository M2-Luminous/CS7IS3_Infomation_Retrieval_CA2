Is the right wing the next to join forces after the liberals' agreement and the left wing bloc? A straight answer is not yet forthcoming. [passage omitted] [Szendrei] Why are you appearing in a joint meeting with Istvan Csurka with whom you have had many debates? It seems that, after the former internal and external allies of the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] were expelled from paradise, they now have found each other. [Torgyan] I do not have 2.1 million forints to give a massive speech in the Budapest Sports Hall. This is why I accepted someone else's invitation. Rather than Csurka, it was Ferenc Morvai, leader of the Citizens' Interest Protection Organization, who invited me. You can see that I am also talking to you, but we cannot at all be accused of having the same political platform. [Szendrei] You know that an interview is different from a demonstrative political rally. I do not believe that you would also jointly appear with Viktor Orban [chairman of the Federation of Young Democrats] at an event. The electors consider all jointly held speeches to be political gestures. To be naive: Is the meeting of the smallholders and the MIEP really the result of a purely financial constraint, without any intention to cooperate? [Torgyan] In politics, it is impossible to use the same categoric notions as in mathematics for example. Therefore, the rally organized for 20 February has to be accepted as it is. Nothing needs to be added. For a politician, there can be no greater honor than to talk in front of crowd that is as large as possible. As far as I know, there are 12,000 seats in the Sports Hall, but the experts will set up loudspeakers in the corridors and then as many as 100,000 people will be able to hear us. [passage omitted] [Szendrei] Whatever way we look at it, Csurka and his party are on the right of the Hungarian political spectrum at the moment. Many people say that the slightly left-wing pre-war smallholders party may shift to the far right under Torgyan's leadership. [Szendrei] You are using completely different terms from what would be appropriate. Before the war, the smallholders party was indeed a left-wing party -- compared with [governor] Horthy's right-wing views. However, right after 1945, we were to the right of communism. Therefore, there is no point in qualifying us or other parties in this way. [passage omitted] We are not extremists. I repeat that we will not meet Csurka, it is only our host that we have common. I will face the challenge. We can assess our abilities in rhetoric. [Szendrei] I must admit that, even now, you do not give in very easily. [Torgyan] Thank you. Therefore, I have to enter into this dialogue, just as I do not decline dialogue with other politicians. This is also part of political culture but we do not have any plans to do with Csurka. [passage omitted] [Szendrei] You are also said to have betrayed the coalition. A government has to be formed after the elections. How certain can the contenders be that you would be a reliable partner? [Torgyan] I do not think reliability should be approached from this angle. We made a coalition agreement [in 1990, at the previous elections] which, contrary to rumors, was in writing. It was the MDF that violated it. This is the reason we criticized the top leadership. We had a serious debate with [former prime minister] Jozsef Antall because he did not fulfill the agreement. This was his way of repaying the fact that, in the second round, we had withdrawn our candidates in many places in the MDF's favor. Without us, the MDF would not have doubled its votes in the second round. [Szendrei] In other words, it was the smallholders who helped the MDF come to government and Torgyan helped Antall come to power? [Torgyan] This is it, precisely. Returning to gratefulness: On the night it came to power, the MDF made a secret pact. I returned home after midnight and was told that a couple had been looking for me. I later realized that these were [then MDF deputies] Imre Konya and Katalin Kutrucz. At that time, they had already signed the agreement with the Alliance of Free Democrats. This is what they were going to tell me. They had made a pact with the opposition behind our backs. Therefore, it is only us who can raise the issue of reliability. [Szendrei] In other words, the smallholders generously allowed the MDF to win. This time, they will not offer this to anyone, rather, they are certain that they will win the elections.... [Torgyan] That is correct. No one can yet tell the size of the victory. I think it is possible that the smallholders will have an astonishingly big victory. The population is so bitter and they have so much faith in us that even this is possible. If we win the elections at whatever proportion, then it will not be us who has to look for partners. Rather, the partners will be seeking us because people do not like to be left out of power. There are not many Jozsef Torgyans in the world, and I have never been running after ministerial office. [sentence as published] [Szendrei] Are you so self-assured or humble? [Torgyan] I said that we were deceived in the coalition, because we had been promised a change of regime, a big clean-up from top to bottom, the return of landed property, and so on. They did not fulfill these promises, and so there was nothing to agree about with those in power. On the contrary! After this, let me ask if those in power who implement a completely different program from what they had promised in their election program are constitutional. [Szendrei] Do you question the government's constitutionality? [Torgyan] Election fraud can never be seen as a constitutional procedure anywhere. And this is what the government has done through its politics. [Szendrei] Where do you, as a jurist, find a paragraph in the Constitution on this? [Torgyan] That is a different question. What I question is an issue of constitutionality, rather than a political issue. The basic principles of this could be laid down in the Constitution. I think that even a referendum is possible on this issue. Therefore, I restate that this government is in power contrary to the Constitution because it has deceived the electors. If they had said that "the cleaning up means that we will take money from your pockets, we will have dealings with the communists, and we will participate in the communists's preservation of power and assets," and they had received the votes after this, then I would not at all object. In that case, they would be ruling lawfully. Capitalist Communists [Szendrei] We can read the public opinion polls and hear the views of politicians and the public that the left wing is becoming stronger. What will the smallholders party do after a left-wing victory? [Torgyan] This danger does not exist. People who have listened to what I said can see that the communists had been speaking up against the curse of private property until they relieved society from this curse. They made themselves into owners. The former party chiefs would be foolish to return to their party positions. [Szendrei] What kind of government would you consider to be a strong government in the coming four years? [Torgyan] We have to start from our program. People cannot bear the insecurity of existence, the level of the loss of assets, and the obvious anguish of unemployment. A government that is able to make fundamental changes will be a strong government. [Szendrei] Therefore, in your view, the smallholders party will win the elections. As the party's chairman, you may even become prime minister. Do you think that you are the most suitable person to be prime minister? [Torgyan] Not at all. However, it is a fact that I am the only politician who can mobilize really large masses. In other parties, there are not any charismatic people who are accepted by the people.
