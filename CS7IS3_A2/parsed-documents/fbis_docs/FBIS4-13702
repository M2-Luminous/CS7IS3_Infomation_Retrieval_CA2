However, the fact is that we have not yet fully realized the importance of this action. What were the intended objectives, implications, dimensions, and extent of this action? Does the mere severance of diplomatic relations survive in isolation, without its perspective within the overall concept of domination? Can this conform to the original objectives? The breaking of relations should be viewed in all its aspects; diplomatic relations cannot be segregated from economic and trade relations. Those who blindly insist on the continued severance of diplomatic relations are as ignorant as those who are covertly striving to patch them up. They do not realize the true significance of severing these relations nor that the issue cannot be confined to the political arena, for that would be a blatant contradiction of its purpose. Now that there are no relations between Iran and the United States there are irrefutable signs of increased economic relations. Even though in most cases direct economic ties have been obstructed, the transactions take place through middlemen. Hence, one must view the profits and losses of these indirect deals. If we are realistic, we will clearly see that the goods that reach us in these deals already cost 10 to 20 percent more and the countries that act as intermediaries also take a cut at our expense. The American companies do not seem dissatisfied with this state of affairs because their third country partners take their share from Iran. In the case of countries such as Turkey, which is facing major financial difficulties, these indirect U.S.-Iran transactions are extremely favorable. Therefore, contrary to Ayatollah Azeri-Qomi's remarks that the murmurings of relations with the United States stem from a lack of taste on the part of some officials, these murmurings are in fact realities resulting from the absence of a specific economic policy. In the current circumstances, no one desires diplomatic relations with the United States, which maintains policies hostile to the Islamic Revolution. However, those who issue licenses to facilitate the entry of American products into the country will sooner or later find themselves forced to defend the forging of diplomatic relations. We must tell these gentlemen clearly: It is not possible to continue advertising for Coca Cola and General Electric in the most revolutionary newspapers while simultaneously defending the severance of diplomatic relations. Such a blatant contradiction is detrimental to our national interests. The United States does not dominate solely through its embassies all over the world. Coca Cola and General Electric are their vanguards, and economic and trade domination precedes political domination. Those who have turned a blind eye to the uncontrolled entry of American commodities into our country will sooner or later have to face the reality that political relations will consequently become necessary. Has adequate attention been paid to this issue? How will it be possible to profess that we do not want relations with the United States when a large part of the consumer market is controlled by American companies? A dual approach to a phenomenon that is intrinsically unitary will not resolve the problem. The Islamic Revolution should adhere to the concept of not having relations with the United States, but in our opinion, the Iranian consumer market, to which the United States fervently wants to return, is more important. A glance at the shelves of the markets that have mushroomed since the revolution and have sprung up even in the smallest cities will show that the most substandard products from various parts of the world can be found in these boutiques [preceding word in English]. American goods may not be the most prevalent in these shopping centers, but they are certainly no fewer than those from other countries. A cultural movement can only reach fruition when it does not lose sight of its objectives or degenerate into a mere cultural quirk. Have our officials and our nation embraced the belief that they should not use American goods?! Such claims do not appear logical and the converse is clearly evident in our society. The dissemination of information in our society is quite rudimentary, but even so, it is quite eloquent even at this level. If one were to intensively examine the Iranian-German talks on the reimbursement of outstanding sums, one would recall how vehemently the United States protested to Germany for not coordinating with it on exerting pressure on Iran. The United States was unable to answer one German official's justification of his government's policy. He attributed the situation to the pillaging of Iranian foreign exchange by American companies, and we maintained our poised silence in this altercation. At the same time, there were rumors all over the world that the United States wanted to increase pressure on Iran and urged its allies not to conclude agreements with Iran. Current developments -- which our Central Bank is proclaiming with much fanfare as a major victory for public consumption -- are in fact another trap to make us become so indebted that we will have no room left to maneuver. The transformation of short-term loans to long-term loans is not an art discovered for the first time by the authors of our economic adjustments. In any case, it will not make much difference whether a debtor country has relations with the United States or not, or continues to remain estranged. For as long as we do not approach these issues in an honest and realistic manner, vacillations in our foreign policies are inevitable, regardless of whether anyone is ready to accept them or not.
