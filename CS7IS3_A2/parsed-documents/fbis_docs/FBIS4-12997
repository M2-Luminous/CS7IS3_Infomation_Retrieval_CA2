Clinton had set himself apart from George Bush a few hours before taking office when he said he would be prepared to engage Iraq in dialogue. His advisers had leaked suggestions he would pursue different policies toward Iraq when he assumed power. We, therefore, feel disgust toward a man who started off with a human face but later turned into a ferocious beast! In his early youth, Clinton joined protest marches and took a hostile stand toward his country's military engagement in Vietnam. But he is now pursing even more criminal policies than Richard Nixon and stands readier than Bush to become a monkey and effect a complete aboutface. Is there anything so base as the president of the greatest nation on Earth turning himself into a monkey that turns its backside to amuse spectators in the hope of making a dime or two? The rash and nervous Clinton of today is not the sober and cool Clinton of yesterday! One who loses one's balance and falls captive to one's passions and crises is bound to be caught up in lies and further crimes! On the day before yesterday, he sent a new letter to the U.S. Congress's official spokesman in which he stooped even lower and repeated lies about Iraq. Clinton opened his letter by stating his extreme alarm by contradictions and the questions that remain unanswered in the area of chemical weapons. It was important, his letter said, to ensure effective and comprehensive inspection. Clinton knows that such statements to the Congress are sheer lies, for the simple reason that the UN commission's reports, including those submitted by Rolf Ekeus, head of the Special Commission, testify that Iraq has met its obligations and that the chemical weapons file is closed. Beyond that, Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz and Lieutenant General 'Amir Rashid recently showed, supported by evidence and figures, that Iraq has implemented its commitments in the area of chemical weapons. Clinton and his aides have had access to these facts. To call him liar, therefore, is not to do him an injustice. Clinton has stooped to such depths as to blackmail Ekeus into dereliction of his duties and abandonment of his convictions. The American President quotes Ekeus as saying he does not expect his report about Iraq's compliance with its commitments to be ready before the end of the year at the earliest. Clinton goes on to comment: We strongly advocate Ekeus' line and reject the drawing up of a timetable. These statements are clearly meant to pressure and threaten Ekeus. They amount to orders as to what he should and should not do. Clinton thus chooses to forget that he is in breach of UN Security Council Resolution 687, especially Paragraph 22, which stipulates that the council will lift the sanctions once Iraq has honored its obligations, which Iraq has done, as evidenced by reports submitted by UN commissions and Ekeus himself. Clinton goes too far with his show of his meanness, reaching the level of a professional liar. He quoted a fabricated story, previously denied by a neutral investigation conducted by a UN committee, to the effect that southern Iraq is exposed to repression. Does this mean the UN committee's investigation is based on lies? Doesn't this mean that the President of the United States is a liar? In an attempt to incite the Congress against Iraq, he spoke about investigating Iraq's war crimes and violations of human rights in Iraq. This proves once again that Clinton is not only a liar with double consciences and double standards, but that he also does not have the memory to protect him from saying anything that is easy to refute. Every day, the world discovers anew that the U.S. Administrations' crimes in the field of human rights are the worst, the meanest, in mankind's modern history. Based on U.S. information, since its establishment the United States has carried out more than 200 large-scale military interventions against other nations and peoples, without any justification or legal right. As a result, hundreds of thousands of people died and cities and cultural sites were destroyed. Among these crude interventions were the U.S. aggression against Korea in the fifties, the aggression against Vietnam in the sixties, the aggressions against Grenada and Nicaragua in the eighties, and the aggressions against Panama, Haiti, Iraq, and Somalia in the nineties. The world is now convinced that America is the most hostile state in history, and that it has encroached the most on the most important of human rights, namely, the right to live freely in a sovereign, independent state. Before this, the United States was the first nation in history to use, unnecessarily, a nuclear weapon that killed hundreds of thousands of people. Later, the United States was one of the most prominent states that turned its own people into guinea pigs and injected them with chemical and nuclear materials, which led to many years of torture for them, although laws prohibited the experiments. America's record of disdain for human rights is endless. It is the country that discriminates the most against other ethnic groups and races. It even reached the point where the non-white were considered equal to dogs and animals. So, does a state whose human rights record is this black have the right to speak about human rights and war crimes? Mankind is looking forward to the day when peoples will succeed in condemning those who were the first to use nuclear arms against people; chemical weapons against revolutionaries, freedom-loving people, and civilians; those who assassinated the leaders of liberation movements and spread vice and drugs in the world; and those who, with unmatched brutality, attacked civilian shelters and annihilated hundreds of thousands of children as a result of a shortage of medicine and malnutrition due to the blockade clamped on Iraq. When he speaks about Iraq's Kurds, as the one who defends them, Clinton looks like a circus clown who knows he has become a means to make his viewers laugh. The whole world knows, particularly the Kurds, that the most hideous persecution the Kurds had ever been exposed to is the one taking place now under the protection and blessing of Clinton. Turkey is carrying out a war of annihilation against its Kurds with Clinton's blessings and under his protection. However, concerning Iraq's Kurds, Clinton, just as his predecessor criminal Bush, also exposes them to annihilation, but in a different way. They are suffering from starvation, a lack of security, and the deliberate spread of disease and the destruction of the unity of the family. America's appointment of the thieves, smugglers, and killers of the Talabani and Barzani gangs, rulers of Iraq's Kurds, is in itself a systematic destruction of the Kurds' life. How can Clinton have the audacity to accuse Iraq of doing something that is a small part of what he does? The crimes America has perpetrated, and is perpetrating, against mankind requires that international observers be appointed at the Pentagon, the U.S. State Department, and CIA headquarters, in Indian reservations, the black cities, and the quarters of Hispanics exposed to ethnic and economic persecution and social discrimination. Clinton told Congress that "the Security Council member states are unanimous that Iraq has not complied with Security Council resolutions." Clinton's statement contradicts UN and other reports that made the international community change its attitude. This change was even apparent at the Security Council, when three permanent member states and eight nonpermanent member states, including some U.S. allies, have acknowledged that Iraq has largely complied with UN resolutions. Is there a fool in the whole world who would believe this nonsense? Is Clinton unaware that most nations now understand Iraq's view and are uncomfortable with U.S. custodianship? Speaking about the embargo, moreover, Clinton said: "The Iraqi Government distributes humanitarian supplies to its supporters and to the Army." This contradicts hard reality that supplies reach even the isolated autonomous region. This also contradicts international and U.S. reports prepared by committees that visited Iraq and admired the ration card system as a comprehensive system that covers all citizens, and not only a faction of the people. Finally, Clinton discussed the false story about the assassination of foreigners in the autonomous region, saying: "Documented reports show that the Iraqi Government is offering financial rewards for terrorist operations." We will not elaborate on this lie. We will only cite the fact that the U.S. State Department spokesman said the United States is checking this information. Also, a report by the United Nations did not make any accusations in this regard. So how can Clinton be so sure in his letter? Is this not a kind of falsification and deception of the highest legislative authority in the United States? Has Clinton forgotten that the warlords in northern Iraq, such as Talabani and Barzani, trade accusations about murder, theft, lack of security, and spread of vice? Is the CIA so incapable of knowing that there is no security in northern Iraq and that this allows for all kinds of crimes, including crimes against foreigners? Another thing. Why does Clinton find it strange for a German reporter to be killed and two others to be injured in a region where there is no security when dozens are killed daily in New York, as well as in other American cities. The last such incident was the killing of two Japanese people in America. Finally, we would like to tell Mr. Clinton the following: First, you are lying and you know that you are lying. This shows your dreadful moral decline, especially since you were an advocate of freedom. Second, you are lying to mislead Congress. This is a crime punishable by the U.S. Constitution and U.S. law. Third, you are helpless and driven to do all of this because hellish episodes have placed you in the middle of a hell of financial and sex scandals. You were shown a picture that condemns you and were asked to choose either killing and devouring the flesh of mankind so as to satisfy the urge of capitalism for theft in return for covering your deviations or facing scandal and receiving slaps from Hilary Clinton, the lady who makes your decisions, when these pictures are sent to her showing her the story of your romance before and after becoming president. Fourth, the lies you are telling today will result in killing more Iraqi children and elderly people and expose the Iraqi people to further pain and suffering. You are well aware of that. Therefore, you are a strong candidate to become a war criminal that can be easily guided toward organized crime. But you are mistaken, Mr. Clinton. The world is changing. The voices of freedom are getting louder, and you know that too. This is clear in your stupidities and nervousness that prove you are aware that the United States will be defeated and Iraq will triumph, just like all nations struggling for freedom, independence, and honor will triumph.
