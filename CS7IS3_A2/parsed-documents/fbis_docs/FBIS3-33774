Eight full days passed and only in Indonesia were the Muslims' feelings aroused. They forwarded a strongly worded protest to the German Government, while the Islamic institutions in Egypt maintained complete silence. Finally, the Religious Affairs Committee of the People's Assembly made a move and released a statement urging the boycott of the House of Chanel. The statement was issued after the house apologized to the Muslims and pledged to destroy the dress that was embroidered with Koranic verses and the dress's pictures and films. The Religious Affairs Committee discovered the tragedy after AL-WAFD published the story and the picture twice with sharp comment, appealing to those responsible for Islamic affairs in Egypt to move and confront the West's badness and depravity. The unconsciousness of the officials in Egypt could be tolerated in every other respect, but not in what causes harm to Islam and the holy Koran. We cannot but ask the People's Assembly: Where have you been all these past days? We also say to all religious bodies and organizations, at the top of which are al-Azhar's ulema: Wake up.
