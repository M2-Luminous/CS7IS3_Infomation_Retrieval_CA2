In this regard, Central Electoral Commission Chairman Ivan Yemets yesterday provided his explanations to the Ukrainian Radio and Television Company. [Begin Yemets recording] Actually, there are many such incongruities between the Constitution and Electoral Law. First, in four constituencies, the elections were held with the participation of one candidate, since others had withdrawn their candidacies. Article 89 of the Constitution says that any number of candidates can be included in a ballot. Following is a characteristic example. In the 147th constituency of Donetsk's Artemivskyy rayon, two candidates -- Chuprun and Panasovskyy -- were running in the elections. Panasovskyy won 49.3 percent of the votes, and all other candidates won less votes. Chuprun withdrew his candidacy, and the remaining five people refused to run, realizing that they had no chance. What should be done in such a case? Where to find one more candidate, if there are none in sight? Another question is the implementation of Article 48 of the Electoral Law. Who runs in run-off elections? As you know, run-off elections have been scheduled in 112 constituencies in Ukraine. In 92 constituencies where the elections were held but none of candidates won the required number of votes -- 50 percent -- those people cannot run again in the run-off elections. However, there are 20 constituencies in which the voters did not participate in the elections for some reason. The question arises as to whether those people who won in these constituencies can also participate in the run-off elections or not. The Central Electoral Commission has therefore asked the Supreme Council to provide its interpretation of these articles of the Electoral Law, and certain other articles, since there are many contradictions with the Constitution and other laws. This is why we have asked the Supreme Council to provide an interpretation of this law. [end recording]
