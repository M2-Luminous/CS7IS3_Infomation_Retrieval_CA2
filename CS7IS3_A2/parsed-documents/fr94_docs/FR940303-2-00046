Take notice that on February 9, 1994, Richfield Gas Storage System (Richfield) tendered for filing a petition pursuant to Rule 207 of the Rules of Practice and Procedure of the Commission's 18 CFR 385.207, either for waiver or exemption from the requirement set forth at ยง260.2 of the Commission's regulations to file the annual FERC Form No. 2&hyph;A report. Richfield states that since the Form No. 2&hyph;A is due by March 31, 1994, and that the Commission may not act on the instant petition until after the Form 2&hyph;A is due to be filed, Richfield also requests that the Commission waive compliance with the Form No. 2&hyph;A filing requirement while consideration of Richfield's petition is pending. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with 18 CFR Sections 385.214 and 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before March 4, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the public reference room.
