Magistrates and medical doctors who had so far stayed away from the industrial action this morning joined the striking workers. Louis Salef, general secretary of the Confederation of Cameroon Workers Union, explains the strike to Jean Mater Ndi: [Begin recording] [Salef] The strike order issued by the magistrates and medical doctors has been observed massively throughout the country. There were also diversionary tactics by the government. According to the head of state's message, it was suggested that career problems affecting doctors and magistrates would be revised, but this was only to amuse them. It was said that their salaries would be revised and increased by 50 percent from the reductions announced. All these are diversionary tactics. Today all these comrades, even from the private sector, felt the need to join us to efficiently carry out the struggle. [Ndi] What did you notice when you went around? [Salef] We noted that the Yaounde magistrates had gathered in a courtroom but were not working, which means that they were observing their strike order. At the Yaounde central hospital, for example, the strike order is being observed on a massive scale. However, we deplore that some strategies have been put in place to play down the strike and to intimidate the workers who would like to join their striking counterparts. [end recording]
