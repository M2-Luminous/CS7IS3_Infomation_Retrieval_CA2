Our correspondent Dan Preda informed us that the representatives of the UDMR made numerous critical remarks about the Government of Romania and accused it of having an attitude of duplicity and of lacking any real political will to solve the recommendations formulated for Romania upon our country's admittance to the Council of Europe. The UDMR representatives mentioned that, in the six months that have elapsed since the day when Romania joined the Council of Europe, no program for fulfilling the recommendations has been drafted or implemented. Likewise, the representatives of the UDMR affirmed that certain parties or political circles, both in the parliament as well as at the level of local administration in Romania, are still showing an attitude of intolerance and xenophobia. The UDMR representatives also criticized the attitude of the mayor of Cluj-Napoca Municipality and affirmed that he started implementing new discriminatory measures. The prefects were accused of taking abusive measures disfavoring the Hungarian minority as far as the bilingual signs and inscriptions are concerned. The UDMR leaders also mentioned that the parliament approved certain discriminatory articles or laws, and as an example they mentioned the law on war veterans and the police law. During the talks with the Council of Europe rapporteurs, the UDMR representatives mentioned that the pardoning decree signed by Romania's president, quote, only partially satisfied a written request of the UDMR, but since the act itself took place just before the arrival of the Council of Europe rapporteurs, it does not show a consistent policy aimed at implementing the recommendations of the Council of Europe, unquote. Senator Gyorgy Frunda said that the presidential decree was based on ethnic criteria and several members of the Executive Committee of the Romanian Communist Party of Hungarian origin have remained imprisoned. He also draw Mr. Koenig's attention to the fact that Pal Cseresznyes, condemned after the March 1990 events in Targu Mures, although not guilty, has still not been pardoned. Continuing their discussions, the rapporteurs met with representatives of Romanies and discussed the problems faced by this minority. During the talks, the Romanies discussed ways in which the court of justice approached cases that referred to the devastation of Romanies' dwellings in some counties. Finally, the two rapporteurs held a meeting with the representatives of the National Council for Minorities. Viorel Hrebenciuc, general secretary of the government, said that the law on minorities is in its final stage of drafting and the government will forward it to the parliament the moment it is ready. Mr. Hrebenciuc also said that he hopes that Romania will ratify the convention for human rights by 15 April. During the same talks, the representative of the (?Italian) minority affirmed that any ethnic minority has the right of veto in discussions that refer to that minority's own problems, and this does not justify any withdrawal from the Council of Minorities. The withdrawal of the Hungarian representatives from this council was considered as an example of lack of patience in finding solutions to certain problems. The head of the council, Viorel Hrebenciuc, also said that the establishment of this council shows the interest and political will to solve the problems of minorities in our country, and this is why the council has asked for a higher budget for this year than for the last year, our correspondent Dan Preda also informed us.
