He stood and warmly spoke to Shi Haifa, abbot of Luoyang's Baima Temple: "Please come sit in the front row!" When the abbot, who is over 70 years old and wore a patchwork outer vestment, sat down in the front row, Li Changchun, secretary of the Henan Provincial CPC Committee, stated to clinch the point: "Comrade Luo Gan is in charge of religious affairs in the State Council. This is a concrete demonstration of how he has attached importance to religious affairs!" When it was time for NPC deputies from Henan to express their views, the deputies vied with each other to speak first. Li Changchun held up his hand and said: "Please, let the abbot speak first, for people of religious circles have priority!" Shi Haifa then expressed his opinions on refurbishing scenic spots and developing tourist resources in Henan. Make a "Report" to Vice Premier Li When Vice Premier Li Lanqing took part in a group discussion, Director Hao Yanzhong of China No. 2 Grinding Wheel Plant began to speak. His first sentence was: "Let me report to Vice Premier Li first!" In the last year's NPC session, Li Lanqing had asked Director Hao: "Can your plant earn more than $10 million in foreign exchange in 1993?" Director Hao expressed his firm confidence at that time. Through hard work by staff members and workers of the entire plant, the plant's foreign exchange earnings increased from $8.25 million in 1992 to $10.86 million in 1994. After hearing his report, Vice Premier Li said with a smile: "Very well! However, you have merely accomplished your goal. Please work harder this year!" [passage omitted]
