It warns that the DPRK will counter hard line with hard line and its tough stance will be clearly shown in practice rather than in words. Commenting on the creation by the United States of a grave crisis that may lead the process of the solution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula to a collapse, the analyst says: Officially urging the DPRK to accept the unjustifiable demand of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for a comprehensive inspection, the United States is threatening that unless the demand is accepted it will not hold talks with the DPRK but take "sanctions". Worse still, they are even crying for a "special inspection" of the DPRK's two military sites which have nothing to do with nuclear activities. The U.S. official quarters are blaring that another military rehearsal targeted against the DPRK will be staged, if the "Team Spirit" joint military exercises are suspended this year, that it would take place in other region if not in South Korea. And the U.S. hardline conservative forces are promoting in full scale the supply of Patriot missils to the U.S. troops present in South Korea under the pretext of coping with the DPRK's "missile attack." The U.S. Administration hurriedly dispatched the director of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to South Korea at the beginning of the new year to have a confab for "the intensification of intelligence against North Korea" and is operating in South Korea an "intelligence supporting team" composed of specialists of the CIA and the Defence Intelligence Agency. This clearly indicates that the new war provocation moves of the United States against the DPRK have reached a full-scale stage. All the facts clearly prove that the United States has no intention at all to solve the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula peacefully and is still pursuing the purpose of strangling the DPRK and destroying socialism with strength at whatever cost. The United States should ponder over the matter, clearly understanding that with nothing can it frighten the Korean people.
