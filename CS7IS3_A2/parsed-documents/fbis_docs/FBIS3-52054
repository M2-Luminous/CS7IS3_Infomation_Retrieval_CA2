This was subsequently supported by the Soviet Union's demise. Perhaps Winston Churchill, who definitely marked the initiation of the Cold War following his 5 March 1946 speech at Fulton University, Missouri, United States of America, would not have been so optimistic if he could see several current conflicts now. The Korean case: For almost 40 years, the United States has virtually maintained an occupation force in South Korea. Currently it maintains 30,500 soldiers and 140 diverse types of combat planes in addition to the forces it maintains in Japan and other areas of the Pacific. These forces could also be used in case of a conflict in the region. On 12 March 1993, the DPRK decided to withdraw from the NPT [Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty], under pressure to have its territory unconditionally inspected by IAEA officials. This occurred after it was accused of making preparations to construct a nuclear weapon. Although there are ongoing negotiations, the situation in the peninsula continues to be tense. The anti-Korean campaign started at the beginning of 1993. The London SUNDAY TIMES affirmed the DPRK was on the verge of constructing the atomic bomb in an extensive April report. In its 28 November 1993 edition, the U.S. magazine NEWSWEEK, adding fuel to the fire (or maybe a little more "ice" to what was left of the Cold War), labelled the DPRK as "public enemy No. 1." The publication affirmed that the United States, the IAEA, and South Korea are "convinced" the North Koreans are dangerously close to constructing the atomic bomb. The Russian case: When the one-time powerful Soviet Union ceased to exist in December 1991, the consolidation of friendship and relations between Russia and the United States reached unprecedented levels in the military field. In addition to disarmament agreements, on 8 September 1993 a memorandum of understanding was signed between the U.S. Defense Department and the Defense Ministry of the Russian Federation. This was, according to the document, within the framework of "leaving behind forever the years of nuclear confrontation and superpower rivalry." Some U.S. officials have reiterated that Russia is no longer an enemy of the United States, and therefore the possibility of a nuclear attack being initiated against the United State from Russian territory has been reduced Nevertheless, the U.S. combat forces' training program maintains a high level of periodic offensive actions. According to the so-called strategists, their main adversaries are the former USSR republics that have nuclear weapons, particularly the Russian Federation. Their activities include several nuclear rocket targeting tests and the implementation of massive strategic bombings. The report labeled "Total Revision: Forces for a New Era," presented by Les Aspin, U.S. secretary of defense, dated 1 September 1993, after reasserting that the Cold War is over, acknowledges: "The dangers that nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction represent, including the dangers associated with the proliferation of chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons, associated with the high levels of those weapons that are still present in the former Soviet Union." [sentence as received] General George L. Butler, chief of the U.S. Armed Forces Strategic Command, in statements to THE NEW YORK TIMES at the beginning of March, in referrence to the "target" of U.S. intercontinental rockets, said: "We do not only concentrate on the former Soviet Union but also on any potentially hostile country that possesses or that is attempting to possess weapons of mass destruction. It appears the Cold War is not over... definitely not for the Russians either. The Cuban case: The Cuban-U.S. conflict gained a new dimension following the revolution's victory on 1 January 1959. Nevertheless, its roots date back many years before Churchill's speech, and even before the springing up of socialism as a system. It is rooted in the imperialists' appetite for the "sugar island," their theory of a "ripe fruit," and based on the Monroe Doctrine (America for the Americans) and other similar theories. The U.S. Administrations has attempted to isolate, weaken, and defeat the revolution through invasion, the well-known assassination attempts, the economic blockade (taken to its highest levels ever), hostile propaganda, and all types of harassment. During the "Cold War," the United States considered Cuba a USSR satellite and, therefore, a threat to its national security. This is the reason for those Sunday nuclear targeting tests against the small island, while the majority of its resident slept or were getting ready for their daily voluntary work in the countryside and the cities. Although for some theoreticians, the Cold War was officially over in December of 1991, the empire's policy toward Cuba has turned more dramatic since then. The stepping up of the economic blockade with the so-called "Law for Democracy in Cuba," know as the "Torricelli Law," represents one more escalation in this "specific cold war" the U.S. Government is waging against Cuba. This comes at a time when the world is rapidly expanding measures that encourage free trade. But revolutionary Cuba, the Cuba that has always been ready to help everyone, does not have rights. Cuba must be persecuted; it must be cornered, strangled, and starved if it does not surrender; this is how things are in the economic, political, and military fields. The U.S. Armed Forces will use any pretext to maintain a permanent presence in areas near Cuba -- whether the struggle against drugs or the situation in Haiti. Several U.S. Navy warships and Coast Guards ships are always kept a short distance from our coasts. The U.S. Armed Forces have continued to carry out extensive exercises and maneuvers around our nation, despite the alleged end of the "Cold War." In 1992, for example, the U.S. Armed Forces were engaged in the Ocean Venture Exercise that included the landing of amphibious craft on Puerto Rico and the passing of large naval convoys, including aircraft carriers and amphibious ships, near Cuba. This coincided with the Trade Winds Exercise carried out in the eastern Caribbean, which included a mock naval blockade on a Caribbean island. Also, after the "end of the Cold War," the Unites States maintains on Cuba territory -- against the will and wish of our government and our people -- Guantanamo Naval Base in the southeastern part of the country. The United States was able to impose this base under leonine conditions on the budding pseudo- republic more than 90 years ago. From this base -- a base that costs U.S. taxpayers approximately $821,917 a day -- they annually engage in violations of our airspace and national waters by combat aircraft and ships that visit the base. In addition, since its installation, scores of provocations have been staged against our border brigade guards. Their soldiers in this military enclave periodically carry out military exercises in which even the alleged massive arrival of Cuban refugees from nonoccupied territory has been simulated. The immigration issue is another factor that "could make one think" that the "Cold War" has not concluded. While the United States puts up a three-meter metal wall (similar to the one they brought down in Berlin), to prevent the crossing of "illegal aliens" from Mexico into U.S. territory, they encourage illegal departures from Cuba. They do not care who these individuals are, be they mere traitors or common criminals; all are received with open arms in Miami. At Guantanamo Naval Base they also encourage illegal departures, without taking into account the danger this represents. Those who attempt these departures run the risk of perishing because of the mines placed on either side of the fence. Nevertheless, a high percentage of those Cuban citizens who officially request an entry visa at the U.S. Interests Office are refused. After reviewing these specific facts, any reader, even though he may not be an expert in international politics, could at least question whether the Cold War is truly over.
