A corresponding intergovernmental agreement has been concluded and construction will be financed from the $100 million which Japan has earmarked as aid for Russia and the CIS countries for dismantling nuclear weapons. Selection of a maritime waste storage system was conditioned by the Maritime Kray people's opposition to storage of radioactive substances on land. In this way Tokyo will contribute to speeding up the stalled process of nuclear disarmament in the Far East, particularly where nuclear submarines are concerned, since only the unsolved problem of liquid radioactive waste is hampering their dismantlement. Presently the tanker TNT-5 [on which liquid waste is stored] has been moved from the bay near Bolshoy Kamen village further south to Pavlovskogo Bay.
