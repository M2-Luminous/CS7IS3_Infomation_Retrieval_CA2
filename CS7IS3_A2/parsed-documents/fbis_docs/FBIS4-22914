The determinations were carried out in the region of Orsha, Mogilev and Rechitsa townships above and below the population points. It was shown that the water content of petroleum products and phenols exceeded the maximum permissible concentration. In respect to petroleum products, the most contaminated river segment was in the vicinity of Orsha. The phenol content in water was higher downstream from Orsha and Mogilev. It was noted that during the past years the concentration of SAS in the Dnipro river water increased in the vicinity of Orsha and Mogilev. Figure 1; references 9.
