He also denied speculations that the United States shifted from its earlier position and is now willing to engage in Moscow-proposed multilateral conference to defuse the North Korean nuclear crisis. Tarnoff, heading home after his two-day visit to Seoul, said at an airport news conference that the priority focus is to push a sanction resolution at the United Nations. U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, emerging from talks with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, was quoted as saying that Washington is willing to positively consider the eight-way conference Russia suggested to discuss the North Korean nuclear issue. For now, adopting a Security Council resolution has to come foremost than any multilateral conference, Tarnoff said, adding that the resolution will be ready within days. Tarnoff was optimistic about China's cooperation on U.N. resolution, saying that Beijing fully understands the seriousness of the current situation. Knowing that, China will act in harmony as a member of the international community, he said. Asked whether Carter will carry any message from President Bill Clinton when he visits North Korea next week, the undersecretary emphasized that the ex-President goes to North Korea as a private citizen. Washington, therefore, has no intention to deliver a message through him, he said.
