FR941116-2-00061 FR941116-2-00048 Power Rate Adjustment: Mission Valley Power Utility, Montana ACTION: Notice of Proposed Rate Increase. SUMMARY: The Bureau of Indian Affairs is proposing to increase the cost of electric power (energy) to customers of Mission Valley Power (MVP), the entity operating the power facility of the Flathead Indian Irrigation Project of the Flathead Reservation. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) has been informed that the Montana Power Company (MPC), which sells electric power to MVP, has raised its wholesale power rates by approximately 2.0 percent. The MPC increase went into effect on September 5, 1994, and is based on adjustments in the Consumer Price index pursuant to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission license for MPC's Kerr Dam Hydroelectric Facility. Accordingly, the BIA is proposing to adjust the local retail power rates charged by MVP to reflect the increased cost of purchased power. DATES: Comments must be submitted on or before December 16, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments on rate changes should be sent to: Assistant Secretary_Indian Affairs, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Attn: Branch of Irrigation and Power, MS # 4559&hyph;MIB, 1849 ``C'' Street NW, Washington, D.C. 20240. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Area Director, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Portland Area Office, 911 N.E. 11th Avenue, Portland, Oregon 97232&hyph;4169, telephone (503) 231&hyph;6702; or, General Manager, Mission Valley Power, P. O. Box 890, Polson, Montana 59860&hyph;0890. Telephone (406)883&hyph;5361 or 1&hyph;800&hyph;823&hyph;3758 (in-State Watts). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The authority to issue this document is vested in the Secretary of the Interior by 5 U.S.C. 301; the Act of August 7, 1946, c. 802, Section 3 (60 Stat. 895; 25 U.S.C. 385c); the Act of May 25, 1948 (62 Stat. 269); and the Act of December 23, 1981, section 112 (95 Stat. 1404). The Secretary has delegated this authority to the Assistant Secretary_Indian Affairs pursuant to part 209 Departmental Manual, Chapter 8. 1A and Memorandum dated January 25, 1994, from Chief of Staff, Department of the Interior, to Assistant Secretaries, and Heads of Bureaus and Offices. The approximate 2.0 percent MPC increase causes the BIA to raise its retail rates to recover $24,529 which is the financial impact of that increase. Accordingly, the proposed rate increase will flow through MVP to MPC to offset the increased cost of wholesale energy. This proposed adjustment is the result of an increase in the electric power rates charged by MPC, one of three sources of electric power marketed by MVP. The MPC increase, which went into effect on September 5, 1994, is based on adjustments in the Consumer Price index pursuant to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission license for MPC's Kerr Dam Hydroelectric Facility.
