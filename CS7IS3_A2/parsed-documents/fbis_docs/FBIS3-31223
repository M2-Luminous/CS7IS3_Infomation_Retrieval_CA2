He will probably keep his office of defense minister even when he is party chairman. Our correspondent interviewed him on issues he will be responsible for in his two capacities. [passage omitted] [Vajda] The situation is different from that before 1990 and you are probably thinking in terms of some kind of coalition. I assume that various versions emerge. [MDF Deputy Chairman Sandor] Lezsak, whose views are considered to be close to yours in many respects, once said that he cannot imagine any kind of cooperation with the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz], the main reason being its attitude toward the churches. Do you share Lezsak's view on this? [Fur] More or less I do, although he said this rather a long time ago, perhaps two months ago.... The Fidesz appears to be undergoing a big process of change. It is impossible to know its direction because all changes, if the Fidesz's mentality will indeed change, are difficult to accomplish. It is difficult to give up the habits. It is a fact that they have lately been proclaiming that the Fidesz is a center party and wishes to remain so, it has a national commitment, it fully represents the cause of the Hungarian national minorities, and it wishes to remain free of all extremisms. This, I believe, means distancing from the extreme right as well as the extreme left or left-wing parties. In my view, it would not now be possible to say that we will not enter into any kind of political dialogue with the Fidesz under any circumstances, but we cannot say that let us embrace each other, either. [passage omitted] [Vajda] Let us turn to the Army. To be frank: Is it able to function? [Fur] The current situation is indeed very difficult but this is not a result of the past two to three years. The last big purchases were done in the first half of the 1970's. A little was also done in the early 1980's but nothing at all has been bought in the past 10 to 15 years. This is not to mention the structures, barracks, buildings, and dwellings. The last big constructions took place in the 1950's and 1960's, nothing has been done since then. Not even maintenance. It is not in these two to three years that everything is trying to fall on top of us, this is the result of a long process. Everyone is aware of the country's economic situation. Whenever it was possible, I fought tooth and nail for increasing our budget. It would hardly have been possible to achieve more than what we actually received, and even this is reduced by various taxes and levies. I know that for a lieutenant who has basic problems of survival -- whether he can buy meat for himself or he can pay rent or heating -- this is poor comfort but this is how much we have. If the government accepts the proposal on the legal status of soldiers and it is also passed by Parliament then the pay of regular soldiers can significantly be increased possibly this year, but certainly from 1995. [passage omitted] [Vajda] Are you, the first team of the change of the regime, a little bitter because your hopes of receiving Western help -- for example, in developing the Army, among other things -- have not really materialized? During talks with your Western colleagues, do you express that a certain amount of disappointment exists because of this? [Fur] I certainly voice these feelings. I partly express our disappointment because we did not manage to make any progress, or at least we did not really manage to start including modern technology in the Hungarian Army. We also express our feeling of regret because this region has not received the necessary guarantees we would have liked in the area of security. [Vajda] You are obviously also thinking of the case when we allowed certain aerial activity in our airspace, and [former] Prime Minister Antall had asked for definite guarantees -- and this was leaked in the Western press -- but we did not receive these, either. [Fur] AWACS planes circled above us at that time. As for guarantees, we received verbal promise that any kind of harm to Hungary would at the same time mean a challenge for the West and it would not leave it at that. However, it is difficult to know what this actually means in practice. This kind of disappointment exists in Hungary and in other countries of the region. On the other hand, it will still be possible to make progress through the new partnership, if in nothing else then in establishing real military links because, up to now, we have only had visits.... [Vajda] Nevertheless, this is a little less than what you wanted. [Fur] It is less because obviously we wanted more, but this is what we can have and we have to make do with this. More precisely, we will have to be able to make good use of this because certain possibilities do exist here. For example, we might be able to start bringing in small amounts of new technology mainly through setting up and operating the peacekeeping forces. Normalization With Serbia [Vajda] What do we expect from the Russians? What will happen to the remainder of their debt? [Fuir] As a minister, I would be happiest if we managed to settle this remaining $800 million through some military purchases, but other viewpoints also exist. We do not yet fully know the Russian views, either. In Russia, various guesses and ideas emerge from time to time but I do not know if they all have a realistic basis. [Vajda] A military expert actually wrote that the leadership of the Defense Ministry, including the minister, are in love with the E300 defense system. Have we really fully committed ourselves to this system? [Fur] This is not a matter of love, this is a forced situation. [Vajda] However, do we need this system? [Fur] We would need it. Our sky still has a hole in it. This system would be the best one to fill this hole. [Vajda] The reconstruction of the MiG-21s: Have you managed to achieve anything with the Israelis who, as it is known, deal with modernizing the airplanes? Is there a realistic hope or are we going to throw out these airplanes? [Fur] No, we do not want to discard them. This also depends on the budget and on what methods the Israelis happen to find to modernize them. We have looked at a few bases in Israel where this is done. They would be ready to modernize these airplanes; they are also conducting talks with other countries on similar issues. The question is whether we can assign adequate funds to this and whether they can give us favorable offers on future payments or other financial methods. A number of solutions can exist. [Vajda] You were a champion of developing military links with our neighbors, namely Slovakia and Romania. Relations with the Serbs have come on the agenda in Hungarian foreign policy. Can we expect some kind of settlement of Hungarian-Serbian relations? [Fur] We have had links and still have them, mainly in the areas of aerial control and air defense. [Vajda] All the public can see from this is that the Serbian military attache is called in and we protest against the aerial violations over Szeged. [Fur] We also have other contacts and we have had higher level meetings in the past period where these cases of border violations, more precisely, the ways to prevent them, were discussed. Recently, since the fighting moved over to Bosnia, we have not really had any such events. Our military contacts have not been severed although, as it is known, the Serbian, or little Yugoslavian, higher level military leadership has been replaced three times in the past two to three years. The 1990 leadership was replaced in 1992, then these were also replaced later including the generals, the leadership, and everything. [Vajda] This also happens in Hungary below the level of minister.... [Fur] Not to this extent.... In our case, this is a natural turnover while there, I believe, an artificial replacement took place. The main point is that we do have contacts, and I trust that, if we manage to settle relations on a political level -- as [Foreign Minister] Geza Jeszenszky's recent visit to Belgrade indicated this, having confidence in advance -- then higher level or top level meetings can also take place. [Vajda] Would you accept an invitation to Belgrade? [Fur] I certainly would if the conditions were right.
