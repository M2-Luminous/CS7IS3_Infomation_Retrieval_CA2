FR940526-0-00003 FR940526-0-00002 5 CFR Part 532 RIN 3206&hyph;AF73 Prevailing Rate Systems; Definition of Santa Clara, CA, NAF Wage Area to Alameda-Contra Costa, CA, NAF Wage Area AGENCY: Office of Personnel Management. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is issuing a final rule to abolish the Santa Clara, California, Nonappropriated Fund (NAF) Federal Wage System wage area for paysetting purposes. The Santa Clara NAF wage area is composed of Santa Clara County (survey area) and San Mateo County (area of application). The host activity for the Santa Clara NAF wage area survey, Naval Air Station Moffett Field, will close on July 1, 1994, and did not have the capability to carry out the local wage survey scheduled to begin in the Santa Clara NAF wage area in September 1993. No other installation in the Santa Clara NAF wage area had the capability to conduct a wage survey. This regulation redefines Santa Clara and San Mateo Counties to the area of application of the Alameda-Contra Costa, California, NAF wage area. EFFECTIVE DATE: June 27, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mark Allen, (202) 606&hyph;2848. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On December 29, 1993, OPM published an interim rule (58 FR 68715) to abolish the Santa Clara, California, NAF wage area for pay-setting purposes and redefine its constituent counties to the Alameda-Contra Costa, California, NAF wage area as areas of application. The interim rule provided a 30-day period for public comment. OPM received no comments during the comment period. Therefore, the interim rule is adopted as a final rule. Regulatory Flexibility Act I certify that these regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because they affect only Federal agencies and employees.
