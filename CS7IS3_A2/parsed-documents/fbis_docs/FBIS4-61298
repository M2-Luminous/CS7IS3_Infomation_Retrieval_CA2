France is interested in expanding cooperation with the independent Ukrainian state, he said. To assist this, agreements have been signed in the course of the visit on the encouragement and protection of investments, on air transport, on cultural exchanges, and on youth and sport cooperation and exchanges. [passage omitted] During their visit to Ukraine, the French delegation discussed issues concerning energy resources and nuclear power engineering. France has proposed, Mr. Lamassoure noted, that issues regarding nuclear power engineering in Ukraine be discussed at the forthcoming G-7 summit in Naples. France is offering Ukraine help in preparing a project to shut down all generating sets at the Chernobyl nuclear electric power station and complete the construction of three generating sets at other nuclear electric power stations to compensate for power losses caused by the closure. "We do realize, however, that the cost of these projects is very high and that only international financial support will enable Ukraine to carry them out," Mr. Lamassoure stressed. France is ready to promise such support to Ukraine, he said.
