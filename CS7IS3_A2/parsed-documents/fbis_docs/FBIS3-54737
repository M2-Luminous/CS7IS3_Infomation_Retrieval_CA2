According to the chief of staff, the three analytical centers that used to work separately to the president will shortly be reorganized into a single unit. This unit, or council of experts, will concentrate all analysis coming in from the various research structures and draw up recommendations for the president, the government, and Russian regional leaders. The council of experts, as the prototype for a future administration of the head of state, will work on the president's special programs and on his yearly greetings messages.
