An Interview With the Well-Known Economist Wu Xiang"] [Text] Abstract: The sluggish increase in farm incomes is the key to our rural problems, one which affects development of the national economy. Why is this happening? The cause lies in our inability so far to understand, either in theory or in practice, that increases in farm income and labor force transfers are key points of agricultural problems, rural problems, and farmers' problems. The obstacle to understanding comes from the thinking and concepts produced under the planned economic system, expressed chiefly in the attitude toward the development of township enterprises. In addition, some people are expressing the view that transfer of the rural labor force will affect agriculture's stable development. However, many years' experience with reform proves that the development of enterprises is of considerable benefit to the stable development of agriculture; therefore, bringing up the prerequisite that "without agriculture there is no stability" should now be "without industry there is no stability in agriculture." How to resolve rural problems, agricultural problems, and farmers' problems, while carrying out further rural reform? Renewed concepts and changed ideas are the preconditions for resolving rural problems, while at the same time unifying understanding from upper leadership to localities, ensuring that the general goal of the next step in rural reform is to increase farmers' income and implement transfer of the rural labor force. With this objective, we must widen our sights in developing agriculture, paying attention not just to agriculture itself, but rather stressing the simultaneous development of agriculture, township enterprises, and small towns. There must be total support for and development of private enterprises, individually owned enterprises, and the joint-stock system. We must establish and perfect the various key markets. Looking at the goal of achieving a comfortable standard of living in the 1990s, the next six years presents a rather heavy assignment, so it is urgent that we promptly establish appropriate objectives and missions for further rural reform, as well as formulate supportive policies. This reporter had been planning for quite some time to interview the economist Wu Xiang [0702 6272], who had participated in the work of formulating the primary policies for rural reform. When the figure of an average increase of 2 percent for farmers was announced, it gave me the impetus to turn this plan into reality. Sluggish growth in farmers' incomes is the key rural problem and the key factor affecting the domestic economy. Agriculture is in good shape at present, if we are looking at the supply situation for agricultural products and by-products in urban and rural markets. However, if we go deep into the countryside, we will find that there are many problems there and with agriculture--the comparative benefits of farming have declined, with low enthusiasm and heavy burdens. Such phenomena as irregular circulation channels, "sales difficulties" and "payment in IOUs" appear frequently. Sixty percent of the counties exist on financial subsidy from the central government, some not affording salary payments. Relations are tense between cadres and the masses. Wu Xiang stated that these problems were closely related, but the key point was the sluggish growth in farmers' income. In his opening remarks, and without prior consultation, Wu Xiang agreed with the topic of my interview. He said that the growth in farmers' incomes was not only related to the development of the countryside, but also directly affected the development of the national economy. Foreign media have commented recently that the economic power of the developing areas along China's coast, such as Guangdong, has been quite close to that of the four Asian dragons, with the difference that behind the coastal areas, there is a rural market of nearly 800 million population. Also, based on national investigation documents: at present, 50 percent of farm families can sustain a livelihood only through what they produce on the farm, with a zero commercial rate; 35 percent of the farmers are able to market less than 30 percent of their total agricultural produce, just maintaining simple reproduction; only 15 percent of farmers have a commercial rate higher than 30 percent. Wu Xiang said that this document shows that the majority of China's farming families can only maintain simple reproduction, carrying out exchange of produce on a small scale and allocation and consumption within their families. The extensive countryside that foreign nations call "precious land" is actually just a piece of virgin land. We must understand clearly the farmers' level of prosperity, and make correct evaluations in order to establish better policies. Transferring the surplus labor force is the key to increasing farmers' income. [NONGMIN RIBAO] According to your meaning, the goal of further reform in the countryside is to increase farmers' income. On this point, the central government has all along made many policies; but why have there been no substantial gains? [Wu Xiang] That is so. After the masses of farmers had resolved the problem of having sufficient food and clothing, they went after currency instead of agricultural products. But the real result was that increasing production did not increase income. The average annual income gain of Chinese farmers from 1989 to 1991 was only 0.7 percent, lower than the average rate before rural reforms were implemented. To increase farmers' income, the state has repeatedly raised grain prices, but the fact is, while the cost of agriculture has accelerated growth, the profits from price rises in the end have not gone to the farmers. On the other hand, prices of most agricultural products have opened up, some of them approaching the international market. Once China is officially back in GATT, the prices in the international market will be close to the maximum price of agricultural products in the domestic market..., there is plenty of evidence that there is only a slight possibility of raising farmers' incomes through large scale hikes in the price of agricultural products. Therefore, to increase farmers' income we should look for ways which lie outside agriculture, and these ways are: adjust the industrial structure, vigorously developing secondary and tertiary industry, transfer the surplus rural labor force, and then gradually enlarging the operational scale of agriculture. There is a mutual cause and effect relationship between growth in farm income and transfer of the surplus labor force: these are two aspects of the same problem, the key to ongoing rural reform and development. The more fully we understand this problem, the better its resolution, and we can establish good circulation within a shorter time. Otherwise, not only agriculture, but the rural economy and even the entire nation's economic development will suffer serious disruption, making the realization of a well-off living standard and the four modernizations just empty talk. Moreover, various contradictions which affect stability and unity will be more intense, and if they pile up, there will be danger of an explosion. This is absolutely not an exaggeration just to scare people. At present, in China's rural areas there is a surplus labor force of as much 120 million people, and it is estimated that this will reach 200 million people by the end of this century. They are desperate to leave their hometowns and lands to seek higher incomes, but our lack of definite knowledge concerning this aspect has led to, on the one hand, the "tide of flowing workers" becoming stronger every year, and bringing massive social problems with it. On the other hand, the majority of farmers must remain in the countryside against their will, and keep on planting. This often creates misconceptions, hiding the seriousness of the problem; indeed, this is exactly where the danger lies. It is high time that we give a great deal of attention to this problem and deal with it. The labor force transfer problem is unclear, regardless of whether it is in our understanding or in practice. [NONGMIN RIBAO] The calls for transfer of the labor force and conversion of the industrial structure are not weak; to what do you want us to pay greater attention? [Wu Xiang] Since the 14th Party Congress of the CPC fixed the socialist market economy as our target model of reform, the voices calling for us to pay attention to the problem of farmers' income growth have become stronger. The central government and the State Council have issued repeated injunctions to reduce farmers' burden and increase investment in agriculture. This session of the central government's conference on rural work again stressed the problems of agriculture, the countryside, and farmers. Therefore, resolution of the problems is getting closer. But one point that has not been clarified and resolved completely is that farmers' income growth and transfer of the rural labor force are the keys for agriculture, the countryside, and farmers; therefore, it is really impossible to resolve the problem through agricultural slogans. [NONGMIN RIBAO] What do you think is blocking people's understanding of the problem? [Wu Xiang] Generally speaking, concepts and ideas produced under the planned economy system still exercise a malign influence, the only difference being that it pops up in different forms at different times. From the first organization of cooperatives to just before rural reform, millions of farmers contributed firsthand an accumulation of 600 billion to 800 billion yuan, but they were unable to share in the civilization and development brought on by industrial development. Under the dual urban-rural structure established in this way, farmers have no freedom to move and select their jobs, and even the children of farmers are bound to the land with their parents, bringing on a situation whereby 800 million farmers, engaged in making the food we eat, do not have enough to eat or wear themselves. This remains fresh in our minds. We must take serious reference from this historical fact. Fundamentally, the key point in China's reform is to break the dual structure which separates urban and rural, and transfer large batches of the surplus rural labor force from agricultural production. But in practice, there are still some leading cadres who just do not understand this. In 1985, there was a several tens of billion jin drop in grain production, followed by three years of rising and falling. Cities and some leading departments reacted strongly to this; they thought that the problems stemmed from agricultural, even rural, policies; some people even argued that these ups and downs in grain production was actually following the ups and downs in policies. But farmers had a totally different reaction, because the drop of grain production was compensated for by the rapid development of township enterprises, so farmers' incomes still showed some increase. What is more important, millions of farmers found new hope in the development of township enterprises. China's farmers have surmounted massive obstacles by their surprising indomitability and will, they have supported development of township enterprises, and have been called "an abruptly emerging new force," but some comrades are still suspicious of township enterprises, even looking down upon them or speaking accusingly of them. In fact, the bulk of farmers' income growth has come from township enterprises, this has been proven by practice: "without industry, there is no prosperity." But people who hold the old concepts of the planned economy system can't see the positive aspects of developing township enterprises, and of course they find it impossible to put the emphasis in developing the countryside and the rural economy on developing township enterprises, transferring the labor force, and increasing farmers' income. The prerequisite of no stability without agriculture is "no agricultural stability without industry." [NONGMIN RIBAO] Quite a few people think that so much emphasis on farmers' income growth and transfer of the rural labor force will affect grain production's lasting and stable growth. What is your thinking on this? [Wu Xiang] My answer is don't worry. Everyone knows that the problem of feeding over 1.1 billion people is a huge task, one that cannot be sluggish at any time. If there should be any trouble in grain production, no one can help us. The problem is how to guarantee the continuous and stable development of agriculture and grain production. Practice has proven that producing grain solely with grain production in mind, or farming solely with farming in mind, will just lead us down a narrow path, and this doesn't work, especially under market economic conditions. When there were major problems with township enterprises, there were some people accusing it of being the evil root of the rise and fall in grain production, their reason being that the best labor in the countryside all moved to industry to make money. In fact, there is no evidence for this talk. In some developed coastal regions, with cuts in the amount of land for grain, total grain production dropped, but there was a rise in the per mu average production, not a decline. Furthermore, there was a dramatic rise in agricultural productive value. In the Wenzhou area, among more than six million people, the average land owned was just over four fen. This is even less than in southern Jiangsu and the Pearl River Delta. Despite the vigorous development of family industry and township enterprises, the agricultural productive value still rose continuously, both the average production per mu and total production. The three years of rising and falling grain production which began in 1985 involved complex, multifaceted problems which require detailed analysis. I won't talk about that here. But it is certain that the fundamental root of China's poverty and backwardness is that we have 900 million farmers engaging in producing food grains. Wherever there are fewer farmers directly engaged in the food grains business, where the labor force has transferred, and township enterprises are developed, then farmers' income have increased, and there has been hope for agricultural modernization. So, I believe the prerequisite of "no stability without agriculture" should be "no agricultural stability without industry." If we really want to guarantee the continuous and stable development of agriculture and grain production, and not just talk about it, we must "play the pipe backwards"; that is, first to pay attention to developing agriculture, developing township enterprises, transferring the surplus labor force, adjusting the industrial structure, and gradually enlarging the operational scale of agriculture. What should the future course be? [NONGMIN RIBAO] In your opinion, how should we be dealing with the current problems in the countryside, in agriculture, and with farmers. And how to get started? [Wu Xiang] Based on the facts mentioned above, I suggest such countermeasures as: 1) While emphasizing that the problems of agriculture, the rural areas, and farmers are relevant to the fundamental problems of the entire situation of the party and the state, we should be emphatic that farmers' income growth and transfer of the rural labor force is the key to these problems; it should be taken as the starting point of all rural policies, and be put in the forefront of all rural work. Leading organs and cadres at all levels should take this as their guiding thought. There should also be education in this for all rural cadres, for renewed concepts and changed ideas are prerequisite to resolving these problems. 2) To guarantee continuous and stable growth in agriculture and grain production, we should discontinue the old way of farming just with farming in mind, and producing grain with just grain production in mind. We must gradually reduce and even stop the administrative interference of planned economics, taking new measures appropriate to the laws of economics, to protect grain planting families from loss, and insure that grain-selling regions make profits. Implement an agricultural development policy of high production, excellent quality, and high efficiency. I believe that putting excellent quality ahead of high production is more scientific in many respects. 3) Enlarge our vision of agricultural development: we should go from the small scale of 1.5 billion mu of cultivated land to the large scale of 9.65 million square kilometers. Vigorously develop agriculture, carry out construction in mountainous areas, engage in the breeding business and the processing of agricultural products and by-products; in this way a certain amount of the labor force will be absorbed in local areas. Providing work as a form of relief and constructing roads in the near future can not only add job opportunities but also create the conditions for selling agricultural products and by-products. We should extend the concept of capital construction on farmland to capital construction in agriculture, making for continuous improvement in the rural infrastructure. 4) The vigorous development of township enterprises and small towns is the major channel for increasing farmers' income and transferring the rural labor force. The eastern region should pay more attention to developing export-oriented enterprises, improving their technical level, striving for high level, big scale, and excellent quality. The central and western regions absolutely must not stop developing because of their poor foundation and past lack of success; rather, they should organize cooperative projects between the eastern and western regions which are based on local situations, attracting capital and technology, developing competitive products, converting their resources advantage into a merchandizing advantage. Small towns are the seat of secondary and tertiary industry, and it just won't do to not develop small towns, especially when it comes to developing service industries. Counties are the link between urban and rural, models for small town development throughout the whole county. Doing a good job of comprhensive reform and county construction at the county level is of extreme importance in developing the rural economy. 5) There must be deeper reform, and accelerated market development. Without a pluralistic market entity, there will be no market economy. Therefore, we should encourage simultaneous development of the State owned, collective, privately owned, and individual economies. Defining the property rights for individual and privately owned operations, powerful competition, and substantial efficiency wil have an outstanding effect in absorbing surplus labor. We should develop these with complete confidence. The joint-stock system is just unfolding in the countryside, we should give full support to promoting its further healthy development, maximizing its role of allocating social resources. As for developing the commercial market, we should establish markets for the various key factors, especially the labor force market and financial market, develop various intermediary organizations, cooperative organizations, and scientific and technical service organizations, linking the markets and the farmers. This will contribute to improving farmers' income. Calculating by what is needed to accomplish the goal of being well off, the annual rate of increase in farmers' income should be 5 percent in the 1990s, but due to deficits in the first four years of the decade, it will be harder in the next six years. Therefore, we should not miss the opportunity to establish correct targets and missions for further rural reforms. Moreover, it is urgent that we adopt take appropriate corresponding policies, for we absolutely cannot lower our guard.
