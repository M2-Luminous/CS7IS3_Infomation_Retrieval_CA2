A declaration was signed that specifies that the parliamentary opposition parties believe that the reshuffle was carried out by ignoring the parliament; thus the situation has been reached that a third of the current government is made up of people who have not been confirmed by the parliament. At the same time, the party leaders expressed their common attitude toward the replacement of Lieutenant General Niculae Spiroiu as head of the Ministry of National Defense within the context, quote, of intolerable extremist attacks against the military institution, something that creates great concern about the modernization and reform process, a measure that will exert a negative effect on the army and that will lead to the instability of basic institutions of the Romanian state, unquote. The declaration expresses the parties' joint position in connection with the attacks -- which are viewed as immoral -- against former political detainees of the communist regime coming, quote, from some of the most docile servants of that regime, unquote. In conclusion of the declaration, all the leaders of the opposition parties call on those responsible within the current government majority not to waste the chance for a rapid recovery of the material situation of our country's citizens. Our reporter has also informed us that the PD(FSN) secretary, Mr. Cristian Radulescu, specified that tomorrow's planned meeting between the PDSR [Social Democracy Party of Romania] and the PD(FSN) has been postponed until next week. The date will be announced later. The reason for the postponement is the prolongation of the PDSR permanent delegation meeting that will be held tomorrow.
