Kouts, whom Interior Minister Heiki Arike appointed as head of a working group to investigate the incident, held yesterday and today talks with Russian border guard officials. "The talks haven't so far brought a definite result," Kouts said. "The Russian officials claimed they hadn't as yet been authorized to let the Kurds back into Russia, but they didn't deny that they ought to receive them." Kouts confirmed that the chief of Russia's Pskov border guard unit wanted to solve the Kurdish issue on the level of the two countries' border guard authorities, without involving the foreign ministries. The leader of the Estonian border guards told BNS there was no information to confirm allegations that some Estonian officials were paid for allowing the Kurds into the country. "The Kurds give contradictory statements and are afraid to speak, because they were smuggled into Estonia by the Russian mafia and people's lives may be at stake," Kouts explained. He said it is not yet clear what transport the Kurds used. The Interior Ministry told BNS the Kurds claimed to have arrived in Estonia Tuesday [5 April] night from Moscow in two groups in closed containers. They also said they paid go-betweens for being taken into the country. The Kurds were detained on Wednesday in an apartment house in Tallinn's Kopli district. The group comprised 21 men, 16 women and 21 children.
