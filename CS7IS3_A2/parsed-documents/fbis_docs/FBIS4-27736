It was only with the April opening of the Thai-Lao Mittraphap bridge, that the land-locked country of six million people began to attract the attention of the world media. But most of the interest was in its economic potential as it warily opens its doors to foreign investment and market economics. However, if Laos is to take advantage of the dynamism that has become the hallmark of many of the region's economies it will first have to develop its human resources. "There is a lack of understanding at the top leadership level about how to develop and mobilize basic human resources to take up the immense challenges of this development decade," said Chansamon Voravong, president of Paris-based Organization of Lao Community for Refugees and National Communities (Orlec). "It may take another twenty years before the technicians and professionals in training at present become operational, and resorting to foreign experts without capable supervision, coordination, control and reliable evaluation, not only constitutes human and financial waste, but also hinders the solution of human resource development of the country," he said. While hailing Vientiane's programme to focus on human resource development as the right way to reach its stated target of sustainable economic development, Chansamon said it failed to address two inseparable issues -- democracy and national reconciliation. Without the two things, human resource development will not work, he said. "There cannot be national reconciliation without democracy. There cannot be democracy without a sustainable economy," said Chansamon. In an interview with The Region, Chansamon pointed out the present government could no longer rely on foreign help for resource mobilization. He said the magnate of foreign assistance has now shifted to Vietnam with its potentially vast human resources and market of 70 million consumers. International aid agencies will, meanwhile, be focusing on war-ravaged Cambodia. As such, he said the government should re-orientate its focus to tap the overseas Laotian community, who collectively represent an immense pool of human resource in know how capital and access to markets which are crucial to the economic and human resource development of Laos. Vientiane's self-articulated economic development priorities -- education and cultural and national preservation -- in order to sustain a qualitative growth over a quantitative growth will be hard to implement without skilled administrators, he said. Chansamon was among the 10 percent of the Laotian population who joined the exodus for fear of political persecution following the communist victory in 1975. Many of the exiles have successfully transformed them selves into world-class entrepreneurs, investors, technical experts, manager, bankers, social service administrators and leaders in other fields. "Finding ways to access and tap this valuable human resource pool represents a major challenge and opportunity for the government, said the 64 year-old former senior government official of the right-wing government. He left the country in 1979 after being held for four years in a rehabilitation camp. Tens of thousands of Laotians, who formed the core of the intellectual and skilled resources base of the country, were sent to "rehabilitation camps". After more than ten years, less than one percent have been re-integrated into the socio-economic structure of the nation, according to a paper written by Chansamon. "Pragmatic, realistic, reconciliatory and perhaps imaginative ways must be found to heal the wounded hearts and minds, to reestablish mutual trust and to instill new hope and confidence in the future among Laotians from all walks of life, said Chansamon in his report presented to recent international meeting in Tokyo. His organization has been campaigning for five years under a programme called the "Loatian Democratic Initiative" to educate overseas Laotians and to improve the understanding of and commitment to democratic values among the populace. Once allied to the anti-Vientiane Hmong leader Vang Pao in its armed struggle against the Vientiane socialists, his group later renounced the cooperation for peaceful means. "We believed Laotian overseas or in the country share the same aspirations for peaceful political reform and improvement of economic conditions. But those living inside the country cannot express these aspirations without danger," said the report on prospects for national reconciliation. "Some present Lao government officials who can discuss with expatriates, have not yet seen how the word democracy can be utilized without fear of punishment or any other wordings which are not in line with the party's parlance," he said. Chansamon said during the interview that the mobilization of human resources in the country will never work for Laos if the government did not allow people to speak up and put their capabilities to the test. He said he believed Laos would not be suffering from a such a dire shortage of experts and academics if it had allowed the limited number of educated "cream" to speak up and express their opinions. Since the communist takeover, the general election of a National Assembly and promulgation of a Constitution and legal reforms had yet to translate into real democracy and freedom, his report said. On the contrary, the party still condemned the dissemination of documents and ideas about democracy and human rights, which the party considers as a sinister new approach, a peaceful manoeuvre by the "enemies of the People's regime", it said. Chansamon said the government should rather provide conditions conducive to attract educated Laotians abroad to return and help with the skill they had accumulated. Although the government has eased visits and contacts between Laotians in and outside the country and persuaded them to return for national development, there were no formal legal guarantees for their safety or liberty, Chansamon said. For example, he said there was no legal framework to ensure their adopted nationality would be recognized. There were no legal offers including the amnesty programme to guarantee the safety of former anti-government activists if they return. Vientiane recently claimed the government's programme to persuade overseas Laotians to return home since 1978 had met with success. Laotian Ambassador to Thailand Bounkeut Sangsomsak said more than 30,000 overseas Laotians have returned home outside the UN programme. He said the government continued through its embassies in many capitals where expat Laotians live to appeal to them to return. But Chansamon said only a few hundred had so far returned home for good. "The time is right. An unstable Laos would ultimately be a factor of imbalance and instability in the region. Any effort for reconciliation and harmonious economic and social development in this country would be beneficial for the stability of the region, for peace and mutual understanding in the world as well," he concluded.
