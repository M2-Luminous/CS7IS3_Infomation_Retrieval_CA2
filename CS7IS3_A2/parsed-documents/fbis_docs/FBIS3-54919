Yesterday the Russian Federation Government Moved from Staraya Ploshchad to the Krasnopresnenskaya Embankment Building. Today Work Has Begun in the New Residence"] [Text] ...Trucks are driving up to the entrances of the White House regularly, according to a timetable. Boxes and paper sacks are being unloaded. These contain books, documents, office equipment, computers -- in a word, everything that is needed for work. And it is not only the loaders who are heaving the sacks about. It is unusual to see government apparatus staff, including high-ranking officials, in jeans and sweaters rather than ties. But moving is moving. Following the latest batch of packages, I go up to the fifth floor, the "premier's" floor. Some people are moving tables, others are already working almost normally. After all, there is no time to waste making it habitable. That is why the move was scheduled for a holiday -- 3 January. Something else is also unusual -- the complete absence of the 1940's and 1950's style, which perhaps could not be transferred from the corridors of Staraya Ploshchad. Here the furniture provides a modern business style. With the possible exception of the premier's office, where the furniture is imitation antique -- refined and at the same time sturdy. By and large it is not without its splendor, which I believe the head of government of a great power can afford to indulge in. The reception room is several times larger than the one on Staraya Ploshchad. This is not just for the representatives. There are tables and chairs for visitors. In the old building they had to wait in the corridor. It was here that I met Vladimir Kvasov, leader of the Russian Federation Government apparatus. [Ignatyev] Vladimir Petrovich, the mass media has reported that the Russian government is apparently not all that keen to move to the White House and that the Federal Assembly wants to get hold of the former Russian Federation Supreme Soviet apartments for itself. But you are moving. [Kvasov] Yes, the new parliament did appeal to the president about this. However, the president stated unequivocally that he would not change his decision. The point is that the Federal Assembly is not the successor of the former parliament (by the president's edict, the government is). This is a completely new state formation, and so its claims to the property, organizations, and publications of the former Russian Supreme Soviet are not legitimate. If you remember, back on 5 October of this year the president signed Edict No. 1586, which says: "The buildings at No. 2 Krasnopresnenskaya Embankment and No. 2 Rochdelskaya Ulitsa in the city of Moscow city are designated the official residence of the Russian Federation Council of Ministers-Government." Incidentally, this complex was originally built for the RSFSR Council of Ministers. It provided for literally everything in respect of government activity. Today an enormous amount of work has been carried out to restore the buildings, and the necessary conditions have been created for the functioning of the new residence. So the Russian Government has had no doubts in connection with the move to Krasnopresnenskaya Embankment. [Ignatyev] What has been done in the White House in the past three months? [Kvasov] Following the well-known events, as you know, the complex suffered a great deal of damage. The builders were faced with a complex task: They had not only to carry out major repairs to the structure, they had to modernize it. The buildings were constructed a long time ago, so many communications systems had fallen into disrepair. Furthermore, the former Supreme Soviet had partially changed the internal layout. Many areas had been partitioned off and turned into tiny rooms. In a word, the entire complex had to be returned to its original form, as the architect conceived it, and the builders dealt with this very well. [Ignatyev] Were there any changes made during the present reconstruction? [Kvasov] First and foremost the ordinary windows and stained glass windows were replaced by sun protection glass. Because of poor ventilation it used to be very hot in the premises, particularly in the summer. A new air conditioning system has now been installed. All stories are equipped with state of the art fire extinguishing equipment. Extra telephone lines have been laid and the old ones have been repaired. Two large canteens have been built. These are on the sixth and seventh floors. Three snack bars have been opened. Several other eating areas are planned. The interiors have been completely renewed. The inside of the building has become smarter and more modern. [Ignatyev] How did the builders manage to cope with such a large amount of work in such a short space of time? [Kvasov] The restoration work went on day and night. Over 5,000 people took part in it. These included 2,000 specialists representing two Turkish firms. First-class builders were employed. Not all of the work has been finished, however. The complex has been divided into two parts: The six-story building and the high-rise 20-story one. The first has already been fully commissioned, and the second will be finished within the next two weeks. At the moment 12 stories are in use. The others still have to be brought up to the mark, so to speak. [Ignatyev] Has the government moved fully into the new building? [Kvasov] No, the prime minister and all of his deputies have moved in first and foremost. The government services are also installed at the new address. But it only proved possible to locate some of the apparatus. Ten departments are still in their old locations at the moment. They will move gradually, as soon as the restoration work is completed. I think that the entire government apparatus will move to Krasnopresnenskaya Embankment in January. [Ignatyev] Who has moved into the former speaker's office? [Kvasov] We know that Khasbulatov resided in the office of the former RSFSR Council of Ministers chairman. All the government leaders worked in it in their time -- Vorotnikov, Silayev. Now Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin has now occupied it by right. [Ignatyev] So where are the prime minister's apartments located? [Kvasov] They are on the fifth floor. The government Presidium conference hall is there too. There are also several small halls for holding conferences and for meetings with all kinds of delegations and foreign visitors. The chairman's apparatus services are next to them. [Ignatyev] Who has moved into Rutskoy's old office? [Kvasov] An ordinary department. I would like to note that a number of government subdepartments have moved into the six-story building, while the main services are in the high-rise block. [Ignatyev] Are any premises envisaged for the Russian president? [Kvasov] Yes, on the third story of the 20-story block a complex has been set up for the Russian president and his services. This is vital so that the president can work in closer contact with the government. He frequently has to attend government sittings and resolve operational questions. [Ignatyev] Are there any plans for a reduction in the government apparatus? [Kvasov] It is planned that the apparatus will be reduced by 20 percent. Certain ministries and subdepartments will be completely abolished. I cannot name them specifically at the moment. Work is going on in this sphere. But it can already be said for certain today that the departments which are obsolete in the present economic conditions will specifically be subject to reduction. [Ignatyev] And the last question. Where will the Federal Assembly be located? [Ignatyev] Evidently a special building will be erected for the new parliament. A piece of land will be designated and a competition for the best design will be announced. And the Federal Assembly will get its own complex within a few years. But for the time being it will work in the location already determined by the president's edict. ...Overnight the communications workers connected the government and special communications telephones in the new official residence. The government has begun its work.
