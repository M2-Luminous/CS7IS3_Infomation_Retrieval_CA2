Of 1,000 people questioned, 46 percent were critical of the president's performance since he took power in May 1981, but 43 percent were favourable, according to the poll, conducted for a group of regional newspapers. Eleven percent were undecided. The survey was carried out between April 26 and 28. A year ago, after parliamentary elections which saw Mitterrand's Socialist Party turfed out of power, his approval rate was a mere 37 percent, with 54 percent against him. Those questioned give the president credit for his role in areas such as the position of France in the world where he won 59 percent backing, promoting European Union (55 percent), ensuring social peace (53 percent) and guaranteeing national defence (52 percent). But Mitterrand received poor ratings on unemployment with 88 percent critical of his policies, immigration (70 percent), public security (62 percent) and reducing inequalities (61 percent). The president's second term of office ends next May.
