Since the Commercial Code was amended last October, the cost of bringing a class action suit on behalf of stockholders has been substantially reduced. Managers are beginning to realize that they may be personally responsible for huge damage payments if they lose suits. The prevailing corporate culture has been severely shaken. Until recently, stockholders meetings and corporate auditors were considered mere formalities and the system of checks and balances is widely believed not to work. While managers complain that the amendment is "bad law that will erode managerial autonomy," just how will stockholder litigation change corporate management practices? Damage Payment Bonanza "We have no statement to make at this time." Shingo Ariyoshi, the former president of Mitsui Mining Co. Ltd., did not have much to say after the Supreme Court handed down a guilty verdict against him in a shareholder suit last fall--the first such ruling in its history. After agreeing to buy out major shareholders opposed to a joint venture, he forced group companies to purchase the shares at a low price. The corporation sustained a loss and was sued. One of the six defendants has died since the case first went to court 14 years ago. It appears as though the 100 million yen in damages--including 80 million yen in interest--will become the responsibility of Mr. Ariyoshi and the remaining four defendants. A family member of one of the other defendants in the case, a former company director, could barely conceal his disappointment. "We'll do our best to pay the damages," he said as his voice trailed off. Earlier this month, Mitsui Mining announced a net profit of 100 million yen for the fiscal year ending 31 March 1994. In order to pay the damages and avoid going into the red, the company will have no other choice but to sell some of its assets. Ironically, the damages paid by the old management team will erase the profits they managed to generate for the company and its stockholders. A stockholder litigation procedure was first introduced in the 1950's. Under the Commercial Code and the Civil Code, company directors are responsible for corporate performance. As members of the board of directors, the highest decisionmaking body in the company, they are obligated to oversee the conduct of the president and other top executives. They are not only accountable for corporate losses, they are also liable for damages should they allow company executives to conduct corporate affairs recklessly. However, one major obstacle to those seeking redress was very high court fees in proportion to the size of damages. For this reason, there were few lawsuits. These court fees were reduced to 8,200 yen under the recent amendment to the Commercial Code. With this change, litigation activity has increased against a backdrop of continuing disclosures of corporate wrongdoing. There have been more than 10 suits in the past year alone, including the ones brought against the directors of Janome Machine Co. and Hazama Co. An official in the Civil Affairs Bureau at the Ministry of Justice believes that there have been many more undisclosed cases. According to officials at the Supreme Court, 84 cases were still pending as of the end of 1993. At the present time, lawsuits are reportedly being prepared against company directors at Kagoshima, Obayashi-gumi, Daiwa Securities, and the Industrial Bank of Japan. Lawsuits are also proliferating against small and medium-sized companies outside of the major metropolitan areas. At the end of last year, Hisashi Oda and two other shareholders in the Otaru-based Sekiyu Kaiun Co. Ltd. sued the company president for 110 million yen. Mr. Oda is a former managing director of the petroleum marine transport company. "The president purchased a personal membership in a very expensive golf club without the permission of the board of directors, causing the company to post a loss." Oversight Group Formed Now, a group has come forward with a proposal advocating the formation of an organization called the kebiishi (sheriff magistrate) council. During the Heian era (AD 794-1185), an official by this title maintained social order in Kyoto. According to the proposal, an oversight council comprised of legal scholars and lawyers would monitor corporate behavior under this same name. Last December, an organization called the Tokyo Municipal Ombudsman was founded as a first step toward the creation of this council. It was formed to facilitate the formation of class action suits on behalf of major stockholders in listed corporations. Lawyer and founder Toshiaki Takahashi is leader of the group which also includes Waseda University professor Hiroyuki Ikejima. Professor Ikejima was careful to explain the purpose behind the kebiishi council: "Our goal is not to hassle company directors but to facilitate stockholder lawsuits as a means to bring about sound corporate management." He is currently studying the possibility of bringing suit against Tokyo Electric Power and Kansai Electric Power. The Electric Utilities Association is alleged to have made illegal contributions to the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) under the guise of advertising fees. Lawyers Take Initiative Attorneys representing plaintiffs in stockholder cases have traditionally worked pro bono. However, lawyers who view such cases as a "business" are beginning to appear. This is because the legal fees in victorious suits are substantial. In early April, a seminar entitle "How To Bring Suit" was held in Tokyo. Many of the lecturers were heard saying the law was "just another industry" and that shareholder suits represented a "big market." Hidehito Ida, a lawyer who handles shareholder lawsuits for clients such as Nomura Securities, spoke with great candor. "First, there is the sense of justice that corporations should behave properly. Second, there are economic merits." The president of a petrochemical company raised his voice in anger: "During the U.S.-Japan Structural Impediments Initiative (SII) talks, the United States demanded that shareholder rights be strengthened, but the quiet passage of such laws would have caused the chairman of Keidanren [Japan Federation of Economic Organizations] to commit harakiri." While Keijiro Koyama, managing director of Keidanren, agrees that "a constructive effort is needed to reform the litigation system to ensure proper management of corporations," he privately worries about "frivolous lawsuits." Recently, Keidanren has been busy gathering opinions on shareholder lawsuits from various industries. It submitted a proposal to the Ministry of Justice calling for 1) establishment of "managerial decisionmaking principles" not based on results and liability, in order to aid in the creation of a rational managerial decisionmaking process, and 2) a legal amendment putting U.S.-style time limits on stockholders who wish to initiate lawsuits. Koichiro Kurasawa, a Keio University professor and member of the Legislation Advisory Council, wonder why there is a "sudden interest" in time limits. He believes that there could be a large number of lawsuits concerning criminal behavior and managerial indiscretion dating from the bubble era. A wave of lawsuits would indeed serve to remind managers of their legal responsibilities. [15 Apr 94 p 1] [Text] "We are still studying whether to seek damages against the former president of a company subsidiary...." The words of Yasumasa Koshiba, the president of Isetan, trailed off. The corporation had announced losses of 71.6 billion yen for FY1993 due to an error in the futures market made by an overseas financial subsidiary. Nobuo Nakanishi, the former subsidiary president responsible for the loss, has since moved on to Sega Enterprises. The hesitancy over seeking damages stems from the fact that the case could implicate the founding family, which had appointed Mr. Nakanishi. Statements of Intent Change However, some of the directors at Isetan privately worry that if the company does not at least make an effort to recover the losses in a lawsuit, the board may be sued by stockholders for breech of duty. Japanese-style management, which places great value on "consideration", is being undermined by stockholder class action suits. "I've really been quite busy lately." Shigeru Nakajima, a corporate lawyer, serves as legal counsel to approximately 30 companies in the Tokyo metropolitan area. He receives requests almost daily to serve on company boards. At a corporate board meeting in early April, Mr. Nakajima was bombarded with questions from directors after giving a presentation on shareholder lawsuits. "I would like to see us increase funding to one of our subsidiaries in order to bail it out of its current financial difficulties. Should we worry about a potential shareholder lawsuit?" "What are the legal implications of voting against a measure at a board meeting?" Proposals are often voted upon at Japanese corporate board meetings without much opposition raised. However, if there is no record of any opposition to a given venture in the corporate minutes, and it is not clear which of the directors favored the venture, then all could be held liable in a shareholder lawsuit should the venture lose money. Masami Hashimoto is the president of Shin-Etsu Polymer Co. "Those opposed to any proposal must speak out and make sure that their opposition is recorded in the company minutes." More and more top executives are making such statements at the beginning of board meetings. Last May, Fuji Bank created a legal affairs department. Tokai Bank established one in January, with Sakura Bank following suit a month later. Sumitomo Bank organized a legal affairs office last October. As a legal affairs specialist at a city [money-center] bank explained, "the number-one priority is shareholder lawsuits." The nature of the position is changing rapidly. "Soon everything with legal implications, including the results from casual meetings, will be forwarded to us automatically so that we can get it in writing." Toshiaki Hasegawa is a lawyer. "Requests from banks and securities houses for my legal opinion have doubled over the course of the past two or three years. They are seeking input from outside specialists in order to compile more accurate records." Solid Bailout Policies Nowhere is this caution more evident than in the number of bailout requests from struggling companies that are being rejected by banks. Money-center banks such as Tokai Bank are turning down requests from nonbank lending institutions to postpone interest ayments. Such requests were routinely accepted as recently as two years ago. Excessively generous bailouts have increased the amount of bad credit at the bank, making it vulnerable to shareholder lawsuits. "That was absolutely the wrong thing to say." Commenting on the importance of public relations, a lawyer criticized the remarks made by a board member at Shinoji Paper in a magazine article on the speculative financial losses at the now defunct Kanzaki Paper. The director denied any knowledge of the matter, claiming that he had "trusted those in charge of the matter." The lawyer shook his head. "This indicates a complete abdication of oversight responsibilities as a company director. His remarks would work to his disadvantage in a shareholder suit, especially when the appropriate company records are disclosed." In fact, a shareholder lawsuit has been brought against the Shinoji director since these comments were made. "The company is in the same industry, and we increased our investment after receiving a request from public authorities." In mid-March, Nomura Securities announced that it had decided to increase its stake in Sanyo Securities. Twenty billion yen will be invested in Sanyo Securities in order to help restore it to solvency and reform the nonbank lending institution system. Of this total, the Nomura group will provide 6 billion yen. Sanyo Securities is deeply in debt and is not expected to recover. Nomura has been strongly criticized for the move. Unlike banks, which have bad loans to protect, Nomura has no direct stake in supporting nonbank lending institutions. Because there are limits on the amount of money the Bank of Tokyo and other commercial banks can invest in nonbank lending institutions because of stock ownership restraints, the Ministry of Finance has put strong pressure on Nomura to participate in the bailout. A company official, however, is worried. "Stockholders have criticized this bailout as excessive. Despite the fact that the request came from public authorities, such comments make it clear that stockholders may consider filing a lawsuit." Insurance Applications Soar Given the cost of court fees and potential damages, company directors are rushing to apply for liability insurance. AIU has been selling liability insurance since 1990, but applications doubled after the amendment to the Commercial Code was passed last October. Currently, over 300 corporations have applications pending. Toshishige Katsuwaki, who heads the office in charge of corporate insurance, expects the number of company applications to increase once again after June stockholders meetings." Not only is there a sense of crisis brewing at corporations over stockholder lawsuits, corporate directors are becoming obsessed with protecting themselves. Masanori Yajiro, the Citicorp representative in Japan, believes that better documentation of proceedings, liability insurance, and the opinions of lawyers may not be enough to prevent stockholder lawsuits. "Directors must behave more responsibly towards shareholders. I believe they should improve daily oversight by bringing in outside directors." During the excesses of the bubble economy, many directors lost sight of the fact that they were in business to provide a reasonable return on investment to those who invest money in the company's common stock. That is why corporations are called "common stock companies." May the increase in lawsuits serve as a warning to those managers who neglect the interests of the stockholder.
