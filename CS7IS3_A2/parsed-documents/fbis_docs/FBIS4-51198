Such listing, according to Mr Gao, is a matter of fund raising as well as development of the securities market. So long as the securities market at home develops to a certain extent in which various kinds of markets operate quite sound and are under proper supervision while enterprises see greater capability for self renovation and for further development, enterprises are then qualified for the listing of their shares abroad and an expected success is therefore possible. Mr Gao pointed out that China's securities market started in 1988 with establishment of the circulation market for national bonds. He added that the national bond market was considered the centre of the entire securities market. Proper handling of relationship between the national bond market and the securities market is key to healthy development of the securities market in China. [as received] The national bond market has in recent years proceeded at a fast pace with business entities undertaking transaction of national bonds situated at various cities across the country. A layout for securities trading basically took shape with the Shanghai Securities Exchange, the Shenzhen Securities Exchange and the Wuhan Securities Centre as its core and featuring a national automated securities quotation system as well as a large number of trading venues outside the exchange centres. The trading pattern covers spot transaction, national bond futures and repurchase transaction. A new system for the trading of national bonds which was set up last year will see further improvement this year while the system for issuance and circulation of the no-voucher national bonds tended to be much more sound.
