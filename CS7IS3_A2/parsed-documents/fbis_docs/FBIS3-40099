Agencies and businesses throughout the province that are engaged in the border trade are facing the same question today, which is whether to languish in the present trough or to go in for pervasive development. The answer to this question lies, first of all, in how one regards border trade prospects. The drop off in border trade stems from many reasons. The province's main border trade partner, Russia, is accelerating privatization and undergoing political turmoil. Its laws are changing greatly, and the legal representatives of its business concerns are changing frequently. Consequently, trade contracts signed in the morning may change by nightfall, making the honoring of agreements difficult. Only 400 million of an 8 billion Swiss francs trade agreement signed at talks in Harbin during 1993 had been honored as of the end of September. Channels for settling payments do not work well, thereby increasing trade risks. During recent years, Sino-Russian border trade has gradually changed from mostly barter trade to cash settlements, but since there are no banks in Russia that are able directly to accept spot cash settlements, Chinese concerns have to turn to a third country bank. Procedures are cumbersome, so frequently opportunities to honor contracts are lost. Prices and Customs duties vary, making it difficult to predict trade profits and losses. During April and August 1993, Russia twice increased tariffs by more than 10 percentage points each time. Prices of some commodities such as chemical fertilizers and trucks increased several fold. When they signed contracts for the importation of sources of supply, the Chinese anticipated a substantial profit, but after the goods were delivered, they showed virtually no profit. Foreign trade problems are also directly related to the imperfect Russian infrastructure and lack of coordinated control. Poor transportation means low ability to move goods through entry and exit points, which results in serious cargo pile-ups. Every year approximately 300 million Swiss francs worth of materials cannot be transferred into or out of Russia. The damage done to the operating order is serious, and macroeconomic regulation and control lacks teeth. Currently the province has 8,000 border trading companies, but fewer than 1,000 of them can move cargoes across the border. Furthermore, statistics show a more than 1.3 billion yuan shortage of border trade funds provincewide. Some companies are operating at a loss, are unable to repay loans, and are unlikely to carry on. However, one cannot be pessimistic because of the above difficulties. Those who are well informed point out that the current predicament in border trade is an inevitable reflection of accumulated problems in going from a preliminary stage that was not normalized to pervasive normalized development. The problems are a temporary phenomenon that can be overcome through active efforts. Some units are already making genuine efforts in this regard, and some conditions are gradually changing. Reportedly, the provincial border trade bureau is taking a hard look at companies commissioned to act as border trade agents to reduce their number from 8,000 to around 4,000. It has also decided on a one-year and a three-month training program for the rotational training within three years of all the trading company cadres in the province. By way of eliminating bottlenecks in Sino-Russian trade deliveries, the provincial border trade bureau may work with the railroad system in exercising uniform control over import and export shipments, and in coordinating planning to reduce pile-ups. Some companies are also preparing to set up joint transportation companies with the Russians. For example, the province's external investment group is discussing arrangements for a marine transportation company with the Russian Ministry of Foreign Trade's Cooperation Bureau. The investment group has submitted a ministerial level conference agenda for a Sino-Russian mixed commission, which has gained the serious attention and support of both the Chinese and Russian governments. It is being actively pursued. The banking and finance system is also considering the opening of settlement avenues, the Bank of China permitting use of the renminbi in making Sino-Russian border trade settlements. This would help narrow the Sino-Russian trade balance to the benefit of both parties. Some business are considering opening cooperative venture banks in Russia that use the currencies of both countries in settlements. Russia is also putting border procedures in order, normalizing the administration of licenses and procedures for examining and approving travel from Russia in an effort to expand areas of cooperation. Russian officials in China have proposed starting with Chinese and Russian products that complement each other, opening up unique areas of trade, and making an effort to win confidence in technical cooperation and improvement of merchandise quality. Some experts warn that Sino-Russian trade is a long range matter in which it is necessary to proceed from realities, understand both parties' national circumstances and individual people's circumstances, economic development, and market needs. We must engage in trade in a steadfast and focused way, going from pure trade to economic and technical cooperation, resolutely overcoming deceptive and short-term behavior. Now is the time for all border trade enterprises to adjust to circumstances, readjust their orientation, and concentrate their entries on pervasive development.
