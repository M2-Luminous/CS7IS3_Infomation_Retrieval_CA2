FR940816-0-00011 FR940816-0-00007 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 271 [FRL&hyph;5052&hyph;8] Florida; Final Authorization of Revisions to State Hazardous Waste Management Program AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency. ACTION: Immediate final rule. SUMMARY: Florida has applied for final authorization of revisions to its hazardous waste program under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). Florida's revisions consist of the provisions contained in the rules promulgated between July 1, 1990, and June 30, 1992, otherwise known as RCRA Cluster I & II. These requirements are listed in section B of this document. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has reviewed Florida's application and has made a decision, subject to public review and comment, that the Florida hazardous waste program revisions satisfy all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization. Thus, EPA intends to approve Florida's hazardous waste program revisions. Florida's application for program revisions is available for public review and comment. DATES: Final authorization for Florida's program revisions shall be effective October 17, 1994 unless EPA publishes a prior Federal Register action withdrawing this immediate final rule. All comments on Florida's program revision application must be received by the close of business, September 15, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments should be sent to A.R. Hanke, Chief, State Programs Section, Waste Programs Branch, Waste Management Divison, USEPA, 345 Courtland Street NE., Atlanta, Georgia 30365. Copies of Florida's program revision application are available during normal business hours at the following addresses for inspection and copying: Florida Department of Environmental Protection, 2600 Blair Stone Road, Tallahassee, Florida 32399&hyph;2400, phone (904) 488&hyph;0300; USEPA Region IV, Library, 345 Courtland Street NE., Atlanta, Georgia 30365; (404) 347&hyph;4216. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Al Hanke, Chief, State Programs Section, Waste Programs Branch, Waste Management Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 345 Courtland Street NE., Atlanta, Georgia 30365; (404) 347&hyph;2234. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background States with final authorization under section 3006(b) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (``RCRA'' or ``the Act''), 42 U.S.C. 6926(b), have a continuing obligation to maintain a hazardous waste program that is equivalent to, consistent with, and no less stringent than the Federal hazardous waste program. In addition, as an interim measure, the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (Public Law 98&hyph;616, November 8, 1984, hereinafter ``HSWA'') allows States to revise their programs to become substantially equivalent instead of equivalent to RCRA requirements promulgated under HSWA authority. States exercising the latter option receive ``interim authorization'' for the HSWA requirements under section 3006(g) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6926(g), and later apply for final authorization for the HSWA requirements. Revisions to State hazardous waste programs are necessary when Federal or State statutory or regulatory authority is modified or when certain other changes occur. Most commonly, State program revisions are necessitated by changes to EPA's regulations in 40 CFR parts 124, 260 through 268 and 270.
