Zhirinovskiy calls his visit a vacation, and after a series of bombastic statements, he has chosen Portoroz and Bled as the places for his vacation. The controversial Russian politician arrived accompanied by six bodyguards, although his headquarters consider that there will be no excessive scandals during Zhirinovskiy's stay in Slovenia. Zhirinovskiy will hold a news conference for domestic and foreign journalists in Bled tomorrow. Zhirinovskiy is otherwise in contact with the National-Socialist Alliance of Slovenia, an extreme right party from Velenje, at whose invitation he has actually arrived. Via the Russian Embassy in Ljubljana, he has told them that he would not be able to attend this party's congress, which will be held on 12 February. However, he will be represented by Alexey Ivanovich (?Lepenkin), who is at the same time also an official of the Russian Embassy in Ljubljana. As the prelude to his visit in Slovenia, since it was questionable whether he would get a Slovene entry visa, Zhirinovskiy issued a message to the Slovene Government, the Foreign Ministry, and the Slovene public. In this message he says that he considers Slovenia to be a highly developed and highly cultured central European country that, following the disintegration of Yugoslavia, broke off with its Balkan past, even though it now influences considerably the outcome of the crisis in the Balkans. Zhirinovskiy, among other things, further says, I quote: Myself and the party are interested in dialogue with the official representatives of your country regarding an as quick as possible end to the bloodshed in Bosnia and the recognition of the new reality on the Yugoslav territory. End quote. In his message to the Slovenes, Zhirinovskiy favors the recognition of the states that have emerged in the Balkans within their internationally recognized borders and then adds a sentence that certainly will not go unnoticed in Slovenia. The message is: We favor that Russia becomes a guarantor of the security, stability, and independence of Slovenia.
