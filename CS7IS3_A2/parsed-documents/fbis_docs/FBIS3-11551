Capt. Paredes, who retired from the Navy a few years ago, became known for his public charges of corruption in the Navy when he presented Congress copies of videos on connections between political leaders and drug traffickers. He confirmed that "the DEA works with drug traffickers outside U.S. and Bolivian laws." "I say it, I confirm it, and I can prove it" said Paredes Sempertegui, a MBL [Free Bolivia Movement] member who is currently as adviser to the Chamber of Deputies Defense Committee, in asserting that DEA agents and Bolivian policemen carry out "their well-known extortion operations." He said the criminal acts "are made in the so-called security houses located all over the national territory. These acts are known by the public. For example, in Santa Cruz I would like to point out the house of a Bolivian Navy member rented for that purpose. It is the house of Colonel Alberto Latelier Ortiz." Paredes explained that his charges refer to specific people and facts that in no way compromise national institutions, for which he said he has respect and consideration, mentioning the Armed Forces and National Police primarily. He said the investigation announced on this case by legislative committees will certainly confirm his charges and will clarify the real operation of the "security houses," which are completely outside the country's legal order.
