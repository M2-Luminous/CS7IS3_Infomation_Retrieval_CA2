FR940426-1-00016 FR940426-1-00004 In reviewing the sections below, commenters should consider the following central themes: (1) Whether there are classes of investors, securities, or transactions that do not need the protections of specific rules governing manipulative conduct during offerings; and (2) Whether there is a simpler structure for antimanipulation regulation with regard to offerings that will achieve the identified goals. 34 34 The Commission will continue to rigorously apply the current antimanipulation provisions during the course of this review. Commenters are invited to discuss the issues identified below and any others that they believe are relevant to the Commission's consideration of these matters. Following its receipt and review of comments, the Commission will determine whether rulemaking or other action is appropriate. V. Restrictions on Market Activities During Offerings: Rule 10b&hyph;6 A. Rule 10b&hyph;6 Generally Rule 10b&hyph;6 is an antimanipulation rule that is intended to prevent those persons participating in a distribution of securities, as defined in the rule, from artificially conditioning the market for the securities in order to facilitate the distribution, and to protect the integrity of the securities trading market as an independent pricing mechanism. 35 Rule 10b&hyph;6 accomplishes these goals by prohibiting these persons from bidding for or purchasing, or inducing others to purchase the securities being distributed, or any security of the same class and series as the security being distributed, or any right to purchase that security until they have completed their participation in the distribution. 35 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 31347 (October 29, 1992), 57 FR 49039, 49040. Thus, the primary focuses of Rules 10b-6 are: The offerings that raise manipulative concerns, defined in the rule as ``distributions;'' the persons who are likely to engage in manipulative activity; and the activities that could be expected to raise or support the security's price. The rule is grounded on the view that: A person contemplating or making a distribution has an obvious incentive to artificially influence the market price of the securities in order to facilitate the distribution or to increase its profitability. [The Commission has] accordingly held that where a person who has a substantial interest in the success of a distribution takes active steps to increase the price of the security, a prima facie case of manipulative purpose exists. 36 36 Bruns, Nordeman & Co., 40 SEC 652, 660 n.11 (1961) (``Bruns, Nordeman''). The rule identifies the participants in an offering who are presumed to have an incentive to engage in activities for the purpose of facilitating the distribution; i.e., to induce the purchase of the offered securities. Various means by which such persons could achieve this manipulative result are covered in the rule. Bids and purchases, the most obvious means of influencing market activity, are prohibited expressly. Rule 10b-6 also broadly proscribes other ``attempt[s] to induce any person to purchase'' the securities covered by the rule. The rule then carves out of the general prohibitions a number of activities that are considered necessary in order to conduct an offering or have little manipulative potential. 37 One commentator has said that ``[i]t is the exceptions and the exemptions which give the rule viability and feasibility.'' 38 None of the exceptions is available, however, if the otherwise permitted activity is ``engaged in for the purpose of creating actual, or apparent, active trading in or raising the price of any [covered] security.'' 39 37 Paragraph (a)(4)(i)&hyph;(xiv). The rule as originally adopted contained 11 exceptions. Three exceptions have been added and one has been deleted since 1955. Transactions in certain classes of securities are excepted entirely from the rule. Paragraphs (d), (h), and (i). The Commission also is authorized to grant exemptions from the rule's requirements. Paragraph (j). 38 Whitney, Rules 10b-6: The Special Study's Rediscovered Rule, 62 Mich. L. Rev. 567, 568 (1964). 39 See Paragraph (a)(4) (introductory text). This structure and the rule's terminology reflect its direct lineage to the implementation of the manipulative concepts of Section 9(a)(2) as they had been applied to offerings. The rule also reflects the Commission's experience in combatting manipulative behavior during offerings and provides guidelines to the investment banking community as to what types of market activity generally would not be deemed by the Commission to be manipulative.
