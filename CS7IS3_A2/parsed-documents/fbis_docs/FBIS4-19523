As reported, the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] had identified factors that seriously affect the safety of the two rector blocks that are currently operating as well as a deterioration of the shelter enclosing the reactor destroyed in 1986. "If Chernobyl is shut down, there are two alternatives to ensure Ukraine's energy supply," IAEA Deputy Director Forrest Remick, who is participating in the meeting, told KURIER. "First, a more efficient use of energy, and second, the startup of other power plants." An agreement on the second alternative is possible. A total of six nuclear power plants are under construction in Ukraine, three of which might be completed within six months with international help involving the equivalent of 2.4 billion schillings, Remick pointed out. Important people are participating in the Vienna conference, including the Ukrainian deputy prime minister and representatives of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The three reactors that are to be installed in Chernobyl are WWER-1000 [water-cooled water-moderated] type. Reactors of this kind have been used in the Temelin nuclear power plant in the Czech Republic, which is to be completed with U.S. aid. This issue is also being discussed by Chancellor Vranitzky during his visit to the United States. On Tuesday [19 April] Prague's Environment Minister did not rule out that an environmental inspection might be carried out at Temelin.
