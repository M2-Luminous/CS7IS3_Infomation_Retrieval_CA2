FBIS4-59622 "drnes096dd_94003" FBIS-NES-94-096 Daily Report 17 May 1994 Palestinian Affairs `Arafat Remarks on Jihad, Jerusalem Draw Reaction `Arafat Remarks on Jihad, Jerusalem Draw Reaction PLO Official, Israeli Envoy Comment LD1705205494 Lisbon Radio Renascenca in Portuguese to Europe 1600 GMT 17 May 94 LD1705205494 Lisbon Radio Renascenca Portuguese BFN [Excerpts] It is emerging one week later that 'Arafat has made an appeal for the jihad to continue until Jerusalem is liberated. This took place in Johannesburg, at the time of Mandela's swearing-in ceremony, behind closed doors in a mosque. The Palestinian leader -- in English -- asked South Africa's Muslim community to participate in the jihad -- the holy war -- to liberate the city. 'Arafat has given assurances that the struggle will continue. More details from Tiago Rebelo: [Rebelo] The Palestinian leader delivered the speech at a mosque -- with no journalists present -- but a recording of his words reached the South African Jewish community and the Israeli radio: [Begin 'Arafat recording] The jihad will continue. And Jerusalem is not for the Palestinian people [as heard]. [end recording] [Rebelo] That is 'Arafat saying that the jihad will continue, because Jerusalem belongs to all Muslims and is more important than anything else the Palestinians have already got out of the Israelis. It was a public appeal by 'Arafat that, had it been made before the signing of the Cairo accords, could have been a reason for the Palestinian autonomy process to be stopped. The PLO leader is now making this appeal for Arab mobilization, because, as he stated, the main Palestinian battle concerns precisely Jerusalem, the most important Muslim holy place. [passage omitted] [Announcer] We have the PLO representative live on the telephone. Good afternoon Dr. Isam Bisusu. We have now heard for the first time -- at least in Portugal -- 'Arafat's appeal. Is this a PLO counterattack? [Bisusu] First, I want to confirm that President 'Arafat's political line, as well as that of the PLO in general, is precisely the one that was reported in the Declaration of Principles in Washington and signed in Cairo on 4 May. Therefore, I want to confirm again that 'Arafat, during the years of war against Israel, never made an appeal for a jihad; he never appealed for a jihad. This is because the PLO declaration, the PLO principles, are very clear about the international solidarity under which all Muslims, Jewish people, and Christians have a claim over Jerusalem. [Announcer] Does that mean that jihad does not mean holy war? [Bisusu] Holy war is a totally different thing that appeals to all Muslims all over the world to fight against the Christians and the Jews and is a totally different thing. [passage omitted] [Announcer] We also have live on the telephone the Israeli Ambassador in Lisbon Binyamin Oron. Good afternoon. What is your reaction to 'Arafat's statement? [Oron] Good afternoon. I would like to correct a small detail mentioned in your conversation: Jerusalem is not the main Muslim holy city, it is the third most holy city following Mecca and Medina. [Announcer] Is it not the main holy city in Israel? [Oron] It may be so, but it may be so for the Jews and not for the Muslims. That is a correction I wanted to make before I can add anything else. [Announcer] Can you then comment on 'Arafat's appeal? [Oron] Well, I heard the speech by the PLO president, Mr. 'Arafat. I have not heard it completely, I only heard the bit you have broadcasted. If in reality those things were stated, I believe it is a serious statement. [Announcer] Do you believe it is a threat to the climate of negotiations? [Oron] Well, I believe that all the process is based on a mutual compromise, in the exchange of documents that preceeded the signing of the statement of principles which stated all the differences and conflicts would be decided or discussed through negotiations and in a peaceful manner. [Announcer] Let me clarify a concept: Is jihad for you not a holy war different from the way Dr. Bisusu has interpreted it? [Oron] I believe that people from the east have different interpretations. I do not want to debate academic interpretations. It is natural that the connotation of jihad is a negative one; it is not one of negotiation and compromise. It has a negative connotation although orientalists interpret it in different ways. [Announcer] To end our conversation, could you tell us briefly about the statement made in Israel by the government? [Oron] Well, the government, the prime minister, stated that if in reality those statements were made, there would be a question mark over the process. They are serious statements, and we would have to read the whole text to have a more official reaction. [Announcer] Many thanks ambassador. Let us go back to Dr. Bisusu to have a final comment on the words of the Israeli ambassador in Lisbon: [Bisusu] I believe that both sides, the Palestinians and Israelis, have made declarations of principles in Washington and Cairo. I believe the Palestinians and Israelis have an interest in following what was signed in those countries -- Egypt and the United States. As far as we are concerned, the war is over. The most important route is that of peace, and we are going to continue following this route. The Isreali occupation is over in part of Palestine -- Jericho and Gaza -- and this occupation ended with peace negotiations and not with military action. Therefore we must continue the peace negotiations that have been carried over the past seven months. [passage omitted]
