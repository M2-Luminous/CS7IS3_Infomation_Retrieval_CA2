The afternoon session was directed by National Assembly Chairman Nong Duc Manh." All of the fourteen deputies who spoke at the session agreed with the views of the law drafting committee. They pointed out: "In view of the demands arising from the renovation process and in compliance with the 1992 Constitution, the amendment of and supplement to this law are regarded as a pressing and necessary requirement as the term of office of people's councils at various levels will expire by November 1994." The deputies concentrated their discussions on the following major issues: -- Term of office of people's councils at various levels. -- Duties and powers of people's councils, of people's councillors, and of people's committees. -- Whether people's committee chairmen should be people's councillors?, and so forth. "Many deputies who spoke proposed that the term of office of people's councils at various levels should be five years and that people's councils should meet three times a year. They said it would be too much of an interval if people's councils meet only twice a year." Many deputies called for more attention to the role of the Fatherland Front Committees at various levels in the activities of people's councils. As for Article 24 and Point 4 of Article 33 on how people's councils should resolve complaints and denunciations, many deputies called for more specific stipulations on the powers of people's councillors and people's council standing members with regard to this matter. With regard to the question of whether people's committee chairmen should be people's councillors, "may deputies spoke in favor of the idea that people's committee chairmen will not necessarily be people's councillors." "Tomorrow, National Assembly deputies will continue to meet at the conference hall to discuss a revised draft law on the organization of people's councils and people's committees."
