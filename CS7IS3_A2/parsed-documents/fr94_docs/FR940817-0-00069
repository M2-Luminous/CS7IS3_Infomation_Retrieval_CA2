Preliminary Statement A public hearing was held upon proposed amendments to the marketing agreements and the orders regulating the handling of milk in the New England and other marketing areas. The hearing was held, pursuant to the provisions of the AMAA and the applicable rules of practice (7 CFR Part 900), at Eau Claire, Wisconsin; Minneapolis, Minnesota; St. Cloud, Minnesota; Syracuse, New York; Tallahassee, Florida; and Irving, Texas, on September 5, 1990, through November 20, 1990. Notice of such hearing was issued on July 11, 1990, and published July 17, 1990 (55 FR 29034). Upon the basis of the evidence introduced at the hearing and the record thereof, the Administrator, on November 6, 1991, issued his recommended decision containing notice of the opportunity to file written exceptions thereto. Following the submission of exceptions and comments on the recommended decision, a final decision was issued on February 5, 1993. General Basis for This Amplified Decision On April 14, 1994, the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota issued a memorandum opinion and order. The Court held that the Secretary of Agriculture's final decision for the ``1990 National Hearing'' on amending Federal milk orders was deficient in part. The Court found that the Secretary's decision to retain the existing Class I pricing structure was tantamount to a finding that the structure continued to satisfy the requirements of the AMAA as set out in section 608c(18). The Court stated that this conclusion might or might not be supported by the substantial evidence from the 1990 National Hearing, but since the explicit findings and explanations relative to the ยง608c(18) factors were not issued, the Court was unable to make that determination. The final decision was remanded to the Secretary for 120 days for filing of an amplified decision. This amplified decision provides additional findings and conclusions that address the material issue on the record of the 1990 National Hearing concerning Class I milk pricing and related issues. This document provides an amplified explanation of why the Secretary decided to not change the Class I pricing structure of Federal milk marketing orders and that such determination is consistent with the pricing requirements of section 608c(18) of the AMAA.
