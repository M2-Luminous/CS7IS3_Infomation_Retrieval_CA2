The number of people held in France has risen by almost 70 per cent since the start of the year, and the London-based charity now has 300 cases on its books out of a worldwide total of 1,000. Almost 90 per cent of arrests in France are for drugs-related offences and traffickers face up to 30 years in jail under still sentencing laws introduced two months ago. In Thailand last week, another name was added to the list of British detainees when Jonathan Wheeler, 34, from Hythe, Kent, was arrested on heroin smuggling charges at Bangkok Airport. The Foreign Office says 3,000 Britons are locked up or have been charged across the world. Prisoners Abroad estimates that five years ago the number was about 1,500. A spokesman said: "The death penalty exists for smuggling drugs in Mauritius, China, Taiwan, Malaysia and Thailand, and India has a mandatory sentence of ten years in jail for possessing anything over half a gram of hashish." However, France has seen such a big increase that a case worker, Duro Olowu, has been appointed solely to handle cases there for the charity. He said: "Under the new sentencing guidelines, anyone caught with 25 kilos of cannabis could be jailed for six years. Drug conviction also earns prisoners a fine of up to Â£120,000 which can add two years to a sentence if unpaid. "The relaxation of border controls had been followed by more vigilance among the police, so that people are not just being caught at the borders but throughout the country. "Arrests in Thailand always grab the headlines because those found guilty face the death sentence and the prisons are perceived as hell-holes. But even in Europe prison is not an enviable experience. Families are split up and women are left in Britain trying to bring up children on income support." Mr Olowu added: "Many of the people caught are small-time couriers with little real idea of what they are doing."
