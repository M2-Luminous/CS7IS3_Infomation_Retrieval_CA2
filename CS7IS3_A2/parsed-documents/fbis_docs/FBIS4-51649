Accordingly, the IAEA has canceled the plan to send five inspectors to North Korea. IAEA spokesman Hans Meyer said: North Korea sent a reply to the IAEA's new proposal on 29 April, and an analysis of the reply message by IAEA high-level policy makers has come to the conclusion that it is unsatisfactory [manjoksuropchi motan kosuro kyollonul naeryoddago]. He stressed: The IAEA has canceled the planned visit to North Korea by the five inspectors, who were supposed to leave for the country today [30 April], since North Korea notified that it cannot meet the IAEA's demand that North Korea allow the inspection team to conduct necessary inspection activities when fuel rods are changed. Hans Meyer also said that the IAEA plans to discuss the change of fuel rods with North Korea again early next week.
