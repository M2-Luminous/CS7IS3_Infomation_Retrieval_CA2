FR940620-0-00085 FR940620-0-00029 Title III of the ADA, which also became effective on January 26, 1992, prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability by private entities who own, lease, lease to, or operate a place of public accommodation. Title III establishes accessibility requirements for new construction and alterations in places of public accommodation and commercial facilities. Section 504 of the ADA requires that the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (Board) issue minimum guidelines to assist the Department of Justice and the Department of Transportation in establishing accessibility standards under titles II and III. Under sections 204(a) and 306(b) of the ADA, the Department of Justice is responsible for issuing final regulations, consistent with the guidelines issued by the Board, to implement titles II and III (except for transportation vehicles and facilities). Sections 229 and 306(a) of the ADA provide that the Department of Transportation is responsible for issuing regulations to implement the transportation provisions of titles II and III of the ADA. Those regulations must also be consistent with the Board's guidelines. Rulemaking History On July 26, 1991, the Board published the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG) to assist the Department of Justice in establishing accessibility standards for new construction and alterations in places of public accommodation and commercial facilities. See 56 FR 35408, as corrected at 56 FR 38174 (August 12, 1991) and 57 FR 1393 (January 14, 1992), 36 CFR Part 1191. ADAAG contains scoping provisions and technical specifications generally applicable to buildings and facilities (sections 1 through 4.35) and additional requirements specifically applicable to certain types of buildings and facilities covered by title III of the ADA: restaurants and cafeterias (section 5); medical care facilities (section 6); mercantile and business facilities (section 7); libraries (section 8); and transient lodging (section 9). 1 1 On September 6, 1991, the Board amended ADAAG to include additional requirements specifically applicable to transportation facilities (section 10). See 56 FR 45500, 36 CFR 1191.1. On that same date, the Board also published separate final guidelines to assist the Department of Transportation in establishing accessibility standards for transportation vehicles. See 56 FR 45530, 36 CFR Part 1192. The Department of Transportation has incorporated ADAAG and the Board's guidelines for transportation vehicles and facilities in its final regulations. See 56 FR 45584 (September 6, 1991), 49 CFR Parts 37 and 38. On July 26, 1991, the Department of Justice published its final regulations implementing title III of the ADA which incorporated ADAAG as the accessibility standards for newly constructed and altered places of public accommodation and commercial facilities covered by title III. See 56 FR 35544, 28 CFR Part 36. On that same date, the Department of Justice published its final regulations implementing title II of the ADA. See 56 FR 35694, 28 CFR Part 35. The Department of Justice's title II regulations give State and local governments the option of choosing between designing, constructing or altering their facilities in conformance with the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS) 2 (Appendix A to 41 CFR 101&hyph;19.6) or with ADAAG (Appendix A to 28 CFR Part 36), except that if ADAAG is chosen, the elevator exemption contained in title III of the ADA does not apply. 3 See 28 CFR 35.151. 2 UFAS was developed by the General Services Administration, Department of Defense, Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the United States Postal Service to implement the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4151 et seq.) which requires certain Federally financed buildings to be accessible. Most Federal agencies reference UFAS in the accessibility standards for buildings and facilities constructed or altered by recipients of Federal financial assistance for purposes of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended. (29 U.S.C. 794). 3 In new construction and alterations, title III of the ADA does not require elevators if a facility is less than three stories or has less than 3000 square feet per story, unless the facility is a shopping center or mall; a professional office of a health care provider; or a terminal, depot or other station used for specified public transportation or an airport passenger terminal. See 28 CFR 36.401(d) and 36.404. When the Department of Justice published its title II regulations, it noted that the Board would be supplementing ADAAG in the future to include additional guidelines for State and local government facilities. The Department of Justice further stated that it anticipated that it would amend its title II regulations to adopt ADAAG as the accessibility standards for State and local government facilities after the Board supplemented ADAAG. 56 FR 35694, 35711 (July 26, 1991). Adopting essentially the same accessibility standards for titles II and III of the ADA will ensure consistency and uniformity of design in the public and private sectors throughout the country. To further the goal of uniform standards, the Board intends to use ADAAG as the accessibility guidelines for Federally financed facilities covered by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4151 et seq.) since the Federal government owns or operates many of the same type of facilities as State and local governments which are addressed in this interim final rule. Under section 502 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 792), the Board is responsible for establishing guidelines for accessibility standards issued by other Federal agencies pursuant to the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968. See note 2 supra. The Board anticipates initiating action to adopt ADAAG with special provisions as appropriate for Federal buildings (e.g., post offices, military facilities) in place of its current guidelines for Federally financed facilities. Standards issued by other Federal agencies pursuant to the Architectural Barriers Act must be consistent with the Board's guidelines. Those Federal agencies responsible for issuing accessibility standards under the Architectural Barriers Act will initiate separate rulemaking to adopt standards consistent with ADAAG as supplemented in place of UFAS. Commenters, including Federal agencies, were encouraged to comment on the notice of proposed rulemaking for State and local government facilities in the context of how the proposed guidelines will also affect Federal facilities and to specify any particular Federal building types which would require special provisions. A number of the comments received in response to the NPRM supported having a single standard for all facilities, including State, local and Federal. Proposed Guidelines On December 21, 1992, the Board published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in the Federal Register which proposed to add four special application sections to the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines specifically applicable to certain types of buildings and facilities covered by title II of the ADA: 11. Judicial, Legislative, and Regulatory Facilities. 12. Detention and Correctional Facilities. 13. Accessible Residential Housing. 14. Public Rights-of-Way. The NPRM also proposed requirements and asked questions regarding the addition of miscellaneous provisions specifically applicable to State and local government facilities, including swimming pools, text telephones, automatic doors, airport security systems, entrances, elevator exemptions, building signage, assistive listening systems, and sales and service counters.
