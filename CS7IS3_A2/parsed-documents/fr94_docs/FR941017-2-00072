FR941017-2-00072 FR941017-2-00051 Philadelphia Electric Co., Public Service Electric & Gas Co., Delmarva Power & Light Co., and Atlantic City Electric Co.; Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station, Units 2 and 3; Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating License Nos. DPR&hyph;44 and DPR&hyph;56, issued to Philadelphia Electric Company (the licensee), for operation of the Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station (PBAPS), Units 2 and 3, located in York County, Pennsylvania. Environmental Assessment Identification of the Proposed Action This Environmental Assessment has been prepared to address the potential environmental issues related to the licensee's application to amend the Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station, Unit Nos. 2 and 3 operating licenses. The proposed action would increase the licensed thermal power level of the reactors from the current limit of 3293 megawatts thermal (MWt) to a revised limit of 3458 MWt. This request is in accordance with the generic boiling water reactor (BWR) power uprate program established by the General Electric Company (GE) and approved by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) staff in a letter from W. Russell, NRC, to P. Marriotte, General Electric, dated September 30, 1991. The proposed action involves NRC issuance of a license amendment to uprate the authorized power level by changing the Operating License, Appendices A (``Technical Specifications'') and B (``Environmental Technical Specifications'') to the Operating License. The proposed action is in accordance with the licensee's application for amendment dated June 23, 1993, as supplemented by letters dated April 5, May 2, June 6, June 8, June 29, July 6 (two letters), July 7, July 20, July 28 (two letters), September 16 and September 30, 1994. The Need for the Proposed Action The proposed action is needed to permit an increase in the licensed core thermal power from 3293 MWt to 3458 MWt and provide the licensee with the flexibility to increase the potential electrical output of PBAPS, Units 2 and 3, providing additional electrical power to the licensees' domestic and commercial service areas. Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action The ``Final Environmental Statement (FES) related to operation of Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station, Units 2 and 3'' was issued in April 1973. The licensee submitted General Electric (GE) Topical Report, NEDC&hyph;32183P, ``Power Rerate Safety Analysis Report for Peach Bottom 2 & 3,'' Class III, dated May 1993, as Attachment 3 to the June 23, 1993 submittal. NEDC&hyph;32183P contains the safety analysis prepared by GE to support this license change request and the implementation of power uprate at PBAPS Units 2 and 3. The analyses and evaluations supporting the proposed license changes were completed using the guidelines in GE Topical Report NEDC&hyph;31897P-A, ``Generic Guidelines for General Electric Boiling Water Reactor Power Uprate,'' Class III, dated May 1992, and NEDC&hyph;31984P, ``Generic Evaluations of General Electric Boiling Water Reactor Power Update,'' Class III, dated July 1991. The staff reviewed and approved these Topical Reports in the September 30, 1991 letter described above and in a letter from W. Russell, NRC, to P. Marriotte, General Electric, dated July 31, 1992. The licensee provided information regarding the non-radiological environmental effects of the proposed action in the June 23, application and supplemental information in the September 30, 1994 submittal. The licensee provided information regarding the radiological environmental effects of the proposed action in NEDC&hyph;3183P and supplemental information in the September 30, 1994 submittal. The staff has reviewed the potential radiological and non-radiological effects of the proposed action on the environment as described below. Non-Radiological Environmental Assessment Power uprate will not change the method of generating electricity nor the method of handling any influents from nor effluents to the environment. Therefore, no new or different types of environmental impacts are expected. The staff reviewed the non-radiological impact of operation at uprated power levels on influents from and effluents to the Conowingo Pond. Peach Bottom has a once-through circulating water system and five mechanical draft cooling towers for dissipating heat from the main turbine condensers. The cooling towers reject heat from the circulating water prior to discharge back to the Conowingo Pond. The cooling towers are operated in accordance with the requirements of the facility's National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit, Permit No. PA0009733. The NPDES permit includes a matrix which specifies the number of cooling towers that must be in operation as a function of total station thermal power production, circulating water pumps and average inlet water temperature.
