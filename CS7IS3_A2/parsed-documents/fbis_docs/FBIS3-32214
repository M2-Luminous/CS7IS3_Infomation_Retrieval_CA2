Will that make you change your mind about running for governor of Rio Grande do Sul? [Britto] For the presidency I am the second choice; for governor of Rio Grande do Sul, I am the first choice. I already made a commitment with the people of Rio Grande do Sul, and I cannot go back on my word. I am candidate for governor, and I already prepared an alliance in this regard. I have been working for one year to be governor. I believe we can also make a great alliance for the presidency. If we can work out an alliance, it would be easy to find a candidate. [Rothenburg] Apart from you, a leading candidate among PMDB convention delegates is former Sao Paulo Governor Orestes Quercia. Do you believe his name would be endorsed by such an alliance? [Britto] I do not believe a party could nominate a candidate who would have to answer too many questions. I do not know the truth about Quercia. I cannot say whether the charges made against him are fair or unfair. All I know is that for any candidate having the above problem it would be very difficult to win votes on the streets. [Rothenburg] Does that mean that he could not be a candidate? [Britto] The PMDB and the other parties have other names. We have to act judiciously, and weave a strong social-democratic alliance already for the first round of the election. We have learned in politics that after working out an alliance it is easier to find candidates. Yet without an alliance, no candidate will stand a chance. Winning the election should not be our only priority at this time. Collor did just that. We must also guarantee governability. By doing this, we would be innovating in Brazil by having a president who will in fact rule the country. Neither Sarney, nor Collor, nor Franco managed to do that. [Rothenburg] But to weave that alliance it will be necessary to overcome regional interests. For instance, do you find it possible to unite Quercia, [Sao Paulo Govenor Luiz Antonio] Fleury, and [Brazilian Social Democracy Party Senator Mario] Covas in Sao Paulo? [Britto] In this election we will have to follow that old popular saying "we either spend our money to eat, or we just keep our money." If we want a strong president, we must overcome our regional interests and sacrifice some fellow members in some states. If political parties choose to push for regional interests, we will not have a strong alliance or a candidate. As the popular saying goes, we will have to choose between either food or money.
