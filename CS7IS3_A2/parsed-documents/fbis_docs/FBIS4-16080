NKR Army headquarters has reported that the Azerbaijani formations, supported by air power and armored cars, have been attacking Karabakh positions in Mardakertskiy Rayon since this morning. In repulsing all the enemy attacks, the Karabakh forces launched counterattacks in certain sectors of the front and occupied a number of advantageous positions. The NKR air defense forces shot down an Azerbaijani attack plane during the battles. Details are being determined. After getting reinforcements, the Azerbaijani troops launched an offensive against Agdam on the same day. However, they were forced to withdraw to their initial positions after suffering losses. Having failed on the fronts, the Azerbaijani Army has again chosen to launch air attacks against the peaceful settlements of the Republic. The Azerbaijani Air Force dropped bombs on the residential quarters of the capital of the NKR at 0635 this morning. Five residents were killed and nine were injured during the raid, mostly women and children. Frederick (Doneli) and Henri [last name indistinct] from the French state television and two independent reporters [names indistinct] from the United States, who (?were) in the city, are ready to confirm the bombing of Stepanakert.
