FR940419-1-00043 FR940419-1-00008 The proposed special rule requires that a system for monitoring skins be implemented by the countries of re-export, so that the transaction history is provided, that inventory controls are maintained by the manufacturer, and that unmarked skins in re-exporting countries will not be allowed in trade after a specific period of time. Furthermore, this special rule is written to allow the Service to respond quickly to changing situations that result in lessened protection to the crocodilians. Thus, the criteria described in the special rule establish non-discretionary bases for determining whether CITES provisions are being effectively implemented. Therefore, imports into the United States can be prohibited after publication of a notice of information on any country that fails to comply with the requirements of the special rule. For those additional situations outside of the ones set forth in the special rule, which involve a judgment as to whether necessary trade controls are being implemented, the Service will go through a separate proposed rule and comment process before reaching a final decision on any trade bans. In a separate rule-making proposal, the Service will propose implementation of the CITES tagging system for all crocodilians. The rule proposed here will adopt the CITES-approved tags as the required tag for all saltwater and Nile crocodile skins or partial skins being imported into or exported from any re-exporting country if the skin is eventually imported into the United States. The proposed rule is designed to allow trade in saltwater and Nile crocodile skins and products from designated populations without the need to obtain a threatened species import permit. Tagged skins may be imported from the country of origin or any CITES-member country of re-export as long as the involved countries comply with certain criteria. Crocodilian products may be imported without individual tags, provided the involved countries comply with criteria described for products. The proposed rule provides several criteria for ensuring that countries of origin and re-export have implemented controls to monitor transactions in crocodilian skins and products and have a satisfactory enforcement and CITES implementation history. If a country fails to meet the criteria in the proposed rule, notice to that effect will be published in the Federal Register , and skins and products from Nile and saltwater crocodiles will not be able to be imported into the United States without the threatened species import permits required in Part 17. 3. Section-by-Section Description. The proposed rule at ยง17.42(c)(1) contains definitions of ``crocodilian skin'' and ``crocodilian product.'' A ``crocodilian product'' is an item that is fully manufactured and ready for retail sale without further processing. A ``crocodilian skin'' is any whole or partial skin, and thus includes skins that have been salted, crusted, tanned or partially tanned or otherwise processed, e.g., dyed, shaved, polished, or filled. Paragraph 17.42(c)(2) stipulates those ESA prohibitions that apply to the saltwater crocodile from Australia and Papua New Guinea and the Nile crocodile. All ESA prohibitions apply to other saltwater crocodile populations. In addition, primarily commercial trade is prohibited for specimens from those saltwater crocodile and Nile crocodile populations listed in CITES Appendix I, and non-commercial imports or exports of specimens from Appendix I populations require a CITES permit issued by the Service's Office of Management Authority. Paragraph 17.42(c)(3) describes exceptions to prohibitions stipulated in ยง17.42(c)(2); specifically subparagraphs (i) and (ii) describe the exceptions for skins and products, respectively, provided the country of origin and all countries of re-export are in compliance with the criteria described in subparagraph (iii). Paragraph 17.42(c)(3)(i)(A) provides that each crocodilian skin bear an intact, uncut tag from the country of origin, with the CITES-required number in compliance with 50 CFR part 23. When chalecos are traded, the two halves of any individual chaleco shall be tagged so that if the halves are separated each half bears a tag. Skins may be cut in the country of origin (for instance into flanks or tail and body pieces) but each piece must be separately tagged when it leaves the country of origin. Since it is impossible for skins currently present in re-exporting countries to be tagged by their country of origin, the special rule provides for a period of twelve months after publication of the final rule, for such skins to be imported as skins or products without the trading history requirement. Paragraph 17.42(c)(3)(i)(B) requires that the information on each tag in a shipment be given on the accompanying CITES export permit, re-export certificate or other Convention document, or on a separate sheet validated by the same issuing authority as described in CITES Animals Committee's resolution adopted at its September 1993 meeting.
