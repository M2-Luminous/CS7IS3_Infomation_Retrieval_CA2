This attitude, Acarkan noted, gives a clear indication of the desire to obtain results in Cyprus through the use of force rather than through negotiations. In a written statement issued today, Acarkan said that when confidence-building measures are on the agenda and when the world's attention is turning toward Cyprus, we are witnessing a new example of the extent to which the Greek Cypriots differ from the confidence-building concept. He pointed out that it has again become evident that the Greek Cypriot-Greek side encourages and aggravates nonconfidence, rather than creates trust. The contradictions contained in the statements issued on this subject are tantamount to poking fun at the world, unless they are a manifestation of guilty feelings, Acarkan remarked. Recalling that the Greek Cypriots first stated that joint Greek Cypriot-Greek military exercises will be conducted within the framework of the joint defense doctrine, and then they denied this and claimed that the Greek commandos came to vacation in Cyprus, Acarkan said this is the first time in history that fully armed military units have been taken on vacation. The Assembly speaker advised the Greek Cypriot-Greek side to contribute sincerely contribute to the quest for peace and to refrain from actions that may aggravate the lack of confidence.
