When this maxim is rephrased in a different form by the present prime minister it makes one nervous. And not only because, as a learned colleague noted here last week, he has already stated that: "no date (in the agreement) is holy," and whoever starts out on that tack would be forced to agree that no paragraph in the agreement is holy, but because of something much more important--something connected with a basic understanding of what an agreement is. First of all, a basic principle in any agreement is that the parties to an agreement can agree to nullify all its obligations or add to them. There is no restriction in any agreement on coming to an additional agreement. Beyond that, what must be honored in an agreement is the obligation that you take upon yourself. You can cancel your obligation only if the other side agrees. But you can always add an obligation that you did not take upon yourself in the agreement or nullify a right that you have. It is only necessary that the other side not see injury to itself in the additional obligation that you take upon yourself. Instead of talking theory, let us take a simple example: You agreed to sell an apartment. The agreement says you will hand it over empty. For some reason you decide to leave the air conditioner and the gas range. Have you broken the agreement? No. You are not required to leave the air conditioner and the gas range, you simply may do so. On condition that the purchaser does not object. Let us consider some examples. Let us talk about Hebron and the settlements, and about Rabin. The agreement says that the settlements will remain in place until the end of the transition period. The Palestinians are obligated not to demand their removal before the end of this period. But is it an obligation on the part of Rabin not to remove any settlements? Of course not. Rabin can dismantle any settlement he wants. True, the Palestinians, perhaps, cannot demand it (i.e., they can always make demands but are not entitled to have them fulfilled), but the prime minister can decide to move them for his own reasons. And if Rabin wants to move them and thinks it important to do so--he should not say there is an agreement and he cannot move them. One more bit of advice for Rabin: Do not say you have to move the Jews from Hebron because it is impossible to protect them. That is not true. It is possible to surround them with a tank battalion 24 hours a day and send select vehicle patrols between the tanks. It is possible, but is it worthwhile? Does this presence justify the price? Is it justified? After all, Rabin himself called the settlement in the heart of Hebron "stupid" and said it is a "time bomb." Even before the elections he dared to say that many other settlements were "political." So, stupid things should be abolished. The time bomb must be dismantled on time. The settlement that was set up for political reasons can be moved for political reasons. There is no need to be confused by the crocodile tears of those who cry "transfer" and their demagogy. Transfer is when you take a people and send them out of their land to a foreign country. A political decision about Jews who were settled in the heart of Hebron for political reasons (the chief reason among them--to prevent any possibility of peace based on territorial compromise) being moved to another place, a place within their own homeland, is not transfer. It is simply the correction of a political mistake, the correction of a stupid act, the dismantling of the time bomb. Returning the Jews from the center of Hebron to somewhere else in Israel is not a violation of the agreement with the Palestinians. Do the Palestinians object to such a measure? If not, it is consonant with the agreement. True, Rabin is not obligated to the Palestinians to do it, but he is obligated to us; to use an expression with a little more pathos--to the future of our children and grandchildren. So enough talk about the moving of Jews from the center of Hebron being contrary to the agreement. Gad Ya'aqobi also should not say it abroad where they simply laugh at him. Rabin has to do it now, not within the framework of negotiations with the Palestinians, as a concession under pressure (by doing so we can teach them that what is not accomplished by force is stronger), but by an independent sovereign decision of an independent sovereign state. Not because the Palestinians demand it, but because it is good for the Jews.
