The opposition parties in Burundi have decided to suspend for two days their efforts to turn Bujumbura into a ghost town. This started on Monday [31 January]. [passage omitted] The Army is being accused of passive complicity. This is denied by Defense Minister Charles Ntakije. He spoke to Dominique de Courcelles: [Begin recording] [Ntakije] On Monday and Tuesday, we tried to talk, to raise the demonstrators' awareness, but today we have started making arrests. The situation is controlled by the Army. The situation is returning to normal. People can, I think, return to work this very afternoon or tomorrow. [Courcelles] Has calm returned to the streets of Bujumbura then? [Ntakije] Yes, calm has returned. People are going about their normal business in the street. [Courcelles] How is it that the small parties belonging to the Collective were able to find such sympathy, manage to paralyze Bujumbura, and stir up trouble that left several dozen dead, even though they are not present in the parliament and the Army, UPRONA [Party of National Unity and Progress], FRODEBU [Front for Democracy in Burundi], and everyone has agreed to maintain legality. How is it that they have so much power? [Ntakije] Because, as far as political circles are concerned in Bujumbura, there is a lot more extremism being expressed than there is moderation and political good sense. This means that the extremists have had much more effect on young people, who are open hearted and who go into the streets if asked. So they didn't use older people, who might think and refuse. They used young people, and now it is young people that we are having to deal with in the streets. We haven't seen any adults manning these barricades. I think that this is where they have been much more successful in raising people's awareness and blocking the streets. [Courcelles] Can you say that the Army is resolutely behind the new president? [Ntakije] Completely behind the president. Our problem is that politicians [words indistinct] cause problems where there aren't any, because they [words indistinct] the procedure instead of installing him immediately. They agree on the person, but don't want to install him. The Army is keen to see him installed as soon as possible because he is regarded as a factor of security. [Courcelles] The chief of staff has said that the Army would not hesitate to resort to violence to restore calm. What does that mean? [Ntakije] It means that since people's awareness was raised on Monday or Tuesday, we found that the consciousness raising that we were doing was not finding a response. The others who were stirring up the young people managed to get other messages across and that meant that, as far as the methodology of consciousness raising is concerned, we couldn't get through. So we had to resort to violent methods--arrests, for example, and using tear gas. [Courcelles] What kind of arrests have you made? You are speaking of arrests? Who? [Ntakije] First of all, we arrested the young people visible in the streets, blocking the streets, and setting up barricades in order to deter them from continuing this. And at the same time, we are explaining to these young people that it is not in their interest to block the roads because that means that economic activity comes to a halt and there is a risk of supplies drying up. Parallel to the arrests of these young people, we raise their awareness so that they won't start doing the same thing again. After that, we shall start on fines. [end recording]
