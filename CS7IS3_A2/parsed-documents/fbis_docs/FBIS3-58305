It has been discovered that the CIA received an intelligence report that the Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK] planned to assassinate Ciller. It immediately informed Ankara and the police in Belgium about the matter. Acting on that information, the police in Belgium took maximum security measures. Meanwhile, police officials have said they have taken additional measures but do not believe that an attempt to kill Ciller is possible. The source of the information received by the CIA agents, who have been working in Brussels for many days because President Clinton will attend the NATO summit, has not been disclosed. The police in Brussels called the Turkish Embassy two days before Ciller arrived in Belgium to tell the officials about the information they received on the assassination attempt. Ciller's arrival in Brussels was delayed for two hours in accordance with the additional security measures that were implemented. The information on the assassination attempt by the PKK militants, who selected Belgium as a base after the PKK was banned in Germany and France, has created as wave of anxiety. The fact that the information on the assassination attempt was received only a week after PKK militants created incidents in that country has added to the state of uneasiness. Ciller postponed her departure from Ankara to Brussels for two hours yesterday. She was scheduled to leave Ankara at 1200. She arrived in Brussels in the evening and found herself in the middle of a wall of police officials. The police officials said they took all the necessary measures to protect Ciller but added that they did not take the information on the assassination attempt seriously. Prime Minister Ciller went to the Hilton Hotel after arriving in Brussels. She gave statements to the BRTN and RTBF Television Networks in Flemish and French respectively in her hotel last night and received the representatives of the Turkish community in Belgium. She was briefed by the representatives on the incidents the PKK created in Belgium last week. Ciller also appeared on a live CNN telecast with Frank Fesno. Minister of State Necmettin Cevheri will fill in for Ciller while she is in Brussels to attend the NATO summit. The circular on Cevheri assuming the prime minister's duties was published in the official gazette yesterday. Minister of Labor and Social Security Mehmet Mogultay will fill in for Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin, who has accompanied Ciller to Brussels.
