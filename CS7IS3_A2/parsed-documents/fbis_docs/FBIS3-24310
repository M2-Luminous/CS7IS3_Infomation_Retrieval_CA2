Here is just one example. In state stores, through February sugar has gone at a price of 14,500 karbovantsy, and in commercial structures from 10 to 14 thousand per kilo. I have data which show that commercial structures purchased in Germany dozens of metric tons of cream, and offered it to wholesale customers at 40 to 50 thousand per kilo. But the lack of cash keeps it from going out to the store shelves in large amounts. And state trade still dictates the price for cream. Though customers are boycotting them, because of a lack of money. Today, the pace of the sale of cream has significantly decreased. A similar picture is noted for distilled substances. The state is experiencing great losses from the fact that the necessary funds for sale of "80 proof" are not coming to its treasury. Not because people have stopped drinking it. They drank it, and they drink it. But not the drinks that state trade offers. The potential customer is getting around the high prices. So it turns out today that commercial structures have "knocked down" state prices, which are set in an unknown manner, no one knows by whom. If they are oriented toward world prices, then we for a long time we have already been making our own "price cereal" overdistilled, oversweetened, and overcreamed. So it is not strange that commercial structures, which have free funds, have begun to buy cream, sugar, and distilled products where they are significantly less expensive. And state trade, because of a lack of cash, cannot do this, and offers us goods at the prices which have been set. The assistant head of of the committee on pricing policy of the city state administration, Lidiya Tymofiyivna Tolstykh, explained the situation the same way. She stated that guaranteed prices for sugar and cream (80 thousand karbovantsy and 30 percent "overcharge") are nevertheless a guarantee that people will have the possibility of obtaining these products. A lowering of prices for distilled goods is awaited. Kiev factories have already begun putting out this production at the new prices. But until the "old" production is sold, we will not see a lowering of prices. A conclusion can be drawn: to make things a little less expensive, today we all have to buy at "stinging" prices. But the majority of us cannot do this. How do we get out of this trap? Today there is a glimmer of hope that the competition from commercial with state trade will somehow resolve this issue.
