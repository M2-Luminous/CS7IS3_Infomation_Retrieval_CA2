A Candidate To Be Expelled From His Own Party "] [Text] Returning to a discussion of whether its countrymen should participate in the elections for the Republic of Crimea's presidency or not for the fourth time in the past two weeks, the Crimean Tatar People's Assembly rescinded its own 2 January decision on boycotting the elections. Now the Assembly believes that the pre-election situation has changed drastically and there are fears that a person who insists on redrawing the current borders may come to power. (As a matter of fact, five out of six candidates, except for Crimean Supreme Soviet chairman Nikolay Bagrov, call for this to be done.) This is why the Assembly called on the Crimean Tatars to vote against the five and thus give their backing to Bagrov. "Our decision," Assembly chairman Mustafa Dzhemilev told NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, "was prompted exclusively by the desire to preserve peace on the peninsula." The Assembly thinks that the decision it made does not amount to the recognition of the institution of the presidency as set forth in the Law on the President, approved by the Crimean Supreme Soviet. The Assembly will not recognize the powers of the future president if he takes steps to redraw borders or make decisions on Crimea's status without taking into account the Crimean Tatar people's opinions. In all, 17 Assembly members voted for taking part in the presidential elections, with 10 "No" votes and 2 abstentions. The Russian Party of Crimea's emergency congress, attended by members of Crimea's Russian Society, expelled Sergey Shuvaynikov, who is running for the Crimean presidency, from the party he headed. Shuvaynikov was accused of having concealed from the party the fact that he had been expelled from a military political school in 1972 and refused to reveal the sources of financing his electoral campaign. According to observers, however, the main reason for what occurred was Shuvaynikov's refusal to withdraw his candidacy and to join the "Russia" bloc, which fielded Yuriy Meshkov, chairman of the Republican Party of Crimea, as its only candidate. According to some members of the Russian Party of Crimea's political council, however, the congress was not legitimate and Shuvaynikov's expulsion from the party was illegal. This is what your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent was told by Andrey Mazyuk, member of the Russian Party of Crimea's political council.
