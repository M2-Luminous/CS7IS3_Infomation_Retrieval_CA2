"The Coal Industry Is in Its Death Throes," was the sad title of M. Yermakov's article, published in DONBASS on 5 January 1994. It describes disproportions in the prices for coal and materials needed for its production. That the miners' dissatisfaction with wages, shortage of materials and spare parts results in both a lower coal production and a lack of discipline, sloppiness. That mines need subsidies, without which they will not survive. But at the same time, says the author, we need to increase labor productivity and cut the labor force. The question of needing to cut the labor force is not new. It is also linked with another issue--closing the mines with poor production indicators. However, no cardinal measures have yet been taken in this direction. Year by year, this changes for the worse the indicators of the sector's overall operation. The past year of 1993 is not an exception--production of coal and labor productivity fell by more than 13 percent, while the size of the labor force remained practically unchanged. The situation is more or less the same at Donetsk Oblast mines. Many money-losing mines were still in operation thanks to financial and credit propping by the state. This made it possible to support a great number of jobs in order to avoid unemployment. But it also contributed to unprecedented inflation in the country. It can no longer continue this way. Today inefficient mines cannot count on large-scale help on the part of the state. There is one way to survive--mobilization of internal reserves. But not all reserves can be used by mines without state support. Some subsidies will be needed. A subsidy is the state sharing in the coal producers' expenses. The state's share depends on its capabilities and the need for coal. At the same time, coal producers must ensure the required volume and production cost. Great Britain's experience is interesting in this respect: It carried out a program of closing unprofitable mines soon after the notorious strike of British miners. The state there set a maximum for production costs the mines could achieve. If that value was exceeded, the mine was closed. Over a four-year period, while maintaining the same total level of coal production, 60 mines in the country were closed, with a 40-percent labor force reduction. Ukraine's Gosugleprom began a similar undertaking. Twenty-one mines with low technical and economic indicators have been selected (including 12 in Donetsk Oblast), and for them targets have been set for 1994 requiring an increase in labor productivity and reduction in production cost. If it turns out that it is impossible to improve the situation by the means available, the mines will be closed. It is clear that other mines will follow in the footsteps of this first group. It is clear that the road to better productivity and production cost indicators lies through ensuring effective employment for the population. The process of improving employment includes freeing workers, redistributing them among spheres of employment, existence of unemployment, ensuring high labor productivity, and remuneration by results of labor. Many people found themselves unprepared for this process, which by itself is not unexpected for the industry. First and foremost unprepared for an understanding that production should employ as many workers as it needs, not as many as there are available. In practice, it manifested itself in such associations as Artemugol, Dzerzhinskugol, and Ordzhonikidzeugol, where the size of the labor force practically has not changed since 1992, while the output of coal fell by 20-24 percent. It is obvious that when production declines, it is logical to let some workers go. If a decline is temporary, it is a temporary lay-off. The heart of the solution to employment problem is creating a core of skilled and productive workers at enterprises (associations). The size of the remaining labor force must change on the basis of production needs. There are many ways to provide employment for persons released from primary production. In particular, there is the known practice of creating auxiliary enterprises. Donetskugol association has experience in this respect. There are enterprises in its system that make sausage and furniture, churn butter, and manufacture equipment. Yu. Seregin wrote about it in the article "Will Donetskugol-lapti-selkhoz-prom Save Us If the Mines Are Closed?" (DONBASS, 13 November 1993). Actually, the association does not yet make lapti [bast sandals]. But there is no doubt that the approach taken by the association, which may include different solutions, will help the miners to weather transition years. And the society as a whole will benefit from it, since people will be paid wages for the results of their labor instead of "pay" for idling during the periods of decline and cutbacks in the primary production. There is also another important ask--we need to break the dependency psychology of some collectives. As is known, when our miners insist on their demands, they are inclined to point out the income of American miners. But one has to look at himself with a critical eye and ask himself why labor productivity of five to 10 tonnes a month has become so common? This is several times less than the level reached by Ukraine in the past and tens of times less than the yield produced by American coal miners. So at whose expense do the collectives with poor labor results intend to live? Growth of labor productivity in the sector as a whole is hampered by shortcomings in the development of the mine inventory. The oblast currently has many small mines: 67 percent of the mines have the production capacity of less than 60,000 tonnes a month, and 22 percent have less than 300,000 tonnes a month. Other countries have long disposed of such things. So perhaps we should now speed up the closing or denationalization of small mines? This will allow to use of materials and labor resources more effectively. The capacities being taken off line may be compensated for by increasing the rate of utilization of capacities of remaining enterprises. There are reserves in this respect, since last year in the oblast on average capacities were being utilized at a 77-percent rate, and in almost one-third of the mines, at less than 60 percent. And, finally, the measures for reanimation of the coal industry will be successful only when the workers unconditionally accept the rule that "there should be discipline at work!" and wages are commensurate only with the results. This should reinforce workers' understanding that this is no longer the time when, as Nikolay Ivanovich Bukharin said: "From a hired slave, the proletariat of our country became a hegemon." These days all of us must first and foremost become civilized hired labor, and in addition, we may become co-owners of enterprises. The more we persist in not understanding it, the worse it will be for us, and the more realistic the prospect that we will indeed need bast sandals...
