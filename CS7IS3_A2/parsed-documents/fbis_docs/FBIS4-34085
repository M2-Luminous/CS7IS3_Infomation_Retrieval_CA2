He said he will meet with those presidents who wish to do so. Upon his arrival in this northern Colombian city, Castro said there has been progress in all the Ibero-American summits, but he explained that we must wait for the pronouncements by all the presidents attending the summit. "We have things to say, but we must wait until tomorrow," Castro said in brief statements to the media at the Rafael Nunez Airport, in view of their insistence. "We will meet with all those wishing to meet with us," the Cuban president said, when asked about possible bilateral meetings he might hold during his stay in Cartagena. When questioned about a possible return of Cuba to the OAS, Castro said he will not raise the subject in the summit of presidents of Latin America, Spain, and Portugal. Cuba was expelled from the OAS in 1962, three years after the revolution led by Castro. The Cuban president arrived at 2315 (0415 GMT) and was greeted at the air terminal by Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin and author Gabriel Garcia Marquez. Castro was the last of the 22 chiefs of state and government to arrive here. Together with Dominican Vice President Carlos Morales Troncoso, they will participate in the summit which opens here, tomorrow, Tuesday.
