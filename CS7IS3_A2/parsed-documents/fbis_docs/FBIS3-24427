It is necessary to point out that illegal armed formations have been one of the main factors destabilizing the situation in the republic in recent years, and they have served as an implement of violent actions aimed against the state and citizens of Azerbaijan. A particularly large quantity of arms were illegally distributed to members of the NFA [People's Front of Azerbaijan] and other radical organizations when A. Elchibey was president, and there is documentary evidence of this. Despite repeated appeals by the authorities, only a small part of the arms held by them have been returned to the republic's law enforcement organs. Taking into account the extreme public danger of calls to revolt, which are a threat to Azerbaijan's national security, the republic's law enforcement organs have recently stepped up their work to confiscate the combat weapons held illegally by private individuals. During the course of this work more than 100 firearms, over 200 explosives and incendiary agents, and 95 bulletproof vests and other munitions and equipment have been confiscated from various members of the radical opposition. Seven persons have been arrested for their illegal possession. An investigation is being conducted in connection with the discovery of munitions and military gear on the premises of the NFA headquarters; there have been no arrests. These actions by the authorities have received the full support of the republic's citizens, who are tired of the illegal acts and political extremism of the radical opposition. In attempting to whitewash their illegal activity, the radical opposition and the mass media controlled by it seek to misrepresent the actual course of events and unleash a propaganda racket about "repressions" and "persecution" against the opposition. Unfortunately, many news agencies have become unwitting participants in this deliberate manipulation by disseminating unverified information. In this connection, the press service of the Azerbaijan MVD has been authorized to state the following. Observance of personal rights and freedoms is a fundamental principle in the Republic of Azerbaijan's domestic and foreign policy. The authorities' actions to ensure the security of citizens, the society, and the state and to confiscate the weapons held illegally by extremist and radical groups who call for violent actions are aimed at these very objectives. Political pluralism and the rights and freedoms of opposition organizations are observed to the full extent, and the activity within the law by many opposition parties and their mass media, which do not pursue extremist objectives or call for violent actions, attests to this.
