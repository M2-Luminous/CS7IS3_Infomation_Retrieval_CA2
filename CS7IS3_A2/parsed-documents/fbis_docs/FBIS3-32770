All talks with [word indistinct] only after they have disarmed. [Unidentified reporter] [Words indistinct] the 3-80 rebels must disarm prior to talks with the government? [Mendieta] Once they decide to disarm, and once they begin to disarm, then we will begin a process of dialogue with them, but this will not be a negotiation.
