Of the five republics of former Soviet Central Asia, Kyrgyzstan is considered to be the most democratic: Is this reputation deserved? [Akayev] It is well deserved. All our efforts are concentrated on achieving this. Kyrgyzstan is founded on the rule of law and is on the road to democracy. It is also true that our process of democratization is proceeding at a faster pace than in other countries in Central Asia. We have more political parties than in France, and when it comes to freedom of the press, the Kyrgyzstan's president is criticized more than President Mitterrand! [Meyer] Why? [Akayev] I see three reasons. First, our democratic traditions. We have always been the nomads of Central Asia, a lifestyle which favors democracy. For example, our traditional seat of power, the Council of Judges (Boloush) is elected. The Kyrgyz are a very ancient people, older than the Kazakhs. We can be traced back, in ancient Chinese texts, to as early as the second century. Another reason is our multi-ethnic structure: One Kyrgyz in four is European, German, Russian, or another Slav. Finally, our country has always been open to the outside world (except during the Soviet era: editor's note). The Silk Road passed through our land, which allowed us to assimilate traditions of both the West and the East, and allowed us to quickly adapt to a market economy; we are culturally prepared! [Meyer] Why do people here so often hold up Switzerland as a model of development for Kyrgyzstan? [Akayev] In terms of state structure, we are closer to the French model. Our Constitution reflects the French Constitution, in terms of the separation of powers between the president, the prime minister, parliament, and prefects. Our fascination with Switzerland relates to something else. Kyrgyzstan is like the reflection of Switzerland in Central Asia. We also live in high mountains, the Ala-Too chain. Lake Geneva is like our Lake Issyk Kul. Another similarity is that both our peoples consist of three principal ethnic groups. With its French-speaking, German-speaking, and Italian-speaking cantons, Switzerland has been able to create a confederation. We have 80 ethnic groups, but with three major ones: Kyrgyz, Russians, and Uzbeks. Our journalists like to taunt me when I say that Kyrgyzstan will become the Switzerland of Central Asia: How, they think, can we compare ourselves to this "little giant" with its high tech industry and advanced social system? My answer: By building a state founded on the rule of law! [Meyer] What do you expect from Europe and what can Kyrgyzstan offer Europe in return? [Akayev] I expect a great deal! We already have links with Europe, with Switzerland and Germany for example, but they are still fragile. We are the only country in the CIS to have made the change to a market economy according to the criteria of the IMF and the World Bank. We are now embarking upon the renovation of economic structures, which requires investment and technology transfer. Europe has both of these. I am seeking to stimulate the interest of your private investors in the reconstruction and conversion of our industries. In return, we can offer preferential terms for mining rare metals and raw materials used in the new technologies and the strategic field. We also have a natural environment which is perfect for the development of green tourism. [Meyer] You are a scientist by training, rather than a career politician; does this background lead you to adopt a different approach to your presidency? [Akayev] You know Napoleon, when he wanted to reward his mathematics teacher, Laplace, he made him interior minister. Shortly afterwards, as Laplace was constantly bothering him with one little problem after another, the emperor decorated him, at the same time sending him packing to continue his beloved studies. I never use my scientific methods in politics. I prefer to use the experience of previous great politicians whose memoirs I read, such as de Gaulle, or Eisenhower. The other day when I was in Moscow at the theater for a performance of "Fouche and Talleyrand," a very popular play at the moment, I said to myself: "I need ministers like that." When he got up in the morning, Fouche knew everything which had happened during the night, even in the Emperor's chamber. But my interior minister does not even know what is happening inside his ministry. My finance minister is unable to collect more than 35 percent or 40 percent of the taxes. Fouche collected 200 percent, and without annoying anybody! After the Great Depression, Roosevelt, who was advised to form a government of scientists, replied: "Scientists are like sugar in your coffee. If there are too many, it's undrinkable!" So I try to develop realpolitik. We Are Trying To Curb Russian Emigration [Meyer] Is there a risk of ethnic rifts in Kyrgyzstan? [Akayev] This problem is arising throughout Central Asia. Our large Russian minorities are emigrating. It is a natural process. France and Great Britain experienced the same thing in the 1950's and 1960's, and the return of the Algerian-born Frenchmen could have had serious consequences in France if there had not been men like de Gaulle or Pompidou around at that time. We have had ethnic problems, but so far we have managed to avoid the worst. The departure of the Russians is one of the conditions of democratization, but these Russians are also qualified workers. We are trying to curb their departure. [Meyer] One of your big problems is corruption. What is the scope of corruption? [Akayev] It has always existed, and there is no doubt that it is getting worse during this transitional period. We are seeing some people grow breathtakingly wealthy while the mass is on the brink of poverty. If we do not manage to halt it, then the situation could explode. We need more than our forces alone to fight it. Foreign influence, in the form of joint ventures, technologies, and new blood, can only be a good thing. Maintaining the Balance Between China and Russia [Meyer] What are your relations with China, your big neighbor on the other side of the Tian Shan mountains, unknown territory during the 30 years of Cold War, until 1989. [Akayev] This question is of crucial importance for all of Central Asia. As a region, we are flanked by two superpowers. We see them as two wings to help us take off. Flying on these two wings is our guarantee of sovereignty. Russia is our main ally and leading trade partner. I hope we can bequeath this stability, which is the fruit of our parents' efforts, to our children. Our Russian cultural and scientific heritage serves as our opening to the world. Through Russia, we are European, the children of Montesquieu and Diderot. For us, however, China is 1,000 km of border and 2,000 years of common history. The first working school in this country was Chinese. Via the Silk Route, the Chinese traded their textiles for our sturdier horses. I pray to God that Russia and China will always maintain good relations, because that is an essential condition for our security and the security of all Eurasia! [Meyer] During his recent visit, did Chinese Prime Minister Li Peng ask you to bring under Chinese administration the Uighurian exile organizations from Xinjian ? [Akayev] No. We have 24 ethnic organizations. We appreciate their desire to be different and to maintain their identity, on a strictly cultural level. Our relations with China are normalizing, and it cannot put pressure on us. [Meyer] Do you see the possibility of a rebirth of the ancient empires of Central Asia, in a confederal or other form? [Akayev] No. There will be no rebirth of the Turkestan of old. Uzbeks and Kyrgyzis, for example have the same linguistic and religious roots, but are very different. Our goals are the same: To build a democracy based on a market economy. However, the paths we have chosen are not the same. Another example can be seen in the fact that the Turkmenistan's president wants to return to authoritarian methods to establish democracy. We do not have the same approach. It is impossible to restore Turkestan under these conditions. However, there are things which we must recreate together: The democratic area and the borderless market that existed 1,000 years ago in Central Asia; the free trade of goods and labor. The wellbeing of the peoples leads to solidarity. Three presidents, Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan, Karimov of Uzbekistan, and myself, recently signed an agreement to avoid any hindrances to trade. Finally, we must avoid using the concept of Turkestan as a political pawn to counterbalance China: Nothing will be done against China.
