It was learned that Chinese and foreign enterprises, namely the Dongmao Enterprise Company Limited of Shenyang City, the Guangyu Shareholding Xiamen Company of Fujian Province, and the Shifa Garment Company Limited and the Yongjia Garment Plant Company Limited of Shantou City in Guangdong Province were named public; exchanges with Hong Kong's Daguo Company and the ROK's Dongqing Trading Company Limited and Taiyuan Trading Company Limited have been banned; and the Shanghai office of Hong Kong's Linghua Company was closed down. It was learned that since 1990, the U.S. side had presented the Chinese Government with a total of 69 cases of illegal textile transshipment and had asked the Chinese side to conduct comprehensive investigations into them. To date, the Chinese Government has given notice of the results of 47 investigations cases to the U.S. side through the U.S. Embassy in China. The remaining 22 cases are still under investigation. Viewed from the results of the investigations, not many of the Chinese export or manufacturing enterprises really intended to bypass management quotas on textiles or to engage in illegal transshipments, and most of them were innocently involved. For example, they took part in illegal transshipments planned by businessmen in Hong Kong and other regions without knowing that such activities were illegal. Only a few lawless enterprises planned and carried out illegal textile transshipments, seeking exorbitant profits and ignoring the overall interests of the country. Viewed from cases provided by the U.S. side and from the results of investigations conducted by the Chinese side, the range of enterprises involved in illegal transshipments is quite wide at present. These include enterprises engaged in three forms of import processing and compensation trade, foreign-invested enterprises, enterprises engaged in special foreign trade, representative offices of foreign businessmen in China, and manufacturing enterprises which are not authorized to take part in foreign trade. Since foreign-invested enterprises and township and town enterprises know very little about illegal textile transshipments, more problems are found among them. The meeting reaffirmed that in stopping and cracking down on illegal textile transshipments, the Chinese Government would, as before, adopt a resolute stand and attitude, severely punish enterprises which are engaged in illegal transshipments, and take necessary measures to prevent the occurrence of this kind of illegal activity.
