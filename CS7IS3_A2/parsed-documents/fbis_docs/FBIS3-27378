Now there are more than 60,000 households specialized in animal husbandry, of which 44,000 households each can produce more than 10 head of cattle annually. Last year the province's total output value for animal husbandry amounted to 6.6 billion yuan, a major industry, second only to the planting of crops. In the last few years, price increases in animal husbandry products, as well as market demand, have encouraged peasants to develop animal husbandry. They have broken away from old conventions, expanded the breeding scale, reduced production costs, and improved product quality. Governments at all levels also have formulated preferential policies and measures, built a large number of animal husbandry production bases, and provided priority treatment for specialized households, thus creating conditions for the development of animal husbandry. Animal husbandry scientific and technological departments have exercised an economic contract responsibility system and other methods. In the rural areas, they have introduced good breeds of livestock, mixed fodder, medical treatment, and preventive medicine. They have introduced a fine breed of pigs to pig breeding bases, as well as grass planting methods and refined fodder to mountainous areas, thus increasing livestock production and improving economic results.
