FR940516-0-00082 FR940516-0-00027 3. The rules adopted by the Commission are based on the findings and recommendations in its ``Report to Congress on Means for Assuring Compatibility Between Cable Systems and Consumer Electronics Equipment'' and information provided in comments submitted in response to the Notice of Proposed Rule Making (Notice) in this proceeding, 58 FR 65153, December 3, 1993. These rules include measures that will assure improved compatibility between existing cable system and consumer TV equipment. They also include provisions for achieving more effective compatibility through new cable and consumer equipment. The specific provisions of these regulations are essentially the same as those proposed in the Notice , with a number of modifications that address issues raised in the record. The new rules for improving compatibility between existing cable system and consumer equipment require that cable operators: (1) Refrain from scrambling program signals carried on the basic tier of service; (2) Offer subscribers supplemental equipment to enable them to use the special features and functions of their TV equipment with cable service; this includes providing subscribers the option of having simultaneous access to all signals that do not need to be processed by a set-top device; (3) Provide a consumer education program to inform subscribers of potential compatibility problems and methods for resolving such problems; this includes notice that remote controls and supplemental equipment compatible with the set-top devices used by the cable system are available from third-party vendors; and (4) Allow set-top devices that incorporate remote control capability to be operated with subscriber-owned remote controls or otherwise take no action that would prevent the use of such remote controls, including changing the infrared codes used to operate the remote control capabilities of the set-top devices they employ so as to adversely affect the operation of consumer-purchased remote controls. The compatibility rules for new equipment provide technical standards for ``cable ready'' consumer TV equipment and require that both ``cable ready'' consumer TV equipment and cable systems use a standard cable channel plan. 4. The Commission also concluded that more effective compatibility between consumer TV equipment and cable systems that use scrambling can be achieved through use of a standard interface connector, or ``Decoder Interface,'' in ``cable ready'' consumer TV equipment and associated component descrambler/decoder devices to be provided by cable systems. Used together, the Decoder Interface and component descrambler/decoder devices can eliminate the need for use of a set-top cable box. However, based on indications that the cable and consumer electronics industries are close to agreement on a new Decoder Interface standard that will serve both existing analog cable operations and also incorporate flexibility to support new technologies and services, including digital cable service, the Commission found that it would be appropriate to allow an additional period of time for the industries to complete their work on the new standard. The Commission therefore did not act on the Decoder Interface standard and related issues now, but rather will allow industry parties an additional 90 days to complete the new standard. 1 The Commission stated that would develop rules establishing a standard for a Decoder Interface connector and requirements for its use after that period. 1 If the industry parties do not complete their work in the 90-day period, we will establish a standard using our own resources. 5. As a policy matter, the Commission also found that standards for cable digital transmissions are desirable. These standards will be needed to ensure that compatibility is maintained as new digital cable technologies and services are introduced. The Commission stated that it was not, however, adopting technical standards or other rules in this area at this time, as developmental work on cable digital technologies and services has not reached a stage where it would be reasonable to attempt to specify such regulations. It stated that it will continue to monitor progress by the industries in this area and will initiate a separate action on these issues as is necessary to assure continuing compatibility in the future. 6. The Commission indicated that the actions in this First Report and Order will allow consumers to utilize equipment offered by a variety of suppliers, including the cable system operator, in a competitive market. Thus, a number of manufacturers and retailers will be able to increase their participation in markets to which they previously had limited access. Opening these markets to competitive equipment providers will give product developers and manufacturers, as well as cable system operators, the ability and incentives to introduce new products and to respond to consumer demand. In return, consumers will have greater access to technology with new features and functions. Most importantly, consumers will be assured that the equipment they buy will work with their cable system. 7. The Commission further indicated that open entry for equipment provision ensures that the equipment market remains competitive. In addition to open markets and incentives for innovation, another key component of competition is information. The new regulations ensure not only that the marketplace will be open and equipment options available to consumers, but that consumers will be informed about their choices. Competition could be stifled unless consumers are informed about their equipment options. By structuring the regulations to promote innovation and competition, the Commission expects increased investment in new technology development and increased economic activity as consumers purchase the new, competitively priced equipment. 8. Accordingly, it is ordered that parts 15 and 76 of the Commission's rules are amended as set forth below, effective 30 days after the publication of this final rule in the Federal Register . This action is taken pursuant to authority provided in sections 4(i), 7(a), 302, 303(c), 303(f), 303(g), 303(r) and 324A of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended 47 U.S.C. 154(i), 157(a), 302, 303(c), 303(f), 303(g), 303(r) and 324A.
