Sheu made the statement after learning that the US Trade Representative (USTR) has decided to move Taiwan from the special 301 "priority watch list" to the less threatening "watch list" this year. Sheu said Taiwan has made significant progress in IPR protection during the past year, including the passage of amendments to copyright, trademark and patent laws stipulating harsher penalties for offenders. Taiwan has also launched massive crackdowns on commercial piracy, Sheu said. "We'll continue law enforcement efforts to prevent IPR violations and hope the US can move us from the special 301 `watch list' as soon as possible," he added. Sheu reported that police cracked 2,111 cases involving copyright violations last year, in which 131,261 pirated music cassette tapes, 18,307 videotapes and 19,219 volumes of pirated books were confiscated. The number of cases cracked was up 51.5 percent from 1992 and the quantities of seized pirated books, videotapes and music tapes were all historic highs, Sheu said. Government authorities received 25,112 applications for copyrights in 1993, of which 96.7 percent were filed by local residents and the remaining were filed by foreign nationals. Official tallies show that 86 percent of copyright applications by local people were approved, while 78 percent of those filed by foreigners were approved. The USTR placed Taiwan on the special 301 "priority watch list" in April 1993 and decided to keep Taiwan on that list last August. Under the special 301 provisions of the trade act of 1974, the US Government must complete its annual review of its trading partners' IPR protection practices by April 30, and submit a report on the review to Congress.
