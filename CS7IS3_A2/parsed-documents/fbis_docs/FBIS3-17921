Nesterenko, V. Zelenkin, and I. Bespalov) held a news conference on 23 March in the former House of Political Enlightenment. Their visit to the kray was the result of an exacerbation of the conflict between the municipal and kray authorities, which ended with the events that are known to everyone. For the sake of objectivity, the deputies first listened to the aggrieved side, and afterwards a series of meetings was held with the leadership of the kray, the kray UVD [Office of Internal Affairs], and the city and kray procuracies. In a long conversation with the governor, according to V. Zelenkin, the governor was forced to admit that the kray organs "went too far" in recent events. A conversation with K. Tolstoshein, the acting head of the city, did not transpire: He met the Moscow guests in such a way that, in the words of the same Zelenkin, "we were compelled to get up and leave." The deputies were very restrained in their comments on the situation in the kray, declaring that they were not authorized to give a legal evaluation of the events. At the same time, they unanimously admitted that "the methods for changing the city leadership were absolutely improper, exceeding that which is authorized." V. Zelenkin also noted that despite the need to resolve local problems through local courts, he does not see any possibility of resolving them (the problems) without the intervention of the center and the General Procuracy, two of whose representatives were already in the country. Moreover, a representative of the Russian Human Rights Committee is also here today. To the question as to whether the deputies were in the kray court and saw the court's decree on dismissing V. Cherepkov from his position, I. Bespalov answered that "we were not shown such a decree, and we saw only the decree of the procurator stating that it concurs with the kray court." Regarding the appointment of Tolstoshein, the deputies remarked that according to the law, the head of the kray in the given circumstances can appoint anyone he wants, although now, incidentally, the Duma committee on local self-government, headed by V. Zelenkin, is considering a law that envisions an election procedure for electing the head of a local government. Concerning mass discharges in the Grey House, the deputies could report only that they had not yet seen the pertinent documents, having received only an oral explanation of the reorganization of the managerial structure of the city that has taken place. In particular, as he told them, no one "dismissed" Gilgenberg--it was simply that the new structure did not provide for the position of city manager. The result of the deputy trip will be a note addressed to the president, the State Duma, and the General Procuracy. They promised that they will try once again in the next few days to raise the "Vladivostok question" at a Duma meeting. The events in Vladivostok are so out of the ordinary, the deputies said, that they reverberate throughout Russia. The opinion of the deputies on the postponement of the date of the kray elections is interesting: V. Zelenkin thinks that in this decision the governor of the kray violated an edict of the president that established the date for the conduct of elections at the end of March. However, in a telephone conversation with the chairman of the Central Election Commission, the latter affirmed that the postponement of the elections to a later date was authorized. In the opinion of the deputies, rumblings in a number of regions where elections have been disrupted for one reason or another (mainly because of the passivity of the voters) should not delay the dates of elections to local representative organs.
