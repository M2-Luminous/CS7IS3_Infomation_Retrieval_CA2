He said this was determined by the testimony of three repented Shining Path members who were under the command of one of them, and also from intelligence information. Other military chiefs said the dead were known as "Comrade Mardonio" and "Comrade Abel" of the logistical and military commands respectively of the so-called 3d Batallion of the Moena-Moyuno People's Committee. The body of "Comrade Abel" supposedly belongs to the peasant Felix Loyola who, according to his wife and relatives, was a coca grower who had his farm in this sector and was shot by soldiers when he was leaving the area. General Rodriguez presumes that the bodies belong to some of the six terrorists killed by a militay patrol on 8 April in a clash in another sector of Moyuna, about three to four hours by foot into the jungle. He said that all the information will be given to provincial Prosecutor Carlos Gonzalez Ortiz, who is investigating this case to gain more evidence to clarify the killings. Regarding the bones found in the Carmen Alto zone (near the port of Moyuna de Anda), he said that according to preliminary information the bones have been there for several years.
