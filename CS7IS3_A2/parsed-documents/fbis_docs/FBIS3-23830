Collection of natural rent through the transfer of deposits for leasing for an indefinite period of time with the establishment of the lease payment in dollars, depending on the world price of the extracted product. The active use of rent for the utilization of land, especially in cities and suburban zones; --Reduction of the number of taxes, fees, and payments through their unification or abolition. The establishment of standard normatives for the distribution of tax revenues amongst budgets at various levels. The establishment of automatic procedures (built into the bank settlement mechanism) for collecting taxes to replace declarative ones; --Replacement of progressive income tax systems with proportional ones with the simultaneous introduction of tax on the property of legal entities and individuals, a 50-percent tax for exporting capital, and taxes on operations involving real estate and securities (3 percent of the value of the transaction); --Replacement of income and profit tax with a consumption tax to be paid by legal entities. The establishment of a standard rate of value added tax in the amount of 10 percent. [end box] A radical change in the tax-budget strategy of the Russian authorities is becoming increasingly probable. Having discovered the ineffectiveness of the utilization of the existing tax system to resolve the budget crisis, leaders of both federal and local governments do not rule out the possibility, in a certain stage, of resorting to a reduction of traditional taxes and making rent payments the main source of budget revenues. This is shown by the attention paid by specialists of the Government of Russia and also the Governments of Moscow and St. Petersburg to proposals contained in the report received yesterday from experts of the Central Economics and Mathematics Institute, "Basic Directions for the Formation of the Economic Policy." The thrust of the report is to rely on rent payments for replenishing the state budget. It is significant that among the authors of the report is the chairman of one of the key parliamentary committees, the Committee of the State Duma on Economic Policy--Sergey Glazyev. The prospects of legislative support for these ideas make it crucial to analyze the possibilities of such an adjustment to the economic policy. Russian Authorities in Search of Budget Revenues: Reliance on Rent Payments The attempts on the part of Russian authorities and academic circles to find some nontraditional sources for radically increasing budget revenues are quite natural. Surmounting the crisis of state finances is officially considered to be almost the main objective of the economic reforms in Russia. It is especially significant that this is insisted upon by international financial circles, which proceed from the idea that without improvement in its financial system Russia will hardly be able to surmount the economic crisis and resolve the problem of its foreign indebtedness. It is significant that at the present time in the Russian economic policy methods of achieving financial stability through reducing budget expenditures are losing popularity--since the reduction of budget aid to key branches in the social sphere, as has become obvious, leads to an extremely significant increase in sociopolitical tension. Therefore main attention is drawn to an idea that has gained popularity recently, which is that it is possible to resolve the problem of increasing budget revenues rapidly and radically by relying not only and not so much on traditional taxes (value added tax, income tax, profit tax) as on rent payments for the use of state mineral deposits and agricultural land. In particular, this is the idea contained in the recently published report prepared by the Central Economics and Mathematics Institute entitled "Basic Directions for the Formation of Economic Policy." It is noteworthy that one of the authors of this report is the chairman of the parliamentary committee on economic policy, Sergey Glazyev. Thus it cannot be ruled out that in the foreseeable future such an idea will be the official "contribution" from parliament to the adjustment of the federal economic policy. Moreover, sympathies for this method of replenishing the budget are not concealed by influential figures in local organs of power either--especially in the Moscow and St. Petersburg Governments. For example, the December directive from the mayor of Moscow contains an instruction to the Department of Economics to prepare a proposal for increasing land tax and reducing other taxes. The obvious merits of this idea contribute a great deal to its popularity. Since the government up to this point essentially retains ownership of natural resources, it would be natural to make maximum use of them for replenishing state finances. In essence, this is being done already to a certain degree--for example, existing excise taxes on the extraction of oil, in spite of their name, are nothing other than differential rent. To be sure, such a path to surmounting the financial crisis has one essential shortcoming--it is clearly based on preservation of the state monopoly on natural resources, particularly the land. And many Western experts, insisting on budget stabilization as a necessary component of market reforms, reject the idea of a state monopoly on natural resources. Particularly the prominent Harvard professor Jeffrey Sachs, who recently left the post of adviser to the Russian parliament, asserted that land rent cannot be the main source for replenishing the budget, and he considers privatization of the land to be the most important and urgent problem. But recently it has been increasingly popular in Western financial and industrial circles to think that rejection of the state monopoly on natural resources in Russia is not mandatory--in particular, many Western investors are completely prepared to limit themselves to obtaining land and mineral deposits under a long-term lease. Thus it is quite probable that the idea of budget stabilization and financing of the development of Russia's economy through rent payments will not evoke fundamental objections in the West. The more so since initially such an idea appeared precisely in Western economic theory. World Theory and Practice of the Utilization of Rent Payments in State Finances The diversity of rent theories does not change its essence. When speaking of rent one is usually referring to the added profit that is received by the owners of an especially productive resource as compared to their competitors, who have resources with less productivity (the added profit is received simply because certain producers have considerably lower production outlays than their competitors and sell their goods in a competitive economy at the same prices). The most typical source of rent in productions involving natural resources is from agriculture or the extraction industry. This is natural since natural resources essentially cannot be created by man and so they are limited--therefore the difference, for example, in the fertility of the soil or the productivity of deposits is relatively constant. The fact that the owner of particularly fertile land receives a certain profit whose source is "nature" has quite naturally attracted the attention of economists almost since the origin of economic theory. It was quite tempting to declare the appropriation of such a gift of nature by one person to be unfair to a certain degree. Therefore when searching for sources of state financing, it was extremely popular among economists to demand that rent be paid into state revenues--with a simultaneous reduction of taxes, which in any country have caused dissatisfaction among entrepreneurs and the population. Theories based on such a change in budget policy are fairly diverse. Some suggest abolishing all taxes and leaving only a high tax on the land (Henry George), while others suggest introducing differentiated tax separately for buildings and separately for the plot of land, leaving the basic tax burden on the land (Nicholas Tiedeman, Stephen B. Cord), while still others (Fred Harrison, Francis Smith) want to change the entire structure of the tax policy by increasing the tax on land and reducing other taxes (income tax, profit tax, value added tax). The initiator of the idea of financing the budget through rent alone with complete abolition of all other taxes was the American economist Henry George, who back at the end of the last century stated: "To abolish taxes which, by acting and counteracting, now slow up every wheel of exchange and oppress all kinds of industry, would mean to shift an immense load from this mighty source...if somebody is building a ship we force him to pay for this audacity as if he had done harm to the state; if a factory is built we impose on it an annual tax which would be more than enough for a decent income...." Such a theory has adherents at the present time as well. According to calculations of the London Association of Scientific Research in the Area of Economic and Social Sciences, in the majority of developed countries land rent makes up about 40 percent of the national income, and the rents would be quite enough for the governments to cover state expenditures. But not all economists are so radical. Nicholas Tiedeman and Stephen B. Cord limit themselves to this tax policy on the scale of individual cities. But they make analogous proposals--to leave only tax on land for financing local budgets. It is suggested that the amount of this tax be determined by regularly offering the right to use sections of it at auctions. Concretizing the use of rent payments for financing the budget, a number of researchers, particularly Stephen B. Cord, suggest rejecting the existing system whereby taxes on land and real estate are the same and sharply increasing the tax on land, while reducing property tax on buildings (which, in his opinion, will provide an impetus for new construction). This theory was applied, in particular, in Pittsburgh (Pennsylvania, United States) where, beginning in 1979, the tax rate for land was almost doubled but the amount of the tax on buildings remained the same. The tax rate for land was 9.75 percent, and buildings--2.45 percent. (Since that time they have changed periodically, and today they are 15.15 percent for land and 2.7 percent for buildings.) As a result, during 1980-1984 the volume of new construction in Pittsburgh increased 5.9-fold as compared to the period of 1974-78 (according to figures from the Bureau of Construction Inspections). And in the United States as a whole the volume of new construction has increased only 1.6-fold during that time. But, in spite of the fact that in theory reorienting the state budget completely to rent payments produces appreciable advantages, large-scale practical introduction of such a plan would naturally be extremely difficult. A special role here is played by the active resistance of the landowner lobbies, which are traditionally quite strong in practically all industrial countries. Prospects for Reorientation of Budget Policy to Rent Payments On the whole one can say that the concept of augmenting state finances through the use of rents and real estate taxes completely corresponds to the interests of the Russian authorities. At both the federal and the local levels the authorities are interested in demonstrating a desire to reduce taxes on profit and income "in order to stimulate national industry and entrepreneurial activity." It is essential that the authorities will be able to count on more stable revenues from rent, lease payments, and real estate tax than from other taxes, the more so since profit and incomes, as practice shows, are easier to conceal from taxation than are land and real estate. Moreover, as the report from the Central Economics and Mathematics Institute shows, the authorities might consider it preferable to calculate rent payments--particularly when leasing mineral deposits--directly in hard currency. This too could stabilize budget revenues under conditions of inflation. According to the report, the most reasonable method is considered to be leasing mineral deposits for an indefinite period with the collection of the lease payment in dollars. The amount of the payment should be established depending on the world price of the product extracted. According to calculations of the Central Economics and Mathematics Institute, for rents for products of the petroleum and gas complex alone, when calculated in world prices, the budget would receive about $30 billion annually. In order not to evoke a counteraction from the "petroleum and gas lobby," the authorities might very well try to use another formula that was proposed in the report--sharply reduce all taxes on leasing enterprises and guarantee that in any case the enterprises will be left with enough profit to cover the needs for the development of the complex itself. Of course, mass support from local authorities for such an idea will depend largely on how the rent payments are divided between the local and federal budgets. Incidentally, the interest of local authorities in radically changing the tax policy certainly does not mean that this can be done quickly from a purely technical viewpoint. Tax Reform in Russia: The Opinion of Tax Organs As one might expect, specialists of tax organs, who are traditionally cautious about innovations, are fairly skeptical about the reform. In their words, to conduct a tax reform in Russia in the near future with a shift of the main burden from income taxes to land payments is not very likely. The main argument against changing the structural foundations of the tax system is the technical impossibility of correct calculation of both the real value of the land and the effectiveness of conducting such a reform from the standpoint of budget revenues. The impossibility of calculating the value of the land, in the opinion of tax organ specialists, is conditioned by the fact that there is no liquid land market in Russia today. Therefore there is no possibility of determining the price of "similar" plots put up for auction. The institution of real estate appraisers as such (and especially land appraisers) is only in its initial stage of development. All this will also lead to a situation where it will be practically impossible to calculate the effectiveness of the land tax, since there is no basis for calculation. Even if approximate calculations are done and they show that shifting the tax burden to large land holders is attractive for the budget, this certainly does not mean that everything will turn out that way in reality. The reason is that, as practice shows, replacing typical laws with less familiar ones without the preliminary practice of "breaking them in" leads to a reduction of revenues into the state budget. The taxpayers (and fiscal echelons as well) are simply not in a condition to correctly calculate the sums due to the budget. Moreover, the normative documents that introduce the new taxes might contain (or might not contain) a considerable number of "loopholes" which allow the leakage of a considerable amount of money on which the budget could count. Such a situation developed, for example, when the former turnover tax was replaced by the value added tax. A means of evading taxation by using false fines, which seems obvious today, was closed off only two years after the introduction of the law on value added tax. It is probable that this is why one of the highly placed workers in the Ministry of Finance, commenting at the request of the KOMMERSANT editors, on the proposals for the tax reform, worded his opinion fairly emotionally: "Under today's conditions only an enemy could suggest such a thing!" And so the only thing that can be expected from the increasing popularity of the theory of land payments as the basis of public well-being is the conducting of experiments in cities that are most susceptible to new trends: Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Nizhnyy Novgorod. They will most likely consist in considerably raising the rates of the existing land tax, which will require additional decisions at the level of federal authorities since a limit on raising these rates has now been established. And there is no guarantee that this will occur along with any significant reduction of taxes on profit and income.
