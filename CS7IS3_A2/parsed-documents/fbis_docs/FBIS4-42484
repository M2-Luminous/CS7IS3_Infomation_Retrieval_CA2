That is preventing the economic convergence of the countries, which is a pre-condition for a single currency, he said this weekend at the London conference of the Association Cambiste Internationale. "Until much greater real economic convergence has been achieved, flexibility of nominal exchange rates may help to speed up the process of convergence." But it will be a long time before sufficient and sustainable convergence of stable economies will permit such a monetary union, Mr George said. Fixed exchange rates are, however, not an alternative. Wide economic stability is the only process that will maintain steady exchange rates, he explained. "Fiscal discipline, a reduction in the role of the public sector, often involving privatisation, internal and external liberalisation" are generally now agreed as sound policy. "If we can't achieve greater internal stability as a matter of self-interest, then I am not at all sure that a nominal external anchor would necessarily be a more compelling general discipline."
