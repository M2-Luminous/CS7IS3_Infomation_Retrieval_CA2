FR940616-0-00084 FR940616-0-00011 There are, however, some differences between this part 9 rule and the DOJ section 504 coordination regulations for federally assisted programs, as well as many other agencies' implementing regulations. Many of these changes are based on the Supreme Court's decision in Southeastern Community College v. Davis, 442 U.S. 397 (1979) [ Davis ], and the subsequent circuit court decisions interpreting Davis and section 504. These differences were discussed in detail in the preamble to the part 9 proposed rule at 56 FR 24604&hyph;24605. There are also differences between the part 9 proposed rule and the part 9 final rule. These differences are discussed in the following section. II. Differences Between Part 9 Proposed Rule and Part 9 Final Rule The Department invited public comment on the part 9 proposed rule. During the public comment period, which expired July 29, 1991, the Department received seven comments. The commenters included: One state agency for the visually impaired; a not-for-profit law firm that specializes in disability and health law; an organization representing the interests of senior citizens; two legal service organizations; and two disability advocacy organizations. Following careful consideration of the issues raised by the commenters, and further consideration of the part 9 rule in light of regulatory implementation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (Pub.L. 101&hyph;336, approved July 26, 1990) (ADA), the Department has decided to adopt the part 9 proposed rule substantially as published on May 30, 1991. However, the Department has made some changes to the proposed rule in response to certain issues raised by the commenters, and in response to the final rules published on July 26, 1991, implementing titles I, II, and III of the ADA, which address, respectively, equal employment opportunity for individuals with disabilities (title I); nondiscrimination on the basis of disability in State and local government services (title II); and nondiscrimination on the basis of disability by public accommodations and in commercial facilities (title III). (See 29 CFR part 1630, 56 FR 35726 (title I); 28 CFR part 35, 56 FR 35694 (title II); and 28 CFR part 36, 56 FR 3544 (title III). A change in terminology that has been made in the part 9 final rule (and which also will be made to the rule in 24 CFR part 8) is replacement of the term ``handicap'' with ``disability.'' The Rehabilitation Amendments of 1992 (Pub.L. 102&hyph;569, approved October 29, 1992) amended the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to replace ``handicap'' with ``disability.'' The additional changes made to the part 9 proposed rule by this final rule include the following. Applicable Accessibility Standards The final rule provides that HUD will follow the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS), except where the accessibility standards issued under the ADA provide for greater accessibility than the UFAS. The accessibility standards issued under the ADA are referred to as the ADA Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG), and are set forth in appendix A to 39 CFR part 1191. The UFAS implements the accessibility standards required by the Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151&hyph;4157) (Barriers Act), and these standards are set forth in 24 CFR part 40, appendix A for residential structures, and in 41 CFR 101&hyph;19.600 to 101.607 for non-residential structures. The DOJ, by memorandum dated June 30, 1993, advised all Federal agencies that at a recent meeting, the ATBCB adopted a resolution urging Federal agencies to follow the ADAAG whenever it provides equal or greater accessibility than UFAS. The DOJ has requested that Federal agencies which have not issued their final rules implementing section 504 in Federally-conducted programs and activities comply with the ATBCB's request. The DOJ notes that from a legal point of view, current section 504 regulations do not prohibit implementation of such a policy because the regulations do not require compliance with UFAS, but, rather they simply state that compliance with UFAS is deemed to be compliance with section 504 new construction and alteration requirements.
