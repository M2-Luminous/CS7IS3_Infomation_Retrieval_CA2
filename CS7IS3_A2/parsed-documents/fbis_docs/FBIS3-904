In the letters to the three presidents, Francois Mitterrand, Paul Biya, and Sani Abacha -- with copies received by AFP today -- the CD believes that a war over the Bakassi Peninsula would only worsen the two African countries' social problems. In the text sent to President Mitterrand, the CD criticizes French intervention in the dispute "because of its potential for provocation." "The present French intervention as part of the treaty between Paris and Yaounde -- while the dispute could be resolved bilaterally and regionally -- contradicts the ideals of the United Nations and its bodies, especially the Security Council, where your country has a permanent seat," the letter indicates. In the letters sent to the Cameroonian and Nigerian presidents, the CD accuses the two leaders of using the border issue "to divert" their fellow citizens' attention from the socio-economic problems of their respective countries. According to the CD, a diplomatic solution should be found to this crisis which has been affecting the relations between the two countries for two and a half months now.
