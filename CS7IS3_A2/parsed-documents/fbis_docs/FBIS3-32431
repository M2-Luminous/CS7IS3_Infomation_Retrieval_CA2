Presidential spokesman Felix Loarca said the rumors about top military commanders planning tactical movements to oust the former human rights ombudsman were "groundless." He said: "Ramiro de Leon is working at the presidential residence and carrying out his routine activities." "The president has reiterated that peace prevails in the country and that its institutions are stronger than ever today," he added. Loarca pointed out that the Guatemalan officers accept their role in the democratic system and that the reports are simply rumors," he pointed out. [no beginning quotation marks as received] Loarca called on the population not to pay attention to the coup rumors that attempt to destabilize the country's institutions. This past weekend, the local PRENSA LIBRE and SIGLO VEINTIUNO morning newspapers reported on troop movements in different areas in Guatemala City. Such movements are similar to the ones that have preceded previous coups d'etat in the country. The Defense Ministry has reported that the military movements were routine actions and reaffirmed its full support for Guatemalan President Ramiro de Leon. "Our objective is to further the consolidation of the democratic process and to ensure, as the institution in charge of the country's security and sovereignty, that institutional order is maintained," Defense Minister General Mario Enriquez stated. On Sunday, SIGLO VEINTIUNO hinted at the possibility of "the military coup ghost in Guatemala" and advanced that "a very important general" in the Armed Forces had stated at a secret meeting that "it was impossible for a victorious Army to be led to the losers' territory." The officer, thus, referred to the president's decision to accept the presence of a UN representative at the peace negotiations with the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (URNG) rebels. According to the newspaper, if a coup d'etat occurs now, when the rebels are almost annihilated, it would give the URNG some air, mainly in the international sphere where its position has deteriorated after the fall of previous President Jorge Serrano. In a parliamentary election early on 6 June 1993, de Leon assumed the Guatemalan presidency which was left vacant by Serrano who, after a brief self-inflicted coup d'etat, abandoned the country and took asylum in Panama.
