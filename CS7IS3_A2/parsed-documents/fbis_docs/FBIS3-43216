FBIS3-43216 "cr00000004894001" 28 January 1994 Article Type:FBIS Document Type:FOREIGN MEDIA NOTE--FB PN 94-011--SAUDI-PLO SAUDI ARABIA: IMPROVING RELATIONS WITH THE PLO Summary: The meeting between Saudi King Fahd and PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat on 24 January (reported by Saudi radio) marked the culmination of a steady improvement in Saudi-PLO relations in recent weeks. Signs of impending rapprochement were visible as early as late December, when the expatriate publication AL-MAJALLAH prominently displayed a picture of PLO Chairman 'Arafat warmly greeting the Saudi Ambassador to London. Other evidence of improving relations, including the recent exchanges of letters and PLO officials' visits to the kingdom, were chronicled in an early January article in the expatriate daily AL-HAYAH. 'Arafat Meets Saudi Ambassador in London Initial evidence of Saudi-PLO rapprochement appeared in the 26 December issue of AL-MAJALLAH, a London Arabic-language weekly magazine, which prominently displayed at the top of its Society page a picture of Yasir 'Arafat warmly greeting and shaking hands with Saudi Ambassador to London Gazzi al-Qusayby during the PLO chairman's state visit to Britain earlier that month. AL-HAYAH Notes Improving Saudi-PLO Relations The London-based and Saudi-owned daily AL-HAYAH published an article by Sulayman Nasr on 7 January that assessed improvements in Saudi-PLO relations in recent weeks. Nasr emphasized several signs of increasingly cordial relations: the first public exchange of letters since the onset of the Gulf War between Saudi King Fahd and PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat, and recent visits by several Fatah Central Committee members and Faysal al-Husayni, chief Palestinian negotiator in the peace talks. Exchange of Letters According to the article, 'Arafat's letter to King Fahd expressed "congratulations on the opening of the Consultative Council," the Majlis al-Shura, and "deep gratitude for the continuous brotherly support (he) extended to the Palestinian people." King Fahd reportedly replied in a cable published by the Saudi Press Agency on 6 January: "With my appreciation for what you, your dear people, and your brothers expressed, I ask God Almighty for all to succeed in benefitting our Arab and Islamic nation and to attain its virtuous objectives, in the forefront of which are the hopes and the objectives of the Palestinian people at this important stage of its history, as it builds its institutions as a foundation for establishing an independent state with Jerusalem as its capital, God willing." Nasr stressed that the publication of the exchange between King Fahd and 'Arafat was "the first time" that Saudi media had published a cable from the Saudi monarch to 'Arafat since the outbreak of the Gulf crisis and the ensuing deterioration of Saudi- PLO relations. Nasr further noted that 'Arafat had previously sent King Fahd several cables and congratulatory letters which had elicited no published Saudi response. Nasr speculated that the failure to respond had been due to Saudi "reservations about dealing with the Palestinian president since the outbreak of the Gulf crisis," noting specifically the repeated Saudi rejection of "rapprochement with 'Arafat," despite his attempts to visit Saudi Arabia. Fatah Members Visit the Kingdom In addition to the exchange of messages, Nasr reported that a Palestinian delegation from the Fatah Central Committee visited Saudi Arabia to attend the funeral of the Palestinian ambassador to Riyadh, Subhi Abu-Karsh (Abu al-Mundhir), who was buried in al- Madinah on 5 January. The delegation consisted of Salim Za'nun, vice president of the Palestine National Council, 'Abbas Zaki, Nasr Yusuf, and Intisar al-Wazir (Umm Jihad), as well as a number of other officials. According to the author, the delegation visited the kingdom for "humanitarian reasons" and did not meet with any Saudi officials. However, Nasr observed that "this is the first time this many Fatah officials have visited Saudi Arabia" since the Gulf crisis. Visit by Faysal al-Husayni Nasr also underscored the importance of the month-long visit of Palestinian leader Faysal al-Husayni, "one of the most prominent officials from inside Palestine." According to Nasr, al-Husayni's visit was limited "to bringing the Saudis up-to-date" on developments in the occupied territories, in particular those concerning Jerusalem, "which holds special value for Saudi Arabia." While there, however, al-Husayni held a private meeting with "a high-ranking Saudi official," in addition to his "official meeting" with Foreign Minister Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal on 26 December. The journalist speculated that al-Husayni "no doubt" discussed with the Saudis political matters related to the Palestinians, including the roadblocks facing the implementation of the PLO-Israel Declaration of Principles. The article concluded by stating that al-Husayni conveyed his "strong satisfaction" with his informal meetings with Saudi officials and with their views regarding "the Palestinian issue, its latest developments, the Saudi approach to this issue, and the continuous Saudi support for the Palestinian people, especially those who are under occupation."
