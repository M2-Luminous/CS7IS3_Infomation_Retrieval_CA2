Sources said that when the berths go into operation, the annual handling capacity will reach eight million standard containers. The first-phase construction of Yantian port consisted of 58 projects, including a 24-kilometer highway from the port to Pinghu Railway Station, a 72-kilometer highway from the port to Huizhou city, six berths with an annual handling capacity of 2.8 million tons and a container yard with an area of 240,000 square meters, and a 6.29-square-kilometer infrastructural base for water- and electricity-supply and telecommunications services. The port is designed to be computer-controlled and it now has hundreds of up-to-date port machines. The second phase of the construction of the port will start later this year.
