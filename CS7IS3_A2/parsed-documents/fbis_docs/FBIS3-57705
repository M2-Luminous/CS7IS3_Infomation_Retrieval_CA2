It consists of five points: 1. To approve the state privatization program. 2. The Supreme Council of the Republic of Crimea and Congresses of People's Deputies of all levels should elaborate and approve by 1 March 1994 corresponding regional privatization programs based on the state program. 3. The Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers, jointly with the Supreme Council commission for issues of economic reform and management of the national economy, is to prepare and submit for the Supreme Council's consideration by 1 March proposals on introducing changes and additions to Ukraine's legislative acts with the aim of creating conditions for the implementation of the state privatization program for 1994 and ensure that the interests of the socially unprotected strata of Ukraine's population are protected. 4. The Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers is to prepare by 15 February and submit for the Supreme Council's consideration the draft law on privatization of land plots and proposals on introducing additions to the criminal code and Ukraine's code on administrative violations in the part that relates to imposing sanctions for violating the privatization legislation. 5. The Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers is instructed to ensure that a single computer information network for implementing privatization and a single data base on privatization facilities is created by 1 April 1994. People's Deputy Popov, the head of the commission on basic sectors of the national economy, made a speech. He informed deputies about the situation that had arisen with regard to "Blasko" Black Sea shipping company. An analysis of the activities of the Black Sea shipping company for the first six months of 1993 had indicated a 16-fold drop in the level of annual clear hard currency receipts, compared with 1992. The total indebtedness of the Black Sea shipping company to the state budget is 106 billion karbovantsi. The hard currency debt of the Black Sea shipping company over nine months of 1993 was $5.6 million. Information about the construction of an administrative building for $10 million, the purchase of a nine seater luxury plane, and the construction of a business center for more than $3 million was confirmed. The commission qualified these actions as an "irresponsible and inexpedient use of state property and funds that led to material losses for the state in the form of state enterprises." "Some irregularities in the way the accounts were kept give grounds to suspect the existence of 'double accountancy,' which enabled those responsible to avoid paying tens of millions of dollars to Ukraine's hard currency fund," said Popov. The conclusions that Popov made in his speech were: Such actions "forced the commission to approve a demand to the cabinet of ministers to dismiss Ukrainian Transport Minister Klympush and the president of "Blasko," Mr. Kudyukin, from their posts."
