FR940725-0-00114 FR940725-0-00014 FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION 47 CFR Part 1 [FCC 94&hyph;181] Document Specifications AGENCY: Federal Communications Commission. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Commission grants petitions for reconsideration of previous order amending the Commission's rules regarding document specifications. The rule is amended to eliminate the character per inch requirement for Commission filings. Instead, the amended rule requires that Commission filings must utilize type of at least 12-point in height, must be double spaced, and must be filed on A4 or 8.5 × 11 inch (21.6 cm. × 27.9 cm.) paper with the printed material not exceeding 6.5 × 9.5 inches (16.5 cm. × 24.1 cm.). EFFECTIVE DATE: July 25, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: S. Lee Martin, Office of General Counsel (202) 418&hyph;1758. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This is a summary of the Commission's memorandum opinion and order, adopted on July 7, 1994, and released on July 20, 1994. The full text of the memorandum opinion and order is available for inspection and copying during normal business hours in the FCC Reference Center (Room 239), 1919 M Street NW., Washington, D.C. The complete text may also be purchased from the Commission's copy contractor, International Transcription Service, Inc., Suite 140, 2100 M Street NW., Washington, DC 20037. Summary of Memorandum Opinion and Order 1. By its order the Commission granted reconsideration of a previous order, Amendment of Section 1.49 of the Commission's Rules, 58 FR 63087 (Nov. 30, 1993), that was intended to ensure against the circumvention of the page limitations by the use of printing reduction processes. To achieve this goal more effectively, the Commission determined on reconsideration that it would eliminate the character per inch requirement, but that it would amend §1.49(a) to specify with greater precision the acceptable format for Commission filings. These changes are designed to ensure that all parties filing a particular pleading have an equal opportunity to make a substantive presentation to the Commission without regard to whether they have access to sophisticated word processing equipment. 2. Section 1.49(a) continues to require that all Commission filings be double spaced, but the rule is amended to specify a distance of at least 7/32 of an inch (0.158 cm.) between the lines. Although footnotes and quoted material may be single spaced, parties are cautioned against abusing the page limitations with filings that contain excessive single spaced material. The permissible paper size is unchanged but the rule is amended to specify that the margins must be set so that the printed material does not exceed 6.5 × 6.9 inches (16.5 × 24.1 cm.). 3. The Commission has adopted the suggestion that pleadings must utilize 12-point or larger type, but it has deleted the character per inch requirement. Such requirement was deemed unnecessary in light specifications as to point size, margins, and the minimum distance between each line of text. 4. The Commission also amended 47 CFR 1.50 to reflect that briefs should be typewritten or mechanically produced unless the Commission specifically requests printed briefs, and that typewritten or mechanically produced briefs must meet all the general format specifications that are set forth in section 1.49(a) of the rules. List of Subjects for 47 CFR Part 1 Administrative practice and procedure, Pleadings, Briefs, and other papers. Federal Communications Commission. William F. Caton, Acting Secretary. Rule Changes Part 1 of Chapter I of Title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations is amended as follows: PART 1_[AMENDED] 1. The authority citation for Part 1 continues to read as follows: Authority: Secs. 4, 303, 48 Stat. 1066, 1082, as amended; 47 U.S.C. 154, 303; Implement, 5 U.S.C. 552 and 21 U.S.C. 853a, unless otherwise noted. 2. Section 1.49 is amended by revising paragraph (a) to read as follows: §1.49 Specifications as to pleadings and documents. (a) All pleadings and documents filed in any Commission proceeding shall be typewritten or prepared by mechanical processing methods, and shall be filed on A4 (21 cm. × 29.7 cm.) or on 81/2 × 11 inch (21.6 cm. × 27.9 cm.) paper with the margins set so that the printed material does not exceed 61/2 × 91/2 inches (16.5 cm. × 24.1 cm.). The printed material may be in any typeface of at least 12-point (0.42333 cm. or 12/72 ’ ’) in height. The body of the text must be double spaced with a minimum distance of 7/32 of an inch (0.5556 cm.) between each line of text. Footnotes and long, indented quotations may be single spaced, but must be in type that is 12-point or larger in height, with at least 1/16 of an inch (0.158 cm.) between each line of text. Counsel are cautioned against employing extended single spaced passages or excessive footnotes to evade prescribed pleading lengths. If single-spaced passages or footnotes are used in this manner the pleading will, at the discretion of the Commission, either be rejected as unacceptable for filing or dismissed with leave to be refiled in proper form. Pleadings may be printed on both sides of the paper. Pleadings that use only one side of the paper shall be stapled, or otherwise bound, in the upper left-hand corner; those using both sides of the paper shall be stapled twice, or otherwise bound, along the left-hand margin so that it opens like a book. The foregoing shall not apply to printed briefs specifically requested by the Commission, official publications, charted or maps, original documents (or admissible copies thereof) offered as exhibits, specially prepared exhibits, or if otherwise specifically provided. All copies shall be clearly legible. * * * * * 3. Section 1.50 is revised to read as follows: §1.50 Specifications as to briefs. The Commission's preference is for briefs that are typewritten or prepared by mechanical processing methods. Printed briefs will be accepted only if specifically requested by the Commission. Typewritten or mechanically produced briefs must conform to all of the specifications for pleadings and documents set forth in §1.49.
