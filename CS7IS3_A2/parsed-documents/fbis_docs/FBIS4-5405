FBIS4-5405 "dreas069_a_94009" FBIS-EAS-94-069 Daily Report 11 April 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan More on Aftermath of Hosokawa's Resignation More on Aftermath of Hosokawa's Resignation Watanabe on Post-Hosokawa Politics OW1004143294 OW1004143294 BFN [Editorial report] Tokyo FNN Television in Japanese at 2329 GMT on 9 April, in its "News 2001" program, carries a live 20-minute interview with former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe by FNN announcers Yuji Kuroiwa and Seiko Tomomi, political commentator Kenichi Takemura, and Keio University professor Yoshiaki Kobayashi at the FNN studio in Tokyo. Asked what he thinks of the opportunity for him to realize the things written in his newly published book "New Conservative Revolution," Watanabe says: "Of course, I do not think that what I wrote in the book will be realized 100 percent." In response to a question on whether he will run for prime minister if asked by the ruling coalition, Watanabe says: "They have not approached me as yet. The LDP has to do its best to regain power. However, the best way for me is to have a comfortable number of members of the Liberal Democratic Party support me." He then explains the need and importance of finding coalition members who share the same beliefs, rather than trying to find as many partners as possible for the sake of getting sufficient numbers. On allying with the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], Watanabe points out several policy differences between the LDP and the SDPJ and says: "There are fundamental differences between the LDP and the SDPJ. Although the SDPJ has been changing recently, it is still unable to change completely. The SDPJ is unable to respond to the changing times. Therefore, it will be difficult for us to form a partnership with the SDPJ unless it does something like changing the party and starting anew." However, he says he can form a coalition with some of the SDPJ members who are called Democrats. On the political style of Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito, Watanabe says although he does not like it, he agrees with Ozawa's fundamental political ideas. Watanabe rules out the possibility of forming a coalition with Komeito under the current situation. He points out that Komeito's fundamental policies are quite different from those of the LDP. He said: "They said, when they formed the coalition government, that the LDP government's fundamental policies would be maintained but the situation was different when it came to talking about concrete measures." Asked what he thinks of Foreign Minister Hata becoming the next prime minister, Watanabe explains the importance of policies, saying: "The problem is what kind of policies he will have, or whether or not his policies will be similar to ours." Kobayashi goes back to the question of whether or not Watanabe wants to become the next prime minister, urging Watanabe to tell the people that he wants serve as prime minister. In response, Watanabe says: "I do want to become a prime minister, by all means, if I am allowed to do even 70 or 65 percent of what I wrote in my book."
