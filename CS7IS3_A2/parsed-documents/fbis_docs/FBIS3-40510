The FS-X development project began the development in FY88 of a new fighter on the premise that it will be based on the F-16C and a combination of Japanese and U.S. technologies. The development period was set for 11 years, ending in FY98. The basic design was completed and a full-scale mockup built in FY92. During FY93, the project worked on detail designs and started the production of four prototypes, including two ground test prototypes for checking controllability and the structural strength and fatigue strength of the airframe and two more prototypes for inflight testing of the performance of the airframe. In FY94, the developers will continue the work to complete the prototypes and will begin the technical tests, including the performance check; they hope to conduct the test flight in July 1995. Since the development has been moving quite well to date and on schedule, it was decided to set up the preparation office now, to prepare the ground technical support facilities and other necessary systems required for the application tests. Two FS-X test pilots are being dispatched to the United States this month for five months to attend the test pilot course of the U.S. Department of Defense. More pilots will be trained later as they are selected. At the same time, the test facilities are being built near Gifu Base; in addition to the completion of an engine stand, the flight-test control system, which will be used for the test flight of FS-X and others, has been completed, and its test operation began at Gifu Base in September. The system will help to accelerate the flight tests and improve safety, as it will process and display the test data in real time as it communicates with the test airplane during a test flight. In addition, test plane hangars and engine hangars are being constructed and are expected to be delivered soon, and the simulator, as well as its enclosing facilities, will be completed by the end of the year, which indicates that everything will be ready when it is needed.
