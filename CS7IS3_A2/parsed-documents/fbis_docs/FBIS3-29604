"Frankly speaking, an early breakthrough on the issue is unlikely, " Deputy Foreign Minister Koichiro Matsuura, a chief negotiator in the Japan-U.S. trade framework talks, said in a speech sponsored by the Japan National Press Club. Terming solution of the issue "very difficult," Matsuura proposed holding informal sessions between the two countries. Bilateral negotiations on a governmental basis are limited following the collapse of the framework talks during the Japan-U.S. summit earlier this month, he said. As part of efforts to mend the soured economic relations with Washington, Matsuura cited the need for Japan to cut its global current-account surplus "significantly" within four to five years, in line with the Japan-U.S. accord last July. As a first step, Tokyo should achieve its economic target for fiscal 1994 of cutting the ratio of the global current-account surplus against gross domestic product to 2.8 percent from about 3.1 percent estimated for the current year, he said. Achieving that figure would lead to a reduction in Japan's trade surplus with the U.S., which accounted for more than half of its global surplus of nearly 120 billion dollars in calendar 1993, Matsuura said. He said the state of the U.S. trade balance with Japan is like "a thermometer gauging U.S. harshness against Tokyo." Matsuura called for U.S. efforts to reduce its budget deficit, expand savings and increase industrial competitiveness, in line with its commitments shown in the July 1993 meeting between then Japanese Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton. Matsuura criticized the U.S. for threatening to scrap a global trade accord proposal on electronic components. Washington recently unveiled a plan to retract a 60 percent to 70 percent cut in tariffs on electronic parts as agreed under the Uruguay Round of multilateral talks sponsored by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). The U.S. said it will opt for the step because Japan has rejected a U.S. call for removal of wood product tariffs in Japan. Tokyo agreed in the Uruguay Round to halve the tariffs. The latest U.S. action is "unconvincing" in terms of the procedure of the global trade talks, Matsuura said. The concluded Uruguay Round allowed for additional offers by GATT member countries before February 15 only when such offers are regarded as steps leading to further market opening, Matsuura said. On the overall Japan-U.S. relations, Matsuura said the two countries should do their utmost to prevent the current economic friction from impinging on other aspects like political problems. It would reflect a "relationship of grown-ups" if the matter is handled at an economic level and prevented from worsening the overall relations of the two countries, he said.
