Answering a question from an ITAR-TASS correspondent on the prospects for a Bosnian settlement, he expressed satisfaction with the fact that a kind of contact group has already been set up at the level of experts. "France is in favor of convening a meeting of representatives of the European Union, Russia, and the United States with the participation of the United Nations." Such a course should enable progress to be made in the search for ways to a peaceful settlement in Bosnia, he believes. Some aspects of the Bosnian crisis were touched upon at talks between official delegations and expert groups from France and Turkmenistan within the framework of Francois Mitterrand's working visit to Ashkhabad, which ended today. The French side set out its approach to the Bosnia problem and expressed regret in connection with the fact that Foreign Minister Alain Juppe had not come to Turkmenistan. He was unable to leave Europe because French diplomacy is currently undertaking active efforts in the Bosnian sphere.
