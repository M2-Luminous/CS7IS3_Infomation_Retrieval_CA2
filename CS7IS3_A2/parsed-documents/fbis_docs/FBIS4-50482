Liu Bangyun and Huang Kaihong were sentenced to death after the Supreme People's Court verified the incidents and gave its approval; they were executed by shooting in Sichuan today. In November 1991, Liu Bangyun, without applying for a business license, rented a distillery in Huaishu Village, Yunxi Town, Shifang County, illegally to brew and sell the white spirit for consumption. In August 1993, Liu Bangyun hired Huang Kaihong, who had been released from a reform-through-labor institution, to promote sales. To seek staggering profits, Liu Bangyun and Huang Kaihong hatched the scheme to lace the white spirit with industrial alcohol. From 17-30 September 1993, they bought 3.8 tonnes of industrial alcohol through fraudulent means on four occasions, and mixed it with water to produce some 20 tonnes of the white spirit in bulk, which they sold in Shifang and Guanghan Counties. At the distillery, they also retailed the spirit to people in nearby villages. On 9 October 1993, Ye Shaofu and Ye Shaorong, two brothers in Huaishu Village where the distillery is located, bought 28 jin of the white spirit in bulk from the distillery for a funeral dinner in memory of their late father. Many guests at the dinner suffered from methanol poisoning after drinking the spirit. Although they were given emergency treatment in a hospital, Ye Shaofu, Ye Shaorong, and several people who suffered from poisoning sustained severe eye damage and lost their sight as a result. At midday on 12 October 1993, Chen Zhonghui, a woman in Qingming Village, Yunxi Town, entertained guests at her home. In all, she drank about three liang of the spirit, during the day and at night. After the drinks, her vision turned blurry, and she was too weak to walk. She died on that night. During the 10-day period from 4-14 Ocotber 1993, 11 cases of alcohol poisoning were reported one after another in Yunxi Town and Minzhu Township in Shifang County, leaving four people dead, seven seriously harmed, and three with minor injuries. An investigation confirmed that the white spirit consumed in all 11 cases was brewed by Liu Bangyun and Huang Kaihong. Following an autopsy of the dead, and testing of the poisonous substance and samples of the spirit, relevant departments found that the white spirit, brewed by Liu Bangyun and Huang Kaihong through mixing with industrial alcohol, contained methanol whose minimum and maximum contents were 229 and 330 times higher than those set by the state for health reasons. Just drinking a small amount could leave people blind in both eyes or dead. After the incidents, more than 10,000 jin of the toxic spirit, which had not yet been marketed, and which had methanol contents more than 250 times higher than those set by the state, was found at Liu Bangyun's distillery. By wantonly using industrial alcohol to brew the harmful white spirit for sale, Liu Bangyun and Huang Kaihong seriously endangered society and people's lives. Ruling in accordance with the Criminal Law and relevant decisions of the National People's Congress Standing Committee, the Deyang City Intermediate Court convicted Liu Bangyun and Huang Kaihong on charges of brewing and selling toxic and harmful foods. Because the circumstances of the crime and the consequences of the harm inflicted on people were both exceptionally serious, the court sentenced Liu Bangyun and Huang Kaihong to death in accordance with the law, deprived them of their political rights for life, and fined Liu Bangyun 3,300 yuan. Liu Bangyun and Huang Kaihong disagreed with the ruling and filed an appeal. During second-instance proceedings, the Sichuan Provincial Higher People's Court rejected the appeal and upheld the original verdict. A responsible person from the Supreme People's Court pointed out: Criminal activities in producing and selling counterfeit and substandard goods, especially toxic and harmful foods, directly endanger people's lives and safety. People's courts should continue to mete out stiff punishment for such criminal activities in accordance with the law.
