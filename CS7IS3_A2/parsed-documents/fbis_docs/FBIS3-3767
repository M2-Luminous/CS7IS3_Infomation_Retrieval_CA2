These are a strict restriction on fixed assets investment, restriction of the issuing of currency and the amount of credit and restriction of fiscal spending [sentence as received] Mr. Gao said that excessive investment in fixed assets and having too many projects under construction had resulted in the scattering and ineffectiveness of such investment. The investment system, therefore, should be reformed with the scale of investment and the size of credit being strictly controlled and the investment structure improved to better profit from investment. The work efficiency and simplification of the administrative structure should at the same time be implemented on order to reduce spending and waste. Effective control of inflation, Mr. Gao said, in fact depended on the changing from a speed-seeking economy to one bringing benefit. Developing speed and expanding investment should not be pursued blindly while the management level, technological standard and economic results should be enhanced. Enterprises should speed up their running on modern company lines, Mr. Gao said, and reform for strengthening macro-control and improving the social security system should also be quickened. In order to guarantee social stability, the establishment of an unemployment insurance system and vocational training schemes as well as the development of tertiary industry should be speeded up.
