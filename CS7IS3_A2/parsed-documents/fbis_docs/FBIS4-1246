FBIS4-1246 "drafr079_c_94005" FBIS-AFR-94-079 Daily Report 24 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Police Begin Investigation Police Begin Investigation MB2404120094 Johannesburg SAPA in English 1143 GMT 24 Apr 94 MB2404120094 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [Text] Johannesburg April 24 SAPA -- Police on Sunday confirmed seven killed people died and 92 were injured when a carbomb exploded on Sunday [24 April] morning on the corner of Bree and Von Wielligh Streets in central Johannesburg. Speaking at a press conference, Witwatersrand Police liaison officer Col Steve Senekal said: "This is by far the largest bomb that ever went off in Johannesburg. It was comparable to the Pretoria Church Steet bomb blast" on May 20, 1983. Police were not certain what type of explosive was used and said it would take some time to complete the investigation. Col Senekal said two policemen on general patrol were a few metres away from the cream or beige Audi when it exploded. One of the policemen was slightly injured, he said. Col Senekal said police did not have an idea of what the motive or target for the blast was. "It is not for us to speculate. There are various offices in the area such as the SADF [South African Defense Force], PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress] and ANC regional offices." Col Senekal welcomed African National Congress spokesman Carl Niehaus' intervention when a crowd gathered near the scene. Mr Niehaus asked the crowd to be calm and not to retaliate. "We certainly appreciate it. We certainly don't need retaliation." He also appealed to other organisations to ask their members to remain calm. A 70 to 90kg bomb was placed inside or underneath the Audi, which was totally destroyed. Buildings shopfronts and vehicles in the area were severely damaged. The area has been cordoned off and will remain so until at least Monday. Police have already offered a reward of up to R500,000 [rand] for information leading to the arrest of "those responsible for this irresponsible and unbelievable deed". A journalist asked police whether another incident was related to the bomb blast. Apparently a black Toyota Cressida was seen in Bree Street near the Smal Street mall. Three black men were seen lying on the ground spread-eagled. Police could not confirm the incident. Television crews from ABC and CNN were being shown around the blast scene shortly after 1PM. Print journalists will be allowed onto the blast site in groups of two and three later on Sunday.
