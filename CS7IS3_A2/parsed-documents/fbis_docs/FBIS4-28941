On the same day, a crowd of puppet Army bandits armed with automatic weapons, crawled into the demilitarized zone in front of Mt. Taedok in Changpung County on the western sector of the front and whipped up war hysterics, running about the area. These were deliberate and premeditated acts of the South Korean puppets to render the situation of the DMZ strained and incite North-South confrontation. The South Korean puppets must stop acting rashly, pondering over the grave consequences to be entailed by their reckless military provocations.
