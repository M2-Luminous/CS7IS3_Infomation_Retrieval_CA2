At one of its recent meetings, the government of the Republic of Croatia discussed, among other things, a ban on state-owned enterprises being sponsors, because according to government officials some budget beneficiaries have compensated for the lack of money following consolidation of the state budget through sponsorships. As these sponsorship funds originate from state enterprises, many of which are money-losing ventures, the government decided to ban sponsorship by enterprises where it is the majority owner. The competent ministries must reexamine all sponsorship agreements in order to gain insight into the dimensions of this "form of siphoning off funds," as the government described it. The somewhat unusual and unexpected decision by the government comes at an inauspicious time, because the situation has become exacerbated with the strike by education workers. Those involved in cultural affairs felt that they are hardest hit by this government move, and they reacted to it immediately, while athletes, who perhaps will actually be hardest hit by the sponsorship ban, were simply caught off guard. This government decision has intensified certain old economic problems that are detrimental to the market development of the Croatian economy, for which the government still has no solution, although its officials contend that they do. To be sure, these are public enterprises and state-owned enterprises. Although through the decision the government has once again affirmed that it is ready to fully and decisively implement a stabilization program, even adopting such ad hoc decisions if it senses that its goals are threatened, tensions have mounted to a red-hot state while the weaknesses in managing state enterprises have not been resolved. If they had been, the government would not be in the position of accountant for public enterprises; instead, the management would be responsible for its operations. No Strategy The government's moves show that there is no development strategy for these enterprises, whose position in the economy is almost of crucial importance, nor are there projections of their future position. Moreover, it appears that the tacit social consensus that the government enjoyed is slowly being drawn into question. Even now it is becoming clear what this consensus has meant to it in the implementation of the stabilization policy, even though statements by union leaders have long provided an indication of their disappointment with the government's belittlement of its social partners. The government contributed to a great extent to the eruption of the strike by education workers and to the protest by cultural workers through its arrogant and intolerant behavior, only to resolve all issues through negotiations, which should have been attempted even before the strike. In sponsorship, the government sensed the possibility of budget breaches. Valentic recently explained to businessmen and the public that he must insist on the budget adopted by the Assembly, without breaches in a single item on the outlay side, and that position is being followed blindly. However, such a decision--seemingly resolute and perhaps even appropriate--is more of an indication of all the problems of government relations with public enterprises and the lack of strategic guidance for the Croatian economy, in which the state defines its interests and priorities, than it is a reflection of resolve in the pursuit of economic policy. Four years ago, when it was decided to found 11 public enterprises under state authority based on a special societal interest, a major inclination by the new state to control all significant economic subjects was discernible, but at the time it was not realistic to expect that an economic strategy would be known precisely. Over four years' time, however, only Astra has departed from that select group, and nothing significant has happened in the government's policy toward those enterprises. In addition, the state has become the majority owner of a large part of the Croatian economy that has undertaken transformation even though it was expected that with the privatization of the rest of the economy the public enterprises too would gradually begin privatizing. Administrative Committees The public enterprises are very important: One-third of the capital of the Croatian economy and 13 percent of all employees were concentrated in these 10 enterprises when they became public, and they accounted for 11 percent of all revenues. Although all governments have emphasized their importance, and some--such as the Sarinic government--have declared the resolution of their status to be a top priority, key problems have remained in relations with these enterprises, which is unacceptable precisely because of the proclaimed greater interest, but also because of their position on the market. The majority of them are monopolies, but for some this is not a natural position. The state was supposed to manage the enterprises through administrative committees. The way in which functions in the administrative committees were understood in our country is largely well-known, as is the fact that they did not work on strategy and on defining economic policy at the enterprises, nor was their relationship to the state specified. It is interesting to observe how the administrative committees operate based on the example of the Fund for Privatization [HFP]. At the beginning of privatization, the fund's administrative committee had seven members because transformation was not regarded as essential, except declaratively. When privatization got into full swing, the number of members rose to 11, but now that everyone has realized that privatization is an essential process there are 13 members of the administrative committee, while the employers' association has demanded that one of its members be admitted to the fund's administrative committee. Judging from the new acquisitions (Ivic Pasalic), it is clear that these expansions of committee membership are politically motivated, and it can hardly be expected that it will formulate a strategy for development of the Croatian economy. Right now it can be said that the state has not pursued a consistent policy toward the public enterprises. There is no obligation to realize profits and to transfer them to the state budget; some enterprises are exempt from payments of taxes on profits, while some are not; some cover losses from the budget, while some do not, even when the loss is the result of an administrative restriction, etc. To be sure, there cannot be a uniform model in dealing with them, because their roles and positions in the economy differ, but there must be a strategy with defined goals. The overall goal of economic policy must be stability and growth, which will be achieved by increasing business efficiency, and it has long been clear that private enterprises conduct business much more efficiently. Return of "Write-Offs" Of major importance to the economy of any state is how big companies conduct business, especially if they are state-owned. Over the past three years (from 1991 to 1993), the state has helped out Croatian Railroads [HZ] with subsidies amounting to approximately 950 million German marks [DM], but in those three years HZ has operated with additional losses of around DM220 million, which means that more than DM1.1 billion has been spent on the railroads. The projected subsidy for this year is around DM290 million, but the situation is not improving. On the contrary: There have already been strikes and political affairs (Kralj, Seks) at HZ, and the HZ Independent Union recently sent a scathing letter to Prime Minister Valentic concerning detrimental contracts (allegedly, HZ has been harmed to the tune of around DM10 million from only three contracts with private enterprises). Strong opposition to the involvement of Josip Bozicevic, former minister of trade and communication, in the management of HZ was also expressed. The letter from the union includes the following: "We regard the return of those who have been `written off' to the top management of HZ, led by Mr. Bozicevic (65 years old), as an attempt to cover up and conceal plunder and pillage at HZ, and as the return of a nebulous and hopeless state at Croatian Railroads." Although the government has introduced a new bill on railroads that proposes solving the railroad problem in three stages, and although railroads are subsidized everywhere in Europe except in Sweden, it appears that the proposed personnel solutions will be problematic: Experts have also expressed their reservations toward this solution, and it appears that the railroad issue will remain very painful for every Croatian government for some time to come. Of the 10 public enterprises, only NARODNE NOVINE and the HPT [Croatian Post and Telephone] are operating in the black, while Croatian Forests is close to it; besides the railroads, Jadrolinija--which the government is helping with subsidies--and the Croatian Electric Power Industry are operating in the red. The others are borderline, operating at the "break-even point," whereby INA [Petroleum Refining and Sales Enterprise] is eliciting an outcry because of its continued special status, while there are those who have said that INA has its own mini-state budget, although the other public enterprises are not far from that either. All these enterprises have experienced various affairs, and there have also been strikes in them. In this atmosphere and given the unclear state strategy and the imprecise and undefined goals, it has not even been possible for public enterprises to operate any better. The government of Nikica Valentic has also formed an Office for Economics and Restructuring of Public Enterprises, which is responsible for monitoring the economic efficiency of public enterprises and for their restructuring. Incest With Banks Minister Zlatko Matesa has also touched on the especially sensitive subject of relations between public enterprises, but also other major, problematic enterprises (e.g., agricultural-food combines, shipbuilding, iron and steel works), and banks. It has been proposed that the "incestuous" relations, in which these enterprises are the banks' biggest debtors, but at the same time their co-owners and members of their administrative committees, be resolved through a sort of swap of stock among the state, the banks, and the enterprises, but for now this is only an idea. The Office for Reconstruction first dealt with INA, perhaps because the head of the office, Milan Ujevic, also works at INA, for which it was proposed that it be a joint-stock company under state ownership, and afterwards models for the railroads were also proposed. What should be most important is the onset of serious restructuring of these enterprises and their at least partial privatization, which is possible in the majority of public enterprises. Croatian Post and Telephone, the value of which HFP president Penic has estimated at DM6 billion, is a very promising enterprise that operates well, although the price of connections and pulses has dropped while investments have been made in establishing 600,000 new connections. However, that is still a far cry from European standards, especially in the price of connections, but partial privatization of HPT could provide significant resources and thus further improve operations. The same is true of NARODNE NOVINE. Moreover, although the majority have rejected such variants, even HRT [Croatian Radio and Television] could be partially privatized if the political will to do so existed. Smothered Initiative However, it is clear that the state will not decide in favor of more substantial moves to privatize this sphere, and even if it did, such moves would be very gradual. Because of this, it is very important to specify and define the relationship between the state and the public enterprises and the manner in which these enterprises will be led. Setting out strategic goals for these enterprises and appointing a management that will execute them with clear authorities and responsibilities would make the government's job appreciably easier; then it would not be an administrator and accountant for public enterprises, but rather a genuine owner who knows what it wants. In that case, there would also be no problems with sponsorship, because an enterprise would have a marketing budget which, as everywhere, must serve the objective of the best possible business results, for which the management of the enterprise would be responsible to the government. Centralized administration of the kind exhibited by our enterprises, according to studies, leads to poorer business results, which has long since been recognized in the rest of the world. Although the government must keep certain things under control during the implementation phase of the stabilization program, centralization in guiding the economy will certainly be counterproductive, because a big, bureaucratic state apparatus is created that smothers business initiative, and the government increasingly concerns itself with everyday business affairs to the detriment of strategic decisions and especially to the detriment of the creation of legislation and business regulations that will permit economic growth and development.
