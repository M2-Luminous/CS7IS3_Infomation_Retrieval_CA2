Our correspondent has prepared a report on the operation carried out by the Turkish Air Force in northern Iraq, during which some bombs fell on two border villages of our country, killing and wounding some of our compatriots: [Begin recording] [Correspondent] Following the incident, meetings were held between Iranian and Turkish diplomatic officials. In a telephone conversation with Foreign Minister Dr. 'Ali Akbar Velayati, the Turkish foreign minister expressed his regret over this incident and dispatched a team of experts to the area, including some officials from the Turkish Foreign Ministry and the joint headquarters of the Turkish Armed Forces, to investigate the matter. After two days of investigation and inquiry in the area, this team announced the results of its survey yesterday. The head of the Turkish delegation confirmed that shrapnel found in the Iranian border areas was from the Turkish cluster bombs used by the Turkish Air Force last Friday. A statement was signed by the two sides and named The Report of the Joint Inquiry Commission. We interviewed 'Ala'eddin Borujerdi, the deputy foreign minister for Asia and Oceania, regarding this incident and the repercussions of such occurrences on reciprocal relations, which you will now hear: [Borujerdi] All evidence points to the fact--especially in view of the large number of fighter planes that participated in these operations and the close proximity of the PKK [Workers' Party of Kurdistan] centers on Iraqi territory to our villages--that there was no definite intent to attack our territory. We have signed a statement because the rockets and bombs fell on our soil and the Turkish side has repeatedly expressed its extreme regret during the past two days. Turkish officials have announced that they are willing to compensate for the losses, which is quite natural. I believe that with the cooperation of the two sides, we will be able to attain results. This incident is a source of immense regret for all. Foreign Ministry officials express their condolences to the families of the victims. We hope that we can defend our national interests with regard to this incident. [Correspondent] What kind of bad effects can such incidents have on bilateral relations? [Borujerdi] It is natural that negative incidents can have concomitant deleterious effects. It is important that such incidents be prevented in the future. I have clearly brought this up with the Turkish ambassador. We have officially requested of the Turkish Government that if they carry out any military operations in the future they should do so after careful study so that there is no encroachment on our soil.
