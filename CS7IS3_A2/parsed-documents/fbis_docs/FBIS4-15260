Our correspondent discussed the aims and tasks of the "Rosvooruzheniye" State Company with Lieutenant General Viktor Samoylov, general director of the "Rosvooruzheniye" State Company. [Lyashenko] Viktor Ivanovich, what prompted the idea to set up this new arms import and export company? [Samoylov] All these organizations [not further identified] were simply duplicating each other. The new state company is leaving the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations structure, but is nonetheless the successor to the organizations you have listed. Previously, under the rigid system for managing economic activity, foreign exchange revenue from weapons sales was distributed by the state itself. The situation then changed, enterprises were being floated, and they began acquiring their own economic interests. The process of producers entering the foreign market began to snowball. But how could this be done without knowing the basic rules adopted in the world of the arms trade, without having any idea about pricing conditions, the system of credit provision, and much else besides -- quite apart from the fact that the arms trade business, as a rule, is strictly secret and foreigners are not privy to these secrets? But this was not all. Often the interests of such businessmen overlap with the interests of our state, and buyers played them off against each other in order to knock down the price of military goods. Just imagine the picture of the Bangladeshi or Malaysian defense ministers, who were visited by 24 Russian representatives in the space of a year, each claiming the exclusive right to supply Russian weapons. [Lyashenko] What specifically will "Rosvooruzheniye" be doing? [Samoylov] Primarily, importing and exporting all sorts of weapons and military hardware, military property, and strategically important raw materials. We are beginning to operate in the world market as a powerful financial and industrial group with excellent professionals who know not only about military hardware but also about economics and marketing -- in other words, the entire arms trade mechanism. One fundamentally new task is to invest our own funds and those of others in defense-sector enterprises. Organizing our work with them on a contractual basis, our company plans to use state and commercial credits to develop and produce primarily weapons types and military hardware that will be competitive on the world market. The largest military-industrial complex enterprises will continue to take part in foreign economic activity under agreements with "Rosvooruzheniye." [Lyashenko] How will the income be shared out between those taking part in the production and sale of military products? [Samoylov] We are developing this mechanism. But, for instance, in the United States the bulk of the money raised from arms sales goes to reduce the burden of defense expenditure and to subsidize defense production. It resolves the problems of restructuring the defense complex. [Lyashenko] Viktor Ivanovich, in restructuring the arms trade like this, will we not be losing our old and pretty good ties on the world market? [Samoylov] "Rosvooruzheniye" has made a very cautious entry into the market. The arms trade is a relatively long process -- it is not the same as pumping oil down a pipeline. After all, the partner state buying our weapons also has to make a government-level decision and allocate budget appropriations. And it is very difficult to make such important decisions in a democratic state with its multiparty system and different views, whereby you sometimes need a virtually nationwide referendum to decide whether to buy our MiG's or a U.S. aircraft. That is why the people representing the vendor country are exceptionally important to the purchaser country. And we are doing everything to ensure that Russia's prestige in this area is not damaged.
