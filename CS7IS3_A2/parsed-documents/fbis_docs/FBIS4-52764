Defence Minister Najib Tun Razak said: We have repeatedly requested the UN to take more firm measures in the Bosnian issue not only because of the increasing number of fatal casualties among UN peacekeepers but also because of the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Bosnians. Bosnia is a dangerous and chaotic place and incidents can happen anywhere at any time and our personnel are always at risk. He was speaking at a press conference where he gave details of the death of Mejar [Major] Ariffin Zakaria, 33, who was killed by Serb mortar fire while on duty Thursday. Najib said stronger action by the UN was needed because the situation could deteriorate further in the future.
