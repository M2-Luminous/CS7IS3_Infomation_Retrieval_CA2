The domestic industry puts out only about 20,000 chemical reagents, while some of the leading companies in the world produce as much as 15,000 to 20,000 items each. This is because the technical level of domestic low-tonnage production fails to meet modern needs. The creation of a diversified low-tonnage production system by traditional methods is lengthy process that must be ecologically clean and thrifty in resources, while a large assortment stimulates production of a gamma of products at a single location. This makes it imperative to develop diversified chemical reagent production along the lines of a flexible production system employing specialized equipment modules. The present work discusses some general principles in synthesis in flexible production of chemical reagents based on the analysis of individual products, their properties, and effectiveness. The procedure for synthesis is presented in the form of a whole system consisting of three mutual sub-systems: a) automated analysis and synthesis; b) formation of a technological equipment park and development of equipment blocks and modules; c) building base structures and formation of structural-technological schemes.
