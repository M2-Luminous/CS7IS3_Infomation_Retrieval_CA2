Speaking to a delegation of the lower chamber of Russian Parliament, headed by Sergey Baburin, Bozovic said that Yugoslavia was an example how the strength of the world's powers was demonstrated through international sanctions as an unprecedented form of violence against innocent civilians. An entire nation, Bozovic said, is punished because the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia urges the respect of the right to self-determination for all peoples in the conflicts in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia. The Russian parliamentarians pointed out the united stand of all parliamentary political parties of the lower chamber on the Yugoslav crisis and the necessity to lift the international sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. They said they were certain that Russian parliament would soon pass a law on their lifting and that the latest initiatives by the Russian Government would step up this process in the international community. The MPs assessed that the world community had violated the principles of international law by recognizing the disintegrations of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and had thus triggered a serious crisis in international relations. Along these lines, they underscored the necessity for establishing a new system of collective security, having in mind the national interests of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Russia. The Russian parliamentarians were also received by Serbian Vice Premier Slobodan Radulovic. During these talks, the two sides set out the complementarity of the economies of Russia and Serbia and the mutual interest for cooperation to continue. Vice President of the Socialist Party of Serbia Goran Percevic underscored the important effect Russia had had on securing a more balanced approach to the resolving of the Yugoslav crisis and said he was certain that Russia would continue to act in this direction.
