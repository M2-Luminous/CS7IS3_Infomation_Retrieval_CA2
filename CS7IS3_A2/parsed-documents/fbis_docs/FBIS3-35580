It turns out that calculations made by the Russian military differ somewhat from reports by the U.S. special services, particularly over the issue of assessing the level of inaccuracy involved when Pyongyang tested the North Korean missile "Nodong-1" last May. The Pentagon and the CIA note that the effectiveness of the North Korean missile is insignificant in combat terms, and it can be "several kilometers" wide of its target. Meanwhile in the notes which have been obtained by the Japanese press, the Russian special services cite other indicators -- according to the Russian version, "Nodong-1" was only 100-200 meters wide of its target, which is clearly adequate for performing combat tasks using a 1-2 megatonne warhead and a flight velocity of Mach 9. In addition to this significant detail, specialists are also studying other curious nuances regarding this matter while noting that the material obtained by SHUKAN BUNSHUN in Moscow deserves to be looked at in great detail. In this connection it makes sense to note that Akira Kato, the author of the article that has caused such a storm, does not work at the weekly and is a "free lance" by profession, untied to any one publication. He speaks Russian, is well known for his numerous pieces on Russia, and frequently travels to our country. I managed to locate the person from SHUKAN BUNSHUN who edited the General Staff material, sent it off for typesetting, and checked the authenticity of the facts. This was Mr. Kimata. According to him, the authenticity of the Russian report, which comprises 36 pages of closely written text, is beyond doubt; he also has a tape-recorded interview with the "leader" and a number of other documents which for the time being are "off limits." Needless to say, the editorial office refused to identify the "leader," although it indirectly confirmed that this person occupies an official position in a top department and is a military officer. The weekly also has in its possession other material on this extremely explosive issue which it is preparing for publication. In a telephone conversation with your IZVESTIYA correspondent, the author of the article also refused to disclose his sources of information in the Russian General Staff, but he confirmed that his meetings and conversations with servicemen in Moscow were deadly serious and that a detailed transcript has been made of all the facts which he gathered in the Russian capital. From the Editorial Office. Neither today nor in its previous edition did IZVESTIYA claim that the report in the Japanese weekly was 100 percent truthful. In our view, this is not the most important point. It is clear that a Japanese journalist working on his own would not have been able to manufacture such a "bombshell" and that he was helped to do so by Russian sources. It is still unclear which ones precisely.
