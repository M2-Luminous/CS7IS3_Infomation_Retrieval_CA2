Takeshi Nagano, president of the Japan Federation of Employers Associations (Nikkeiren), said it contains few new elements. The draft should have included more of the original policy objectives of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, especially in seeking a higher quality of living for Japanese, he said. Nagano suggested that spending should have been expanded to reform the nation's industrial structure, such as providing appropriations for agriculture. Masaru Hayami, chairman of the Japan Association of Corporate Executives (Keizai Doyukai), said drastic cuts in expenditures should be sought through a complete review of outlays for individual ministries and agencies. Kosaku Inaba, chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, urged the government to strictly check expenditures in implementing the budget. But Inaba welcomed an increase of more than 4 percent in the proposed public works spending for its economic stimulation effects.
