FR940622-2-00077 FR940622-2-00060 [Docket No. 50&hyph;245] Northeast Utilities (Millstone Nuclear Plant, Unit 1); Receipt of Petition for Director's Decision Under 10 CFR 2.206 Notice is hereby given that by letter dated May 23, 1994, Anthony J. Ross (Petitioner) has requested that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (Commission): (1) Issue a Severity Level II violation against a maintenance manager at the Millstone plant, (2) institute other sanctions against the manager, and (3) remove the maintenance manager from his position until resolution of the issues raised in his request. Petitioner, who is employed as an electrician at the plant, asks for this action on the grounds that he was told by the maintenance manager that he must report all safety concerns to the manager before reporting them elsewhere. Petitioner asserts that this action reflects an environment of harassment, retaliation and intimidation that exists at the Millstone plant. The request is being treated pursuant to 10 CFR 2.206 of the Commission's regulations. The request has been referred to the Director of the Office of Enforcement. As provided by section 2.206, appropriate time will be taken on this request within a reasonable time. A copy of the Petition is available for inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC 20555. Dated at Rockville, Maryland this 16 day of June 1994. For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Joseph R. Gray, Deputy Director, Office of Enforcement. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;15133 Filed 6&hyph;21&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7590&hyph;01&hyph;M
