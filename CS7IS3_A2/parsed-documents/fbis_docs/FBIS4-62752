Services are continuing on many routes, above all those operated out of the capital's airports. Nevertheless, as the public relations department of the Russian Federation Ministry of Transport told ITAR-TASS, departures have been cancelled or delayed in a number of cities. In Ufa, for instance, nine flights were cancelled, and two in St. Petersburg. Meanwhile, the office of Russia's procurator-general has filed suit against the pilots' union, calling for the strike to be declared illegal. The case will be heard today.
