This indicated that all the European and world politicians actively engaged in Balkan matters in the past two to three years had not acquired greater knowledge in the "matters." They had not dug deeply in decoding the specific Balkan mental code. To be honest, we have not done better ourselves, which proves that we are another world among the Balkan peoples: a civilized people, a normal state, a decent society. That is probably why this decision caught us by surprise, although we survive in the middle of all possible Balkan obstructions, nationalisms, chauvinisms, political narrowness, and nonsense. Logic made us think that Greece could not decide to take the irrational action of closing down its consulate or the Thessaloniki port. We had in mind a European Greece. We missed the possibility that the European Union, of which our southern neighbor is a part, does not itself guarantee that all its members have achieved European habits. Absolutely the contrary. The latest actions, first of all the Thessaloniki meetings headed by the Greek priests, then the changes in the U.S. names of streets and public buildings in Drama -- as an expression of Greece's dissatisfaction with U.S. policy toward Macedonia -- and the decision of the Greek government of Papandreou, show that it is a typical Balkan state. It was only a couple of weeks ago that we took into consideration the Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] position in the dispute with Greece in case that country, that is its political leadership, would change its policy of imposing conditions, blackmail, and denial. Papandreou presented the resolution of his government as a "message" to Macedonia, but also to "others", even to all those "who participate in the formation of the stance of the international community." The Greek prime minister thinks that the recognition of our state by a greater part of European countries and the United States was misunderstood in Macedonia, which "got false impressions that it could ignore the Greek positions, and thus create problems for stability in the region at large." According to his evaluation our country "has not taken a single moderate or cautious step" since the breakup of Yugoslavia until today, while "the basic determination of Greece is peace, stability, and security in the region at large." As a matter of fact, we should look for the background and the essence of the Greek action exactly in this formulation. First of all, Papandreou expressed the Greek insult because of the behavior of Greece's partners and allies in reference to its proposals, initiatives, and stances for the solution of the Bosnian conflict. They have been mainly ignored, and the chairmanship of the European Union, while it is being held by Greece, has been reduced to a permanent supervision over the Balkan "juvenile." Papandreou has been insulted by the behavior of the NATO allies who did not take into account the Greek objections to applying force for solving the Bosnian conflict. And now the right time for Greece has come: By turning attention to the south, amidst the general mess, it is trying to prove that Macedonia is a potential factor of crisis in the Balkans, a destabilizing bullet. It is exactly here that Greece wants to achieve a possible national score, at least as long as it chairs the European Union. Thus it hopes to annul the efforts of the world for a preventive stabilization of the furthest south of the Balkans by recognizing Macedonia and allotting it (at least in perspective) economic assistance. In making a decision on this action, the Papandreou government has, as a matter of fact, helped its friend Milosevic in relieving him of some of the enormous pressures he has been exposed to. It is not the first time in the past two years that the Greek penalties for Macedonia have been synchronized with official Belgrade, with the agreement of the interests of our two neighbors. The last one was very much welcomed in Serbia. It was commented as a "Greek reply to the behavior of the White House which is attaching a growing importance to Skopje by installing itself in the Balkans, at the expense of Greece." If we judge by commentaries in the Greek media, or at least by the way they had been interpreted by their colleagues in Belgrade, it seems that Greece is concerned because the importance of its position in Europe, that is in the region, has been diminished. Instead of starting a new policy, as suggested by some of its domestic political elements, for taking the place that belongs to it -- something which Papandreou insists on very much -- by creating problems for the international community Greece becomes even more distant and places itself on the margins. However, the worst of all is that the first reactions of the EU partners bring the latest decision of the Papandreou government related to Macedonia in close connection with the NATO ultimatum, that is its resoluteness finally to become active in Bosnia, as well as with the visit of Papulias to Belgrade. As far as our country is concerned, the Greek decision on closing the borders has certainly been received with surprise and concern, while Athens rejoiced (a typical Balkan characteristic). The concern comes from the fact that with the closure of Thessaloniki's port our economy will suffer additional damage. Due to the respect for the sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro, a large part of our economy was reoriented to this port, and now hard times are ahead for us. And this time, not only due to the lack of gasoline. However, did Macedonia have an easy time at all during the past three years? It constructed its vitality on the basis of difficulties, and I don't see any reason why it should not be that way this time, too. As a matter of fact, one must take into account that the material damages experienced by Macedonia due to such a Greek decision will not be greater than the political ones that Greece will be faced with. The greatest achievement of Macedonia's official attitude so far has been not to succumb to emotions. For instance, to think of some kinds of reciprocal measures or anything similar, which would put us in an equal situation with Greece. We now have a wonderful opportunity to promote our reputation as a European state and people that we mustn't gamble away. It means we mustn't allow any Balkan-style reaction. We must endure the blow and follow up Greece's behavior in the aspect of length of time of the "sanctions" that were simply introduced by the Papandreou government. We must be ready to experience a probable obstruction in Macedonia's admission to the CSCE in March, because Greece has already made such announcements, in order to see how Greece is going to resist the pressures from its partners and allies if it decides to take such an action. Anyhow, if Athens "is not clear to its European and U.S. friends" with its latest action, if its decision is evaluated as a "serious incident," it will be a clear sign that it has taken a key step backward, into the world of Balkan emotions and irrationalities which can lead to a lot of things -- to its damage, in the first place. Let us recall where Greece was and what it was two years ago compared to Macedonia, which was considered to be a Balkan country, unidentified, full of conflicts, and far away from Europe. Where is it leading to now?
