FR940602-2-00174 FR940602-2-00094 Using the above two examples, calculation of the 1990 fees for those accepting new term permits would be as follows: (A 1990 IPD&hyph;GNP adjustment factor of 1.028 is assumed.) (1) Example 1. The full 1989 fee of $520 times the IPD&hyph;GNP index factor for 1990 of 1.028 equals $535, the full fee for 1990. The increase in the fee is $15. The amount of the 1989 fee increase to be phased-in in 1990 is $54 ($520^$412 = $108/2 = $54). Thus, the 1990 fee to be charged is the base 1982 fee of $412 + $54 + $15 = $484. (2) Example 2. The full 1990 fee equals $477, a fee increase of $13. The amount of the 1989 fee increase to be phased-in in 1990 is $75 ($464^$315 = $149/2 = $75). Thus, the 1990 fee to be charged is the base 1980 fee of $315 + $75 + $13 = $403. 33.11_Fee Credits. In billing holders for fees, reduce the fee by the amount of any unused or remaining credits due holders under provisions of the Appropriations Acts for fiscal years 1983 through 1986. 33.2_Fees on Nonrenewal. When permits are placed on tenure (that is, a new special use permit will not be issued following expiration), the annual fee for the tenth year prior to the expiration date of the current permit becomes the base fee. The fee for each year during the last ten years is one-tenth of the base fee multiplied by the number of years then remaining on the permit. For example, charge a holder with nine years remaining 90 percent of the base fee; with eight years, 80 percent; and so forth. Use the following schedule to calculate the holder's fee during the 10-year period: ␣ 1Years remaining on current permit 1Percent of base fee to charge 10 100 ␣9 90 ␣8 80 ␣7 70 ␣6 60 ␣5 50 ␣4 40 ␣3 30 ␣2 20 ␣1 10 When a review of the decision to convert the lot to an alternative public use shows that changed conditions warrant continuation of the recreation residence, use the following fee determination procedures: 1. If a new 20-year term permit is issued, the Forest Service shall recover the amount of fees foregone while the previous permit was under notice that the lot would be converted to an alternative public use. Collect this amount evenly over a 10-year period in addition to the annual fee due under the new permit. The obligation runs with the lot and shall be charged to a subsequent purchaser. The annual fee under the newly issued 20-year permit shall be the annual index adjusted fee computed as though no limit on tenure existed, plus the amount specified above until paid in full.
