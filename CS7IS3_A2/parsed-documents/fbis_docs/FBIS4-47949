FBIS4-47949 "drafr088_c_94022" FBIS-AFR-94-088 Daily Report 5 May 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Further on Police Arrests Further on Police Arrests MB0605061894 Johannesburg SAPA in English 2142 GMT 5 May 94 MB0605061894 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [Text] Pretoria May 5 SAPA -- A former commanding officer of the police's Vlakplaas Training Unit, Lieutenant-Colonel Eugene de Kock, and two other people have been arrested, SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] radio news reports. This follows the Goldstone Commission's investigation into third force activities allegedly involving the police. The three will appear in court shortly. Further arrests were expected overnight on Thursday [5 May], according to security sources. The arrests were effected by an international investigation team headed by Transvaal Attorney General Jan d'Oliveira. Lt-Col de Kock was arrested at the International Police Association pub in Pretoria on Wednesday night. Dr d'Oliveira said on Thursday night he would have a complete report on Friday morning. He said he had left teams to effect more arrests during the night at their discretion. They were operating according to a certain programme, and he would be told of any crisis during the course of the night. Mr Justice Richard Goldstone said on Thursday night it would be inappropriate for him to comment. Official police spokesmen said they had been kept in the dark about the operation, and did not know who the arresting officers were or where detainees were being kept. The Goldstone report, released by outgoing State President F W de Klerk, recorded allegations of police officers having been involved in secret projects to run guns to the Inkatha Freedom Party. Three police generals, including Deputy Commissioner Lt-Gen Basie Smit, were put on compulsory leave after the Goldstone report was made public but were later reinstated. Gen Smit and Lt-Gen Krappies Engelbrecht this week announced their retirement.
