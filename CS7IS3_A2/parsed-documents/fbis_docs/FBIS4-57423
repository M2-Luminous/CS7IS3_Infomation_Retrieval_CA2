In a radio and television message broadcast to the nation on 18 May on the occasion of Flag Day and of the University of Haiti [as received], Jonassaint said the "union of the (Haitian) people is as necessary now as it was during the conquest for independence." He also urged Haitians, at a time when "consciences are being manipulated, to receive the legacy of our ancestors" and "hoist the flag before the people" and "protect its honor." Prime Minister Robert Malval, who was forced to resign (and is recognized by the international community), asked students earlier at the same celebration not to allow "force to be more important than the law." Malval, in the presence of the diplomatic corps that went to his house to offer support, reiterated (?his rejection of) Jonassaint's "illegal" regime.
