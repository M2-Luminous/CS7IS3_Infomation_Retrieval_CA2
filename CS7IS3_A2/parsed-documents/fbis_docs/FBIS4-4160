In a letter to President Clinton this morning, the California business and farm leaders said that California exports more than 1.7 billion U.S. dollars to China [as received], which support about 35,000 California jobs. With California's economic outlook still grim, "We are deeply concerned that revocation of MFN tariff treatment would have a disastrous effect on the economy of our state and jeopardize thousands of high-wage, high-skill jobs, which are vital to economic recovery in California." The letter said, "We agree with you that America's prosperity in the next century rests on expanding our trade and economic ties with the Pacific Rim. Accordingly, our companies strongly supported your path-breaking initiative to refocus U.S. foreign policy on this dynamic and expanding region of the world." They expressed the fear that revocation of MFN or other trade sanctions against China would trigger retaliation by the Chinese Government, damaging U.S. exports and investment, and endangering hundreds of thousands of U.S. jobs. The letter was signed by representatives of over 440 business organizations ranging from high-tech manufacturing and light industry to agriculture, financial and entertainment services, and toy, footwear and apparel retailing and importing. While these companies are engaged in different sectors of the U.S. economy, "they are united in their conviction that continued U.S. trade with China is vital for America's future and that revoking or conditioning MFN trade would have a disastrous act on American jobs, economic growth, and national security," the Washington-based Business Coalition for U.S.-China Trade noted in a press release on the letter.
