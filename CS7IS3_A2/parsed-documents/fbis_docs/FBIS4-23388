FBIS4-23388 "drafr108_e_94004" FBIS-AFR-94-108 Daily Report 3 Jun 1994 WEST AFRICA Liberia Conflict Spills Into Guinea; Lofa Force Involved Conflict Spills Into Guinea; Lofa Force Involved AB0306193594 London BBC World Service in English 1705 GMT 3 Jun 94 AB0306193594 London BBC World Service English BFN [Text] Once again, the conflict in Liberia seems to be spilling across the border into neighboring Guinea. Some months ago there were clashes on the Guinea side of the border involving rival factions and ethnic groups fighting each other in Liberia. There has been a fresh attack and a lot of civilians have died. From Conakry, Foday Fofana telexed this report: Intelligence sources here said that the Lofa Defense Force, LDF, which is fighting ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia] in Liberia's Upper Lofa County, has launched an attack on the Guinean border town of Koyama, near Zozo District. At least 30 civilians are thought to have died in the attack. According to reports reaching Conakry today from the town of Macenta, LDF rebels crossed into Guinea on Wednesday [1 June] night and used automatic weapons in their attack. Details of this assault are so far scanty and a team of investigators from the Interior Ministry is expected to travel to the area. If this week's attack is proved to be the work of the LDF, the movement will lose a lot of sympathy in Guinea, despite the support it currently enjoys here from members of the Toma tribe. Guinea closed all land borders with Liberia last year following what was thought to be a ULIMO crossborder attack, which resulted in the death of many Guinean civilians. Last year's incursion sparked off vengeance attacks between the (Koniyakis) who side with ULIMO and the Tomas who join forces with the LDF.
