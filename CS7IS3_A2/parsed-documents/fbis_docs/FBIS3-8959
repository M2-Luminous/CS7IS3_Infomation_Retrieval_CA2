He held talks with leaders of the Democratic Community of Vojvodina Hungarians, then travelled to Mol, the headquarters of the Vox Humana aid organization. Jeszenszky is visiting Vojvodina to mark March 15, and will attend the ceremonies honouring the anniversary. He will also hold talks with Radoslav Bulajic, the first deputy of the federal foreign minister. In a brief statement to MTI's correspondent, Jeszenszky said March 15 is particularly important for the Hungarians in Vojvodina. In 1848, there was fighting in Vojvodina during the Hungarian freedom fight (the area was part of Hungary at the time), and national conflicts, but the possibility of the solution was also outlined at that time. This should be sought today, too, from history, but much more so from the present. In answer to a question on the autonomy possibility of Vojvodina Hungarians, Jeszenszky said that in the course of his meeting with the leader of the Democratic Community of Vojvodina Hungarians, he inquired about any developments in this matter since his visit to Belgrade. Jeszenszky then travelled on to Subotica, where a ceremony will be held on Saturday evening to mark March 15.
