While addressing the National People's Congress (NPC) yesterday, Finance Minister Liu Zhongli said the State Council had earmarked 52.04 billion yuan (HK$46.2 billion) for national defence for 1994. The percentage increase this year was the highest since 1979, when patriarch Deng Xiaoping launched his economic reforms, one of whose tenets was to curtail military spending and devote more resources to the economy. China's military outlay takes up 9.59 per cent of its total governmental expenditure, as compared with 23 per cent for Taiwan, 24.3 per cent for South Korea and 17.6 per cent for the United States. A total of 43.25 billion yuan was spent on the People's Liberation Army (PLA) last year, slightly more than the original target. About 42.5 billion yuan had been set aside for national defence in last year's budget, which represented an increase of 14.8 per cent over the 1992 figure. [passage omitted] "The PLA is pumping funds and resources into developing nuclear-powered submarines as well as medium-range missiles that could be launched by them," a military source said. The source added that priority was set after the top brass decided late last year to scrap the plan for building aircraft carriers. "China's five existing nuclear submarines are old Soviet models that are terribly antiquated," the source said. "The PLA is testing a submarine-launched missile that has a range of around 400 kilometres." Western military analysts said the PLA's Second Artillery Unit was aggressively developing medium to long-range ballistic missiles, including the Dong Fang 25 and the Dong Fang 31 models, which had ranges of respectively 1,700 km and 8,000 km. At the same time, emphasis is being put on churning out a new generation of solid-fuel Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles. The analysts said the PLA had to spend more money developing its own weapons systems partly due to the stalemate in efforts to procure Russian military technology. They added discussions on buying another batch of SU27 jet fighters from Moscow -- as well as a co-production agreement to turn out MiG aircraft on Chinese soil -- had bogged down because of Russian reluctance to part with top-of-the-line know-how. However, with the revival of military co-operation with Europe and even the United States, the top brass is again hopeful of acquiring sophisticated hardware from the Western world. "In view of the recent 30 odd per cent devaluation of the yuan, the 52.04 billion yuan budget is not much to play around with," a Beijing diplomat said.
