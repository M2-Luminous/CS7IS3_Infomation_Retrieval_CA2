"There is something that Japan can and should do (on objective criteria)," Kobayashi told a luncheon sponsored by the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan. Kobayashi said objective criteria are concepts that Tokyo and Washington previously agreed to work on in their efforts to establish a new bilateral trade framework. It is not "a difficult task" to evaluate American access to Japanese markets by using certain criteria that describe a "so- called desired state" in certain trade sectors, said Kobayashi, who is also chairman of Fuji Xerox Co. Such criteria, first spelled out in a joint statement issued after the July 1993 summit between then Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton, differ from "numerical targets," which Tokyo has opposed as managed trade, Kobayashi said. "I am sure both governments can agree to the use of `desired state.' It does not have to be stated in specific numbers or market share figures, but it can be stated in mutually agreed terms like visibly reducing the current account surplus," Kobayashi said. If sales of certain U.S. products in Japan stay flat in the future despite Tokyo's purchasing pledge, discussions to improve the situation can then be held, he said. The statement from the Miyazawa-Clinton summit indicated the two countries will "assess the implementation of measures and policies taken in each sectoral and structural area... [ellipses as received] based upon sets of objective criteria, either qualitative or quantitative or both as appropriate." Kobayashi said the perception that the U.S. demands numerical targets is wrong. Clinton "clearly and unequivocally" stated Washington does not want such targets, in a joint news conference after meeting with then Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in February, Kobayashi said.
