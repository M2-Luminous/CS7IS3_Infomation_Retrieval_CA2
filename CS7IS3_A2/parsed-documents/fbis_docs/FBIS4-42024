The elections of a president of Ukraine had begun. This is the third election campaign on the peninsula since the start of the present year. And if it is considered that in the first two the elections were held in two stages, 26 June was the fifth time that Crimeans had gone to the polls. The campaign for the election of the president of Ukraine crept up somehow imperceptibly, without the usual ballyhoo and scope. Only in the final week before the elections did all seven Ukrainian presidential candidates take part in a televised debate, speak on radio, and tour the regions, the Republic of Crimea included. The candidates for the position of head of state endeavored to win votes by personal contact with the electorate and presentation of their programs. And this was not an easy choice for the latter. Which of the seven to choose? After all, what our lives will be like in the future will depend on who is elected. We cannot, therefore, make a mistake and approach the polls indifferently, as just another campaign of which we are sick and tired. This is a critical and decisive choice, particularly for Crimea, with its difficult relations with Ukraine. The fears that the summer vacations and the height of the summer season would influence the activity of the election were unfounded. Those who had left Crimea were able to perform their civic duty as of 11 June. Students who had passed their examinations and lecturers who had gone on leave availed themselves of this right at Polling Station 1/253 of the republic center's Zheleznodorozhnyy Rayon, which is located at the Medical Institute. Polling Station 1/350 of Tsentralnyy Rayon was crowded from the first hour that it was open. Fifty percent of those on the electoral roll had voted here by 1400 hours. According to preliminary information, 52 percent of the electorate had participated in the elections in the republic as of 1600 hours. The greatest activity was displayed by the electorate of Nizhnegorskiy (57.2 percent), Razdolnenskiy (63.3), Krasnoperekopskiy (57.2), Belogorskiy (55.9), and Krasnogvardeyskiy (53.2) Rayons and Sudak (54.6), Kerch (53.6), and Bakhchisaray (58.8 percent). According to the data of the district election commission of Crimean Election District No 1, some 1,003,785 persons participated in the ballot for the election of the president of Ukraine, and 999,376 persons actually voted, which constituted 62.7 percent. The vote was distributed as follows: Valeriy Georgiyevich Babich--19,272 "for," 971,718 "against" (1.9 percent); Leonid Makarovych Kravchuk--74,243 "for," 916,747 "against" (7.4 percent); Leonid Danilovych Kuchma--825,250 "for," 165,740 "against" (82.6 percent); Volodymyr Timofeyevych Lanovyy--33,623 "for," 957,367 "against" (3.4 percent); Oleksandr Oleksandrovych Moroz--12,640 "for," 978,367 "against" (1.3 percent); Ivan Stepanovych Plyushch--2,975 "for," 988,015 "against" (0.3 percent); Petro Mykhaylovych Talanchuk--2,224 "for," 988,766 "against" (0.2 percent). Repeat elections were held on 26 June in four election districts in which deputies of the parliament of Crimea had not been elected on 27 March: Chapayevskiy No. 6 of Yevpatoriya, Livadiyskiy No. 29 of Yalta, and Sevastopolskiy No. 63 and No. 64. According to data of the Central Election Commission for Elections of the Supreme Council of Crimea, the elections were valid, but a runoff for the election of the deputies were scheduled for all the districts for 10 July.
