Meanwhile, defense industries should contribute more to the national economic development by serving economic construction, which is today's central task. Liu Huaqing said: Revolutionaries of the older generation care very much about national defense. Not only have they written a lot of incisive works on defense, but have also personally directed and organized many major research projects. Defense industries have made new headway in recent years as a result of the leadership of the party central committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission. From now on we must work even harder and continue to press forward to live up to the expectations of the revolutionaries of the older generation. Liu Huaqing noted: Having been tempered and nurtured for decades, Chinese scientists, technicians, and administrators working for defense industries have become quite proficient. Considering hard work and selfless dedication an honor, they have contributed significantly to China's defense through giving full scope to their talents and capabilities. Because we have such invaluable people, the modernization of China's national defense is highly promising. Liu Huaqing said: Defense industries must closely follow the world's rapid development of high technology. The development of our own advanced technology should be organically combined with purchases of advanced technology from abroad, and we must make constant efforts to improve these technologies so that they can serve our strategic policy, namely "active defense." Under the premise of ensuring our technology's systematicness [xi tong xing 4762 4827 1840], integrity, and reliability, we must from now on set higher standards for our development and make constant efforts to attain new goals. Meanwhile, we must set strict requirements for management, underscore quality, and work meticulously. By no means should we do our work formalistically. Liu Huaqing stressed: China now gives top priority [shou wei 7445 0143] to economic construction, which is the center of everything. Defense industries should also obey and serve the needs of economic construction, and give local industries and economies the support they need for development. During his inspection tour in Hubei, Liu Huaqing also visited the Wuchang Shipyard to understand its production and to see the cadres and workers there. He also inspected the Wuhan Changfei Optical Fiber Cable Company and the Tonghu High-Technology Development Zone. In Yichang, he also inspected the Three Gorges Project and the Gezhouba Power Plant, and heard briefings of the dam's construction and the plant's management. Accompanying Liu Huaqing during the inspection were Hubei Governor Jia Zhijie and leaders of relevant departments.
