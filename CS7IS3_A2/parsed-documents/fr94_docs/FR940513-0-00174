FR940513-0-00174 FR940513-0-00034 All revisions to such data (both additions to and deletions from the preceding data) shall be submitted to the Commission as part of the next annual report period. Serial number reports for new covered products are due sixty days after the annual effective mandatory labeling date for each product. * * * * * 8. Section 305.11 is amended by revising the heading of paragraph (a), by revising paragraph (e), and by adding paragraph (f) to read as follows: §305.11 Labeling for covered products. (a) Labels for covered products other than fluorescent lamp ballasts, fluorescent lamps, medium base compact fluorescent lamps, incandescent lamps (including incandescent reflector lamps), showerheads, faucets, water closets and urinals_. *␣*␣* * * * * * (e) Lamps. (1) (i) Any covered product that is a compact fluorescent lamp or general service incandescent lamp (including an incandescent reflector lamp), shall be labeled clearly and conspicuously on the product's principal display panel with the following information: (A) The number of lamps included in the package, if more than one; (B) The design voltage of each lamp included in the package, if other than 120 volts; (C) The light output of each lamp included in the package, expressed in average initial lumens; (D) The electrical power consumed (energy used) by each lamp included in the package, expressed in average initial wattage; (E) The life of each lamp included in the package, expressed in hours. (ii) The light output, energy usage and life ratings of any covered product that is a medium base compact fluorescent lamp or general service incandescent lamp (including an incandescent reflector lamp), shall appear in that order and with equal clarity and conspicuousness on the product's principal display panel. The light output, energy usage and life ratings shall be disclosed in terms of ``lumens,'' ``watts'' and ``hours'' respectively, with the lumens, watts and hours rating numbers each appearing in the same type style and size and with the words ``lumens,'' ``watts'' and ``hours'' each appearing in the same type style and size. The words ``light output,'' ``energy used'' and ``life'' shall precede and have the same conspicuousness as both the rating numbers and the words ``lumens,'' ``watts'' and ``hours,'' except that the letters of the words ``lumens,'' ``watts'' and ``hours'' shall be approximately 50% of the sizes of those used for the words ``light output,'' ``energy used'' and ``life'' respectively. (iii) The light output, energy usage and life ratings of any covered product that is a medium base compact fluorescent lamp or general service incandescent lamp (including an incandescent reflector lamp), shall be measured at 120 volts, regardless of the lamp's design voltage. If a lamp's design voltage is other than 120 volts, the disclosures of the wattage, light output and life ratings shall in each instance be followed by the phrase ``at 120 volts.'' Labels for lamps with design voltages other than 120 volts also may disclose the lamps' wattage, light output and life at the designed voltage ( e.g. , ``Light Output 1710 Lumens at 125 volts''). (iv) For any covered product that is an incandescent reflector lamp, the required disclosure of light output shall be given for the lamp's beam spread and be followed clearly and conspicuously by the phrase ``at beam spread.'' (v) For any covered product that is a compact fluorescent lamp, the required light output disclosure shall be measured at a base-up position; but, if the manufacturer or private labeler has reason to believe that the light output at a base-down position would be more than 5% different, the label also shall disclose the light output at the base-down position or, if no test data for the base-down position exist, the fact that at a base-down position the light output might be more than 5% less. (vi) For any covered product that is a compact fluorescent lamp or a general service incandescent lamp (including an incandescent reflector lamp), there shall be clearly and conspicuously disclosed on the principal display panel the following statement: To save energy costs, find the bulbs with the light output you need, then choose the one with the lowest watts. (vii) For any covered product that is a general service incandescent lamp and operates with multiple filaments, the principal display panel shall disclose clearly and conspicuously, in the manner required by paragraph (e)(1) (i)&hyph;(iii) and (vi) of this section of the Rule, the lamp's wattage and light output at each of the lamp's levels of light output and the lamp's life measured on the basis of the filament that fails first. (2) Any covered product that is a general service fluorescent lamp or an incandescent reflector lamp shall be labeled clearly and conspicuously with a capital letter ``E'' printed within a circle and followed by an asterisk. The label shall also clearly and conspicuously disclose, either in close proximity to that asterisk or elsewhere on the label, the following statement: *[The encircled ``E''] means this bulb meets Federal minimum efficiency standards.
