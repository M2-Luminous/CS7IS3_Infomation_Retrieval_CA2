Ter-Krikorov, Moscow Physical Technical Institute; UDC 532.593:551.466.4] [Abstract] Disturbances introduced into a multilayer flow of an ideal incompressible heavy fluid by a point source are examined. The fluid has a finite number of layers and an arbitrary velocity and density distribution in each layer, but in the case of a fluid of finite depth it is assumed that the lower infinitely deep layer has a constant velocity and density. The field of disturbances is represented in the form of a double integral of the Green's function of the auxiliary spectral problem for an ordinary differential equation dependent on two complex parameters. In the case of a fluid of finite depth the properties of the discrete spectrum of this problem make it possible to represent wave and nonwave disturbances in the form of a series of single integrals. In the case of a fluid of infinite depth the properties of the discrete and continuous spectra of the auxiliary spectral problem make it possible, by virtue of the smallness of the stratification parameter, to represent the field of disturbances in the form of wave disturbances having the form of an infinite sum of the single integrals and nonwave disturbances in the form of a double integral. The special case of two layers of a constant density with an infinitely deep lower layer is investigated. References 18: 17 Russian, 1 Western.
