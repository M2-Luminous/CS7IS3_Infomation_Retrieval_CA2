FR940124-1-00094 FR940124-1-00009 In ยง667.21(b)(5) the Secretary proposes to require a State to determine the extent to which it is appropriate to base a State review standard on a related Title IV, HEA program standard or requirement or to establish as the State's review standard the comparable Title IV, HEA standard or requirement. The Secretary believes it is imperative that States take into consideration the standards and requirements institutions must satisfy to participate in the Title IV, HEA programs before increasing the burden on those institutions by adopting entirely new standards for this part. In this regard, the Secretary expects States to avoid establishing standards that are weaker than similar Title IV, HEA program standards that an institution must otherwise satisfy to participate in those programs. In addition, when the Secretary publishes regulations implementing the Student-Right-to-Know provisions in section 485(a) of the HEA, the Secretary expects States to adopt the methodology contained in those regulations for calculating student completion and graduation rates. For the convenience of the reader, the following Title IV, HEA program standards and requirements are related or comparable to the State review standards described in ยง667.21_ (1) With respect to the State review standards in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2), the consumer information requirements in 34 CFR part 668, subpart D, 34 CFR 668.14, and 34 CFR 668.15; and the standards and rules in 34 CFR part 668, subpart F, under which the Secretary initiates an adverse action against an institution for any substantial misrepresentation made by that institution regarding its educational program, financial charges, or employability of its graduates; (2) With respect to the State review standards in paragraphs (a)(3) and (a)(4), the State process and testing requirements regarding students who do not have a high school diploma or its recognized equivalent in section 484(d) of the HEA; (3) With respect to the State review standards in paragraphs (a)(5) and (a)(6), the standards of satisfactory progress in 34 CFR 668.14; and the record retention and audit requirements in 34 CFR 668.23; (4) With respect to the State review standard in paragraph (a)(8), the standards and requirements in 34 CFR 668.13, 34 CFR 668.14, and subpart 3 of part H of the HEA regarding an institution's financial and administrative capability; (5) With respect to the State review standard in paragraph (a)(10), the standards and requirements in 34 CFR 668.14 regarding an institution's administrative capability, and 34 CFR part 600, subpart A, regarding an educational program offered by an institution that prepares students for gainful employment in recognized occupations; or an educational program that is designed to provide occupational skills to students for useful employment in recognized occupations; (6) With respect to the State review standards in paragraphs (a)(11) and (a)(16), the provisions in section 487(a)(8) of the HEA that require an institution that advertises job placement rates as a means of attracting students to provide to those students information concerning employment statistics, graduation statistics, other information necessary to substantiate the truthfulness of the advertisement, and any State licensing requirements for a job for which the institution's educational program prepares such students; and the provisions in section 487(a)(20) of the HEA prohibiting an institution from paying a commission, bonus, or other incentive based on securing enrollments to any person engaged in student recruiting or admission activities; (7) With respect to the State review standard in paragraphs (a)(12) and (a)(13), the formula in 34 CFR 668.8 and 34 CFR 668.9 that an institution that offers an educational program in credit hours must use to determine if that program satisfies the requirements of an eligible program;
