FR941006-1-00083 FR941006-1-00015 These provisions are not meant to require repayment of income that qualifies as exempt function income under section 527(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. 527(c)(3), such as receipts from fundraising activities. The Commission welcomes comments on these proposed revisions. Miscellaneous and Technical Amendments In the interests of clarity, the Commission is proposing to add a comma in the last sentence of 11 CFR 9003.1(b)(4), and in the second sentence of 11 CFR 9033.1(b)(5). Both paragraphs concern candidate and committee agreements to furnish certain documentation to the Commission. Current 11 CFR 9033.4(b) states that, in evaluating a candidate's matching funds submission, the Commission may consider other relevant information in its possession, including but not limited to past actions of the candidate in an earlier campaign. This provision was held to exceed the Commission's statutory authority in LaRouche v. FEC, 996 F.2d 1263 (D.C. Cir. 1993), cert. denied 114 S. Ct. 550. The Commission is therefore proposing to delete this paragraph from the rule. Conclusion The Commission welcomes comments on the foregoing proposed amendments to the public financing regulations, the issues raised in this notice, and on other aspects of the public financing process that could be addressed in these regulations. No final decision has been made by the Commission concerning any of the proposals contained in this Notice. Certification of No Effect Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. Section 605(b) (Regulatory Flexibility Act) The attached proposed rules, if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The basis for this certification is that few, if any, small entities will be affected by these proposed rules. Further, any small entities affected are already required to comply with the requirements of the Presidential Election Campaign Fund Act and the Presidential Primary Matching Payment Account Act in these areas.
