"What do you really want?" Reaction to Political Pressure President Iwao Matsumoto of Matsumoto Avante (head office in Toshima Ward, Tokyo), a major primary wholesaler of flat glass, could not help raising his voice when talking to the Japanese representative of the U.S. glassmaker, Guardian Industries. According to Matsumoto, the Guardian representative, in an effort to enter into new deals with Matsumoto Avante, started with a long lecture on the closed nature of the Japanese market. Arguments and counterarguments were exchanged with Matsumoto, and in the end, "we did not even talk business." Matsumoto Avante does not reject transactions with foreign manufacturers. Two years ago it started importing products from major U.S. company PPG through PPG-CI (head office in Minato Ward, Tokyo), a glass marketing joint venture between PPG and Itochu Corporation. However, Matsumoto is very critical of the Guardian method of taking advantage of political pressure. Guardian Industries, whose vice president Ralph Gerson clamored for "the opening of the closed Japanese market," is quite notorious among glass dealers. However, surprisingly few wholesalers have actually had any contact with Guardian until recently. The president of a leading dealer said: "We have known about that company for years, but it was only last January that a salesman actually came." The share of foreign makers in the Japanese flat-glass market is 4 percent. The U.S. Government has consistently charged that Asahi Glass Company, Ltd., Nippon Flat Glass Company Ltd., and Central Glass Company Ltd. have organized the nearly 400 glass wholesalers throughout Japan into their respective "keiretsu," and that this forms the greatest barrier to foreign participation. However, Yu Maeyoshi, president of PPG-CI, who operates in the marketing front line, claims: "There are practically no physical barriers. Psychological barriers may exist, the result of many years of business ties." The delivery systems of foreign companies are also inadequate. A glass dealer said: "Japanese makers take no more than two days to deliver, but foreign products take as long as 40 days." In Japan, where small lot deliveries are the norm, the smallest lot dealers are able to order is one ton; but some foreign companies still insist on a minimum delivery of two tons. As a matter of fact, it is true that tangible and intangible "pressure" restraining the business transactions of glass wholesalers did exist, as Asahi Glass managing director Yasuhiko Furukawa admits. He said: "About four years ago, a situation like the one the United States complains of did exist." Limits of the Cozy, Symbiotic Relationship We obtained a copy of a document distributed to members of the National Federation of Flat-Glass Engineering Companies in March 1987. The federation is a group of glass engineering contractors that buy glass from wholesalers and to use in subcontract work for general contractors. The title of the document is: "How To Deal With Requests From Clients To Use Imported Materials." This is a "manual" on "excluding foreign products" which cites 11 reasons for refusing to use foreign glass products -- such as: 1) there is little variety in imported products, and it is difficult to complete an entire engineering project using imported products only; and 2) using imported materials simultaneously with Japanese products may undermine the relationship with Japanese makers. Five years later, the federation distributed another notice negating the contents of the "manual." Meanwhile, Asahi Glass and other domestic makers have brought their manuals into line with the Antimonopoly Law. Decision To Use Foreign Glass Not Implemented in the Field The truth is, the Japanese system was not the object of U.S. criticism alone; Japanese makers themselves were also beginning to feel the limits of the traditional marketing method of relying on longstanding symbiotic relationships and presiding over a network of exclusive distributors. In the past, the accepted procedure had been to decide prices not when orders were placed, but after the general contractors had used the products in the maker-wholesaler-engineering firm-general contractor sequence of material flow. According to Asahi Glass, there were cases where a request for substantial discount would be made after the merchandise was delivered, resulting in "many instances of deficits." They decided last year, therefore, to fix prices at the time the merchandise is delivered to the customer. This is, of course, the norm in Western countries. The makers have also lost the ability to spare manpower or money for the sake of maintaining a stable relationship with the wholesalers. The glass divisions of the big three Japanese makers are all suffering from a deficit. Rumors -- such as, "Company X is able to take care of only four of its 30 exclusive distributors in Tokyo" -- are rife among glass dealers. Dealers who are outside the "keiretsu" organization are now seeking to build a relationship with foreign companies. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry recently published the results of its survey of more than 380 wholesalers. Compared to a similar survey conducted a year before, 11 percent of dealers are now handling foreign glass products, which is twice the percentage in the previous poll. Mitsubishi Corporation, which started doing business in foreign glass products last year in cooperation with major glass engineering and processing firm Yamada Shoten (head office in Minato Ward, Tokyo; president, Ryuichi Yamada), often receives telephone inquiries from wholesalers feeling insecure [about the existing marketing system] saying: "We would also like to deal in foreign glass products." However, it would be premature to predict a rapid increase in foreign participation in proportion to ongoing changes. Even if the "keiretsu" formed by glass makers and wholesalers disintegrate, the solid relationship between general contractors and engineering firms remains intact. In one case, Mitsubishi succeeded in obtaining the client's agreement to buy imported flat glass. However, the decision was overturned at the last minute. Apparently, the head of the general contractor's local office had to heed a request from the subcontracting engineering firm, with which he had a longstanding, friendly relationship. While the head offices of all the general contractors are saying, "we would very much like to use foreign products," this does not seem to apply in the field. Even if all the barriers between the makers and wholesalers are removed, other barriers to foreign participation still exist. The debate between Guardian and Iwao Matsumoto may continue for some time.
