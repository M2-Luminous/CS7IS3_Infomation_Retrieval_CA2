"Hitler was an angel compared with these guys," a woman escorting the evacuees, Ziba Hadzic, 62, said of the Serb forces who had bombarded her home town in eastern Bosnia since late March. "He didn't go around setting hospitals and schools on fire." The Kosevo hospital has set aside 500 beds, with 60 beds also available in the French City Hospital, Kosevo director Faruk Konjhodzic said. Four flights by UN helicopters delivered 91 more refugees from Gorazde on Monday. They were flown to a sports stadium which is being used as a landing strip. Most of the wounded were missing limbs. One woman had lost the whole of the lower half of her body. Of 85 evacuees who arrived on Sunday, 36 had already been operated on. Most were very badly wounded or exhausted through loss of blood, and others were in shock. Some of the evacuees, having taken shelter in cellars, "have not seen daylight for a fortnight or more," Konjhodzic said. All but five or six of the cases involved in operations were amputees. The great majority had shrapnel wounds. Sixteen operating rooms were mobilised to deal with the influx, the hospital director said. Genevieve Begkoyan, a doctor with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, said that many of the wounded in Gorazde had simply died through lack of medical care. She said it had become more difficult to collect and prepare evacuees for the flight because many of them had been taken back to their homes, scattered around the town. UN sources said that a breakdown of the figures of killed and wounded by gender and age indicated that local Bosnian authorities had given priority to men of fighting age for treatment in Gorazde hospital. A UNHCR doctor who stayed in the town, Mary McLoughlin, said there had "never been more that five percent of women and three percent of children" in the hospital.
