Vohra was currently in Nepal canvassing for cooperation to strengthen border vigilance. India's concern over the happenings in the neighbouring countries stems from reports that these are being used as conduits for pushing in arms and ammunition into the border areas. In the case of Bangladesh, there is an additional problem of illegal immigration causing population explosion in the border districts of Bihar and West Bengal and social tensions in other areas, including Delhi. The protest to Bangladesh was made by Prakash Singh, Director-General of Border Security Force (BSF), at the Indo-Bangladesh coordination meeting which concluded here on Wednesday. The Bangladesh delegation was led by Mohammad Anwar Hossain, Director-General, Bangladesh Rifles. Prakash Singh raised the issue of illegation [as published] immigration from Bangladesh and insisted on the implementation of the September 1991 agreement between the two countries. He conveyed the Government's strong feelings on the subject of assistance to insurgent groups from the North-East in Bangladesh. Reliable sources said the Bangladesh delegation contested the BSF chief's arguments. It reportedly argued that India had pushed many people into Bangladesh merely on the suspicion of their being illegal immigrants. As a consequence, the meeting did not yield any clue to solving the burning problem of illegal immigration. However, there was agreement on two issues: one, that the undemarcated 50 kms of Indo-Bangladesh border be demarcated at the earliest, and the other that the work of repair and maintenance of boundary pillars along the international border should be taken over by the security forces of the two countries. It was decided that the two security forces would be requesting their respective governments to issue directions to surveyors-general to complete the demarcation of the boundary. In this context, the dispute in the Mahurichar area was also discussed. India's argument was that on the basis of Indo-Bangladesh agreement of 1974 the boundary in this area was along the course of Mahuri river. On the other hand, Bangladesh insisted that the cultivation on the Indian side should be stopped. India did not favour this proposal saying that the 1974 agreement related to alignment of the border and not utilisation of land on either side. Given this background it was obviously only as a matter of courtesy that the two sides agreed that the security forces of both sides should exercise utmost restraint and that they should coordinate their efforts to curb smuggling and other criminal activities along the border. The Vohra-led delegation is visiting Nepal after a thorough on-the-spot study of the situation in the border districts of Bahraich and Maharajgan in UP [Uttar Pradesh]. Vohra had convened a meeting of top officials of these two districts as well as those of Siddharath Nagar, Pilibhit and Gonda districts. He personally visited several checkposts in the border areas along with heads of intelligence agencies. The Government has been concerned about the influx of Punjab extremists in UP.
