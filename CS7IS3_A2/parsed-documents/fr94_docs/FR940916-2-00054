FR940916-2-00054 FR940916-2-00047 [FRL&hyph;5073&hyph;2] Workshop on the Use of Available Data and Methods for Assessing the Ecological Risks of 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-Dioxin to Aquatic Life and Associated Wildlife AGENCY: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice of availability. SUMMARY: This notice announces the availability of a report entitled ``Workshop on the Use of Available Data and Methods for Assessing the Ecological Risks of 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-Dioxin to Aquatic Life and Associated Wildlife''. This report compiles discussions and recommendations from a 1993 workshop sponsored by EPA's Risk Assessment Forum. While the report addresses scientific issues related to ecological risk assessment, considerations of EPA policy on TCDD, revisions to EPA's ecological risk framework, formulating a complete TCDD risk assessment, and issues related to the health effects of TCDD were beyond the scope of the workshop and are not addressed. ADDRESSES: To obtain a single copy of the report, interested parties should contact the ORD Publications Office, CERI, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 26 West Martin Luther King Drive, Cincinnati, OH 45268, Tel: (513) 569&hyph;7562, FAX: (513) 569&hyph;7566. Please provide your name and mailing address, and request the document by the title and EPA number (EPA/630/R&hyph;94/002). FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Bill van der Schalie, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (8101), 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460, Telephone (202) 260&hyph;6743. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In March, 1993, EPA released the Interim Report on Data and Methods for the Assessment of 2,3,7,8-Tetra chloro dibenzo-p-Dioxin (TCDD) Risks to Aquatic Life and Associated Wildlife (Interim Report; EPA 600/R&hyph;93/055). This report compiled and critically reviewed current scientific literature concerning toxicity and exposure data for TCDD-related effects on aquatic and wildlife species. On September 15 and 16, 1993, EPA's Risk Assessment Forum sponsored a workshop to discuss use of data and methods in the Interim Report for ecological risk assessments. Workshop participants used both the Interim Report and the EPA report Framework for Ecological Risk Assessment (EPA/630/R&hyph;92/001) as starting materials. Workshop participants identified significant issues, discussed major uncertainties and recommended research needs for future assessments. In addition, workshop participants developed a ``conceptual model'' for a hypothetical scenario concerning TCDD effects on aquatic life and wildlife. This model, which includes comments and suggestions on the transport, fate, and effects of TCDD and related compounds, should be helpful to risk assessors planning to evaluate the ecological risks of TCDD. While the report addresses scientific issues related to ecological risk assessment, considerations of EPA policy on TCDD, revisions to EPA's ecological risk framework, formulating a complete TCDD risk assessment, and issues related to the health effects of TCDD were beyond the scope of the workshop and were not addressed. Dated: August 30, 1994. Carl Gerber, Acting Assistant Administrator for Research and Development. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;22978 Filed 9&hyph;15&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;M
