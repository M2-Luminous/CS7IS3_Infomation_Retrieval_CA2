A resolution examined by lawmakers called for the establishment of a new Ukrainian Constitutional Court that would be asked to render a judgment on the matter. The parliament of Crimea voted last month to restore a 1992 constitution that allows for a Crimean citizenship, treaty relations with Kiev and the establishment of a separate militia force. The Ukrainian parliament said the move amounted to a declaration of independence and gave the local legislature 10 days to reverse its decision. In Wednesday's resolution, the parliament recognized that Crimea had not changed its position and reiterated that it still considered the adoption of the secessionist constitution to be illegal. The debate over Crimea's drive for secession came as Ukraine prepared for key presidential elections on June 26, which President Leonid Kravchuk was expected to lose and is trying to postpone. Ukrainian and Crimean delegations met in Kiev following last month's parliamentary decision and agreed that they would not take any additional measures to exacerbate tensions. Kiev moved about 20 armored personnel carriers in the main Crimean city of Simferopol in the days following the parliamentary vote but there has been no violence in the region.
