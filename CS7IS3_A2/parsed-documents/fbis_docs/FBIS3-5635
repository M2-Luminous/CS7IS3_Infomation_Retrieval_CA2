A senior Foreign Ministry official said that "it probably is a bargaining chip to win concessions from Japan." While hard-liners say that Japan can beat the provision by filing complaints with GATT, the government is perplexed with the U.S.-led development of the trade friction issue. Unrest is prevailing in industrial circles, and Japanese-U.S. relations may become even worse after this. Government Reactions The Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] believes that "even if the United States opens an investigation according to the act, this is unlikely to result in unilateral sanctions." Under the Super 301 provision, the United States may raise tariffs on Japanese products or limit imports using a quantitative quota. However, the MITI believes that if these actions are taken without following GATT procedures, this would be regarded as a violation of GATT regulations, as well as those of the World Trade Organization (WTO), which will replace GATT in 1996. Referring to the fact that the reinstated Super 301 provision provides 180 days for negotiations before sanctions are imposed, the MITI official said: "Under the new provision, the negotiation period is extended by six times. The United States has adopted a strategy of using economic sanctions as a bargaining chip." The MITI is taking a tough stand toward this issue, saying: "When the United States takes unilateral action, that nation is most likely to impose higher tariffs on Japanese-made products. In that case, Japan can beat the sanctions by filing a complaint with GATT." The U.S. Government, however, is unlikely to actually trigger a trade war with Japan. A senior Foreign Ministry official said: "Even if GATT supports the U.S. sanctions, that would not reduce the huge U.S. trade deficit. Such actions cannot be a sovereign remedy for the bilateral trade frictions." He then demonstrated the ministry's passive attitude toward the issue, saying: "The Super 301 sanctions and Japan's complaints to GATT would just produce unnecessary conflict between Japan and the United States. I just hope that the United States will not pull the trigger." Because U.S. negotiators say that "the ball is in Japan's court" (as noted by U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor), Japan's voluntary market-opening package is becoming the focal point of the issue. While Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has ordered that the package be formulated within this month, a senior MITI official demonstrated a pessimistic view of its effectiveness, saying: "We have already offered almost everything we have. The package would not look very fresh." Some hard-liners in the government say: "It is unnecessary to prepare such a market-opening package. If Japan does so, this will acknowledge the U.S. claim that the Japanese market is exclusionary." They, however, have no alternative plans for rehabilitating Japanese-U.S. relations. Industrial Circles Industrial circles are wary of the revival of the Super 301 provision. Yutaka Kume, chairman of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association [JAMA], stated that "we are deeply concerned about the revival of this sanction-oriented provision." But, the JAMA intends to carefully watch developments in this issue for the time being, pointing out that "the type of sanctions and other details are still unknown." Auto industry circles have long been dealing with U.S. demands for expanded imports of auto parts. The Toyota Motor Corp. has prepared a plan for the voluntary expansion of purchases of U.S.-made auto parts. Therefore, major automakers are beginning to question the trade policy of the U.S. Government, noting: "Unilateral sanctions go against GATT principles. The U.S. trade deficit with Japan is a macroeconomic issue, not a microeconomic issue (related to such individual trade sectors as automobiles)." Because it is questionable if the United States really wants to impose sanctions on Japan, some quarters demonstrated calm attitudes. A management official of a major automaker said: "If the United States limits auto imports from Japan, that would harm U.S. consumers. It is questionable whether they really intend to do so." The Electronic Industries Association of Japan [EIAJ] is also exhibiting a prudent attitude toward the U.S. decision. EIAJ Managing Director Iwao Oshima said: "Sanctions under the Super 301 provision may be regarded as violations of GATT regulations. We want to watch future developments." On the other hand, a trading house official said, "Super 301 will be an effective weapon because it can apply strong pressures on trade barriers even without actual sanctions." NEC Corp. President Tadahiro Sekimoto said, "Japan should reduce its trade surplus through such macroeconomic policies as domestic market expansion and trade surplus recycling." Moreover, Takeshi Kondo, director of the Politics-Economics Research Institute under the Itochu Corp., noted: "The trade friction is caused by Japan's failure to deal appropriately with the issue. While the Japanese Government promised increased public investment and tax cuts, it gave no estimate of how these policies can contribute to reducing the trade surplus."
