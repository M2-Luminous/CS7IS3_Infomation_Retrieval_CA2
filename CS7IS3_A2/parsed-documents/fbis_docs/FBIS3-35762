"The limit of our concessions to Russia has been exhausted, but we should continue the talks. There is no other way. The two countries cannot be brought together by military methods," he said in an ITAR-TASS interview. Responding to the question about the situation of the people, who have no Latvian citizenship (they account for about one third of the population), the prime minister said: "I believe the problem is being artificially kindled. People are looking for a better place to live, and the fact that there is no massive exodus from Latvia is the best proof that no section of the population feels as economically handicapped." In his opinion, the citizenship problem will be resolved and a corresponding law will be adopted in due time. "Previously we paid no attention to citizenship. Now that the problem is being discussed continually, that rumours begin to circulate about some massive deportations which no one intends to implement, people want to have citizenship as a sort of an anchor. If the problem is settled on a legal basis, then people will feel that they have guarantees for peaceful work," the Latvian prime minister said. According to Birkavs, there are three ways to normalise the situation. "Very careful naturalisation is the first one. An absolutely free repatriation to the ethnic homeland along with the financial support of this process is the second one. And there is one more way: emigration to third countries, which, of course, will not acquire massive proportions," the prime minister said. Responding to the question about Latvia's attitude to the partnership for peace programme, the prime minister praised it and added: "The suggested mechanism of a peaceful settlement of conflicts is valuable to us, because the security problem will be an acute one for Latvia during the coming two or three years." He believes that if Latvia joined the programme earlier, it could have counted on NATO support during the recent dramatic aggravation of relations with Russia (it is worth recalling in this connection that the aggravation was the result of an arrest of two Russian generals by Latvian local authorities.) The head of the Latvian Government believes that "the time has come to analyse military systems of other countries. We were part of the Soviet system long enough and came out from it not with the best of recollections. This is why the orientation towards the NATO structures is obvious, and it will be continued," he said.
