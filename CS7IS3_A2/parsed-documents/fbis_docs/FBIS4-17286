Initially the letter was just "a memo on the nonpayment problem" to be addressed to Central Bank Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko, which was later converted into a public message to the head of government. The change in the document's political status has an exclusively political bottom line -- the president has to demonstrate to society his profound understanding of the economic situation and his concern over economic problems. It is not a coincidence that ITAR-TASS ended its report on the letter to the prime minister with a high-sounding passage: "Boris Yeltsin is taking on the entire responsibility for the second stage of reform, including the need to free the Russian economy from enterprises that have no future prospects." The quotation very appropriately points out that the mass restructuring of money-losing enterprises -- in terms of its consequences -- is on a par with the January 1992 price liberalization and subsequent efforts by various governments to stabilize the ruble. In this case, nonpayments are a very simple but reliable indicator of a grave economic depression, from which there is no other way out than to apply the procedure of bankruptcies with the subsequent restructuring of an immense number of businesses. So the president, who has fairly good experts in his staff, meticulously listed altogether correct, standard, and, hence, long well-known methods to resolve the "nonpayment problem." However, the first part of the above ITAR-TASS quotation -- unlike the second one -- is outright cunning by a most experienced political player. The president, even unaware of economic and legal nuances of the bankruptcy procedure, realizes all too well the political hazard of bringing what is still mostly state-owned property into "a healthy state" (the president's expression -- R.N.). But this is what a government has been envisioned for in the Russian system of executive authority -- as a rule it is the government, not the head of state, who puts unpopular decisions into practice. If Boris Yeltsin really sees bankruptcies -- not the "mutual cancellation of debts," government credits, and so forth -- as the sole method to combat the crisis of sales, a method that does not have any alternative, then the prime minister is facing what may prove to be the most difficult time in his government career. It is he, not the president, who will bear responsibility for public displeasure with forced bankruptcies. Viktor Chernomyrdin's economic successes of the past four months (the slowing down of inflation and the postponement of new customs duties) are attributable exclusively to an unorthodox and at the same time extremely efficient method of "delayed decisions." How this invention could be applied to bankruptcies is hard to imagine, because "delayed decisions" on nonpayments are tantamount to the conservation of unviable bankrupts. Given this situation, the prime minister alone can save himself -- if he manages to find yet another unorthodox way out of the political corner into which he has been pushed.
