FR940128-0-00002 FR940128-0-00001 DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Office of the Secretary 7 CFR Part 16 Restriction on Importation of Meat From Australia and New Zealand AGENCY: Office of the Secretary, USDA. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This rule amends the regulations entitled ``Section 204 Import Regulations'' to carry out the voluntary restraint agreements concerning the level of 1994 meat imports from Australia and New Zealand entered into by those countries with the United States pursuant to section 204 of the Agricultural Act of 1956, as amended. EFFECTIVE DATE: January 28, 1994. See SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION for applicability dates. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Gerald Harvey, (202) 720&hyph;8031, Dairy, Livestock and Poultry Division, Foreign Agricultural Service, USDA, room 6616 South Building, Washington, DC 20250. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Pursuant to the authority of section 204 of the Agricultural Act of 1956, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1854), and Executive Order 11539, as amended, the Office of the United States Trade Representative has negotiated agreements with the Governments of Australia and New Zealand whereby those countries have voluntarily agreed to limit the quantity of certain meats exported to the United States during calendar year 1994. The Secretary of Agriculture, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State and the United States Trade Representative, is authorized to carry out such agreements and to implement such action. Presently, 7 CFR part 16, subpart A entitled ``Section 204 Import Regulations'' contains provisions governing the entry or withdrawal from warehouse of certain meats imported from Australia and New Zealand during calendar year 1993. This rule amends subpart A to delete the provisions relating to Australia and New Zealand for calendar year 1993 which no longer are in effect and inserts new provisions to carry out the voluntary agreements entered into by Australia and New Zealand with the United States for calendar year 1994. The definition of meat in the regulations encompasses the Harmonized Tariff Schedules of the United States (HTS) items which are the subject of the voluntary agreements with Australia and New Zealand. In order to prevent circumvention of the import limitations, the definition also includes meat that would fall within such definition but for processing in Foreign-Trade Zones, territories, or possessions of the United States. In addition, the regulations impose transshipment restrictions which prevent the entry or withdrawal from warehouse for consumption of meat from Australia and New Zealand unless exported from those countries as direct shipments or on through bills of lading or, if processed in Foreign-Trade Zones, territories or possessions of the United States, shipped as direct shipments or on through bills of lading from such areas. Applicability Date Meat released under the provisions of sections 448(b) and 484(a)(1)(A) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1448(b) (immediate delivery), and 19 U.S.C. 1484(a)(1)(A) (entry)), prior to January 28, 1994, shall not be denied entry. This action has been determined to involve foreign affairs functions of the United States. Therefore, this regulation falls within the foreign affairs exception to Executive Order 12291 and the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553 with respect to proposed rulemaking. Further, the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act do not apply to this rule since the proposed rulemaking provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553 do not apply.
