Nearly 50 patients suffering from this disease were reported during November. As a spokesman for the Regional Health Directorate announced, the inhabitants hardest hit by this disease are from the districts of Pueblo Nuevo, Pitipo, and Mesones Muro, and also from the populated centers of La Traposa, Laquipampa, and Senor de la Justicia. He revealed that all the cases involve malignant malaria, and that the majority are persons living in the rural section of Ferrenafe. The source remarked that people engaged in agricultural work and in contact with the countryside are most prone to contract this disease, because farming areas are considered a habitat for its vector, namely, the anopheles mosquito. He claimed that Ferrenafe's chief problem is the lack of medical care for all its inhabitants, because the health sector has only one properly equipped establishment, which must treat all the residents comprising the province. He explained that there are many districts with small medical stations and health centers, but none of them have medicines or medical professionals. Hence, those stricken have been evacuated to the city itself.
