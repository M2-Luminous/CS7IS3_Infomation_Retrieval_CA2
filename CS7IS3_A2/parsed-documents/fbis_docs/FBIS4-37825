The bombardments began at dawn, continued through the day and were still in progress as night fell. Twenty-two civilians were killed and around 100 wounded as Katyusha rockets slammed into the city's northern suburbs and shells hit the city centre, officials at Aden's main hospital said. Fierce fighting on the north and northwestern fronts left eight soldiers dead and 48 wounded when northern troops launched two offensives, according to the city's other hospitals. Wounded taken to the main hospital had to be treated in the corridors because of lack of space, while weeping relatives crowded the courtyard. A spokesman for the breakaway Yemen Democratic Republic said on Aden Radio: "Following renewed, blind bombardments by the north of Aden, we urgently call on the international community to impose a ceasefire by force." He appealed for northern troops loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih to be forced to withdraw from the south and to be treated as war criminals. Aden Radio called on the town's citizens to "join in the defence," assuring them there had been no breakthrough by northern forces, while television read out an army communique indicating "resistance operations" within territory held by northern forces. The army statement said 47 northern troops had been killed in the previous 48 hours during two "resistance" operations in the Lahij region, some 100 kilometres (60 miles) north of Aden. Military sources here said the north had managed to seize the entrance to the town of Bi'r Ahmad, 15 kilometres (nine miles) northwest of Aden, close to one of the city's three power stations. The plant was hit by eight Katyushas, causing a fire in fuel pipelines and resulting in a partial shutdown and power cuts in several Aden districts. A cloud of dust and sand hung over Bi'r Ahmad caused by explosions as a Toyota car, with a siren blaring, scoured the area picking up dead and wounded soldiers. Electricity was restored to many districts in the city after a power cut caused by a rocket attack on the Hiswah power plant, west of Aden. On the northern front the battle raged for control of the pumping station at Bi'r Nasir which provides Aden's drinking water supplies. Two shells hit the fish market at Ma'allah on the sea front and a salvo of Kaytusha rockets destroyed five houses in the working class district of Mansurah. Shells fell on Aden at the rate of two or three a minute and the Khormaksar district near the airport and northern suburbs near the front were also hit. Southern leaders said in a statement that 800 civilians had been killed or wounded by northern attacks on Aden and its suburbs since June 17. Salih and southerners backing his rival 'Ali Salim al-Bid have been locked in civil war for almost two months. "The Sanaa regime is continuing to defy the international community," the statement added, referring to a UN Security Council resolution adopted on June 1 calling for an immediate ceasefire and the start of talks. The north's Planning Minister 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani is en route for Washington where he is to meet with UN Secretary General Butros Butros-Ghali to discuss the war which broke out on May 5. Al-Iryani will also meet UN special envoy Lakhdar Brahimi who failed to broker a truce during a 10-day tour of the region, the official SABA' agency said. The north demands that the south renounce its May 21 declaration of a separate state before entering talks. The minister, scheduled to hold talks in Washington with U.S. State Department officials, will discuss the "means to apply UN Resolution 924 in the context of Yemeni unity," the agency said. The war shattered four years of uneasy union between the former Marxist South Yemen and conservative, tribal North Yemen. Meanwhile in Cairo, Russian Ambassador Vladimir Polyakov said any recognition by Russia of the breakaway state would depend on the findings of Brahimi's report.
