[passage omitted] In press statements, other figures of Romania's political scene have also reacted to the attack in Sarajevo. Thus, the president of the Democratic Party (National Salvation Front), [PD-FSN] Petre Roman, emphasized that, when it comes to human lives, no effort is too great to save them and nothing can be viewed as too insignificant when these human lives disappear. The time has definitely come for the international community and what is termed will for peace to finally adopt radical measures based on the law, on the right to life. Ion Diaconescu, vice president of the National Peasant Christian Democratic Party, [PNTCD] emphasized in his statement that it is crazy to kill innocent people and that what happened in Sarajevo compels world powers to do all they can to halt this tragedy. The president of the Agrarian Democratic Party of Romania [PDAR], Victor Surdu, stressed that the long-standing tragedy that is taking place not far from Romania's borders concerns and worries us. The numerous victims in Sarajevo's history testify to the illogical and absurd nature of this conflict. The time has come for international organizations to manifest greater determination and urge the adoption of solutions, which will put a halt to this tragedy. Mrs. Ana Blandiana, Civic Alliance president, pointed out in here statement that the tragedy in Sarajevo has the same roots and is linked to the tragedy in Tiraspol and Chisinau, and to all the suffering in the periphery of the former Soviet empire in which the conservative forces are striving to reestablish their domination, regardless of the costs. What is terrible, however, Mrs. Blandiana emphasized, is the fact that everything is also linked to a general indifference -- from the indifference of the great powers to that of individuals in general.
