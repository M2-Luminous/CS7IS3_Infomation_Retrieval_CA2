In the course of the last two years, a new system for the organization of military-technical cooperation with foreign countries was worked out and established through the joint efforts of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation, and the defense industry. A fundamental reorganization of the system for the export of arms was begun under the leadership of the Interdepartmental Commission on military-Technical Cooperation. At the present time, a number of stages of the plan for the reorganization of military-technical cooperation approved by the Government of the Russian Federation have already been realized: --a consultative and supervisory council under the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations made up of representatives of developers and manufacturers of export arms has been established and is working actively; --financing-industrial groups oriented toward the export of arms have begun to be formed and a new system is being established for the interaction of defense enterprises with specialized foreign economic associations of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations ("Oboroneksport," "Spetsvneshtekhnika," and GUSK); --a powerful and reliable system of military-technical cooperation is being established that relies on developers and manufacturers of arms employing the structures of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, which will provide for the comprehensive servicing and modernization of domestic military equipment at the foreign customer and will expand the volume and forms of exports and services for technical assistance to the foreign buyer; --certain changes have been made in the structures of foreign economic associations dealing with the export of arms, their leadership has been replaced, etc. At the present time, the established system of military-technical cooperation is fully workable and basically fulfills the functions assigned to it, although it is not free from shortcomings (parallel efforts in individual areas of the work of foreign economic associations, bureaucracy, and a long time for the drawing up of contracts), which, in our view, can be eliminated through customary methods of everyday work. For this reason, the withdrawal of specialized foreign economic associations in a particular stage (as foreseen by Edict No. 1932c of the President of the Russian Federation from 18 November 1993) may lead to the disorganization of the program planned and approved by the Government of the Russian Federation for the reorganization of military-technical cooperation. Also unavoidable are the following negative consequences: 1. The receipt by foreign partners and arms customers of information about the fundamental reorganization of the All-Union association "Oboroneksport," the state foreign economic company "Spetsvneshtekhnika," and the GUSK, which have many years of experience in international weapons markets, will doubtless lead to increased uncertainty among them about the stability and possibility of Russia to fulfill its obligations in the area of military-technical cooperation. This threatens the conclusion of a number of new contracts and the incipient positive trends in the development of military-technical cooperation. The losses in connection with the cancellation of contracts are estimated at about $2 billion. 2. The establishment of the state company "Rosvooruzheniye" means the actual transfer of the state monopoly for trade in weapons to an economic entity, which violates the integrity of the work being carried out by the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations to pay off the debts of foreign countries to Russia and to eliminate the state debt of Russia to suppliers of arms and military equipment. 3. The establishment of the new structure in the system of military-technical cooperation will disrupt the organized utilization of a single infrastructure for the foreign economic activity of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, including foreign representations (trade delegations), through which most military-technical cooperation with foreign countries is carried out today. The edict of the President of the Russian Federation from 18 November 1993 was not coordinated with the departments responsible for the status of military-technical cooperation. It appears that actions for its realization are in need of serious coordination on the part of interested organizations. In connection with what has been stated above, we ask you to suspend temporarily the effect of the edict and to entrust the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations of the Russian Federation with the preparation of proposals in relation to its realization. B. Bunkin, general designer of the scientific-production association "Almaz," V. Yefremov, general designer of the concern "Antey," G. Yefremov, general designer of the scientific-production association for machine building, Yu. Perunov, general designer of the Scientific-Production Association imeni P.S. Ploshakov, V. Kireyev, general designer and general director of the Novocherkassk Engineering-Reclamation Institute, M. Simonov, general designer of the Experimental-Design Bureau imeni Sukhoy, A. Kuznetsov, general designer of the MAK "Vympel." This letter and the material published on page 2 were prepared for printing on the eve of the first meeting of the Federal Assembly. We decided to put off its publication only so that we would not exercise even indirect influence on the results of the election of the speaker of the Council of the Federation--the figure of V. Shumeyko was already looming behind the scenes of this political drama. The Russian senators have now made their choice and V. Shumeyko is now beyond the reach of justice. But the trade in Russian weapons is a magnitude immeasurably greater both economically and politically. In our view, the documents that RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA is publishing today must attract the close attention of parliamentarians and perhaps a parliamentary investigation will be required. After all, the powerful main designers of Russian weapons, whose letter to the president we are publishing simultaneously, actually did not accomplish anything, although they raised the same questions to the highest state authority that are contained in the publication of RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA. In refraining from the publication of this material on the eve of the elections for the Council of the Federation, we actually contributed to some degree to the election of V. Shumeyko to the highest post in the legislative structure of authority. While congratulating him on this success, we would also like to say that the repression to which RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA has been subject until now emanated and continues to emanate from the closest circle around the president, to which V. Shumeyko also belongs. At times this repression has the nature of petty revenge. They either shut down RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA or "punish" it in some other way for criticizing the scandalous "settlements" in the highest echelons of power, which attained the character of permanence and are diverting the strength of officials away from affairs that have now reached a deplorable state. For example, they cut off the telephones for government communications, as happened in October and continues to happen to this day, although the editor's office pays very well for this kind of service. As they say, the poor are very inventive and those in power are crafty in their repression, although prudence is very much preferable today.
