The minister spoke at the Latin American Integration Association (ALADI) headquarters. He called on association members to work for the convergence of subregional processes and for joint action on economic, social, and political issues. He referred to the need to accomplish more in this sense by gradually integrating production and service sectors. In regard to the island's situation, Robaina asserted that his government is taking concrete steps to restore as quickly as possible the principal economic indicators. Robaina added that in his country everything is subject to debate at several levels so as to resolve current problems. He also denounced the economic, commercial, and financial blockade imposed by the United States for the past 30 years and said the measure was a flagrant, massive, and systematic violation of human rights. The minister added that the Caribbean country will not negotiate over its sovereignty or its right to speak for itself. Nor will it abandon the social achievements it has accomplished. The head of Cuban diplomacy arrived in Uruguay last Monday for an official three-day visit which will continue until tomorrow, 7 April, according to reports. During his stay, Robaina was received by President Luis Alberto Lacalle and met with cabinet members, including his colleague Sergio Abreu, businessmen, intellectuals, and compatriots who reside in that country. Robaina's South American tour includes Ecuador, Peru, Argentina, and Paraguay, according to sources in the Caribbean delegation.
