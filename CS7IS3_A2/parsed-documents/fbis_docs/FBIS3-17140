He was once a minister of justice and a secretary of the Communist Party of Belarus [KPB] Central Committee. He is one of those few people who remain faithful to their beliefs, despite all transitory trends. Currently, Valeriy Guryevich heads the People's Movement of Belarus [NDB] Supreme Soviet faction. He has recently met with a RESPUBLIKA correspondent. [passage omitted] [Gukovskiy]You are the leader of the NDB's deputy faction. How do you, and your colleagues, assess the current political and economic situation in Belarus? [Tikhinya] Serious changes have recently taken place -- society has become more leftist. Left-centrist forces have consolidated under the NDB's roof. The Belarusian Popular Front [BNF], which is rapidly losing people's confidence, is agonizing. This was confirmed by the events that took place in February -- the failed attempt to turn society upside-down. The tide of nationalist frenzy is seceding. Complex and contradictory processes are under way in the Belarusian economy which, in my opinion, is inertly falling, but has not yet hit bottom, and I doubt it will do so this year. Over the last two years, the GDP has fallen by more than 20 percent, which has been an unprecedented decline. The Belarusian economy could not endure senseless experiments, and as a result, Belarus has joined the undeveloped countries of the world. The social gap continues to widen -- the poor are getting poorer and the rich are getting richer. According to the Institute of Sociology Data, two thirds of Belarusian citizens currently live on the brink of poverty. Biological survival has become the main problem for many people.... [Gukovskiy]What do you propose? [Tikhinya] To start with, the entire path we have gone through should be analyzed, and our ailing economy should be diagnosed. After that, a program for overcoming the crisis should be worked out. Today, we resemble a passenger of a train, the engineer of which does not know where he is going. [Gukovskiy]When did the engineer lose touch with reality? [Tikhinya] At the first stage of Gorbachev's so-called perestroyka, approximately at the end of 1990. As Goethe said, we admitted that the idea was useful, but we failed to wisely implement it. Although we accepted the idea of market economy, we have not managed to put it into practice so far. There should be a comprehensive concept of action for implementing market reforms. We should proceed toward the market economy on an evolutionary path, beginning with the sector of economy that is prepared most adequately for this. In this regard, I totally support the Kebich government, despite the fact that it sometimes fails to consistently proceed on this path. Gaydarization and shock therapy are not for us. Our economic course should be thoroughly corrected. I am not speaking about this accidentally. Addressing the Supreme Soviet session after his election, [Supreme Soviet Chairman] Mechyslaw Hryb stated that Belarus' course, including implementation of economic reforms, had not been changed. I cannot agree with this. Reforms that lead the people toward impoverishment are worth nothing, and it is evident that the people are being robbed. I have in mind not only the "burnt" savings in the Saving Bank. During the tenure of [former Supreme Soviet Chairman] Stanislav Shushkevich, social guarantees, which had been won in preceding years, were systematically and gradually liquidated. I believe that there are at least three preconditions for coming out of the crisis: overcoming the powerlessness of authorities, joining an economic union with Russia, and mounting the battle against crime. [Gukovskiy]Where, in your opinion, does the powerlessness of authorities lie -- in its insufficient powers or low professional skills? [Tikhinya] Until recently, the main reason lay in the lack of powers. The parliament, however, has recently granted additional powers to the Cabinet of Ministers. Therefore, the personnel issue has now come into prominence. [Prime Minister] Vyacheslav Kebich's attempts to reorganize the government deserve approval. The second necessary precondition, as I have already said, is an economic union with Russia. We need it, as we need air, and the establishment of a common ruble zone should be the first step in this direction. The third precondition for overcoming the crisis is the battle against crime. Corrupted Mafia rings have infiltrated state structures, which was vividly confirmed by the evidence collected by the committee headed by Deputy Alyaksandr Lukashenka. This comes as no surprise, since there still is no state program for combating crime. Crimes against property currently amount to 75 percent of all felonies. When I was the attorney of the Minsk Leninskiy rayon, this figure did not exceed 25 percent. However, this is not strange at all, given the out-of-control price hikes. A man is tempted into committing a crime if he has nothing to eat, even under the threat of harsh punishment. Improvement of the situation depends on how quickly can we improve the economic situation. [Gukovskiy]The NDB is composed of various parties and organizations, in terms of their viewpoint on the future economic development of Belarus. I understand that an accord is possible in politics to achieve common goals and tasks at a certain stage. How, however, is the NDB going to work out a common economic program? Are you going to create a hybrid made of contradictory economic viewpoints? Will it not lead to an even more abnormal and abominable experiment? [Tikhinya] The NDB will discuss its economic program at its next congress, which will probably be held after the economic union with Russia is concluded. I hope that we will not have to wait too long. There will be no hybrid. We will collectively discuss a draft program on which our specialists have already begun to work. I believe that it will be based on the communists' program. In general, all organizations forming the NDB agree that the people should be returned what they have been deprived of, and that we should build a welfare economy. This conforms to a constitutional provision on building a welfare state. [Gukovskiy]The deputies' corps voted for introducing the presidential office in Belarus. Shortly before that, NDB leader Syarhey Haydukevich had stated in an interview with our paper that the movement is for a parliamentary republic. Did the NDB have not enough votes to block the parliament's decision, or did you simply change your mind at the last moment? [Tikhinya] We are indeed able to block any decision requiring a constitutional majority. Having analyzed this issue on the eve of voting, the majority of us finally decided to vote for introducing presidency. Although I conformed to the majority, I still believe that we have not taken advantage of all possibilities of a parliamentary republic. On the other hand, given the current disorder, the introduction of the presidency can become the effective means of strengthening the executive branch that we have spoken of. It should be kept in mind, however, that the presidency can also lead Belarus to an authoritarian rule. Therefore, following the introduction of this office, we should immediately work out a whole range of limits and counterweights. We should, for example, stipulate that the president is not entitled to dissolve the Supreme Soviet, etc. [Gukovskiy] What sort of a man, in your opinion, should the Belarusian president be? [Tikhinya] Speaking about a political leader, it should be somebody like Petr Masherov [former first secretary of the KPB]. Speaking about a state leader, I would name Yuriy Andropov [former first secretary of the CPSU] -- Belarus needs exactly this sort of a man today. [Gukovskiy]What can you say about chances of specific politicians in the presidential elections? Whom will the NDB field or support? [Tikhinya] Our coordinative committee has not yet discussed this issue. I, personally, believe that either Lukashenka or Kebich can become candidates of left-wing forces' bloc. Perhaps other people will appear. The right wing, in my opinion, will present as its candidates Karpenko [leader of the Party of People's Accord], Shushkevich, Tarazevich, and, probably, [BNF leader] Paznyak; the latter, however, has rather poor chances, as a very loathsome individual. [Gukovskiy]How did Tarazevich, former Supreme Soviet chairman of the Belarusian Socialist Soviet Republic, end up on the right flank? [Tikhinya] It is hard for me to answer this question. I only admit the fact. [Gukovskiy]Are you going to run for the presidency? [Tikhinya] According to the draft legislation on presidential elections, either 70 votes of people's deputies or 100,000 signatures of voters is required to register a candidate. The NDB will try to present only one candidate. If my candidacy is put forward, I will run. Today, all I can say is that I will run for a parliamentary seat.
