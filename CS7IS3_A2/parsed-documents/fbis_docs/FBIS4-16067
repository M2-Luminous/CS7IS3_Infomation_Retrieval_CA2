Pattoyev told INTERFAX on Wednesday that, before the summit, to be held in Moscow, Rakhmonov hopes to meet Russian President Boris Yeltsin to discuss the possibility of Tajikistan's joining the ruble zone and of strengthening the Tajik-Afghan border. The Tajik leadership hopes to receive assistance to restore and stabilize the Republic's economy, ruined by the civil war, Pattoyev said. He said Rakhmonov was very interested in Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev's proposal for a Eurasian Union, a community of former Soviet republics closer than the CIS. But the Tajik leader would make no statements on it before he made a detailed study of it, Pattoyev said.
