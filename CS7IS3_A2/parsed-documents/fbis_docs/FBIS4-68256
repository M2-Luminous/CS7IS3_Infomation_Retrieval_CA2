On 15 April of this year the defense minister signed the corresponding order. These documents will evoke joy in some, and anxiety over a son's soldierly fate in others. For workers of mobilization offices and military commissariats they mean the beginning of another period of hard work, full of worries and, sometimes, unresolved problems. In recent years the draft has become a painful point for the country, a point of intersection of often diametrically opposed interests of different people and departments. And the main purpose of this matter of statehood--providing for the country's defense--has faded somewhere back into second or third priority. The fall draft of last year essentially dragged on into February and March of this year. Of course in the official terminology of military commissariats the draft ended on 31 December 1993, followed by a period of assignment of the recruits to the forces. But for practical purposes this has all obviously been a single continuous period. The causes of this unprecedented phenomenon are known: Almost 80 percent of draftees received deferments from service--50 to continue their studies, 23 for health reasons, 4 for work in the arts, education and public health, and 3 because of their family situation. Seventy thousand potential draftees are on the run. Consequently last year less than 22 percent of persons on the draft rolls were drafted. For comparison, in neighboring Finland this figure is equal to 90. Through the efforts of the Main Organizational and Mobilizational Directorate of the Main Staff, of workers of the military commissariats and draft boards, and of representatives of the heads of local administrations, at the beginning of this year we were able to achieve a turning point in this negative trend: Eighty percent of the planned number of draftees were already in the army and navy. By the end of March, the figure increased. [passage omitted]
