Crimea's Constitution does not envisage the post of prime minister; the Cabinet of Ministers is led by the president of the autonomous republic. In a conversation with a UNIAN correspondent on 15 February, Mykola Mykhalchenko, head of the service of the president of Ukraine for domestic policy issues, noted that Saburov cannot be appointed to any state post as this runs counter to Ukrainian legislation, in particular Article 4: On public service in Ukraine, which indicates that the right to a state post belongs to citizens of Ukraine. According to Mykhalchenko, without Ukrainian citizenship Saburov can only lay claim to a consultant's role in the apparatus of Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov. The head of the service of the president of Ukraine for domestic policy issues also stressed that he considers Saburov's utterances on introducing the Russian ruble on the peninsula in parallel with the Ukrainian karbovanets to be populist ones.
