Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-22Mar94-Russia RTV Blasts Yakovlev, Poltoranin SUMMARY On 16 March Russian Television's (RTV) primetime edition of its Vesti news program launched a scathing attack on media bigwigs, including Aleksandr Yakovlev, head of both the Federal Service of Russia for Television and Radio Broadcasting and the Ostankino Television and Radio Broadcasting Company, and Mikhail Poltoranin, head of the State Duma Committee for Information Policy and Communications. Showing video of the two taking in the performance of an exotic dancer at a club for media elite, the program juxtaposed the officials' expensive and decadent perquisites with state television's acute shortage of operating funds. END SUMMARY Newscaster Svetlana Sorokina began the report by highlighting the continuing financial difficulties Plaguing state television. She noted that Anatoliy Nazeykin, chairman of the Central Committee of the Russian Federation Trade Union of Communications Workers, had recently warned that communications workers may again go on strike, as they did in February, if state television companies continue to fall behind in payments to communications enterprise5 for broadcasting state programming. The report then noted that the "media chiefs" had just attended a meeting of the Russian Union of Journalists where participant5 discussed state televisions financial crisis, and had stopped off at an "elitist" and "bourgeoi" journalists' club on returning from the meeting. Accompanying video showed Yakovlev and Poltoranin conversing at a table and then cut to shots of an "exotic" dancer performing a strip-tease to Western jazz music. The reporter said that the club's patrons, largely bankers and entrepreneurs selected according to "CPSU principles," came to enjoy "expensive foreign drinks" and to experience "Western culture," which is "foreign" to Russians. He concluded the report by noting that the proceeds from the club were supposed to support state television and questioning whether the government would also help. Sorokina then closed the broadcast by sardonically assuring viewers that, "as soon as we learn," Vesti would inform viewers "whom the government will help and how." Implications Coming in the wake of a major media reorganizati0n and statements by Yeltsin on the need to maintain two state television companies, this brash attack may indicate that decision-makers at RTV see Yeltsin himself as their patron and do not fear antagonizing Yakovlev or media officialdom in general. It may be particularly embarrassing for Yakovlev, who himself has recently expressed his opposition to excessive sex and violence in Western television programming aired on Russian television. The attack, however, plays into the hands of Yeltsin's hardline opponents, who often decry the alleged influence and decadence of the West. Finally, by simultaneously titillating viewers with salacious television footage and embarrassing Yakovlev, head of RTV's main rival, Ostankino, the report may indicate that competition between the two major television companie5 for viewers and advertising rubles is heating up.
