(Sumitomo Light Metal), has successfully confirmed a new synthesis method for titanium-aluminum intermetallic compounds. The method comprises the blending process of titanium and aluminum powders, the extrusion-molding process, and the reaction process in a heated reactor. By developing this method, Sumitomo Light Metal eliminated the problems of coping with difficult machining after molding the intermetallic compounds and their tendency to oxidize at as high a temperature as 800�C. Initially, Sumitomo Light Metal has begun distributing samples of automotive engine valves to major automobile makers. The lightweight intermetallic compounds will reduce the valve weights, and in turn, improve engine output and reduce fuel consumption. Titanium-aluminum intermetallic compounds, which are promising as lightweight, heat-resistant alloys for automotive components, can be applied more broadly for aircraft and electric power generation turbines if their machinability is improved. The method developed by Sumitomo Light Metal was the ``reaction-sintering method'' for titanium-aluminum intermetallic compounds. In the method, titanium and aluminum powders are mixed and melted with agitation after the component ratio and heat input have been adjusted, and the molten mixture is extrusion-molded into a final shape. Subsequently, in a heated reactor in which the high pressure of 2,000 atm is maintained, titanium and aluminum in the mixture are made to react under pressure to form an alloy. Titanium-aluminum-based intermetallic compounds have been drawing attention for their lightweight and high-temperature strength. However, the compounds have been extremely difficult to machine after the compound is formed by the reaction of titanium with aluminum. Moreover, both titanium and aluminum are easily oxidized at a high temperature, and oxidized alloys tend to undergo deformation. Thus, Sumitomo Light Metal added chlorine to the titanium during the production process to form a film to improve resistance against oxidation. Currently, the company is developing a mass-production technology based on the reaction sintering method under a consignment from the Japan Research Development Corp. of the Science and Technology Agency. Titanium-aluminum intermetallic compounds have specific gravities of 3.8 to 3.9, as compared with 2.7 for aluminum and 7.8 for iron. The tensile strength per unit area for the compounds at normal temperature is 50-70 kg, which is slightly lower than 60-100 kg for heat-resistant steel and nickel-based alloys. However, at high temperatures, the compounds do not lose as much strength as do the other metals, so that the compounds are stronger than the other materials at approximately 800�C. Sumitomo Light Metal plans to market the compounds with their advantage as lightweight, heat-resistant materials that can withstand high-speed rotation at high temperatures. The initial target will be automotive engine valves that replace existing valves of heat-resistant steel and nickel-based alloys. The applications for the compounds are expected to broaden if the production cost, including machining cost, can be reduced.
