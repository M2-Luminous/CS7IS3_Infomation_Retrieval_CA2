FR941021-0-00055 FR941021-0-00007 Response: The MMS has used the requirements of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (NHPA) 16 U.S.C. 470 et seq., the Archaeological and Historic Preservation Act 16 U.S.C. 469&hyph;469c, and the Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979 (ARPA) 16 U.S.C. 470aa&hyph;mm in developing the requirements in the regulations. However, MMS believes that the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act provides sufficient authority for all requirements in the regulation. Changes in Definitions Comment: Two commenters suggested that we define the term ``archaeological resource'' to be consistent with the definition provided in implementing regulations for the ARPA, 16 U.S.C. 470aa&hyph;mm, 43 CFR 7.3. Response: We have changed the definition of ``archaeological resource'' to the wording recommended by the commenters with one exception (with regard to the age criterion), to correspond to the definition provided in 43 CFR 7.3(a) (1) and (2). The exception was to change the 100-year-old criterion for the age of an archaeological resource to a 50-year-old criterion so that the MMS regulation is consistent with the NHPA criteria for eligibility to the National Register of Historic Places. To improve the clarity of the rule, MMS added a definition of significant archaeological resource. Archaeological Report Standards Comment: One commenter suggested that we include documentation (report) standards in the archaeology rule. Another commenter suggested that the reports submitted conform to the ``Secretary of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines for Archaeology and Historic Preservation.'' Response: The MMS has developed detailed survey and report standards for OCS archaeological surveys based on more than 20 years experience. These standards are contained in Region-specific NTL's. The MMS has chosen not to include the survey and report standards in the rule. These standards are very detailed and vary from region to region due to differences in regional geology and environmental conditions. Basis for Requiring Archaeological Report Comment: One commenter was concerned that in the proposed rule, the Regional Director would be permitted to make the determination of whether an archaeological survey/report would be required. Another commenter suggested that we provide improved guidance about the basis upon which a Regional Director would make the regulatory determination that an archaeological resource exists in the proposed lease area. Response: This decision as to whether or not a report is required is not made arbitrarily by the Regional Director. The MMS conducts regional archaeological baseline studies to compile information on the locations of historic shipwrecks and coastal prehistoric archaeological sites. These data are also used to construct predictive criteria for the occurrence of unknown sites on the continental shelf. Using these predictive criteria, MMS can identify portions of the continental shelf having potential for archaeological resources. These ``archaeologically sensitive'' areas are used as the basis for requiring marine remote sensing surveys to evaluate the archaeological site potential of individual lease tracts before permitting lease activities.
