The striking thing is that the Palestinian retaliation was carried out one day after the incident in question -- which means that there is a decision not to stay silent about any Israeli attacks in the future, whether in Hebron or elsewhere. The Israeli authorities are responsible for these violent incidents. Because they defied the international will and sought to continue to humiliate the Palestinians when they refused to remove their settlements and settlers from Hebron in the wake of the tension that dominated the area following the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, which resulted in the martyrdom of at least 100 people. When Israeli Environment Minister Yosi Sarid says that coexistence between the Arabs and the Jews in the town is no longer possible, he is adding nothing new. All settlements in the occupied territories represent for the Arabs a constant provocation and an obstacle to any peace process. The Rabin government wanted to use the Hebron settlements in particular as a bargaining chip to secure some concessions from the PLO. Because it knew that the latter was in an embarrassing situation after the massacre. And now it is realizing just how costly that reckless and unstudied action has proved to be. What applies to the Hebron settlements applies to the Gaza Strip settlements, whose population does not exceed 4,000 settlers and which do not represent any economic or security value aside from disrupting the Palestinians' existence and continuing to embarrass the Palestinian leadership. In the past Israeli governments have used security as an excuse to build and expand settlements. But since Iraq's al-Husayn missiles landed in downtown Tel Aviv without missing their targets even once, all these pretexts and excuses have collapsed and the settlements have become a burden on the security of Israel and the Israelis and the object of Arab and international criticisms. It is fortunate that the Israeli tide of violence and the swift Palestinian revenge for those wounded by the settlers' bullets should coincide with Israeli [as published] Secretary of State Warren Christopher's visit to the region in the framework of his shuttle between Damascus and occupied Jerusalem to reactivate the Israeli-Syrian track. Prehaps Christopher realizes for the umpteenth time the danger of continued Israeli occupation and its impact on peace and stability in the region as a whole. Israel, which is submitting a long list of impossible conditions and giving priority to normalization before any positive step regarding withdrawal, is refusing to abandon many of its aggressive aspects so that it can become a state, like other states, that respects international law. It is unnatural for international observers to enjoy respect and cooperation from host states throughout the world, and nothing but scorn, maltreatment, and spying [from Israel], as mentioned by a Danish newspaper, quoting circles close to Danish soldiers in Hebron. The crisis lies in the presence of a man like Rabin, who continues to think like a general and has no clear strategic views for peace. This is why he and his government continue to act haphazardly inside and outside the occupied territory. So we must expect more surprises in Hebron and elsewhere in the coming days and months.
