In a statement today, the movement said it rejects any dialogue between Hamas and Israel, saying the only language the Israeli enemy understands will remain the language of force and struggle, not the language of concessions and capitulation. The statement said that all the Israeli attempts to open dialogue with Hamas members detained in Israeli prisons have failed, and will never be successful.
