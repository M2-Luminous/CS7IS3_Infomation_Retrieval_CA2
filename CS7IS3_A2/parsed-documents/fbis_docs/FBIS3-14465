This resolution was adopted to condemn the massacre in the sacred al-Ibrahim Mosque in Hebron, and to take important measures, for the first time, on this significant international level. Especially important is the comprehensive aspect of this resolution, which is binding on all members of the international community. In relation to holy Jerusalem, the resolution deals with it as an integral part of the Palestinian territories that have been occupied since June 1967. The clarification supplied by the U.S. Government on the paragraph concerned prompted the Islamic and Arab groups to begin activities in New York and Washington to immediately take up the issue with the U.S. Administration. The administration has recently clarified its position, and despite feverish attempts by the Jewish lobby in the United States, the final status of Jerusalem will be discussed within a period not exceeding two years from this date. Holy Jerusalem is the capital of the state of Palestine; therefore, we stress our total belief in our right, religion, and holy Koran [passage omitted]. Jerusalem is an integral part of Palestinian national sovereignty; God Almighty has honored us by making us its loyal guardians; we defend it with our lives and with the cascades of blood that have not ceased to flow for one single minute along the path of the Palestinian and Arab holy war to defend the two holy places -- sacred places of Prophet Muhammad, God's peace and prayers be upon him, and Jesus Christ, God's peace upon him. Stemming from this principle, we will not accept any Israeli or non-Israeli control over Jerusalem, because it is the capital of our independent state of Palestine. [passage omitted].
