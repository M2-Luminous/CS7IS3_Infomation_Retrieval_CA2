During a speech two days ago, while inviting the United States to show a greater and more active presence in the Middle East region, Fahd commented on Iran and its relations with the neighboring states, saying: Iran should observe international regulations and should return to the United Arab Emirates [UAE] the three islands in the southern sector of the Persian Gulf. Saudi Arabia, in view of the role it assumes for itself among the tiny states of the Persian Gulf, has always tried to present itself as the leader of these states in the region by interfering in their affairs. Therefore, while the Islamic Republic is striving to remove the misunderstanding with the UAE on the basis of a bilateral agreement, Arabia by raising and exacerbating the issue is presenting itself as a claimant on this matter. Fahd's remarks have no legal base either. For Saudi Arabia is neither an acceptable source of arbitration with sufficient credibility to express an opinion on issues of other countries, nor should the head of state of a third country comment fundamentally on the territorial possessions of others. If we were to analyze Fahd's comments as a whole, we would realize that he is raising these matters just to please those powers which benefit from creation of discord among the Islamic countries. This is a policy in line with America's policies and is implemented to isolate Iran in the region. Iran, in accordance with its independent policies, is opposed to the course of compromise, is opposed to the expansion of the Zionist regime's presence, and is against the U.S. presence in the region. Whereas the United States, by leading the compromise course, is striving to open the gate of the Islamic countries to the Zionist regime and to strengthen the foundations of its own presence in the Middle East region. For the same reason the United States has always tried to isolate Iran in the region and to neutralize its role as a regional power.
