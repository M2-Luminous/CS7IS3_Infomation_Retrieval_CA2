Vice-Premier Aleksandr Shokhin said in an interview with the same programme it would be wrong to speak about a change in the government policy. "The question is that we are entering a new period, a new phase of the economic policy, and this new phase means that we must do thorough, routine work, hard work. It is impossible to promise an abrupt improvement of overall performance in three or six months, the vice-premier stressed. Itogi also interviewed Boris Fedorov who declined to join the new government as finance minister. He said it was impossible to continue "a normal economic policy" as long as Viktor Gerashchenko remained the chairman of the Central Bank of Russia. According to Fedorov, inflation in Russia will soon reach at least 30 per cent a month. Responding to a question about his possible role in the parliament to which he had been elected Fedorov said he intended to engage in "constructive criticism of the government but not in political gambling. The interests of the state are above all". Fedorov categorically denied rumours that he had met the U.S. ambassador in Moscow a short time ago to ask him for a job. Both Itogi and the independent television analytical programme Voskresenye discussed the recent drop in the rouble exchange value against the dollar after January 13. According to experts, the panic buying was provoked by two main factors: the end-of-the-year and payments aimed at offsetting inflation and Yegor Gaydar's resignation. Asked by Itogi about his view on the plummeting of the rouble last week, Central Bank Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko said that the fall was due to "several factors, both economic and political". Gerashchenko stressed that the resignation of Gaydar and Fedorov "cannot mean a change in the policy which is objectively necessary". The Central Bank chairman said inflation in January and February would amount to approximately 20 per cent, and may reach 25 per cent in February when debts to some industries will have to be paid. He said the debts have reached 2.5 trillion roubles.
