FR940527-1-00077 FR940527-1-00014 When we modeled the combined operating and capital outlier payments, we found that using a common set of thresholds resulted in a slightly higher percentage of outlier payments for capital-related costs than for operating costs. We estimate the proposed thresholds for FY 1995 would result in outlier payments equal to 5.1 percent of operating DRG payments and 6.3 percent of capital payments based on the Federal rate. 2. Outlier Changes Planned for FY 1996 Through FY 1998 As stated above, section 1886(d)(5)(A) of the Act requires us to phase out payments for day outliers over the FY 1995 through FY 1997 period. We currently expect to meet the statutory reductions in day outlier payments for FY 1996 and FY 1997 solely through a reduction in the marginal cost factor without having to raise the day outlier threshold. If necessary, we will propose achieving the reduction in day outlier payments between FYs 1996 and 1997 through a combination of reducing the marginal cost factor and raising the threshold. There will be corresponding increases in payments to cost outliers as we phase-out payment to day outliers. We welcome comments on this issue. E. Rural Referral Centers (§412.96) Under the authority of section 1886(d)(5)(C)(i) of the Act, §412.96 sets forth the criteria a hospital must meet in order to receive special treatment under the prospective payment system as a rural referral center. For discharges occurring before October 1, 1994, rural referral centers receive the benefit of payment based on the other urban payment rate rather than the rural payment rate. As of that date, the other urban and rural payment rates will be the same. However, rural referral centers will continue to receive special treatment under both the disproportionate share hospital payment adjustment and the criteria for geographic reclassification. One of the criteria under which a rural hospital may qualify as a referral center is to have 275 or more beds available for use. A rural hospital that does not meet the bed size criterion can qualify as a rural referral center if the hospital meets two mandatory criteria (number of discharges and case-mix index) and at least one of three optional criteria (medical staff, source of inpatients, or volume of referrals). With respect to the two mandatory criteria, a hospital is classified as a rural referral center if its_ •Case-mix index is at least equal to the lower of the median case-mix index for urban hospitals in its census region, excluding hospitals with approved teaching programs, or the median case-mix index for all urban hospitals nationally; and •Number of discharges is at least 5,000 discharges per year or, if fewer, the median number of discharges for urban hospitals in the census region in which the hospital is located. (The number of discharges criterion for an osteopathic hospital is at least 3,000 discharges per year.) 1. Case-Mix Index Section 412.96(c)(1) provides that HCFA will establish updated national and regional case-mix index values in each year's annual notice of prospective payment rates for purposes of determining rural referral center status. In determining the proposed national and regional case-mix index values, we would follow the same methodology we used in the November 24, 1986, final rule, as set forth in regulations at §412.96(c)(1)(ii). Therefore, the proposed national case-mix index value includes all urban hospitals nationwide, and the proposed regional values are the median values of urban hospitals within each census region, excluding those with approved teaching programs (that is, those hospitals receiving indirect medical education payments as provided in §412.105). These values are based on discharges occurring during FY 1993 (October 1, 1992, through September 30, 1993), and include bills posted to HCFA's records through December 1993. Therefore, in addition to meeting other criteria, we are proposing that to qualify for initial rural referral center status for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1994, a hospital's case-mix index value for FY 1993 would have to be at least_ •1.3028; or •Equal to the median case-mix index value for urban hospitals (excluding hospitals with approved teaching programs as identified in §412.105) calculated by HCFA for the census region in which the hospital is located. The median case-mix values by region are set forth in the table below:
