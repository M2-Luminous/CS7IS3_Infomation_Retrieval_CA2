Commenting on Tudjman's threat that "he will use all available means to reintegrate the rebel Serbs into Croatia," Mikelic said that the Republic of Serb Krajina would also use all of its available resources to defend all things Serbian and which have been Serbian for centuries. Adding that the defense of the republic of Serb Krajina "is not what it was when Miljevci plateau and Divoselo were attacked," and that Serbs would no longer lodge complaints with the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] if Croats attack any of their villages, Mikelic said: "Our strength is now tenfold compared to earlier years." Dwelling on the statements from Croatia that it would not extend UNPROFOR's mandate, Mikelic said the territory in question did not belong to Croatia but to the republic of Serb Krajina and that the international forces could stay there for two years because the Serbs want peace. "Croatia's behavior as a whole best illustrates why Serbs cannot and do not want to live with the Croats any longer," he said.
