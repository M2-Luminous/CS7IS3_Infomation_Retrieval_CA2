Li visited five middle and primary schools in Shijiazhuang, capital of the province, Baoding city and Baoding Prefecture on January 30-31. He visited schoolrooms and teachers' dormitories and sent regards to the teachers on behalf of the State Council. He encouraged them to make greater contributions to education in the countryside. Rudimentary education concerns the quality of the entire nation, Li stressed repeatedly during his trip. Governments at all levels must perform rudimentary education work well in the countryside in accordance with local conditions, he said. Li also discussed with provincial officials the development and reform of higher education, vocational education and adult education during his stay in Hebei. More than 800 million of China's 1.16 billion population live in the countryside.
