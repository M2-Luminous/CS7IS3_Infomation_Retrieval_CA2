[Correspondent] The Republic of Croatia has never been held in higher international esteem, says Minister Granic. There are no serious pressures from foreign countries. We have completely adjusted our position regarding Bosnia-Herzegovina to that of the international community. The Washington agreement is the foundation for future relations between the Croats and Muslims. Now that the Vienna agreement has been signed, there are no significant obstacles to the establishment of the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation. As regards the UN protected areas [UNPA's], the cease-fire agreement has been fully implemented by the Croatian side. We expect that the Serbian side will do the same. After that the talks on economic issues and, finally, on political issues should follow. [Begin Granic recording] Our relations with Serbia are perhaps the only thing I would like to underline. If Serbia does not make its position regarding the UNPA's very clear, we will insist on the sanctions, in keeping with [UN Security Council] Resolution 871. There will be no meeting in Belgrade and I will not travel there until the agreed conditions are met. [end recording] [passage omitted]
