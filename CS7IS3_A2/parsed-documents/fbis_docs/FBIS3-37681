The news conference took place after his political consultations with three EC foreign ministers -- those of Belgium, Greece, and Germany. Kozyrev said that at the moment UN representatives are discussing the number of personnel in such formations. There is hope that this problem will be solved within the next few hours and Russian "blue helmets" will take part in the peacekeeping operations in Sarajevo. The main thing is not to miss the this opportunity but to move toward the peace settlement. He said that Russia has historical, cultural, and religious sympathy with all the peoples of southern Europe and is interested in stability in the Balkans. It is in Russia's interests that all the states in this region should enjoy their sovereignty and independence and renounce all territorial or any other claims on each other by solving all the problems by political means. In particular, we are always ready to offer our help as mediators in solving controversial problems between Athens and Skopje, both of which we consider as friendly states, he said. During all the stages involved in reaching a Bosnian settlement, the Russian minister said, we have been taking part in the efforts that are being made to resolve the conflict politically, both in Sarajevo and in Bosnia as a whole. These efforts have been manifested in the new Russian initiative to set up security zones, primarily around Sarajevo. They have found expression in the letter that Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin sent to the Serbs, and to which their positive reply has been received. A. Kozyrev commended the efforts by Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias, who has launched a personal initiative for moving toward peace in the region. Reiterating the importance of B. Yeltsin's message, the minister said that Russia is now trying to get the United States and other partners to exert the necessary influence on all sides in the conflict, especially the Muslims and Croatians, so that they opt not for force but for using the opportunities opening up for achieving peace in Sarajevo and in Bosnia as a whole. The laurels for whoever does the most for this will be shared later, if this is necessary at all, A. Kozyrev concluded. The main thing is not to miss this new opportunity for peace in Europe.
