"I will be a candidate, I will leave the prefecture on 30 March and I expect everyone's help" said Maluf during a three-hour meeting in his house in Sao Paulo. Maluf seeks to end the pressure from friends and relatives not to run for president. Senator Esperidiao Amin (SC) [Santa Catarina], national president of the PPR, made the announcement. He said: "I am convinced Maluf will be our presidential candidate." A good part of the meeting was used to evaluate the studies of Maluf's electoral possibilities and of the PPR candidates for state governors. One point emphasized by Maluf was the concentration of his support, as shown in the polls, in the middle, lower middle, and lower classes of the population which cover the largest part of the electorate. The evaluation of the PPR is that Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso (PSDB) [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] who would be Maluf's direct competitor in a second round would have problems getting the votes of the poor.
