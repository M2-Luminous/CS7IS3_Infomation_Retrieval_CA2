"The way the election campaign has started," Andreatta said on Saturday [26 February] in this northeastern city, "an accord between Pact for Italy and Forza Italia after March 28 seems very unlikely to me." Andreatta, a former Christian Democrat who is not a member of parliament, is a Pact for Italy candidate for the Lower House, running in the northeastern region of Friuli Venezia Giulia. He is running for one of the House seats (25 percent of the total) to be assigned using the proportional system.
