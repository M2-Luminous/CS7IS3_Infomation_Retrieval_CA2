Interior Ministry Secretary General Pascal Benon said the group, probably from Mali, opened fire on a coachload of passengers on June 9 near Djibo, 190 kilometres (120 miles) north of Ouagadougou and injured three of them. The group also intercepted an official car, Benon said. Several other clashes have been reported since last December. The Tuareg rebellion has been raging in neighbouring Mali and Niger since the early 1990s, leading some 7,000 people to seek refuge in Burkina Faso. Military reinforcements were sent to the area at the start of the week. Benon said the situation was "very tense" and stressed that there was a danger local people might decide to "settle their scores with the Tuaregs for themselves." The refugees have gradually been relocated in a camp run by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees at the village of Ferrelio to the north of Djibo. The authorities in Ouagadougou want the UNHCR to move the camp away from the border. However, the UNHCR wants Burkina Faso, one of the poorest countries in the world, to pay the costs, estimated at 184 million CFA Francs (330,000 dollars). The country's 1,000-kilometre (600-mile) frontier with Mali and the 500-kilometre (300-mile) one with Niger are considered practically uncontrollable by the Ministry.
