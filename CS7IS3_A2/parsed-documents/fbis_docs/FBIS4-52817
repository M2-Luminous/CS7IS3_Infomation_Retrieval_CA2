FBIS4-52817 "dreas093_d_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-093 Daily Report 13 May 1994 South Korea U.S.-DPRK `Working-Level' Contact Reported U.S.-DPRK `Working-Level' Contact Reported SK1305023494 Seoul YONHAP in English 0221 GMT 13 May 94 SK1305023494 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Washington, May 12 (YONHAP) -- The United States and North Korea held working-level talks in New York Thursday but a few issues were left dangling that make future prospects uncertain, sources here said after the contact. Gary Samore, director of nonproliferation at the State Department, and Kenneth Quinones, from the North Korea section at the Department, attended the one-hour mid-level contact with Han Song-yol, counselor for political affairs at the North Korean Mission to the United Nations, officials said. North Korea refused to say whether it has started changing the fuel rods at its 5-megawatt reactor or whether it will postpone the process, according to the officials. It instead urged the Americans to open the next round of North Korea-U.S. high-level dialogue so that this issue can be negotiated, they said. Postponement of the refueling is a condition for International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspection of North Korean nuclear facilities. The agency told Pyongyang earlier this week it would send an inspection team "on the assumption" that North Korea was deferring the changing of the rods. Officials here said the uncertainty over the nuclear reactor and the rods is making the IAEA uneasy about sending the inspection team. They said it remains unclear whether the agency will go ahead and send the team to Pyongyang this weekend or wait for an official reply from North Korea before deciding on the dispatch. "It's more correct to say that the situation right now has a lot of unclear issues than to say that it is uncertain," said one official. Although speculation has it that the North Korea-U.S. high-level dialogue will take place late this month, there is a chance the meeting may be put off until June.
