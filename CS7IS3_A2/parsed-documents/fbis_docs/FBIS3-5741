The global community regards Japan's huge trade surplus as "a problem" for the world, but resorting to steps like Super 301 is an "overreaction," Longuet said. Longuet made the remarks in his meeting with his Japanese counterpart Hiroshi Kumagai. France and other European countries are against trade policies accompanied by sanctions, Longuet said. "Such a step is unlikely to solve problems on a long-term basis." Kumagai said Japan will not leave unattended the soured economic ties with the United States following the breakdown of trade "framework" talks in February. Longuet called for global economic cooperation with Japan in such fields as automobiles, aircraft and energy. He also proposed Japan and other Asian countries step up cooperation for industrial development. Kumagai shared the view with the French trade minister, who arrived Tuesday for a visit lasting through Sunday.
