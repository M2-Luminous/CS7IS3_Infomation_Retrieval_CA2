Why? [Al-Ahmar] I believe that the brothers in the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] are responsible for the continuation of the crisis, especially over the document. Because after the signing, all officials were supposed to return to their work in Sanaa, whether in the Presidential Council, the Council of Ministers, or any other institution, so that all bodies could perform their official duties, and in order to implement the document. But regrettably, they began to flee from Amman. [Munsir] Would you call that a rebellion? [Al-Ahmar] Undoubtedly the position of some YSP leaders has been considered a rebellion since the crisis began. [passage omitted] [Munsir] Did your signing of the document mean the end of your reservations about it? [Al-Ahmar] The reservations still stand but it does not mean that we reject the document as a whole. We have reservations about some points in it until an understanding is reached on them. [Munsir] Can you specify some of these points? [Al-Ahmar] They are known to and understood by everyone. [passage omitted] [Munsir] Who is behind the military tension and clashes that took place in Abyan, Harf Sufyan, Shabwah, and Ma'rib? [Al-Ahmar] When there is a crisis or a dispute between two forces, two parties, or even two states or tribes, complications are bound to emerge, whether through someone's actions or as a result of psychological tensions leading to that. [Munsir] But it was noted that the clashes occurred after the document was signed and then escalated in an unprecedented manner. Do you believe forces opposed to the document were behind these military developments? [Al-Ahmar] That is not ruled out. I believe that that action was designed to abort the signing of the document. On that day it was said that the YSP had sent military reinforcements from Aden to Abyan, violating the decisions of the dialogue committee, the Presidential Council, and the House of Representatives and the military committee's instructions. [Munsir] The YSP persists in accusing what it terms the "influential military family in Sanaa" and influential forces or elements in the General People's Congress [GPC], and sometimes a third party -- apparently a reference to the Yemeni Reform Grouping [YRG] -- of being behind these attempts and explosions. What is your opinion? [Al-Ahmar] These accusations are absolutely untrue. The YSP represents half of the authority, and it is now demanding that others implement the document, even though its implementation requires a unified political will. [Munsir] The YSP moved a step ahead of you at the foreign level. Its leaders intensified their visits to most Arab states, especially in the Arabian Peninsula and the Gulf. It was said at the time that the YSP was occupying your traditional positions at the regional level. How do you view and what is your position on these visits? [Al-Ahmar] The visits the YSP paid to fraternal states, near and far, are illegitimate moves which prompted the people to see them as separatist moves aimed at separation. This is the people's interpretation and opinion. [passage omitted] [Munsir] YSP leaders have said that there is a "political Islam" scheme or a "fundamentalist scheme" obstructing the national democratic unionist plan. Some people interpret this as a clear reference to the YRG. What truth is there in reports of the existence of extremist fundamentalist elements in Yemen? [Al-Ahmar] I am surprised by the allegations of the YSP and those helping it to promote these lies. I am also surprised that the Egyptian brothers should listen to these lies and believe them, hence viewing us as they view Islamic groups in some Arab states. We in Yemen are a Muslim people. We do not have religious or ethnic minorities among us. Since the dawn of history Yemen has been ruled by the Islamic Shari'ah, which is dominant and the basis on which Yemeni cases are settled, including political, commercial, and other cases. Thus there is nothing to prompt the Yemeni people or any religious group or element to resort to violence in order to demand what Islamic parties in Egypt or elsewhere are demanding -- the application of the Shari'ah. [passage omitted] [Munsir] The YSP accused YRG militias of fighting alongside the al-'Amaliqah forces in the clashes that occurred in Abyan. What truth is there in these accusations? [Al-Ahmar] The YRG has no militias. It is a phrase they level at any cadres or elements capable of carrying weapons and defending themselves. YRG "cadres" in Abyan defended themselves with their own arms. [passage omitted] [Munsir] What have Arab mediations achieved so far with regard to achieving a solution to the crisis? [Al-Ahmar] We in the YRG reject any Arab, foreign, or even Yemeni mediation that proposes any initiatives or solutions outside what is mentioned in the Pledge and Accord Document. We are working to reinforce and safeguard unity. [passage omitted] [Munsir] There have been reports that delegations from hard-line movements, including the Muslim Brotherhood International Organization and the National Islamic Front led by Dr. Hasan al-Turabi, arrived in Sanaa recently, and that they met with YRG and GPC officials with a view to setting up an Islamic alliance in Sanaa to confront a "secular" south Yemen-Egyptian alliance. What truth is there in this? [Al-Ahmar] That is a lie and absolutely untrue. No delegations from Arab or non-Arab Islamic organizations have arrived in Yemen. If a delegation visits us, we do not receive it secretly, because we do not consider that a conspiracy or something to be ashamed of. We will warmly, publicly, and fraternally receive any Islamic delegation that visits us. It is an honor for us to be visited by an Islamic preacher from any Arab or Islamic state, because we in Yemen are a Muslim people. [passage omitted] [Munsir] There have been numerous reports of the existence of camps in Yemen to train terrorists, and a committee has been formed recently to investigate the matter. What truth is there in this, and what does it mean to you as an Islamic party? [Al-Ahmar] Before the committee comes back with its report, I say that that is untrue and merely a lie. There is nothing to prompt the Yemenis to resort to setting up camps to train people in the use of arms. All Yemenis carry and are trained in the use of arms, hence there is no need to set up secret camps. [passage omitted]
