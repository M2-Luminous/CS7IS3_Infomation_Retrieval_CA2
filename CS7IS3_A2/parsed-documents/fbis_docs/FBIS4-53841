The Central Committee of the Organisation of Workers of Mozambique in a statement on May 13 said the rash acts of the Japanese reactionaries against powerful socialist Korea and Chongnyon are ridiculous, indeed. Japan is stepping up its conversion into a military power and nuclear power behind the curtain of such insidious acts, the statement noted. It said the Japanese reactionaries must stop the suppression of Chongnyon at once and apologize to the Korean people. The French Committee for Recognizing the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in a letter of protest sent to the Japanese ambassador to France on May 10 branded the suppression of Chongnyon by the Japanese authorities as an intolerable violation of human rights and strongly urged a prompt stop to the suppression. On the same day, the Portugal-Korea Friendship Association in a letter of solidarity to Han Tok-su, chairman of the Central Standing Committee of Chongnyon, expressed full support to and solidarity with the Koreans in Japan in the struggle to defend Chongnyon. The Central Executive Committee of the National Railway Workers' Union of Japan published a statement on May 12 and the Saitama Women's Society for Supporting the Independent and Peaceful Reunification of Korea sent letters of request to the prime minister, the director general of the police agency and the Osaka prefectural police headquarters of Japan on April 29.
