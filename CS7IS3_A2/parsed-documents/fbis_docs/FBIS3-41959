Federal councillor Kaspar Villiger has ordered the legal division of his department to throw some light on the affair, indicated the DMF Thursday. The role played by police chief Peter Regli, in particular, will have to be cleared up. The Zurich canton police had discovered the uranium after receiving an anonymous telephone call. The caller said that he had deposited the merchandise at a freeway rest area in Kemptthal (Zurich), so that it could be disposed of in a competent manner. According to the DMF, the police were tipped off at the instigation of police chief Peter Regli, the deputy chief of the State Information Service. The police inquiry concerning the case itself is under way. At the same time, the chief of the DMF has instructed the legal division of the department to establish the role played by the GRS in the affair. The flow of information and the contacts between the caller and the deputy chief will be subjected to close scrutiny. GRS Informer The caller knew the police chief personally because he had done his military service with him in the air force. However, when interviewed by ATS, Daniel Eckmann, the spokesman for the DMF, said that the anonymous telephone call had come from a GRS informer. Supposedly, the man involved was an arms dealer living in Zurich. It is claimed that he asked for advice from police chief Regli, who had then suggested that the caller turn to the competent police body, maintained Mr. Eckmann. The uranium courier had then explained to him that his life had been threatened if he went to the police. For that reason, the police chief contacted the police himself so that the uranium could be brought into safety as quickly as possible. Evidently, stressed the DMF spokesman, a procedure of this kind is no everyday matter. It is not normal for the deputy chief of the State Information Service to be involved in such an operation involving the safe disposal of uranium. Transparent Explanation Kaspar Villiger wants to establish all the facts "which will make it possible to evaluate the political and legal aspects of the intervention in their entirety," quoted the statement issued by the DMF. Police chief Regli ought to "have a transparent explanation" for all the circumstances leading up to the uranium being brought to safety. The DMF will take account of these explanatory remarks accordingly. Peter Lehmann, the spokesman for the Public Ministry of the Confederation, confirmed an article in the German-language weekly "Cash," in which the person who supposedly deposited the uranium was an arms dealer living in Zurich. It is alleged that this dealer was arrested last 27 October at Zurich-Kloten airport. When interrogated by officials from the Public Ministry, it is claimed that he admitted having transported the merchandise from Eastern Europe to Zurich at the request of an unidentified contact so that it could be eliminated from the market. 25,000-Franc Fine It was thanks to an official from the police force of the Zurich canton that it had been possible to identify the arms dealer, following his recording of three anonymous telephone calls. The arms dealer could be charged with violating the federal law on atomic energy. Under Article 35 of the law he could be sentenced to pay a fine of up to 25,000 Swiss francs for the illicit trafficking of radioactive material. According to specialists at the Paul-Scherrer Institute, who were called to the scene when the discharge of radioactivity had been established, the level of uranium radiation had not been very high. It is alleged that it would only have posed a danger to human beings after exposure to it over a two-hour period at close quarters.
