Section 76.1302 is amended by revising the introductory paragraph and paragraphs (a), (r) and (s) to read as follows: ยง76.1302 Adjudicatory Proceedings Any video programming vendor or multichannel video programming distributor aggrieved by conduct that it alleges to constitute a violation of the regulations set forth in this subpart may commence an adjudicatory proceeding at the Commission. (a) Notice required. Any aggrieved video programming vendor or multichannel video programming distributor intending to file a complaint under this section must first notify the defendant multichannel video programming distributor that it intends to file a complaint with the Commission based on actions alleged to violate one or more of the provisions contained in ยง76.1301. The notice must be sufficiently detailed so that its recipient(s) can determine the specific nature of the potential complaint. The potential complainant must allow a minimum of ten (10) days for the potential defendant(s) to respond before filing a complaint with the Commission. (r) Statute of limitations. Any complaint filed pursuant to this paragraph must be filed within one year of the date on which one of the following events occurs: (1) The multichannel video programming distributor enters into a contract with a video programming vendor that a party alleges to violate one or more of the rules contained in this section; or (2) The multichannel video programming distributor offers to carry the video programming vendor's programming pursuant to terms that a party alleges to violate one or more of the rules contained in this section; or (3) A party has notified a multichannel video programming distributor that it intends to file a complaint with the Commission based on violations of one or more of the rules contained in this section. (s) Remedies for violations. (1) Remedies authorized. Upon completion of such adjudicatory proceeding, the Commission shall order appropriate remedies, including, if necessary, mandatory carriage of a video programming vendor's programming on defendant's video distribution system, or the establishment of prices, terms, and conditions for the carriage of a video programming vendor's programming. Such order shall set forth a timetable for compliance, and shall become effective upon release, unless any order of mandatory carriage would require the defendant multichannel video programming distributor to delete existing programming from its system to accommodate carriage of a video programming vendor's programming. In such instances, if the defendant seeks review of the staff or administrative law judge decision, the order for carriage of a video programming vendor's programming will not become effective unless and until the decision of the staff or administrative law judge is upheld by the Commission. If the Commission upholds the remedy ordered by the staff or administrative law judge in its entirety, the defendant will be required to carry the video programming vendor's programming for an additional period of time equal to the time elapsed between the staff or administrative law judge decision and the Commission's ruling, on the terms and conditions approved by the Commission. (2) Additional sanctions. The remedies provided in paragraph (s)(1) of this section are in addition to and not in lieu of the sanctions available under title V or any other provision of the Communications Act.
