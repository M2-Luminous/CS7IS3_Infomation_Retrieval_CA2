One of the most important manifestations of the internal struggle within the top echelons of power was President Yeltsin's 7 April 1994 edict relieving Russian Academy of Sciences Academician Anatoliy Kuntsevich of his post as chairman of the Russian president's Committee for Convention Problems of Chemical and Biological Weapons. The edict contained the following wording -- ``for a single gross breach of professional duty.'' The president's press secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov interpreted this as follows: ``The committee agreed to toxins being transported and stored in a major population center.'' However, it seems that, if this actually did occur, it was more of an excuse than the real reason. (Suffice it to say that Mr. Kuntsevich was ill at the time the edict was drafted). The story linking Anatoliy Kuntsevich's dismissal with a ``moral victory for the military-chemical dissident'' Vil Mirzayanov and company is even less plausible. Strangely enough, Lt. Gen. (Reserve) Kuntsevich does not seem to have suited certain structures within the Russian Defense Ministry. And they are not the only ones. Whatever you say about Anatoliy Kuntsevich, his status as a top-class professional and his undoubted international prestige gave him a many opportunities for candor. It is extremely likely that someone thought that the committee led by Kuntsevich was too ``extradepartmental.'' Your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA was told by a highly-placed official from this department, who asked to remain anonymous, that ``there are more than enough people who are unaware of the problem but who want to head up this organization. Many people are attracted by the chairmanship, which holds ministerial rank. Moreover, it will be easier for `competent' organizations to control such an incompetent person.'' Vaganov: The specific wording of the presidential edict regarding your dismissal is pretty surprising for an official of your rank. Do you have any comment to make? Kuntsevich: I would like to say right away that, in accordance with the old soldier's custom, I do not discuss orders from above. Vaganov: Fine. Could you tell us how much of a surprise this was to you? Kuntsevich: This situation can be regarded in different ways. I do not want to get personal. There is a Russian presidential edict which I am obliged to implement. But I must say on the whole that the problem of chemical disarmament concerns very important and extremely sensitive aspects of our state's activity. Naturally a whole range of opinions arise when these matters are being decided. How can they be resolved so as to accord with national interests above all? On the other hand we have to act so that Russia does not ``drop out'' of civilized forms of communication with other states. Vaganov: How did the Committee on Convention Problems begin its activity? Kuntsevich: The Convention on the Prohibition of Biological Weapons was formulated way back in 1972. The USSR subscribed to it in 1975. However, no legal documents were adopted at the time banning the development of offensive biological programs in the USSR. In February 1992 the Committee on Convention Problems of Chemical and Biological Weapons was set up under the Russian president, and 11 April that same year a Russian presidential edict appeared with the committee's direct participation aimed at ensuring Russia's fulfillment of international convention commitments in the sphere of biological weapons and banning the implementation in our country of any offensive biological programs. The committee was made responsible for supervising implementation of this edict's provisions. The matter was finalized in law. In my view, this was the committee's first major act, and it drew worldwide attention. It was then necessary to discover forms and means of working that would make it possible to remove mutual suspicion and anxiety between Russia, the United States, Britain, and other countries in the sphere of biological weapons. We proposed carrying out a series of inspections. This approach of ours was put into effect in September 1992 in a tripartite -- Russian-U.S.-British -- joint statement, which also made provision for the principle of carrying out mutual inspections. These inspections have gone ahead in 1993-1994. A joint group of U.S. and British experts and inspectors inspected four facilities in Russia. Russian specialists accordingly visited three installations in the United States and one in Britain. A real foundation developed for comparing our countries' scientific, technical, and industrial potential in this field with facts and figures in hand. Thus, we brought our relations to the point of possible quantitative juxtaposition and comparison. Today, a good working roundtable has formed at which any problems can be constructively discussed. Vaganov: And this is the moment when you, one of the people who set up this roundtable, are unexpectedly removed from the chairmanship of the Committee on Convention Problems. It looks as though there is a negative opinion of your work in this post. Kuntsevich: That has nothing to do with the committee's activity. I do not think that this decision was based on what you have said. The committee is not me alone. There are 57 people working on it today. By current standards that is a small collective, but it comprises eminent specialists. Perhaps that is my main achievement -- that I succeeded in finding people who are professionally aware of the full complexity and multifaceted nature of the problems and really have an idea of the possible ways of resolving them without harming Russia's national interests and security. Vaganov: What do you think are the main difficulties facing Russia in the sphere of chemical disarmament? Kuntsevich: The most challenging problem is the problem of what is to be done with the Convention on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons which Russia signed in January 1993. It concerns Russia's highest international and national interests. No matter how my opponents reproach me for rushing to sign this convention, I categorically disagree with that. The negotiating process began back in 1980 or even earlier. Moreover, as for the history of this problem, Russia came to the negotiating table back in... 1868. It was then that the first legal document in the field of chemical weapons appeared in St. Petersburg -- a declaration banning the use of poisoned bullets was signed. Vaganov: To return to today's events.... Kuntsevich: We are in effect talking about one thing today -- whether or not to ratify the convention. Vaganov: What do you predict? Kuntsevich: This is all pretty tricky. I spoke about it at the State Duma hearings 24 March this year. We have to square economic, financial, and technological potential with our commitments under this convention and determine the real priorities in disarmament. Russia's international political, moral, and ethical prestige is undoubtedly in the balance. From the time when the committee was formed I always said that, for Russia to be able to join this convention, it was essential to create powerful international support for it, bearing in mind our current difficult economic and financial situation. This international support must undoubtedly come under our intellectual, scientific and technical, and organizational leadership. I am talking not about obtaining some kind of financial or technological handout but about creating a committed pool of support for Russia's chemical weapons destruction program -- which is particularly important during the initial phase. In addition, previously my opponents tried via the mass media to present me as a rabid supporter of the military-chemical complex, dreaming of how to drag out the process of chemical disarmament and ridding Russia of the heavy military-chemical burden. However, to be fair I must say that of late my opponents have done a complete turnabout. They are now trying to persuade the public that Kuntsevich was allegedly in a hurry and impelled Russia to sign the Convention on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. I categorically refute that opinion and consider it unprofessional in every respect -- from both the state, the political, and the general human viewpoints. It is now being said that the committee chairman was developing pro-Western sentiments and upholding a Western line. But, pardon me for saying so, what strategic line should I have developed in the interests of my taxpayer? Would it really have been bad for the committee to try to obtain $6 billion in aid (and the preconditions for that did exist)? I can say that the preconditions are still there today for us to obtain almost $1 billion in foreign aid. Can that really be bad for Russia? Vaganov: So, someone in the top ranks of the Russian leadership has decided that it is bad.... Kuntsevich: I do not think that this decision came from the top. However, there are obviously politicians and various currents that are trying to play this card in their own interests. Vaganov: Now a very tough question: Where are the chemical weapons to be destroyed? Kuntsevich: We have to be realistic about this: There is not a single component of the Federation today that would voluntarily accept chemical munitions for destruction on its territory. And few would even allow them to be transported across their territory. So we must design a system whereby these weapons will be destroyed right in the areas where they are stored. National unity has to be secured on this: All the other components of the Federation must not simply be left as detached observers, especially since the timeframes for the safe storage of chemical weapons are ebbing away before our eyes. The regions must join forces with industrial and entrepreneurial structures and set up a system of funds. And corresponding concessions enshrined in legislation by the State Duma are needed in order for regions where chemical weapons destruction facilities are located to obtain the requisite investment. Vaganov: Following your dismissal, do you still have a real chance of influencing the destruction of chemical weapons? Kuntsevich: I am a chemist by profession. In the more specialized sense I am a specialist in the destruction of toxic substances. I began studying this in 1958 right after graduating from the Academy of Chemical Protection. I will most likely now return to the Russian Academy of Sciences, where before my committee appointment I was working mainly on the recycling of intermediate products and toxic substances and on the conversion of production facilities. In particular, I will do everything in my power to implement the idea of creating a system of funds to support the program for the destruction of chemical weapons. There are many people who are interested in this. But they want guarantees from the state, they want to be sure that they are involved not in a vain undertaking but in an important, promising job. And there are elements that they find very appealing. First, involvement in what is effectively a global project for the destruction of chemical weapons. In this connection -- and this is the second point -- the project has strong political ``protection.'' Any authority -- I mean any sensible authority -- will do its utmost to reinforce this political ``protection.'' Consequently, guarantees of stability -- political and state -- exist that will ultimately not only enable Russia to meet its international commitments under the convention but will also make it possible to rid Russian citizens and all mankind of the threat of one of the most insidious kinds of mass-destruction weapon.
