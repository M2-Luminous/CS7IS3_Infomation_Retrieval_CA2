This statement was issued by Mr. Michai Wirawaithaya, president of the association; Mr. Wirasit Titthitrai, deputy director for social affairs of the AIDS Project, Thai Red Cross; Mrs. Suraphi Wasinon from the Department of Public Welfare, and Dr. Usa Thitsayadon, an obstetrician at Chulalongkorn Hospital. Concerning the AIDS situation, Mr. Michai said that the number of people with AIDS continues to rise. In particular, the rate of infection among prostitutes and drug addicts is very high. And a very worrisome group is pregnant women, among whom the rate of infection has doubled since last year, increasing from 1 percent to almost 2 percent this year. Every year, about 2 million women become pregnant. Thus, about 20,000 pregnant women have AIDS. Almost 6,000 infants have been born with AIDS and died. About two-thirds of the children who survive, that is approximately 18,000 [as published], will become orphans because the mother will die of AIDS. The Department of Public Welfare cannot look after all these children who have lost their mothers, because the number of such children is double the number that the department is now looking after. [passage omitted] Mr. Michai said that the risk of contracting AIDS is 10 to 30 times greater for those who have a venereal disease, which includes syphilis, herpes, and chancroid. In particular, those people who have syphilis and who contract the AIDS virus usually die very quickly. The virus, which usually spreads to the brain slowly, will spread to the brain very rapidly. "AIDS will continue to spread as long as Thai men continue to have sexual relations with prostitutes. Today, there are about 600,000 to 800,000 people with the disease, or an average of approximately 700,000. This figure comes from the Ministry of Public Health." Mr. Wirasit talked about youths and housewives. He said that it is very difficult to control the spread of this disease in these groups. The average age of these people is between 20 and 29. In these two groups, the number of people with AIDS is increasing at a rate of 500 to 700 people a day. "Women are at great risk of contracting AIDS because they trust their husbands. Today, about 5 to 10 people a day are dying from AIDS. I obtained this figure from the Epidemiology Division, [reports on] military conscripts with AIDS, and hospital reports on pregnant women and children with AIDS." As for the number of people who have died from AIDS at various hospitals, particularly hospitals in northern provinces, about 1 to 2 people a day are dying at each of the hospitals. At present, the ratio of men to women with AIDS is about 2:1. Dr. Usa said that today, a large number of children have AIDS. This is clear from the fact that approximately 300 infants born at Chulalongkorn Hospital were born with AIDS. About one-third of these will die within 2 to 3 years. The rest will die by the age of 10. [passage omitted]
