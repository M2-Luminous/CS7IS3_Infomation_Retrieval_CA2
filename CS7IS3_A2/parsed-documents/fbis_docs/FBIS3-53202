He stressed that "no restrictions" are imposed on Jews in Syria and that they are treated like other Syrians. In an interview with AL-HAYAH, Hamra pointed out that since U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's visit to Damascus and his meeting with President Hafiz al-Asad, after which facilities for Syrian Jews were announced, "some 550 exit visas have been issued at the rate of 30 a day." He pointed out that 350 Jews have not received visas yet, and "I believe that their visas will be issued before the Syrian-U.S. summit, although most of those who have obtained exit visas will not leave the country." On the facilities offered to Syrian Jews after the recent al-Asad-Christopher meeting, Hamra said: "Actually there have never been restrictions on the Jews' travel in al-Asad's era. But it is to do with red tape, administrative matters, and bureaucracy. The president's instructions have led to speeding up matters in this connection." He added that in the past any Jew wishing to travel had to deposit a financial guarantee ranging between 10,000 and 15,000 Syrian pounds in the Central Bank, and entire families used to be banned from traveling. He stressed that there are now no restrictions, and instructions were issued by President al-Asad after his meeting with Rabbi Hamra in April 1992, lifting all the restrictions. "We can now obtain passports valid for six years and a one-year multiple exit visa without paying any financial guarantee." He added that in President al-Asad's era we have "enjoyed our dignity and freedom in trade, religion, and culture in every sense of the word." He pointed out that in April 1992 President al-Asad issued an amnesty for sentenced Jews and that "the past was dark for Jews." Rabbi Hamra pointed out that since the new instructions were issued most Jews have traveled abroad, especially to Brooklyn in the United States, and that some 1,250 Jews out of about 4,000 have stayed in the country. Most of them live in Damascus and in al-Amin Street (1,000 Jews). About 250 Jews live in Aleppo and al-Qamishli and enjoy religious freedom, as there are 22 synagogues in the Syrian capital, two in Aleppo, and one in al-Qamishli. He also said that some of the Jews who left the country have returned because they could not live abroad. "About 100 people and 10 families have returned, even though some of them stayed abroad for some 14 months," while some of the Jews who have been granted exit visas have not left the country. On his expectations for the Syrian-U.S. summit to be held in the middle of this month, the rabbi said in the interview, which was conducted at the "Jewish School" in al-Amin Street: "I hope all the exit visas will be issued before the meeting. I do not want this issue to be raised in it. I want the meeting to be devoted to issues more important than us." He added: "The time allocated to the meeting should be devoted to more important questions than this issue, because it is resolved." The rabbi stressed that the "Golan Heights are Syrian territory and must be returned to us as Syrians." He added: "I do not want the Jews issue to assume any political dimension. All I want is to defend the rights of my country (Syria) and the rights of the community." He expressed his hope that peace will be established in the Middle East Region after the Clinton-al-Asad meeting. "I hope that the results will be positive so that nothing will prevent any Israeli Jew from visiting Syria or any Syrian Jew from visiting Israel." He expressed his hope that there would be no "barriers" in the future, stressing that this can be achieved through "a comprehensive and just peace based on complete withdrawal from the occupied Syrian territory." Asked whether any Syrian Jew has gone to Israel, Rabbi Hamra said: "I do not believe that any of them has gone there. During my stay in New York I did not hear that any of them is there." However, he pointed out that the Syrian Jews present in Israel are emigrants who left at the beginning of the century. This emigration included Syrians of other religions, as about 40,000 Jews "went there before 1948." He pointed out that he will soon go to the United States to meet his children and wife who are there, to look after the affairs of the community there, and "to attend the engagement of my daughter, whose fiance I want to be Syrian, even though we are allowed to marry from others." He added that no U.S. rabbi understands Syrian Jews "like I do, because I have been with them since 1976," after succeeding former Rabbi Nasib Andibu [as transliterated].
