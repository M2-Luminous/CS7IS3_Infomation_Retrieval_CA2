Ossetia Counterintelligence Chief on Rule in N. Ossetia LD1705152394 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1436 GMT 17 May 94 LD1705152394 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [Text] Chief of the Federal Counterintelligence Service (FSK) Sergey Stepashin in an interview with Interfax on Tuesday said he was opposed to the imposition of federal rule in North Ossetia's Prigorodny Region, which is at the center of a dispute between the Ossetian and Ingush communities. He described special rule as a form of territorial claim. Stepashin said the misguided article six of the law rehabilitating the deported people which provides for territory changes had ignited the whole of the Northern Caucausus. While the introduction of special rule in Prigorodny Region could blow up the whole of Russia, he said. "We have already gone through this in Nagorno-Karabakh," he added. The FSK chief believes the parliament must ban any attempt to redraw borders and prevent all announcing of territorial claims. Pointing to what he called Chechnya's "visible and invisible" presence in any region of the Northern Caucausus, Stepashin said that Chechen leader Johar Dudayev stood to benefit from the conflict between Ossetia and Ingushetia whether maintaining the role of a potential peacemaker or directly involving itself in the conflict. Stepashin said his agency was capable of improving the situation in Chechnya itself by ensuring the safety of railway trains which come under attack there. One way of resolving the problem is to replace ordinary trains for armored ones accompanied by military escorts, he said. Stepashin said that different states including Turkey and the U.S. had begun to consider the region as an area of their vital interests over the years of regional instability. "Their intelligence services employ military and trade emissaries, professional agents and foreign nationals to carry out espionage in the region," he said. "The FSK is planning a series of operations to try to root out these practices," Stepashin said. He stressed that FSK activity in the Northern Caucausus would become part of government policies given the crisis situation there.
