Makarov, candidate of technical sciences] [Text] An aircraft with an acquisition radar for early warning of the appearance of airborne targets was used for the first time 50 years ago during World War II. This small U.S. aircraft, the TBM-3W Avenger, was based on aircraft carriers. A year later PB-1W land-based aircraft, developed on the basis of the B-17 Flying Fortress heavy bomber, began to be used in support of fleet combat operations. One and the same radar (later designated AN/APS-20), operating in the 10 cm waveband, was installed in both aircraft. In the 1950's several other radar early warning aircraft were created with different versions of that radar with a dish antenna and housed in a dome beneath the fuselage--Guardian, Skyraider, Gannet, EC-12 and Shackleton. They were intended for operations over the sea. One (the British Shackleton-AEW.2) was used right up until 1991. Subsequently, the capabilities of these aircraft were reduced considerably in connection with increased speeds of strike aircraft using low flight altitudes and with mass employment of aviation. Airborne radar early warning and control systems with pulse-Doppler radars capable of providing vast areas of surveillance of low-flying targets and performing functions as air control centers came to replace them during the 1960's-1970's. At the present time preference is given abroad to two types of radar early warning and control systems based on the E-2C Hawkeye and E-3 AWACS system aircraft. In recent years new ones -- P-3 AEW Sentinel and C-130 AEW with the radar used on the E-2C Hawkeye, and the Defender with Skymaster radar -- also have begun to arrive. In contrast to radar early warning aircraft of the 1940's and 1950's, they have more sophisticated radars which acquire airborne and surface targets at long ranges against a background of ground clutter, and high-capacity onboard data processing, display and exchange equipment. The latter permits successfully acquiring and automatically tracking a large number of targets and guiding friendly aircraft to them. In addition to radars, the makeup of radar early warning and control system equipment includes sets for ELINT collection and identification of nationality; communications and data exchange equipment; navigation, flight control and landing gear; various control consoles; a central computer; and data processors. Characteristics of radar early warning and control systems are given in the table.

Hawkeye aircraft, created in the United States in the early 1960's for deck-based naval aviation, have become widespread abroad. The first of them (E-2A and E-2B) subsequently were refitted as the more modern E-2C, which became operational in 1972. At the present time around 200 aircraft already have been produced. In the United States they are basically used by the Navy in the deck-based version with folding outboard wing panels. In other countries (Israel, Egypt, Japan, Singapore), they are employed from shore airfields. The U.S. Navy presently plans to stop purchasing new Hawkeye aircraft, but several other foreign states attracted by their relatively low cost are showing interest in them. Equipment was constantly upgraded in the process of Hawkeye radar early warning and control aircraft production. The radar underwent an especially significant modernization -- six versions were created. This was explained above all by the radar's poor noise rejection and limited capabilities for discriminating targets against the background of ground clutter (but not reflections from the sea). Work presently is being completed on the radar's latest modernization, which U.S. specialists believe will permit effectively using the E-2C even in the 21st century. The effective range of the radar and of equipment for identifying nationality will be increased by 40 percent, the number of targets tracked will increase fourfold (it was 250), and targets displayed on the screen of multifunctional control consoles will increase by 9.6 times. It is planned to upgrade the new radar (designated AN/APS-145) by use of high-speed digital processors with great capabilities, introduction of an automatic frequency change under the effect of interference, and use of three pulse repetition frequencies of emitted signals, increasing the effectiveness of tracking targets during flight operations over land. Installation of modern seven-color displays (the screen size rose from 25x25 cm to 27.5x27.5 cm) will enable displaying over 2,000 targets. A NAVSTAR satellite radionavigation receiver, which will increase accuracy of determining the aircraft's position, and improved equipment of the JTIDS joint tactical communications and information distribution system also are being introduced to the equipment makeup. Production of the E-2C Hawkeye with new onboard equipment is planned for 1993-1994, and modernization of the old ones is to be completed by 1998. One deficiency of the aforementioned aircraft is limited endurance. Proposals for equipping it with additional fuel tanks or an aerial refueling system have not been supported, since this precludes substitution of crew members for rest. They operate under difficult conditions of cramped space and high noise. Capabilities of the E-3 AWACS airborne early warning and control system aircraft, created in the United States to support command and control of air defense forces and assets over large territories, is considerably broader. It began to become operational in 1977, and 68 aircraft were produced in five different versions before its production stopped in 1991. Of these, the E-3B and C are used in the U.S. Air Force, the E-3A in the NATO Allied Air Defense System in Europe and Saudi Arabia, and the E-3D and E-3F in the UK and French air forces respectively. The E-3B and C radar early warning and control systems have a greater amount of communications equipment compared with the E-3A NATO-AWACS and E-3D and F. AN/APY-1 radars are installed in the E-3A (Saudi Arabia) and E-3B, and the more modern AN/APY-2 radars in the others. E-3A aircraft of the Saudi Arabian Air Force as well as the E-3D and F use new engines of the French firm of SNECMA and their power is approximately ten percent higher. Other differences are unimportant and consist, for example, of the installation of an aerial refueling system different from the U.S. system and, on the British version, use of an ELINT set of their own development housed in wingtip pods. E-3 AWACS systems are constantly being upgraded in the process of production. In particular, it is possible to note modernization of the AN/APY-1 radar as the AN/APY-2 version chiefly by introducing to it a supplementary operating mode against surface targets, and also an increase in central computer capabilities, which permitted increasing the number of targets being tracked automatically. In addition, expansion of the system equipment mix was provided for in advance. An increase in the number of multifunctional control consoles from 9 to 14 also should be included among the most important improvements. Since 1993 the AN/AYR-1 ELINT set has been installed in E-3A NATO-AWACS and E-3C aircraft. The latter will permit determining the type of radar or other electronic sets, their operating mode and their location by an analysis of signals being received. A high data processing rate supports identification of up to 100 targets in 10 seconds. A signal source and platform characteristics data bank stored in the central computer memory is used. The station weighs 860 kg and consists of 23 units. U.S. radar early warning and control aircraft and those belonging to NATO are to be outfitted with it during 1997-1998. France also is showing an interest in the set. It is also planned to outfit E-3 aircraft with NAVSTAR satellite radionavigation system receivers, upgraded JTIDS system data transmission equipment in the 2H modification, a more powerful central computer, and subsequently with MILSTAR space communications system gear. Much attention is being given to fulfilling the program for modernizing the radar of AWACS systems to improve its capabilities in acquiring low-signature targets. The set's effective range will almost double through improved signal processing quality (with the help of a new high-powered processor) and through a change in the structure of emitted signals with inclusion of a signal spectrum analyzer in the gear with a display located at the radar control console. It is proposed to complete modification of the radar under this program in the late 1990's, which in the opinion of U.S. specialists will permit successfully using E-3 AWACS radar early warning and control systems until 2010-2015. The E-3 aircraft is costly and operates from runways of great length, and so its purchase is accessible only to certain countries. The E-2C is approximately three times cheaper than the E-3, but has half the patrol time and worse radar characteristics. In view of this, in organizing zones of lengthy patrolling, it is necessary to activate at the very least two E-2C's in place of one E-3. Foreign specialists realize the requirement for the appearance of a radar early warning and control aircraft occupying an intermediate position in capabilities and cost between the E-3 and E-2C. In Great Britain, the Nimrod with AN/APY-920 radar could have become that aircraft, but after lengthy work and expenditure of considerable funds the country's Ministry of Defence in 1986 (already in the process of acceptance tests) was forced to give up further development and make the decision to purchase the U.S. E-3 Sentry. This was due to the fact that the radar (two antenna systems installed in the fuselage nose and tail to provide a circular scan) and data processing equipment did not meet demands being placed on them. In the 1980's, the U.S. firm Lockheed began to study versions of installing the E-2C Hawkeye aircraft system radar in its own medium-size aircraft intended for other missions. In 1981 a model of the C-130 military transport aircraft (reduced 10 times), with the fairing of this radar antenna located on a shortened tail fin, underwent wind-tunnel testing. A version of the airborne early warning and control system was created in 1984 on a P-3 Orion land-based patrol aircraft with the dome of the AN/APS-125 radar, rotating together with the antenna, accommodated on a pedestal above the fuselage (similar to the E-2C and E-3). In 1985 this aircraft with dome, but without radar gear, was demonstrated at an aerospace exhibition in France. After unsuccessful tests of the radar early warning and control system on the Nimrod-AEW.3, Lockheed suggested installing its radar on a C-130, which would permit a 40 percent increase in payload weight and a 25 percent increase in volume of space for the operations team (compared with the Nimrod). In 1988 development was completed on the radar early warning and control system with AN/APS-125 radar for the P-3 AEW aircraft (Fig. 1 [figure not reproduced]), given the company designation of Sentinel. It was handed over to the U.S. Customs Service, which decided to purchase four such aircraft for detecting aircraft and vessels of smugglers/drug suppliers over the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico. Three aircraft already have been transferred to this service and it is planned to deliver the fourth in late 1993. A more modern version of the Hawkeye radar early warning and control system radar, the AN/APS-138, is installed in all aircraft except the first, and standard P-3 Orion aircraft equipment is used. Software was developed by Lockheed. The work of refitting the P-3 Orion as a radar early warning and control version is valued at approximately $10 million, and on the whole it will cost the client almost $35 million. The EC-130 AEW aircraft (Fig. 2 [figure not reproduced]), with the newest version of the Hawkeye aircraft radar (AN/APS-145) and its other equipment, made the first test flight in 1991 and subsequently became operational with the U.S. Coast Guard. The P-3 AEW and EC-130 AEW have communications gear supporting transmission of data obtained with their help to air defense command and control centers; it is proposed to export them to other countries. Lockheed is undertaking to create new aircraft with the AN/APS-145 radar and Grumman is undertaking to refit the C-130, with installation of all E-2C Hawkeye aircraft gear. The new radar early warning and control systems using P-3 and C-130 aircraft cost approximately half that of the AWACS system E-3, but 1.5 times more than the E-2C Hawkeye. But expenses for their purchase and operation can be reduced by refitting aircraft which are in the order of battle and also using already deployed equipment and elements of the infrastructure for servicing them. At the present time 62 countries have C-130 transport aircraft and 9 have P-3 Orion land-based patrol aircraft in the inventory. Government circles of Japan and Australia were discussing questions of purchasing such radar early warning and control systems. Along with the radar early warning and control systems described above, proposals of firms are published periodically in the press for refitting G.222 and other aircraft for these purposes, but most often the essence of this work consists of creating inexpensive systems with limited capabilities accommodated in small aircraft. The Defender is the most well-known system of this type and already has found use. The BN-2B light passenger aircraft served as its basis (Fig. 3 [figure not reproduced]). Its cost is 2-5 times lower (depending on the equipment mix) than for the E-2C Hawkeye. The Skymaster radar antenna, providing a circular scan, is installed in a dome in the fuselage nose. This pulse-Doppler radar was developed based on the Searchwater radar being used on land-based patrol aircraft. The system makeup includes one or two multifunctional control consoles with color displays. The system's computer equipment is capable of supporting automatic tracking of up to 100 airborne and 32 surface targets. During 1987-1988 the Defender radar early warning and control aircraft was demonstrated at various exhibitions and offered for sale. The press reported that three systems were purchased for Great Britain in 1989. In the early 1990's the U.S. firm Westinghouse proposed to outfit radar early warning aircraft with a modified AN/APG-66 radar of the F-16 fighter with a new antenna (1.3x0.8 m) and infrared acquisition system for use by the U.S. National Guard and for sale to other countries. Various foreign firms have also proposed installing similar radars and other equipment in existing small aircraft, but there is presently no information about adoption of these proposals and purchase of such systems. For a long time the U.S. Air Force and Navy have been developing new-generation radar early warning and control systems which will use radars with large antennas in the form of phased arrays with fully electronic scanning of the surveillance zone space. These qualitatively new assets will permit detecting such low-signature targets as cruise missiles at great distances, but U.S. specialists believe they will appear in the inventory only during the next century. Simplified versions of similar systems--Erieye and Falcon--presently are being created in Sweden and Israel respectively, but it is not clear for now whether they will be able to compete with already existing models. At the same time, the most widespread systems installed in E-2C Hawkeye and E-3 AWACS aircraft already have demonstrated their high capabilities in the course of combat operations in the Arab-Israeli conflicts and in the Persian Gulf War. Thus, different versions of radar early warning and control systems have been created abroad differing in characteristics and cost. Thanks to good survivability and the capability of detecting low-flying targets, their role in supporting air defense will grow (especially on territories not having a ground radar network); and so one can expect them to spread throughout the world in the future.
