FR940916-1-00023 FR940916-1-00007 The ``soft'' conversion method is also known as ``exact mathematical conversion.'' It is used to obtain an exact change in measurement units only. The metric equivalent to an English unit is determined by multiplying by the appropriate conversion factor. It is then rounded off to the degree of precision reflected by the original English value. For example, a soft conversion of 55 miles per hour (mph) yields 89 kilometers per hour (km/hr). The ``hard'' metric conversion method is known as ``size substitution.'' Using this method, an English unit is replaced with an accepted metric standard size used for a particular purpose. Where possible, this method is used to convert an English unit to a metric unit that conforms to an internationally recognized standard. For example, a hard conversion of the 55 mph yields a speed of 90 km/hr. The ``dual'' system of measurement and weights is also known as ``adaptive conversion.'' It changes a magnitude in one system to a magnitude in another that is reasonably equivalent. This process should result in conversions to magnitudes that are meaningful and practical in application. Thus, an adaptive conversion of 55 mph equates to 89 km/hr. With the dual method, an equivalent English unit would be placed in parenthesis after the metric unit. The Coast Guard also is considering a fourth method of metric conversion called the ``hybrid'' method which combines both the hard and dual conversion methods. Using the hybrid method, all English units would be converted to metric using the hard conversion method. Additionally, an English unit of approximate equivalency, typically the English standard measurement, would be placed in parenthesis after the metric unit. When converting the regulations, existing English standards will be replaced with metric standards where possible. When industry consensus standards are used, the Coast Guard will attempt to incorporate by reference industry standards which use standard metric sizes that are equivalent to the original English standards. The Coast Guard also will encourage organizations that establish standards to convert English standards that are currently incorporated into Coast Guard regulations to metric. All conversions will be made so that the final values are within the original safe limits or constraints of the engineering equation. Conversions will be made so that vessels will not be required to meet a different set of standards or new requirements. Some statutes under which the Coast Guard operates contain measurements in English units. In such cases, the Coast Guard would apply a direct mathematical conversion so that use of the metric measurement would not change the statutory measurement. For example, 79 feet would be converted to 24.3 meters. This soft conversion method would also be implemented where adoption of the hard conversion method might cause a change in magnitude and inadvertently result in application of a different regulatory standard. The Coast Guard does not intend conversion to the metric system to result in the application of different compliance standards. Request for Comments The Coast Guard is interested in obtaining information on the impacts on commercial ship operators, shipyards, and marine suppliers of converting its regulations to metric units and dimensions. The Coast Guard is especially interested in the public's evaluation of the impacts of metric conversion on vessel design and personnel safety, and the economic feasibility of converting to the metric system for all segments of the marine industry. The Coast Guard requests additional information on costs, required retooling or replacement of equipment or materials, extra work requirements, current metric system usage, and the impact of metrication on small entities. The Coast Guard also requests comments on which system of metric conversion is most appropriate for the type of vessel and its trade, or any other appropriate considerations. The Coast Guard is concerned that conversion to the metric system using specific conversion methods may result in industry's converting without the necessary training for its personnel. To adequately address the issues and obtain additional information, the Coast Guard will hold a public meeting at the time and place indicated in this notice. Responses to the following questions would be particularly useful in developing a future notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). 1. In what areas, if any, do you currently use the metric system in your business? 2. What method of metric conversion would be most appropriate for your business (hard, soft, dual, or hybrid)? 3. Is it more important to have an exact mathematical conversion (soft) or a convenient unit of measurement (hard)? 4. What potential benefits do you see in using the metric system? 5. Would a conversion to the metric system require the replacement of any equipment or material currently in use? If so, what equipment or material would be replaced, would it be replaced by new equipment, and at what costs? 6. What is the estimated cost of dollars and hours for your company to convert to the metric system? 7. Would conversion to the metric system affect the cost of your day-to-day operations? If so, how much and why? 8. Would a conversion to the metric system present an extra burden of compliance hours? If so, what areas would be burdensome, and how many hours of extra work would you expect to result from a conversion to the metric system? 9. What section(s) of the Code of Federal Regulations do you use most frequently? Dated: September 12, 1994. J.C. Card, Rear Admiral, U.S. Coast Guard Chief, Office of Marine Safety, Security and Environmental Protection. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;23012 Filed 9&hyph;15&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;14&hyph;M
