Members of the abolished House of Representatives advised Abiola to submit to the upper house, the Senate, a cabinet list which should be "broad-based, reconciliatory and of national unity," the legislator, who requested anonymity, told AFP by telephone. The Senate, also dissolved last November when the regime of General Sani Abacha seized power, has issued a similar call to Abiola. Abiola has pledged to form his government by Sunday, the first anniversary of the poll, which was declared free and fair by international observers but annulled by then junta leader Ibrahim Babangida, who alleged irregularities. The millionaire Yoruba businessman has also promised to reconvene the Senate, to which he plans to submit his nominees as stipulated under the 1989 constitution, ratified by General Babangida's regime. After their second clandestine meeting in a week on Thursday, the ex-legislators issued a communique urging civilian state governors, who were also sacked by the military, to resume the mandate for which they were elected in 1991. They also called on the international community and governments to accord Abiola immediate recognition as soon as he is sworn in as president and commander-in- chief of the Armed Forces. The communique was signed by seven members representing different parts of the country. In spite of government warnings, Abiola has insisted on forming his government, challenging the military government to arrest him. The National Democratic Coalition (NADECO) a pro-democracy group which has been championing the cause of Abiola, has declared Saturday a national day of mourning for the "12 June martyrs", a reference to hundreds of Nigerians who died last year during protests against the annulment of the presidential election. To mark the day, NADECO has called on all Nigerians to wear black or white armbands or headbands, the group's national secretary, Ayo Opadokun, was quoted as saying in the press on Friday. Although the group said that it was not planning to overthrow the Abacha regime or organise a violent demonstration against it, the Campaign for Democracy (CD), a NADECO affiliate, has called for nationwide civil disobedience from Monday. During a "national week of action", the CD plans to organise street protests, set up barricades, start bonfires and organise rallies, all aimed at promoting "a popular national democratic government" to be headed by Abiola, a CD statement said. As a precautionary measure in the face of the mounting tension, three universities including the University of Ilorin in central Nigeria, were closed down Thursday by academic authorities, press reports said here Friday.
