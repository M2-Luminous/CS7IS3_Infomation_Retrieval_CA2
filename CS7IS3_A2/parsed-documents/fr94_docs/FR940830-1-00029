FR940830-1-00029 FR940830-1-00002 §124.311 8(a) competition. (a) *␣*␣* (3) For all types of contracts, the applicable competitive threshold amounts will be applied to the procuring agency estimate of the total value of the contract, including all options. * * * * * (d) Sole source above thresholds. *␣*␣* (1) SBA will not accept a construction requirement above the competitive threshold amount as a sole source 8(a) requirement. (2) For purposes of any requirement other than a construction requirement, SBA will accept a contract opportunity above the applicable competitive threshold as a sole source 8(a) requirement only if there are not two eligible offerors in the United States capable of performing the requirement at a fair price. * * * * * (f) Restricted competition. (1) *␣*␣* * * * * * (3) Construction competitions. Where a construction requirement offered to the 8(a) program exceeds the $3 million competitive threshold, SBA will determine, based on its knowledge of the 8(a) portfolio, whether the competition should be limited only to those Program Participants located within the geographical boundaries of one or more SBA district offices, an entire SBA regional office, or adjacent SBA regional offices. Only those Participants located within the appropriate geographical boundaries are eligible to submit offers. (4) Competition for all non-construction requirements. Except for construction requirements, all eligible Program Participants nationally may submit offers in response to solicitations for procurement requirements offered to the 8(a) program that exceed the applicable competitive threshold. (g) Award to firms whose program terms have expired. A concern that has completed its term of participation in the 8(a) program, as set forth in §124.110, may be awarded a competitive 8(a) contract if it was a Program Participant eligible for award of the contract on the date specified for receipt of offers contained in the contract solicitation. (1) For a negotiated procurement, so long as a Program Participant is eligible as of the date specified for the receipt of offers in the solicitation, its program term may expire after that date without affecting the concern's eligibility to submit revised offers, including a best and final offer, and receive a competitive award. (2) Eligibility is determined as of the initial date specified for the receipt of offers set forth in the solicitation without regard to extensions of time through amendments to the solicitation. (3) This provision applies equally to all 8(a) procurement requirements, including construction requirements. (4) An 8(a) procurement requirement for architect-engineer services, in an amount less than the competitive threshold set forth in §124.311(a), that uses the evaluation procedures prescribed by subpart 36.6 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation will not be considered a competitive 8(a) requirement under this section for which a firm whose program term has expired may be eligible. 43. Section 124.311 would be further amended by removing the phrase ``business support level and'' in newly redesignated paragraph (e)(4), by adding the word ``and'' after the semi-colon (``;'') in newly redesignated paragraph (e)(5)(iii), by removing newly redesignated paragraph (e)(5)(iv) in its entirety, by redesignating paragraph (e)(5)(v) as paragraph (e)(5)(iv), and by revising newly redesignated paragraph (e)(5)(iv) to read as follows: §124.311 8(a) competition. * * * * * (e) *␣*␣* (5) *␣*␣* * * * * * (iv) If the firm is in the transitional stage of program participation, whether it has achieved its competitive business mix targets under §124.312, or is in compliance with a remedial plan that does not include the denial of future 8(a) contracts. §124.312 [Amended] 44. Section 124.312 would be amended by removing paragraphs (b)(4), (b)(5), and (b)(6) and by redesignating paragraph (b)(7) as paragraph (b)(4). 45. Section 124.312 would be further amended by removing paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(3), and (c)(9) and by redesignating paragraphs (c)(4), (c)(5), (c)(6), (c)(7), (c)(8), (c)(10), (c)(11), and (c)(12) as paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(3), (c)(4), (c)(5), (c)(6), (c)(7), (c)(8), and (c)(9), respectively. 46. Section 124.317 would be amended by revising paragraph (b)(3), and by adding a sentence at the end of paragraph (c) to read as follows: §124.317 Performance of contracts by original 8(a) concern. * * * * * (b) *␣*␣* (3) The individuals upon whom eligibility was based are no longer able to exercise control of the concern due to physical or mental incapacity or death; and * * * * *
