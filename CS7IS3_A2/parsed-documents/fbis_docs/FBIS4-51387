Statistics show that in 1993, over 525,000 workers came into contact with poisonous material leaks in more than 13,400 factories and enterprises in the city. According to a 1993 survey, nearly 2000 people have contracted with diseases caused by their work each year, an annual incidence rate of 1.3 percent. The new rules require new projects to meet hygienic standards set by the state. It also emphasizes the prevention measures. The regulations define the responsibilities which relevant departments should assume, such as diagnosis of and supervision over occupational diseases. Problems still exist in the city's 1,500 foreign-funded enterprises. Some companies have introduced production equipment but not the corresponding safety facilities to prevent poisons in workshops from doing serious harm to workers' health. Some foreign businessmen, under the guise of maintaining company security, do not disclose the chemical compositions of prescriptions which contain harmful materials. Several materials which have been banned or replaced by substitutes abroad are still used in some Chinese joint ventures.
