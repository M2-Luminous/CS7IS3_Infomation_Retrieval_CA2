Broad money, which includes currency in circulation, demand deposits, time and savings deposits and foreign currency deposits, expanded at a rate of 13 per cent in December 1993, but eased off to 8.5 per cent in January of this year and further decelerated to 7.5 per cent in February. The NBC Economic and Monetary Statistics Review for February 1994, made available recently to The Cambodia Times, comments that this trend "augurs well for containing inflation". Indeed, it records that the trend in the rate of inflation itself continues to be encouraging, noting that consumer prices marked only a marginal rise of 0.88 per cent in February. The report reveals that February's rise would have been lower if not for the jump in energy prices. It cautions that "such a subdued trend in prices has to be sustained over the months, if inflation for the year 1994 as a whole, is to be contained within the 10 per cent level". That, in turn, would require maintaining a disciplined monetary policy. The financial operations of the public sector and the lending operations of the banking system as well as the kingdom's balance of payments status and the parcelling out of significant aid pledges would affect such policy. Currently, the NBC notes that "the share of currency in circulation in broad money has declined significantly from over 58 per cent in December 1993 to about 45 per cent in February 1994". It further records that "such expansion in broad money as has taken place is wholly attributable to growth in quasi-money, mainly foreign currency deposits with banks". Quasi-money refers to time, savings and foreign currency deposits. However, the public sector's financial operations have yet to determine a contractionary impact on money supply, with government deposits at 47.5 billion riels for February 1994 while the banking system has net claims of 170.5 billion riels during the same period.
