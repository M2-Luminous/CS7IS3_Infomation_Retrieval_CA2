Police seized just over 50 kg of hashish in Ristiina and Porvoo about a year ago in connection with the same case. The biggest quantity of smuggled drugs totaled 60 kg hashish. Six shipments of 3 kg had previously been smuggled into the country. The court found the two chief defendants guilty of seven serious narcotics offenses. Three other defendants were also given long prison sentences. The stiffest sentence--unconditional imprisonment for seven and a half years--was given to 51-year-old Onni Polvi. He had been living in Belgium and had arranged drug purchases in the Netherlands. He also transported some of the hashish to Finland in his automobile. According to him, the largest drug shipment had been transported in a Dutch long-distance truck. The trial took a long time because of the Belgian extradition procedure. Polvi was arrested in Belgium back in April [1993], but could not be brought to trial in Finland until January. Polvi's companion, Rauno Latvala, 48, was given a seven-year unconditional prison sentence. Just over 40 kg of hashish were seized in his car repair shop in Ristiina in February 1993. Latvala had also organized the distribution of the drug in Finland. He was helped by his daughter and her husband. The court sentenced 36-year-old Rudolf Rennock to six years in prison and 29-year-old Nina Rennock to four years in prison. Both of them had sold hashish, mainly in the area around the capital. The same case resulted in a five-and-a-half-year prison sentence for Ari Muukkonen and a three-year prison sentence for Tulan Suzan Josepoff. The court postponed its decision in the case of the other five defendants.
