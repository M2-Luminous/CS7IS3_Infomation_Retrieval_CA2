Since the Congressional Investigating Committee that was looking into irregular handling of the budget ended its work and the constitutional reform became the most important congressional activity, PT congressmen have been disputing with the PT national board that last year forbade the PT bloc to participate in the reform. Deputy Paulo Delgado (MG) [Minas Gerais] said: "We represent the party and the people. To believe that our mandate is only granted by the party is a way of going against the will of the voters." Some of the PT congressmen interested in participating in the revision suspect that the national board's prohibition, which is strongly influenced by the radical faction, disguises interests about the October elections. According to this suspicion, if the PT's moderate faction did not participate in the reform, they would lose votes among voters who do not belong to the PT. The prohibition, however, would not affect their rivals, who are habitually elected with the support of the orthodox groups. A manifesto against the board's decision was drafted by 19 of the 37 PT congressmen last week. The rebellious congressmen evaluated the possibility of breaking with the party leadership, but Deputy Jose Fortunatti (RS) [Rio Grande do Sul] who leads the PT bloc prevented this from happening. After two weeks of negotiations, Fortunatti convinced the PT leaders on 8 February to allow the congressmen to participate, at least, in the session in which the Social Emergency Fund (FSE) had to be approved. A meeting has been scheduled for 17 February. The PT moderate faction hopes that during this meeting the bloc will be definitively authorized to participate in the reform. One of the objectives of the radical PT members seems to be to isolate Dep. Delgado and three other deputies: Jose Genoino (SP) [Sao Paulo], Eduardo Jorge (SP), and Joao Paulo (MG). These four deputies comprise the faction that is firmly engaged in negotiating PT alliances with several other parties for the October elections. The radical faction tried to prove that the moderate faction was opposing the party's code of ethics, but they could not. Genoino refuted: "We have given the leadership a possibility of overcoming the situation. By preaching a thorough boycott of the reform, the PT leadership started a war without solution." The moderate faction congressmen believe that if they had been allowed to participate in the reform from the beginning, they would have been able to ensure decisive support for their proposals in the plenary sessions. Genoino added: "We were so late in joining the battle that we handed the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party and the Brazilian Social Democracy Party to the Liberal Front Party and the Progressive Renewal Party on a platter." Some of the issues being debated in relation to the FSE, such as the article that ensured allocation of funds to education, were of interest to the PT. When the party decided to take an active part in the session in which the FSE was voted on, there was little to do because negotiations among parties had already concluded. "We were losing the game 10-1 and there was no more time to make a goal," Fortunatti said.
