Niyazov pointed out that Turkmenia [Turkmenistan] will cooperate with Russia on an equal basis whatever the power in Moscow. In his opinion, Turkmenia should select five or six states for having close relations with them. According to Niyazov, all states neighboring Turkmenia can be chosen. Niyazov expressed surprise that Western countries continue to accuse Turkmenia of violating human rights and democracy. He said that there is not a single political prisoner in the Republic and anybody can organize a party "with its regulations, program, supporters and which acts within the framework of the Constitution and the law." "We are building an open society in which all human rights will be respected. Everybody can express his/her opinion, but when a majority takes a decision, a minority should follow," Niyazov said.
