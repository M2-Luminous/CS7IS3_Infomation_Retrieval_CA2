FR940414-0-00076 FR940414-0-00028 §285.26 Size classes. Straight fork length will be the sole criterion for determining the size class of Atlantic bluefin tuna. For any Atlantic bluefin tuna found with the head removed, it is deemed, for purposes of this subpart, that the tuna, when caught, fell into a size class in accordance with the following formula: Total straight fork length equals pectoral fin straight fork length multiplied by a factor of 1.35. For this purpose, all measurements must be taken in a straight line along the middle of the lateral surface from a line perpendicular to the dorsal insertion of the pectoral fin of the beheaded fish to a line perpendicular to the fork of the tail (PF, see Figure 1). The pectoral fin straight fork length will be the sole criterion for determining the size class of a beheaded Atlantic bluefin tuna. Total straight fork length will be the sole criterion for determining the size class of whole (head on) Atlantic bluefin tuna. Atlantic bluefin tuna are deemed to fall into a size class according to the following table; approximate round weights are given for illustrative purposes only. * * * * * 7. Section 285.29 is amended by revising paragraphs (a) and (b)(1) to read as follows: §285.29 Dealer recordkeeping and reporting. * * * * * (a) Must submit to the Regional Director via both electronic facsimile (FAX) and the existing postal system a daily report on a reporting card provided by NMFS, within 24 hours of the purchase or receipt of each Atlantic bluefin tuna from the person or vessel that harvested the fish. A FAX of said card must be received at the NMFS NE Regional Office (FAX 508&hyph;281&hyph;9135) within 24 hours of the purchase or receipt of each Atlantic bluefin tuna. Additionally, said card must be postmarked and mailed at the dealer's expense within 24 hours of the purchase or receipt of each Atlantic bluefin tuna. Each reporting card must be signed by the vessel permit holder or vessel operator to verify the name of the vessel that landed the fish and must show the Atlantic bluefin tuna vessel permit number, metal tag number affixed to the fish by the dealer or assigned by an authorized officer, the date landed, the port where landed, the round and/or dressed weight (indicating which weight(s) measured), the total or pectoral fin straight and/or curved fork length (indicating which length(s) measured), gear used, and area where the fish was caught. (b) *␣*␣* (1) Said report must be postmarked and mailed at the dealer's expense within 10 days after the end of each 2-week reporting period in which Atlantic bluefin tuna were purchased, received, or imported. The biweekly reporting periods are defined as the first day to the fourteenth day of each month and the fifteenth day to the last day of the month. Each report must specify accurately and completely for each tuna purchased: Date of landing or import; vessel Atlantic Bluefin Tuna permit number (if appropriate); metal tail tag number; weight in pounds or kilograms (specify if round or dressed); nature of the sale (dockside or consignment); price per pound or kilogram (round or dressed weight); and destination of the fish (domestic or export). In addition, dealers may indicate the quality rating of their bluefin tuna: (A, B, or C) for four attributes (freshness, fat, color, and shape). * * * * * 8. Section 285.31 is amended by removing paragraph (c) and by revising paragraphs (a)(28), (a)(30), and (a)(37) to read as follows: §285.31 Prohibitions.
