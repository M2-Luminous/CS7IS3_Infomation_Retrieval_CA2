The meeting drew attention because it came in the wake of "the meeting on election security" held in Batman to discuss local elections in the southeast. The PUK leader had met PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] leader Abdullah Ocalan during his recent visit to Damascus. The Talabani-Ilter meeting, which was confirmed by PUK officials in Ankara, took place a week ago. The meeting was preceded by a "summit on election security" held in Batman on 4 March with the participation of Interior Minister Nahit Mentese; Unal Erkan, governor of the state of emergency region; Mehmet Agar, general director of the Security; MIT [National Intelligence Organization] undersecretary Sonmez Koksal,; Aydin Ilter, commander of the Gendarmerie Forces; and many provincial governors and heads of security departments. The summit made a number of decisions in connection with the local elections. PUK leader Talabani held a meeting with PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan during his visit to Damascus last week made to express condolences on the death of President Hafiz al-Asad's son. It is not known what issues were discussed during the meeting in Silopi. One view is that on the eve of the local elections, Turkey conveyed its requests to the northern Iraqi leaders on various issues, primarily regarding border security. Another view is that "Talabani is continuing to act as a mediator between Apo [Abdullah Ocalan] and the Turkish Government. Talabani briefed the soldiers about his impressions of his Damascus visit." There are reports that the PUK leader, who is at present is in northern Iraq, will leave for France in the next few days. Dizai: I Do Not Know What Was Discussed After reminding PUK's Ankara representative Sefin Dizai about the Batman summit on security during the elections, we asked if the Turkish government had made any requests regarding the local elections. Dizai replied: "No. The elections are Turkey's internal problem. I hope that the people in the region will be calm during the elections and that there will be no violence; I advise them to do so." Upon being reminded of the PKK's decision to boycott the elections and the Turkish government's uneasiness over the situation in northern Iraq and the PKK presence there, Dizai said: " We have a responsibility to defend the security of the borders and the region. Our fulfilling this responsibility will not depend on the PKK or any other organization. This issue is completely separate from the elections." Asked if Talabani was representing the northern Iraqi administration at the meeting with Ilter, Dizai said: " No. I think Talabani represented his own party. I have no information on the subjects discussed during the meeting, but border security might have been discussed."
