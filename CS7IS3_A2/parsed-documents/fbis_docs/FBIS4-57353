[Alvarez] Several special circumstances favored this growth. The Argentine bipartisan system has been suffering a slow process of crisis, which is not too visible when there are few alternatives, but which is obvious with the appearance of options that allow people to change their party loyalty and seek credibility elsewhere. I think a combination of factors fueled our rapid growth. [Nole] How did the movement start? [Alvarez] We bolted the Justicialist Party in 1990. On that occasion eight of us, all deputies, split following the pardon [of some military officers involved in the military dictatorship] and because the Justicialist Party became clearly conservative and accepted without criticism an Argentine liberal recipe. In 1991, we participated in the congressional election and obtained 3 percent of the votes. In 1992, Fernando "Pino" Solana ran for a seat in the Senate representing the capital and obtained 7.5 percent of the vote. On 3 October [1993] we ran as the FG for the first time. The FG is an alliance between the Front of the South and the Front for Democracy and Social Justice. We obtained 14 percent in the capital. That was excellent. We did a good job in the Chamber of Deputies where we worked hard against corruption. Then Raul Alfonsin and Carlos Menem signed the Olivos Pact [to reform the Constitution] which created an important vacuum. Many people saw the pact as a leadership arrangement, an ethical surrender, and as a deal leaving the government without opposition. We have profited the most from that political vacuum. [Nole] Do you think your movement can continue to grow if the alliances you are negotiating with other parties succeed? [Alvarez] One of the lessons of this election is that the number of people who will vote for a party regardless of what their leaders do is decreasing. I cannot say we will maintain our electoral strength no matter what we do. Neither can I affirm, as some people say, that our votes were borrowed and will return to their parties in the presidential election. All of this will depend on how we perform in the future. We are the third strongest political force in Argentina. First we must fulfill another requirement. We must create a firmer institutional base to prevent the front from appearing as a sum of other parties' leftovers. We face the challenge of creating a project for 1995 based on a clear program. This project must be clearly feasible from an economic and social perspective. This country tends to reject the left, even though it is a democratic left. The word leftist has a damned connotation. We are building a center-left project with the purpose of going beyond [Economy Minister Domingo] Cavallo's plan, which is what is sustaining this administration's credibility. [Nole] Do you think you can challenge Carlos Menem's reelection if you are successful with your alliances? [Alvarez] If we can organize ourselves well in the provinces we will be able to challenge Menem as a third option. I am not singing victory. I am very careful with my evaluations. We have a very serious responsibility. In sum, I do not know how far or close we are from competing for the presidency. We must be prepared because society is already requiring that we behave as if we were a serious possibility of becoming government in Argentina. In the street, people tell me: "Chacho, do not disappoint us," and; "People believe in you." An important part of society believes in us. [Nole] Can we talk of the resurgence of the leftist vote? [Alvarez] No. There is a need for a new progressive force. I think these 10 years of democracy can be divided in two stages. First there was great expectation with the Radical Civic Union [UCR] progressive project, which advanced in some aspects like the democratization of society, but which ended up failing at the social and economic levels. This stage was followed by Carlos Menem and his entirely conservative project. We may inherit that group of people who were disappointed by Raul Alfonsin's administration. This is why I believe we must strengthen the center-left identity. Today the UCR is again speaking through its most conservative spokesmen. [Nole] Historic Peronism also seems to have disappeared. [Alvarez] We should no longer talk about Peronism. We must talk about how the center-left identity can revitalize parts of the Peronist identity which are still very important for humble people. Issues such as social justice, human rights, income redistribution, people's participation, and a more integrated society are very important for them. There is much to rescue. We must redefine or bring back issues that are very strong in the Peronist tradition and which marked the memory of Peronists. [Nole] If the FG gains the presidency, would you revise the economic transformation being implemented by Menem? [Alvarez] Aside from abuses, the so-called irregularities, I believe it is very difficult to propose a way back in the Argentine society. I believe it would be very harmful to revise past events. To go back would be tantamount to reinstating a State that did not serve the people. Liberalism won the battle in Argentina because the State had been seized by the most powerful economic groups, involving a patronage-oriented, subsidy-oriented State. The State was a disgrace for the people. Public services were a disgrace. A Telephone company worker who collected a bribe to repair the phone was a disgrace. This was also the case with the gas, electricity, and water company workers. In other words, the recent image was that of a State that had turned its back on society's interests. To suggest a revision is tantamount to playing along with Menem and to making the people believe the idea of reinstating an inefficient State, a State entirely opposed to common good. We must build a new State because Menem has left us without a State. No one controls anything here. No one controls our food, medicines, beverages, or services. [Nole] In your opinion, how should the state have been revamped? [Alvarez] First, a debate deprived of so much ideology should have been conducted because market fundamentalists have been involved here, saying all public enterprises are bad and all private enterprises are good. Of course, a mixed system might have been proposed for some enterprises while this was not possible for others. I do not believe all public or state enterprises are necessarily bad. [Nole] Yet yo believe the State may become involved in activities that are not proper of a State like producing manufacturing objects or elements? [Alvarez] No. I do not believe in a State that is a proprietor. I do not believe in it because it is too utopian for Argentina today. We want a State at the service of the people, a State that will establish rules and a plan, keeping pace with the economy. [Nole] Should I assume therefore that you have an entirely critical opinion of the convertibility plan? [Alvarez] From a social viewpoint, the stability programs like the one implemented in our country are highly retrogressive. Instead of discussing convertibility, I believe it is necessary to strengthen stability, enabling us to discuss the type of country that is being planned. We want to begin this discussion with stability, even though this stability has a retrogressive bias. It is necessary for stability, like democracy, become an integral part of the conscience of Argentines and to discuss projects on this basis. [Nole] Another issue. Various problems have arisen within Mercosur [Common Market of the South]. What is more advantageous for Argentina; regional integration or NAFTA? [Alvarez] In a choice between Mercosur and NAFTA, I believe our country must firmly choose Mercosur because we would be entirely engulfed by the U.S. market if we choose NAFTA. The United States has great possibilities for exporting and we will have nothing to sell to the United States, Canada, or Mexico. We must firmly commit ourselves to the Mercosur. Mercosur must integrate the most significant economic circles with small- and medium-size enterprises. We must jointly review the competitive and distributive advantages and Argentina must correct its significant trade imbalance with Brazil. In a nutshell, I see a great future for Mercosur. Furthermore, I believe the bloc's integration is inexorable because there can be no economic solution unless we project our industry and commerce on a large scale and integrated into regional blocs. The best way to protect the domestic market is not by subsidizing enterprises for this domestic market but by assisting and fostering industries that might successfully compete abroad. [Nole] In conclusion, did you use the experience of the Uruguayan Broad Front [FA] as an example when you formed the FG? [Alvarez] No. We have always respected and recognized it. We were greatly encouraged by the Uruguayan experience because in your country there was also a marked bipartisan system. The FA was established in 1970. It endures, it has been able to withstand time, and it could achieve a majority in your country. The FA won the Montevideo mayoralty and has a good rating on the polls to contend for running the government. In this regard, we have always viewed the FA with great recognition and it is very encouraging to see how this party has been able to keep up and grow. I believe countries develop a progressive democratic alternative in keeping with the characteristics and beliefs of societies.
