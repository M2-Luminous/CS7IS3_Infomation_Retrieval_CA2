FBIS4-52005 "dreas087_d_94001" FBIS-EAS-94-087 Daily Report 4 May 1994 South Korea IAEA Head Sends `Urgent' Telegram to DPRK IAEA Head Sends `Urgent' Telegram to DPRK SK0405235794 Seoul KBS-1 Radio Network in Korean 2300 GMT 4 May 94 SK0405235794 Seoul KBS-1 Radio Network Korean BFN [Cha Man-sun Reports from Vienna] [Text] On 3 May, Hans Blix, secretary general of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], has sent an urgent telegram to North Korean Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam in an attempt to make a breakthrough in the issue of witnessing the changing of fuel rods at North Korea's nuclear reactor in Yonbyon. In the telegram, he emphasized that the IAEA would send its inspectors if North Korea accepts the demands set forth by the IAEA, and pointed out that the changing of nuclear fuel rods without witnesses may lead to a serious situation under which the transparency of North Korea's nuclear development cannot be guaranteed. It was reported that Secretary General Hans Blix may have stressed that the IAEA would be compelled to report to the UN Security Council of its inability to confirm whether nuclear materials are being diverted in the event that the nuclear fuel rods are changed without the presence of inspectors. Considering that all previous communications have been made through a working-level channel, the IAEA secretary general's urgent telegram is taken to be a very unusual step that hints of an acute situation and that can be interpreted as an ultimatum regarding the changing of nuclear fuel rods. This step was taken as the situation turned more serious as North Korea recently reiterated its position to go ahead with the changing of its nuclear fuel rods in a statement released by the North Korean Foreign Ministry.
