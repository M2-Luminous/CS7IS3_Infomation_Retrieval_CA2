The President Is Concerned About the Right to Information, the Premier About the Newspapers' Survival"] [Text] The start of the year has been marked by two events for the mass media. The strike by leading Russian newspapers seems to have been averted. Journalists had been about to venture upon this as a forced measure to protest against the increased cost of printing brought about by the revaluation of industry's fixed capital. Presidential edicts have been issued "On Additional Guarantees of the Right of Citizens to Information" and "On the Judicial Chamber for Information Disputes Under the Russian Federation President.". It is impossible not to perceive a certain logic in the fact that these events coincided. Albeit a paradoxical logic. It is difficult to make any objection to the revaluation of fixed capital. It has been brought about by the objective need to bring its value into line with the ruble's desiccated weight category. There has long been talk of this, so the government's decision just cannot be called unexpected. There was more than enough time to reflect on all its consequences. It was not hard to foresee that the revaluation of fixed capital would prove ruinous to those production processes whose output is paid for by the consumer a long time in advance -- subscriptions to newspapers and journals represent just such a form of payment. Consequently, if we do not wish to be deprived of the press, we must be forearmed: We must provide for tax breaks for periodicals and subsidies for subscribers, allocating for the purpose some portion (not even a very considerable portion!) of the increase that the treasury will receive as a result of the growth in the capital's value and, thus, the tax on that value. Nothing of the kind was done, and things turned out once again as in the proverb: The peasant only bothers to make the sign of the cross when he hears thunder. It seemed that a compromise solution had been found at last Thursday's meeting between the chief editors of leading newspapers and Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin. A promise was made to think about how to ease the tax burden for the press, about the participation of journalists in the flotation of shares in printing plants, and about other demands made. In the television report on the meeting certain editors were even heard to say that this was almost the start of a new epoch in relations between the press and the power. But such optimism seems somewhat premature. It probably goes without saying that in planning to strike, journalists were thinking above all not of themselves but of the readers -- of the very right of citizens to information which is the subject of the presidential edict. If the powers that be strengthen juridical guarantees of that right with one hand while undermining economic guarantees with the other, this clearly attests to a lack of coordination in their actions. The path of free speech is of itself thorny and steep, but must each step along it really demand that press people have to resort to extreme measures and superhuman effort? The ink had not had time to dry on the president's signature on the Edict on Information Guarantees before journalists started saying that the edict was unlikely to work. Quite frankly, there are serious grounds for this skepticism. The legal norms proclaimed in the edict conform to the most modern world standards. State organs, organizations, enterprises, public associations, and officials must conduct their activity on the principles of information openness. As the edict explains, this means that any information which is of public interest or which affects citizens' personal interests must be accessible to them. The state is obliged systematically to inform you and me about decisions proposed or adopted, and we have the right to monitor these decisions if, as the edict states, they entail "compliance with or protection and defense of citizens' rights and legitimate interests." In order for even the very best legal norm to be implemented, a mechanism is needed for its execution, but the edict does not contain this. Let us hope that it will appear in the law on the right to information, which the same edict entrusts the Legislative Proposals Commission with drawing up. While this law is being created, there is a perfectly real danger that the edict could be utilized by no means beneficially. Who will decide which information "is of public interest" and consequently must be generally accessible? Who is authorized to indicate which decisions entail "compliance with citizens' rights and legitimate interests" and which do not? Without a clear-cut legal answer to these questions, such powers will undoubtedly be appropriated by a state official, i.e. by the person who possesses the information. Having appropriated them, he will use them in his own interests. You and I will never learn what he categorizes as being of no public significance.... It seems to me that the existing Law on the Mass Media contains a far more sensible legal norm (Article 40): "It is possible to withhold requested information only if it contains information which constitutes a state, commercial, or other secret specially protected by law." The Law on the Mass Media also provides for a mechanism for exercising the right to information and penalties for an unsubstantiated refusal to provide it (Articles 38-41, 47, 58, 61). I believe that references to these legal norms in the presidential edict would have sufficed to remove all questions. It is hard to understand why the drafters of such an important document did not do this. On the other hand, the Edict on Information Guarantees rectifies the mistake made at the time of the election campaign or, to be exact, long before it: Owing to the paucity of information, chiefly television information, society had a very poor and largely a distorted idea of the government's policy, and in the runup to the election this idea was still further distorted by the false populist propaganda of overt and covert antireformers. The edict obliges the state television and radio companies to notify citizens of all legal acts and decisions of state organs on the day they are issued and to create programs which explain the activities of the legislature, the executive, and the judiciary. To monitor the objectivity of the coverage of these activities, the other presidential edict sets up the Judicial Chamber for Information Disputes. I would like to be able to welcome it, like the first edict, unreservedly. The chamber is to help the president of Russia in protecting rights and freedoms in the sphere of mass information, ensure the objective and reliable nature of reports and the principle of equality in this sphere, protect the moral interests of children and young people, observe pluralism of opinions, and even correct factual mistakes in information reports, but here too there are questions. The Judicial Chamber is entrusted, inter alia, with resolving disputes among parliamentary factions over the distribution of airtime and issuing warnings to editorial boards which abuse freedom of speech. This requires direct powers. Although the edict states that the Judicial Chamber "is not part of the system of Russian Federation federal courts," if you proceed from the essence of the assignments given it, it will possess not only judicial but also administrative power, and also, partly, legislative power, it seems, since it just cannot manage without drawing up corresponding legal regulations in order to carry out its functions (for example, to distribute airtime, ensure equal rights, and resolve disputes). Will it not turn into something like the notorious oversight council, of which the former Supreme Soviet used to dream so, only this time under the Russian Federation president? The boards of guardians which exist in many countries, representing the interests of society in television, operate by force of authority, not imperious command, but the chamber is not free of the risk of turning into an administrative organ with a censorial bent. Firm guarantees are needed against such a metamorphosis.
