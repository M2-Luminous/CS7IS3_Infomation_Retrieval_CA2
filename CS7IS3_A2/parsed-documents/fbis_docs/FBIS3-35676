According to the deputy minister, he had the impression after yesterday's meeting of experts that Russia was attempting to delay the negotiations. The mood is not very optimistic, Domarkas said in an interview with a Baltic News Service correspondent today before the continuation of the negotiations. The Lithuanian and Russian commissions on the delimitation and demarcation of the state borders are headed by Deputy Foreign Minister Domarkas and (Gary Chmikhov), the first deputy head of the Kaliningrad region administration. In the meeting in Vilnius, a great deal of attention is being paid to problems of the marine border. The negotiators are today dealing with a project prepared by the Lithuanian Geodesic Service. Domarkas thinks that disagreements on the marine border are stipulated both by economic interests and by psychological standpoints. According to him, the deposit on the [word indistinct] shelf has influence, too, as both sides have a claim to it. The head of the Lithuanian commission agrees that both sides propose at the negotiations their maximal projects but, according to him, this is customary in [word indistinct] practice. The Lithuanian side hoped to complete the negotiations in Vilnius on the land state border, but Russian negotiators stated that Moscow had not yet evaluated the previously agreed draft agreement. The next meeting on the Lithuanian and Russian state border should take place in Moscow in a month's time. The negotiators hope that agreements on the borders will be signed and will come into force this year.
