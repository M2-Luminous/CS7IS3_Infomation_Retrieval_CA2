FR940930-2-00180 FR940930-2-00063 7. In order that the frozen portions of the Accounts may be released without the delay and uncertainty of awaiting the Residual Payments, and in order to enable the transfer of assets from the Plans to the Silgan Plans, the Employer proposes to loan the Plans the amount of the Estimated Residuals (the Loan), and is requesting an exemption to permit the Loan under the terms and conditions described herein. 3 The Loan, pursuant to a written agreement, will be made in a lump sum in the amount of the Estimated Residuals less any Residual Payments which the Plans may have received prior to the Loan. The Loan will be made as soon as practicable after the Committee has obtained the exemption proposed herein, if granted, and a closing agreement with respect thereto has been consummated with the Internal Revenue Service. The repayment of the Loan (the Repayments) will be limited to the cash proceeds, if any, received by the Plan as Residual Payments after the date of the Loan. Repayments are due only as and when Residual Payments are received by the Plans. No interest will be paid on the Loan, and the Plans will incur no expenses with respect to the Loan. Under no circumstances will the Repayments exceed the Loan. At such time as the Trustee or Executive Life notifies the Employer that no further Residual Payments will be made, repayment of any outstanding Loan amount will be waived by the Employer. 3 The Department notes that this exemption, if granted, will not affect the ability of any participant or beneficiary to bring a civil action against Plan fiduciaries for breaches of section 404 of the Act in connection with any aspect of the GIC transactions. 8. If the proposed exemption is granted, the Committee intends to revalue the Plans' investment in the GIC (the Adjusted Value) to equal the sum of the Initial Payment, the Interim Payment, the Loan, and any Residual Payments received prior to the Loan. Each frozen Account will also be adjusted to reflect the Adjusted Value accordingly, reducing the Plans' recorded investment in the GIC from the Conservation Date book value to the Adjusted Value, and a proportional percent of each frozen Account will be recorded as a loss. After the Loan is made and the Accounts are adjusted, the Committee will remove the freeze on the Accounts invested in the GIC and the Plans will resume distribution, withdrawals, loans and interfund transfers with respect to Account portions previously subject to the freeze. Additionally, the Plans will be able to complete the transfer of assets to the Silgan Plans, in accordance with the agreement of sale of the Employer's business unit to Silgan, by transferring the previously frozen Account portions on the basis of the Adjusted Value and by utilizing the cash made available by the Loan. 9. In summary, the applicant represents that the proposed transaction satisfies the criteria of section 408(a) of the Act for the following reasons: (a) All terms and conditions of the Loan will be no less favorable to the Plans than those which the Plans could obtain in an arm's-length transaction with an unrelated party; (b) The Loan will enable the Plans to resume normal operations with respect to the frozen portion of the Accounts; (c) The Loan will enable the completion of the transfer of assets to the Silgan Plan with respect to 288 frozen Accounts; (d) No interest or expenses will be paid by the Plans; (e) The Repayments will be restricted to the Residual Payments received by the Plans pursuant to the Rehab Plan; (f) The Repayment will not exceed the Loan or the Residual Payments received after the Loan is made; and (g) The Repayments will be waived to the extent the Loan exceeds Residual Payments received by the Plans after the Loan is made.
