Ministry Spokesman Michael Griesbeck told DPA in Bonn today that, as an initial step, Kanther familiarized three new BKA main department heads with their future tasks yesterday. It is not yet clear when the newly created hierarchical level, which is to be controlled by the BKA president and vice president, will start its work. According to information from security circles, Rudolf Atzbach, the old head of the BKA Central Administration Department, is to take over the planned Administration and Data Processing Main Department, according to Kanther's wishes. Leopold Schuster, the head of the Fight Against Drugs and Investigation Department, will lead the whole sphere of investigations and the records department. BKA department head Manfred Klink will be responsible for the Terrorism and Protection of the State Main Department, which will be based in Meckenheim near Bonn in the future. Kanther's reform plans met with skepticism and rejection among the police trade union [GdP]. The new level of hierarchy that is to be introduced among the BKA president, the vice president, and the old department heads is in contradiction with all modern findings concerning control and organization, stressed Arno Falk, chairman of the GdP group in the BKA. The appointment of the new main department heads is the "wrong consequence from Bad Kleinen." In fact, the GdP sees the need and the opportunity for restructuring the criminal office in Wiesbaden. Yet it rejects "rash and incompetent decisions, characterized by political opportunism." Falk called on the Bundestag officials responsible for domestic policy and the budget not to accept the plans for the BKA reform. The Bundestag group of the CDU/CSU [Christian Social Union] wanted to adopt the planned amendment to the BKA law that was proposed by the interior minister before the summer recess. The accusation, leveled by opposition members and the GdP, that, as a result of the introduction of a new level of hierarchy, Kanther wants to "deprive BKA President Hans Ludwig Zachert of his power," has repeatedly been rejected by the interior minister. During the bloody operation against the Red Army Faction [RAF] at the Bad Kleinen railway station in Mecklenburg Western Pomerania, police officer Michael Newrzella and suspected RAF terrorist Wolfgang Grams were killed in late June 1993. Suspected RAF member Birgit Hogefeld was arrested without being injured. The slip-ups during the police operation, for which the BKA, among others, was held responsible, led to the resignation of Interior Minister Rudolf Seiters (CDU) and Federal Public Prosecutor Alexander von Stahl.
