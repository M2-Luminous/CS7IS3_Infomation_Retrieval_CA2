A COA official confirmed Thursday [28 April] that Beijing has rejected Taiwan's application to attend the CITES Asian regional meeting on the grounds that Taiwan is not a CITES member. However, local conservation groups, including the Beautiful Taiwan Foundation and Green Consumer Foundation said they will contact Animal Committee Chairman Robert Jenkins to lobby for Taiwan's attendance. A three-member civilian delegation was originally set to represent the COA at the meeting which Beijing said is an official meeting of CITES member countries. Taiwan is not a CITES member. The delegation included Professor Li Ling-ling of National Taiwan University's Zoology Department, Professor Wang Ing of National Normal University's Biology Department, and Professor Chang Hsien- che of the China Medical College. The biennial CITES Animals Committee meeting is a warm-up for the 1994 CITES meeting, which is scheduled to open in Florida this November. Both the COA and local conservation groups hope to attend the committee meeting since it will discuss the future direction of international wildlife management.
