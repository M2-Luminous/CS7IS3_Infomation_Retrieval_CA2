Menem also emphasized the government's nationwide victory "for the fourth consecutive year" in as many elections, and ruled out the possibility of introducing changes in the national cabinet. The president also confirmed "all the terms" of the current economic model, and emphasized that the convertibility program's "measures will be further enhanced." The president confirmed PAMI [Comprehensive Medical Assistance Plan] head Matilde Menendez in her post, because "it is not the time to have heads roll" even though he admitted that "we will correct some mistakes." Menem said that the PAMI head "has not tendered her resignation, nor has anyone asked her to resign," thus denying press reports that circulated shortly after the elections. The president also emphasized that the Justicialist Party [PJ] defeat in the federal capital "cannot be blamed on anyone in particular." Menem said "Argentines no longer vote angrily," and denied that the FG victory in the federal capital represents a "protest vote" against the government. During a news conference at Government House, Menem said "we will strictly abide by" the Olivos Pact that we signed with Raul Alfonsin. Discussing the FG victory in the metropolitan district, Menem said that "the federal capital does not represent the entire country," and praised the victories achieved in San Luis and Santiago del Estero Provinces, among others. Asked to interpret the election results, Menem said "there was a shift in votes." In this regard he made the interpretation that "UCR [Radical Civic Union] electoral strength has declined" and that "these votes were not cast for the PJ" but for the FG, among other forces. Menem specifically made it clear that "even though" some provincial forces that won in their respective districts "do not support the Olivos Pact, they actually agree with the possibility of reforming the Constitution." Asked if after his overwhelming victory in Buenos Aires Province, Governor Eduardo Duhalde would be his running mate in 1995, Menem said: "The governor is free to make any decision. If he wants to be my running mate, I would be very pleased, but I emphasize that it is much more important to hold a governorship like that of Buenos Aires than to hold the post of vice president." Menem then reviewed the provinces where the PJ won. Nevertheless, he refused to discuss [Republican Force leader] General Domingo Bussi's victory against [Tucuman Governor Ramon] "Palito" Ortega in Tucuman Province. Menem said that for this province the Republican Force and the PJ will have "five Constituent Assembly members" each, while the UCR will have one. Asked if the government would conduct a self-examination over these results, Menem initially responded that it would be conducted "within the next few days," but immediately asked himself: "Is it possible to conduct a self-examination after a victory? We have won throughout the Republic, and there is but one country; there are no isolated areas." In this regard, Menem extolled the results achieved in Santiago del Estero Province, where Peronism defeated UCR leader Jose Zavalia, and in Catamarca Province, where "Dr. Ramon Saadi again won after two years of federal intervention." Menem also praised the PJ victory in Salta Province and San Luis Province, where "a few months ago, after a great scandal, politicians and the media asked for federal intervention of this province. We did not implement such an intervention, and won with 66 percent of the votes in San Luis Province." Menem then stressed that according to initial projections, it will not be difficult for Peronism "to have a majority in the electoral college" in the Constituent Assembly, as Peronism "will be supported by the provincial forces because even though these forces do not support the (Olivos) Pact, they support the constitutional reform."
