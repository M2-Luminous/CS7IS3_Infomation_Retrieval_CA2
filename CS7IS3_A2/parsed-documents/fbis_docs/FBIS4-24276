Tome Igreje reports. Everyone must register in order to actively take part in the coming multiparty elections scheduled for October this year. This was the principal message conveyed by Renamo President Afonso Dhlakama to the residents of Dondo and the administrative post of Mafambice yesterday. Accompanied by Raul Domingos and Sofala provincial representative Manuel Pereira, Afonso Dhlakama reminded the people that the war between Renamo and the government has ended and he gave assurances that it will not be repeated in Mozambique. Proclaiming himself the defender of democracy, freedom, and justice in Mozambique, the Renamo leader said the people must prepare themselves to choose their president and government for the next five years. [Begin Dhlakama recording] A voter registration process is under way throughout the country at present. Voter registration teams are recording the names, place of birth, and age of prospective voters. After that they distribute voter registration cards. I would, therefore, like to request my parents here, all the people here to go to voter registration centers. Voter registration is vital for you to be able to vote in the election. No matter how you like this or that party, you cannot vote without being registered as a voter. The war has ended in Mozambique. I am the one who is saying it. I do not want to hear of war any more. I do not even want to see someone holding an AK-47. [end recording] Afonso Dhlakama said proudly that he had defeated the armed forces of the Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo] and their allies of the eastern block. Frequently applauded by thousands of people present at the Mafambice rally, the Renamo leader removed his spectacles on several occasions to show his eyes to the people. He told the people that they should look at him closely so that they could better recognize him, in an apparent appeal to them to choose him in the coming presidential elections. [Begin Dhlakama recording] I can say with pride that Renamo won the war. Renamo defeated Frelimo together with all its allies. [applause] Let us now forget war. Let us now forget war and speak about peace. Let us speak of peace. I am always in Maputo, holding talks with my brother the president of the Republic. This means, therefore, that the war has ended. The only war that now remains is the political war. There should be no more hatred. We should not say: This one belongs to Frelimo. I do not want to associate with him because I belong to Renamo. That has ended. Now we are going to wage a political war. The power now is in the hands of the Mozambican people. It is up to them to choose the future president of Mozambique who will be able to respect their supreme interests. We say thank you for your presence here at this rally. [preceding sentence in Sena] Thank you, thank you very much, Mozambican people. [end recording] The Renamo president then left for Mafambice in a luxurious Mercedes Benz. There he visited the installations of the sugar factory and was briefed on its operation. At present the factory is paralyzed. Afonso Dhlakama also visited other districts of Sofala Province today, but these were not named for security reasons. At a meeting presided over by Afonso Dhlakama in Dondo yesterday, two citizens were detained by Renamo men for allegedly carrying placards which were against Renamo. The two men were forcibly carried by Afonso Dhlakama's men to Mafambice, where the second rally took place. In Mafambice journalists wanted to approach the two citizens who were detained in a vehicle but were prevented from doing so by Renamo men who said there was no reason to interview them. Following journalists' insistence, the Renamo men said there was no major problem with the detained people. They were there just to investigate who sent them to the meeting with the placards, which the journalists were unable to see. The two men were later on released before the holding of the mass rally.
