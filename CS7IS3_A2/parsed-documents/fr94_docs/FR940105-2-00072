AUNW has certified that: (1) No local traffic has moved over the line for more than 2 years; (2) any overhead traffic can be rerouted over other lines; (3) no formal complaint filed by a user of rail service on the line (or by a State or local government entity acting on behalf of such user) regarding cessation of service over the line either is pending with the Commission or with any U.S. District Court or has been decided in favor of the complainant within the 2-year period; and (4) the requirements at 49 CFR 1105.7 (service of environmental report on agencies), 49 CFR 1105.8 (service of historic report on State Historic Preservation Officer), 49 CFR 1105.12 (newspaper publication), and 49 CFR 1152.50(d)(1) (notice of governmental agencies) have been met. As a condition to this exemption, any employee affected by the discontinuance shall be protected under Oregon Short Line R. Co._Abandonment_Goshen, 360 I.C.C. 91 (1979). To address whether this condition adequately protects affected employees, a petition for partial revocation under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) must be filed. Provided no formal expression of intent to file an offer of financial assistance (OFA) has been received, this exemption will be effective on February 4, 1994, unless stayed pending reconsideration. Petitions to stay that do not involve environmental issues 1 and formal expressions of intent to file an OFA under 49 CFR 1152.27(c)(2) 2 must be filed by January 18, 1994. Petitions to reopen must be filed by January 25, 1994, with: Office of the Secretary, Case Control Branch, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423. 1 A stay will be issued routinely by the Commission in those proceedings where an informed decision on environmental issues (whether raised by a party or by the Commission's Section of Energy and Environment in its independent investigation) cannot be made prior to the effective date of the notice of exemption. See Exemption of Out-of-Service Rail Lines, 5 I.C.C.2d 377 (1989). Any entity seeking a stay on environmental concerns is encouraged to file its request as soon as possible in order to permit this Commission to review and act on the request before the effective date of this exemption. 2 See Exempt. of Rail Abandonment_Offers of Finan. Assist., 4 I.C.C.2d 164 (1987). A copy of any petition filed with the Commission should be sent to applicant's representative: Michael W. Blaszak, 211 South Leitch Avenue, LaGrange, IL 60525&hyph;2162. If the notice of exemption contains false or misleading information, the exemption is void ab initio. AUNW has filed an environmental report which addresses the discontinuance's effects, if any, on the environmental and historic resources. The Section of Energy and Environment (SEE) will issue an environmental assessment (EA) by January 10, 1994. Interested persons may obtain a copy of the EA by writing to SEE (room 3219, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423) or by calling Elaine Kaiser, Chief of SEE, at (202) 927&hyph;6248. Comments on environmental and historic preservation matters must be filed within 15 days after the EA is available to the public. Environmental and historic preservation conditions will be imposed, where appropriate, in a subsequent decision. Decided: December 29, 1993. By the Commission, David M. Konschnik, Director, Office of Proceedings. Sidney L. Strickland, Jr. Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;170 Filed 1&hyph;4&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7035&hyph;01&hyph;P
