Fred Eckhard said the 550 troops will travel by different means to Sarajevo and their arrivals will be staggered. Some 220 will fly to Bosnia between April 18 and 21, while 330 will travel by train with military equipment, Eckhard said. He did not say when they would leave Sarajevo for Gorazde but Colin Keating, who holds the rotating Security Council presidency, said it would be as soon as possible. Ukraine has already sent 710 peacekeepers to Bosnia and Eckhard did not rule out the possibility that additional troops could be deployed in Gorazde where there are already a dozen UN military observers. Keating indicated that as many as 1,000 could be sent.
