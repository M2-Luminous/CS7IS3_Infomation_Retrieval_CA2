The nine provincial premiers, frustrated at the inability to get their new governments up and running, can do little more than prepare legislation pre-empting the transfer of powers and functions they assume will be transferred to their provinces by central government. The provinces were also warned this week by the chairman of the Commission on Provincial Government, Thozamile Botha, to speedily begin finalising their budgets for the 1995/96 financial year. "It is already too late for them to submit budgets for the current financial year," Botha told the MAIL & GUARDIAN. "Even next year's budget has largely been prepared by the previous government." Botha said it normally took 18 months to prepare a budget. However, he expected major revisions to the 1995/96 budget drawn up by the De Klerk administration. Most of the changes will be in order to accommodate the ANC's reconstruction and development plan. The nine provincial premiers had a meeting in Cape Town last week during which serious complaints were raised about their inability to start governing. Botha this week could offer the power-starved leaders -- seven from the ANC, one from Inkatha and one from the National Party -- no immediate solace. He said it would take at least five years, and probably longer, for the provincial governments to be fully established in terms of the new constitution. The premiers will have to accept that they will be almost completely powerless until the national budget is passed by parliament on June 22. Botha advised them to start establishing Provincial Revenue Funds and to pass an Appropriation Act allowing central government to allocate funds to them. Describing the situation as a "Catch 22", he said no funds could be transferred to the provinces unless they had their Revenue Funds in place. "As soon as possible, they should establish full treasury departments. People with the necessary expertise from the former bantustans and from the previous provinces are available to assist with this task." The matter is further complicated by the fact that none of the nine provinces knows exactly what powers and functions it is entitled to. They are expected to plan their budgets on the basis of how they assume "on paper" their new governments will function. Botha advised the provinces to invent "prototypes" of what they assume their new ministries and staff components will be like, and to plan their budgets accordingly. The final powers and functions of the various provinces will be decided by Botha's commission -- but only after the provinces have applied to "reclaim" functions from central government. "This will not happen on day one," Botha warned. "It is a process that will have to be approached step by step." It was important, he said, that the necessary structures be securely in place before functions were trnasferred from existing provincial and homeland administrations to the new provinces. "The integration will have to run concurrently with the phasing out of the old administrations." Provincial governments will only be possible once a proclamation has been passed allowing President Nelson Mandela to appoint an administrator responsible for functions belonging to the provinces in terms of the constitution, but which some of the economically weaker ones may be unable to assume. Botha said he was aware of the frustrations of the premiers. But he cautioned them to rather "start doing some of the basic things now to ensure that their governments will run smoothly." These included "less controversial" steps like the establishment of management structures and ministerial task forces to liaise with the administrator about the allocation of functions. They should also start establishing provincial public service commissions to assist them to take over the task of provincial employers. Provincial standing committees should be put in place as part of the mechanism of passing bills into law. Botha said the premiers had to balance their political ambitions with the administrative capabilities of their provinces. "Money will follow the functions as soon as they are reclaimed from central government." Provinces would also have to accept that they would not be able to plan outside the provincial budgets for this year.
