Houston, TX; Operating in the State of Oklahoma; Amended Certification Regarding Eligibility to Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance In accordance with Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 USC 2273) the Department of Labor issued a Certification of Eligibility to Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance on July 20, 1994, applicable to all workers of the subject firm. The notice was published in the Federal Register on July 28, 1994 (59 FR 38495). At the request of the company, the Department again reviewed its certification for the workers of Union Pacific Oil and Gas in Houston, Texas. New findings show that several workers were laid off in Oklahoma. The intent of the Department's certification is to include all workers who were adversely affected by increased imports. Accordingly, the Department is amending its certification to include worker separations in Oklahoma. The amended notice applicable to TA&hyph;W&hyph;29,657 is hereby issued as follows: ``All workers of Union Pacific and Gas, formerly Amax Oil and Gas Company, Houston, Texas and in the state of Oklahoma who were engaged in employment related to the production of crude oil and natural gas who became totally or partially separated from employment on or after March 16, 1993 are eligible to apply for adjustment assistance under Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974.'' Signed at Washington, D.C. this 7th day of November, 1994. Victor J. Trunzo, Program Manager, Policy and Reemployment Services, Office of Trade Adjustment Assistance.
