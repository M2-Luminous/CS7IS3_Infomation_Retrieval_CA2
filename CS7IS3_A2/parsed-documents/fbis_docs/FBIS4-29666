FBIS4-29666 "dreas119_j_94004" FBIS-EAS-94-119 Daily Report 21 Jun 1994 Indonesia Ranariddh, Hun Sen Visit Indonesia Ranariddh, Hun Sen Visit Indonesia Commentary Views Visit BK2106045194 Jakarta Radio Republik Indonesia Network in Indonesian 0000 GMT 21 Jun 94 BK2106045194 Jakarta Radio Republik Indonesia Network Indonesian BFN [Station commentary] [Text] The stalled national reconciliation process in Cambodia, which has not borne fruit so far, delayed the Indonesian visit of Cambodian leaders Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen. The two leaders were only able to begin their visit to Indonesia yesterday. After they had assumed the post of first and second prime minister following last year's elections, they only managed to visit the PRC and Thailand. Even as they left Phnom Penh for Jakarta, the spark that could trigger another outbreak of war was ignited after the Khmer Rouge rejected an offer for cease-fire scheduled for the end of this month. As such, the elected Cambodian Government has not managed to carry out economic reconstruction in the country ravaged by the 15-year-old civil war. Cambodia's economic reconstruction needs the support of friendly countries, including Indonesia. The visit to Indonesia by the two Cambodian prime ministers accompanied by seven key ministers, is aimed at obtaining Indonesia's commitment for economic and technical assistance. Indonesia, which played a major role in the birth of the new Republic of Cambodia [title of country as heard] and currently serves as chairman of the Nonaligned Movement, will pay special attention to the challenges faced by the Cambodian Government and people. Efforts to improve Cambodia's economy and stability, which will in turn contribute to the stability of Southeast Asia, have indeed become Indonesia's basic commitment to that country. We are aware that any problem that arises in any country will have a negative impact on other countries in the same region. Friendly relations between Indonesia and Cambodia in fact have long cultural and historical roots. As a nation that once suffered under long colonial rule, we fully understand the need to extend assistance to Cambodia in its efforts to consolidate national stability through continued economic development and the improvement of the people's economic welfare. Based on the historical friendship between the two nations, we believe there are many forms of long-term and short-term cooperation that can be developed. Such cooperation will be discussed between President Suharto and his two Cambodian guests at Jakarta's Merdeka Palace today. We hope the success of Cambodia's economic reconstruction will lead to its stability and national reconciliation. Our experience has shown that without national reconciliation and unity, it is impossible to carry out economic development smoothly.
