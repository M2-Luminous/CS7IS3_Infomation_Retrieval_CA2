They discussed a proposal concerning KOZ's involvement in the election campaign and internal trade union issues. According to the trade unionists, the level of employment has declined, in particular, in the branches of agriculture, industry, and construction. In their opinion, not a single government has adequately addressed this problem. No comprehensive concept has been drafted, and no basic direction of policy has been determined. It is therefore necessary to carry out a consistent analysis of the labor market and the effectiveness of financial resources spent [on employment policy]. As far as the management of state administration is concerned, the trade unionists regard as the best solution the management of labor offices and the regional Employment Fund bodies from a single center. The participants in the assembly noted that KOZ will become involved in the elections only through individual trade unions and will not give support to any political party. They asked KOZ president Alojz Englis to communicate to the prime minister of the Slovak Republic the trade unionists' dissatisfaction with the speech made by Minister of Labor and Social Affairs Julius Brocka at the Sixth Conference on Trade Union Cooperation in Europe.
