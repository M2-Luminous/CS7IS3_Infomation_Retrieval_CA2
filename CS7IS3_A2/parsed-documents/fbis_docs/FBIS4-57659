The Secretariat of National Defense has presented its military industry: factories of weapons, cartridges, and vehicle assembly. Amid an atmosphere of reports and information on purchase of foreign-made military equipment, the Army has shown what it has: armored vehicles equipped with cannons and machine-guns with long firing capability. If water cannons were placed on these vehicles, they would be underutilized, the Secretariat of National Defense said. General Enrique Cervantes Aguirre, director general of National Defense Factories, affirmed the Army's equipment guarantees national sovereignty. He added there are no secret weapons in Mexico and the purchase of weapons has nothing to do with what has taken place in other countries. [Begin Cervantes recording] It is not convenient to extrapolate events in other regions to those in our country. We have our own experiences and our own institutions. [end recording] Regarding arms supplies, we are self-sufficient. [Begin Cervantes recording] It would be contradictory for us to ship out weapons and ammunition to areas where conflicts appear, when we promote peaceful solutions to conflicts. That is why we do not sell weapons. [end recording] These are high-powered German-made weapons purchased in 1980 for exclusive Army use. This is a vehicle assembly plant where military vehicles, some of which date back to 1942, are refurbished. Here is a 2,500 RAM truck, of which cabin and engine are used and mounted on a military vehicle. This is a vehicle manufactured in Mexico that will be presented to authorities. In addition, cartridges of various calibers are manufactured in Mexico. Some 160,000 cartridges are manufactured daily, but the facility has a capacity to manufacture 300,000 cartridges. They are used to fight drug trafficking and are also sold to the country's high security ports. They are manufactured with automated machines. Here is a factory of plastic and paint, ice picks and matrixes, which are marketed to obtain revenues. The gunpowder factory was closed in 1990 by the Sedue [Urban Development and Ecology Secretariat] for damaging the environment. Currently, gunpowder is imported into the country. The Secretariat of Defense concluded by saying the opening of military factories is intended to calm the population and to instill confidence in their institutions.
