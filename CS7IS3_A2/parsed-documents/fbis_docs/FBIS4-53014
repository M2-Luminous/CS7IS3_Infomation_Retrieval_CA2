In its note to the DPRK Embassy in Burundi, it said that the threat to and pressure on an independent state by big powers are a crude violation of international law and a big obstacle to peace and security of the Korean peninsula and the world. It expressed solidarity and support to the stand and efforts of the DPRK to resolve the nuclear problem through its peaceful negotiation with the United States. It called upon international organisations not to cling to a double-standard policy, blindly following the big powers, but act according to their ideas and reaffirmed undisputed support to the Korean people's struggle for the independent and peaceful reunification of the country.
