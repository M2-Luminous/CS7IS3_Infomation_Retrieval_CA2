FR940920-1-00121 FR940920-1-00012 (1) The legislation directs that awards be made in support of each of the ten (10) goals enumerated in §152.4. The competitive evaluation of the proposals will be done on a goal by goal basis, and the grant awards will be made accordingly. In effect, all of the proposals received that address, for example §152.4(a), will be reviewed against the competitive evaluation criteria detailed in §152.8 in relation to achieving that goal. The best overall proposal will be the recipient of the award. Each of the other proposals offered in support of each of the other goals will likewise be assessed. The State or consortia of States may submit proposals addressing more than one of the goals. Applicants must however insure that the proposal detail is separable in its entirety, goal by goal. States, or consortia of States, applying for the competitive grants available under this section will comply with and are bound by all of the applicable provisions of 44 CFR parts 13 and 14 with respect to the Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants to State Governments, and the Administration of Grants: Audits of State Governments. (2) [Reserved] (b) The application will identify the requestor's status as a: (1) State; or (2) Consortium of States, (detailing each of the States in the consortium). (c) The application will specifically identify both the responsible State organizational element (e.g., the Office of the State Fire Marshal) and the responsible Official/Individual who will administer the grant in the event of an award. Grant requests from consortia of States will include this information for each of the States, and will identify which one of these responsible Officials will serve as the grant's administrative coordinator with USFA. (d) The information provided will include the following: (1) The applicant's complete organizational title; (2) The applicant's complete mailing address; (3) The name and title of the State's designated responsible Official; (4) The responsible Official's complete mailing address; and (5) The responsible Official's telephone and facsimile numbers. (e) The application will indicate specifically which of the 10 grant goals in §152.4 the proposed grant activities are intended to address. Consortia proposals may propose that each of the consortia States address a particular goal or group of goals singularly, or the States may approach the selected goals, in part or in whole, collectively. (f) The application will provide specific work plans which detail the means by which the applicant(s) intends to pursue the selected goal's attainment through the grant. The work plan will include the overall level of effort envisioned as a result of the proposed grant's implementation, the specific tasks and time lines to be accomplished, the resources both human and material that will be applied to the effort (including the means by which the utilization of these resources will be accounted for), and the means and methods that will be utilized to assess and evaluate the accomplishment of the targeted goals. (g) Each applicant will submit a detailed grant program budget which addresses, by goal specific reference, how the grant funds, both administrative and programmatic, will be disbursed. The grant proposal budget element will specifically distinguish between ``administrative costs'' and ``program costs'' consistent with the requirements noted herein. No more than 10 percent of the funds provided under the grant will be used for the administrative costs of the program. This restriction does not preclude the applicant(s) from proposing a greater level of effort or resource dedication to administrative activity, it simply limits the costs to be supported through the grant funding. Each of the States in a consortium may request support for actual administrative costs of no more than 10 percent of its respective program expenses. §152.7 Available funds and application submission. (a) Funds may be appropriated in Fiscal Year 1995 to support grant awards addressing the ten (10) goals of §152.4. No grant awards would be made in Fiscal Year 1995 or future years unless and until funds are appropriated. (b) Reasonable efforts will be made to award a grant addressing each of the enumerated goals in an expeditious manner. Upon completion of the initial competitive evaluations and the resulting grant awards, any goal(s) yet unattended will be identified and may become the subject of a second round of applications solicitation, consideration and grant award(s). Grant proposals should be formatted to address specifically the incremental use of the currently available (FY 1995) funds, and target the possible use of FY 1996 funds if made available, as logical programmatic extensions or replications of the activities proposed and supported by FY 1995 funds. (c) Following the comment period and the publishing of the final rule incorporating these procedures, a formal announcement of grant availability will be issued in the Federal Register . Applicants will be afforded a period of not less than 30 and not more than 45 days, following the formal announcement, to submit applications. It is anticipated that the initial grant awards will be made during the first quarter of calendar year 1995. In the event awards are not made in support of each of the ten goals, a second Notice of Availability, addressing the unattended goals, may be published in the Federal Register and awards will be targeted to occur before September 30, 1995.
