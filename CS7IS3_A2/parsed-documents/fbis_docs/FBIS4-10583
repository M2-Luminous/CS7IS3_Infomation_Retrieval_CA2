[Lacalle] Apart from being a meeting between the Uruguayan president and the U.S. President -- the world's most important political personality -- the occasion on which the meeting was held gave it certain special characteristics. While the continent's presidents were in Chile (when President Eduardo Frei assumed the presidency), we received a fax giving us an advance copy of a letter, which was later received by our secretaries, in which President Clinton expounded his idea of a summit of democratically elected presidents in Miami in December. Our meeting, which was held at the White House, had two distinct parts: The first part was held with the director of the National Security Agency and the under secretary for Latin American Affairs; and the second with these two gentlemen and President Clinton himself. The topics that dominated the meeting included the calling of the presidential summit, its role, my opinion of the idea, and what I thought my colleagues' opinions would be. President Clinton's summons is formulated in a two-page letter: In other words, it is more than an invitation. He outlines an idea that I would like to elaborate on because it was the main topic that we discussed. He has chosen December for the summit, which is too far off -- from March to December is practically a whole year. In one paragraph he writes: "From now until December we must work together to ensure that the agenda of this summit will be very ample and very productive." He indicates some topics: "We must jointly consider the best way to strengthen democracy, to improve the quality of governments, to collectively defend democracy, to promote economic growth through expanded trade and larger investments, and to advance toward a sustained development strategy that will protect the environment and help overcome poverty." He then states that a certain point of the meeting had to be highlighted because it was the most discussed. He says: "I see this summit as a process. Between now and December we should organize a series of very intense consultations between governments. I also foresee meetings among non-government and government organizations, including meetings with government officials, to formulate new initiatives for their organizations and for the summit. A productive summit should generate consensus, give impetus to new ideas, channel a series of meetings between ministers, and strengthen multilateral mechanisms." At this point, I tried to evaluate the difference between this meeting and others. At this point we must recall that all U.S. presidents, practically without exception since Franklin Roosevelt, have had initiatives for Latin America. We had the "Good Neighbor Policy," which was the first, then the "Alliance for Progress," then the "Americas Initiative" just to mention a few. In other words, they all -- under different names -- have attempted to create stronger links with Latin America. I told President Clinton that, from the contents of his letter and from his invitation, my intuition told me he was less interested in a meeting of governments and more interested in a meeting of nations, because this will be more than just a meeting of governments, of foreign or economy ministers; the meeting should include society's intermediate organizations, businessmen, cultural and educational sectors, and non-government organizations that today are having more and more importance within society. We were in complete agreement. Without pretending that one meeting will overcome the disagreements we may have with the United States or that one meeting will bring immediate results -- because one has lived long enough to know that this is not the way things happen -- if President Clinton's formula is accomplished, then I believe this meeting will see the presidents complete a process instead of just initiating and beginning a new one. Interpreting and sharing President Clinton's thoughts allow us to suppose that the Chambers of Commerce of the involved countries should get together. Calling a meeting relative to a specific type of activity will more probably facilitate agreements because the interests of those involved are concentrated and intensified. The same can be said of any type of rectorial meeting. There is understanding among sectors because the world is interdependent. One can speak as an educator on topics that are as problematic in the United States as they are in our country. Talking about investment or trade brings us to the same conclusion. Thus, I believe doing things this way is much more intelligent and complex. Those meetings will be more difficult than getting 20 presidents to sit together, because drafting a good declaration and listening to erudite speeches is quite easy. It only takes 15 to 20 days to prepare. But this other way of doing things is much more ambitious because the interests at various levels have to be ironed out. This is where I see the strength and importance that this meeting can have if this kind of libretto and proposal are accomplished. But everything must be done in a coordinated manner. Our idea is to get the Rio Group to have the summit as the main topic on its agenda; we will thus know how we will respond collectively to this invitation. It will be useless if only the Uruguayan, Chilean, or Peruvian Governments are in agreement when the others are not. [EL PAIS] Is this an attempt to reactivate -- under another name -- President Bush's Americas Initiative ? [Lacalle] The Americas Initiative represented a qualitative change. Let us not forget it was based on aid for opportunity and loans for investment. It represented a major change. This was after the 1970's and the 1980's when foreign aid was requested and credits were easily obtained. It may seem a platitude to say this, but those loans had to be repaid. Partnership in a venture, however, is not repaid because risks are shared. This is why we were one of the first to share and endorse, together with President Bush, that qualitative change. And yet, this new proposal goes even deeper. President Bush proposed the Americas Initiative, which so recently constituted progress. This president has now presented a panoply that includes trade and investment, and other subjects like the environment, the sustainability of development processes, and the strengthening and enhancement of government management. This makes the project quite ambitious. The risk of convening such a summit is, perhaps, the fact that as it is so all-encompassing and so complex, it may meet with more difficulties. Notwithstanding this, I think some conclusions may be drawn from this -- President Clinton's -- outlook. The first is that his government was not satisfied with having established NAFTA, which was one of the risks we foresaw. We said: The U.S. Government has signed a trade and economic agreement with one of the leading countries in Latin America and may therefore deem that this is enough. The U.S. Government did so because Mexico might cast a shadow on the U.S. horizon. The U.S. Government is, however, aiming beyond the horizon and at other countries. I believe that, by joining societies rather than administrations, it will achieve greater strength because our administrations will be changing. In December, when I am scheduled to represent my country, I already will know who will be my successor. In other words, in December my administration will end within 60 days. Therefore, if we achieve agreements, plans, and goals among associations which do not have terms of office as we the presidents have, then it will be a process involving the entire society. Therefore, at first glance, I believe this proposal is different, interesting, profound, and complex, but also very attractive. The integration process was another issue that President Clinton and I discussed. We are constantly quoting [former Bolivian] President [Jaime] Paz Zamora, who said the American integration process must be modular and contemporary. Instead of attempting to achieve everything at the same time, NAFTA was established to strengthen the North, while the Mercosur [Common Market of the South] will soon be established. Coincidentally, an effort is being made to link these processes at a higher level. Thus, our relationship would be facilitated. During my visit, I mentioned that we -- the four Mercosur countries -- have signed with the United States a treaty called "4 + 1," comprising the four Mercosur countries and the United States. I suggested making it into a "4 + 3" treaty, comprising the Mercosur countries, Canada, Mexico, and the United States. In this way, seven nations would be linked. [EL PAIS] Did they accept the proposal? [Lacalle] The idea has been sown. No one will say yes to an idea instantly. I left it with them. We will take the proposal to our Mercosur partners first. We will see if we can discuss it during the next presidential summit. I think it is a good idea. It is, above all, logical. The conversation then moved around these two main topics. I think Mercosur is acquiring an increasingly important international stature. The same happened with the European Union [EU], with which we have a 12 + 4 proposal -- that is, the EU plus Mercosur. Europeans constantly refer to Mercosur as an entity. That is our big responsibility. We must develop and launch Mercosur. This does not mean that we must reject other ideas. We cannot change or start anything new until we finish building Mercosur. The Uruguayan Government position is: First finish building Mercosur. When all problems are overcome and the organization begins functioning, which we expect will occur before June, then we will be able to look around. It will probably take 20 years, easily, from the time Mercosur starts operating until it becomes effective. It is a very difficult task. I think it has granted the four member countries a personality in the world we must appreciate. When Mercosur is finished, there will be four commercially organized groups in the world: The EU, NAFTA, Mercosur, and the Far East agreements. It is a very small league. Just think what it means for our country to be, through Mercosur, in what we can call "the first division" of world economic and commercial matters. These two issues will give us a lot of work and are very positive. During my trip I repeatedly said that Latin America is not part of the problem but part of the solution. It is an area that does a lot of trade with the United States. The zone has political and economic stability. Figures are constantly improving. It is a good field for investment. The zone has resolved its debt problem to a good extent. We are no longer ballast, the lead weight on the fishing line, the problem that sometimes we did not even want to look at. Problems in Latin America have been gradually ironed out. This is the message I took to Washington. [EL PAIS] The "Americas Society" held an important meeting in Punta del Este recently. Within the framework of our international agenda, what can you tell us about that meeting? [Lacalle] That is not an international agenda of the same level. The "Americas Society" has existed for many years. Every year it visits different areas of the world with some of its main associates. People from Argentina, Uruguay, Chile, and Brazil are represented. It is not a strictly North American entity. It is based in New York, but many countries are represented. What is the purpose of the organization? Mutual understanding and better knowledge of reality. The previous meeting, if I recall, was in Chile. This time the association met in Buenos Aires and Punta del Este, trying to cover Argentina and Uruguay at the same time. We talked about the situation, just as we do with the many groups that visit us. In this case [Economy and Finance Minister Ignacio de] Posadas spoke about our economic situation. Then [former President Luis Maria] Sanguinetti spoke about integration on Saturday morning. I gave the closing speech around noon. Many people said it was a "surprise visit" of the "Americas Society." We knew about the visit seven months in advance and announced it. It was a meeting of important people, a meeting of important economic groups. It is never a bad idea to let them know about the process of change in our country. [EL PAIS] Right, but is this visit not in the context of what was proposed by President Bill Clinton, that is, to take integration to the continent's private sphere? [Lacalle] Yes, yes, of course. I think people are increasingly aware of the idea. Politicians and diplomats' work is increasingly one of opening doors, building bridges, and then stepping aside to let those interested walk through. These people could be economic or cultural agents, or anyone interested in a proposal. [EL PAIS] You criticized Congress several times during your trips abroad. Many people wondered if you would renew your attacks during your state of the nation address on 15 March. [Lacalle] First we must clarify the word criticism. We always take the word criticism as meaning something bad. We almost consider it as a synonym of "insult" or "attack." Those in the political arena who cannot tolerate criticism have chosen the wrong profession. I find it amusing that when I state the number of times Congress could not muster a majority to pass a bill -- without adding adjectives, just mentioning facts -- people feel I am attacking and insulting Congress. Let us not forget the number of times the executive branch was subjected to the most atrocious -- and here I will not use the word criticism -- attacks, insults, and inventions. It's the same old story. It looks like a one-way street. We have been described as "disorganized," "irresponsible," "that we do not know how," "that we do not get things done," without counting the personal attacks directed against ministers, their personal life, and their honesty. Is it not so? If we count the number of times we were attacked the list will be very long. When I talk to my fellow countrymen, I am usually frank and I say, for instance, that the police need more than arms and pick-up trucks when they launch an operation. When our policemen subsequently face a criminal and the situation tells him he might have to use his gun, he needs to know that we accept he is representing the law. This does not mean we give them a blank check, but we must give them the assurance that he will be supported. Well, when I say Congress has not voted on the bill regulating this area since it was presented three years ago, I am only stating a fact. I do not believe this is an attack but an attempt to state who is responsible. I have enough with the executive branch shortcomings. If you want changes in some fields you need executive branch cooperation. I can list those fields. I say this as a matter of fact, I do not add a single adjective. I am sorry if someone is annoyed because I say this. [EL PAIS] Your administration has only a few months to go. Do you feel you had the congressional support you expected? [Lacalle] I remind you of what I said during my state of the nation address. One-third of my speech was taken up with explaining the conditions under which the government had to operate. It is already known that the next government will not have a congressional majority and will have to form a coalition. You have seen the result of my government's coalition. Results have been interpreted in different ways because we were able to obtain a majority of votes for several projects, perhaps not as quickly as expected or as quickly as I would have wanted. I conceived a parliamentary type of government with different blocs negotiating and giving speed and assurance to congressional action. I have no doubt that those who supported the proposal to end the car insurance monopoly in 1993 could have acted in 1990. I have no doubt that the port reform could have been approved earlier. There were occasions when votes were there and other occasions when they were not. You are aware of the most outstanding case, the case of the bill reforming the social security system, without a doubt... [EL PAIS] That was a great frustration... [Lacalle] Frustration was not the word. It was an objective that we could not achieve. We said before the election that we had to do something about it. We talked to all party leaders here at government house. The BPS [Social Security Bank] greatly participated, explaining that it was necessary to do something to defend the system, to strengthen it. The system has a deficit that year after year has to be covered by the national budget. It is a very heavy burden for the country. The deficit amounted to some $200 million in 1993. These funds could have been used elsewhere, or total spending could have been reduced. This is something that the next government will have to face, no matter who is the next president. The problem involves us all. Pensioners trust the BPS will continue as a strong bank that will continue to pay their pensions, including the important recent increase. Pension adjustments were several percentage points above the inflation rate. This was a great improvement. It is also important for those who contribute and want to leave their savings in a place that will give them their pensions later. Contributions also affect the cost of products. There is no doubt that social security contributions are a very heavy burden on productive activities. If there is a topic of national scope, this is it. The government I have the honor to preside over has a clear conscience because we tried to administer a solution to the problem several times. We did not want to impose our solution, nor did we hear alternative proposals. Our proposals received a no, a no, and a no, but we never saw an alternative proposal. Our responsibility here is totally in the clear. [EL PAIS] Have some representatives from the Batllist Forum criticized your handling of the Armed Forces? [Lacalle] It ill behooves me to sing my own praises. I can only say that I have abided by the Constitution and the law, and that during my administration the Armed Forces have been totally and absolutely subject to the legitimate command -- the president of the Republic. [EL PAIS] Do you believe La Republica University is keeping up with the times? [Lacalle] The university is undergoing a dramatic and positive change. We recently discussed this with university authorities, noting that it is coming into contact with the real world by drafting reports for public and private companies, and by selling its services -- like some of the most prestigious universities in the world -- to obtain financial resources. This new phase in university life is, therefore, most welcome. I believe, however, that the university still finds it difficult to adapt to these changes; it does not instigate change. [EL PAIS] What would you tell your detractors about the exchange lag? [Lacalle] I think this subject has been analyzed by experts. In my view, the cost of running the government weighs heavily on the exchange lag. The current exchange situation stems from the adverse effect of this cost on the economy, something which we have been trying to eradicate since we assumed office. We believe the decline in inflation will be instrumental in breaching that gap and that a relatively strong currency is a better indicator than a devalued one. To those who criticize this, I would ask them to publicly identify a better alternative, whether to devalue or to liquidate the assets of all those who have a fixed income. [EL PAIS] The constitutional reform is beginning to take shape. Some contend that there is agreement while others deny this. What is your opinion? [Lacalle] For obvious reasons, I have not been directly involved in the dealings of Congress, but I have been following all the latest developments. [Senator Walter] Santoro, [Senator Juan Andres] Ramirez, and [Vice President Gonzalo] Aguirre have always kept me informed. They assure me that congressmen reached consensus and an agreement will be voted on. [passage omitted] [EL PAIS] The press insists that President Lacalle's choice as presidential candidate is Senator Juan Andres Ramirez ... [Lacalle] That will be settled by the Herreraist Convention, at which I suppose -- and believe -- my comrades will take my opinion into account. [EL PAIS] ... in your capacity as leader of the Herreraist sector ... [Lacalle] No, just as a comrade. [EL PAIS] Do you think that this "primary election" may give rise to splits within the sector? You are its leader and should know how to handle it ... [Lacalle] The doors of the different factions swing; one can go in and out through those doors; no one is a prisoner. I have heard my comrades voice their feelings of unity and vocation to serve the Herreraist sector. This is not limited to just one person, it goes beyond that. [EL PAIS] Do you want the Blanco Party to field a common candidate for Montevideo mayoralty? [Lacalle] That issue has not been formally raised for consideration. Therefore, it will depend on what my distinguished comrades say when their opinion is sought. I would thus discuss that when the situation presents itself. We have to see if there will be a constitutional reform. This is an important consideration to be taken into account. [EL PAIS] Your wife recently made some remarks to the effect that women in Uruguay play a marginal role in politics and that she will run in the November elections if the people request that she do so. [Lacalle] Well, you should ask her about that. My considered opinion is that Julia Pou [de Lacalle] is a very intelligent person who is most able to communicate. She has made herself known through her works, her activities. She could have stayed at home during these past five years and that would have spared her much distress. Yet, it is incumbent upon her to reply to your question. There is total and absolute equality at home. [EL PAIS] What will President Lacalle do after 1 March 1995? Will he continue to be involved in politics? [Lacalle] Yes, because I opted for this walk of life when I was 17 years old. Thus, it is rather difficult to change my path.
