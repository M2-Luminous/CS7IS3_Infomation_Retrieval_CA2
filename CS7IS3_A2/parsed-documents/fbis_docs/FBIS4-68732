The future beckons. In the conviction of Beijing strategists, the Asian-Pacific Ocean region [ATR], and primarily East Asia, will become in the twenty-first century a center of world development -- instead of the North Atlantic. A pledge of this is the fact that in our time the states in the region -- first Japan, then the "four small dragons," and, finally, the other ASEAN countries and, of course, China --discovered unparalleled capabilities for dynamic development. China's main trade partners are located in the ATR. The basic foreign capital investments arrive from there. Linked with the immediate southeastern "underbelly" is the most ambitious plan for the immediate future: to create a "Large China" that would include not only Hongkong, which is returning to the mainland bosom in 1997, but also, they hope, Taiwan with its powerful industrial-financial potential, and possibly also, later on, the ethnically related Singapore. Why Does China Need the West? Nevertheless China, which always considered itself to be the center of the world, is not forgetting the three other points of the compass, including the West, which, true, is perceived chiefly in the distinctively Chinese way. It is not the West that, for the European, traditionally opposes the East, but the one that, for him, is an inseparable part of the East. We are talking about Central and Middle Asia. Those are the specifics of the view from China. As long ago as the time immemorial of the first Chinese empires on the threshold of our era the Great Silk Route, which economically linked China and the West, was laid. Then, during the early Middle Ages, Buddhism began to spread in China, from India by way of Central Asia. It was by that route that the famous travelers came from China to gain secret knowledge. In order to reach their goal, they crossed the extremely high mountain ranges and burning deserts -- "the refuges of evil demons and burning winds", where the only markers along the way were the bleached bones of people who perished en route from hunger and thirst. The Chinese people created dozens of legends concerning one of these travelers, Xuan Zang. In those legends he is presented as a hero who, with the aid of his true friends, overcame 9981 obstacles and finally achieved his cherished goal -- the Western Kingdom. Today it is much simpler to travel from China to the West. And it is other interests that lead the travelers there: for the most part, economic and political ones. The dynamic growth of the Chinese economy in recent years has been fraught with the aggravation of many contradictions, among which the ones that definitely do not occupy the last place are the territorial contradictions: the growing split between the northern and southern regions of China, and between the western and eastern. The fact of the matter is that it is not China as a whole that is gravitating toward the East, but primarily its eastern and southern maritime region. It is precisely that region that is winning more than any other region from the course aimed at opening China to the outside world from the creation of free economic zones and the attraction of foreign capital. The territories within the continent, specially the western ones, are lagging considerably behind in economic and social development from the maritime region that has gone far ahead. Further aggravation of this situation is dangerous. It can create in the long run a threat to the integrity of the country and can even lead to its disintegration, especially in the event of the political cataclysms that are almost inevitable in the future. During the years when China followed the Soviet model, the territorial differences between eastern and western China were artificially equalized, primarily at the expense of restraining the economic growth of the eastern territories. Today this method is inconceivable. It is necessary to maintain at least a relative balance by another method: by creating incentives for the laggards. It is in regard that the economic ties with the Asian part of the former Soviet Union take on special importance. Kinsmen Neighbors Therefore something that is increasingly important is the interaction between China's borderland western territory --Sinkiang-Uigur Autonomous Region -- and the former Soviet Central Asia and Kazakhstan. The contacts between them go very far back into the past. Historically, ethnically, and culturally, this is a single region. Living along both sides of the border are either peoples which are one and the same, or are related: Kazakhs, Kirghiz, Tajiks, Uzbeks, and Uigurs. With the inclusion, obviously, of the population that has immigrated -- in the one instance, from Russia, and in the other, from internal China. In the twenty-first century the interests of two empires striving for expansion collided here: the Russian empire and the Manchurian empire. Unresolved border problems have remained from those conflicts. The fact of the matter is that it is unusually complicated to mark the border here: in some instances the border is lost in the unpopulated high mountains, and in others, on the contrary, it is supposed to divide pastures that are being intensively used on both sides. The crossing of human beings and livestock across an imaginary border line is an ordinary matter, although formally it is reprehensible. There have also been frequent mass migrations. Large Kazakh tribes left Russia and went to Sinkiang after the suppression of the uprising in 1916 and during the 1929 collectivization. Tens of thousands of Uigurs fled Sinkiang to the Soviet Union during the starving 1962. The flourishing of Soviet-Chinese friendship in the first half of the 1950's enlivened the trade ties with Sinkiang. The Soviet Union imported various kinds of products from animal husbandry and raw materials, and exported machinery and equipment. For the sake of friendship N. S. Khrushchev, in a broad gesture, made China a present of a number of joint-stock companies that had been created in Sinkiang with the participation of Soviet capital. Soviet or Soviet-Chinese geological and other expeditions that studied the natural and economic resources for the development of that area operated on the territory of Sinkiang. Chinese Colonization Since time immemorial the western territories were viewed by the Chinese as one of the potential reservoirs for placing the excess manpower from the overpopulated eastern part of the country, with a small amount of land. The relatively unpopulated steppe areas, which seemed, to the Chinese who were accustomed to population density, to be boundless. Actually, however, those areas could be assimilated for vegetable husbandry only at the expense of the vital interests of the local livestock growers. Actually the colonization always occurred only under armed guard, and most frequently military personnel were the settlers. In the nineteenth century they were Manchurian banner troops, and after the creation of the CPR the land was settled by an armed army corps of members of the Kuomintang, which was renamed the production and construction corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. It is obvious that this could not fail to cause dissatisfaction on the part of the local population. Today, when China's rapid economic development makes it possible to lessen the demographic pressure somewhat, the country has ben given the opportunity to shift manpower from vegetable husbandry to trade, services, and construction, and the nature of the colonization of the West is also changing. Therefore, one would scarcely think that the former Soviet Central Asia and Kazakhstan have any basis for fearing the mass penetration of Chinese with the purpose of settling their territory and assimilating it for vegetable husbandry. But the intensive use of raw-material resources is another matter. Under conditions when the ties between a Russia that is experiencing an economic slump and this region have been weakened, that region, naturally, turns toward China. If the situation does not change radically within the next few years, there is a serious danger that the Central Asian region will change from an agrarian, raw-materials appendage of Russia, to one degree or another, into a supplement to the economy of the Eastern giant.
