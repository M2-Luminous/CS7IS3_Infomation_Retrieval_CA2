But no such request was made. -- While we were waiting, secret preparations were made to establish a new unified parliamentary group "Kaishin" (Innovation) without consulting the SDP. -- The establishment of the new group infringes the relationship of trust among the coalition parties. -- After intensive discussions, we signed the coalition policy accord just prior to the establishment of a new government. This was the result of sincere efforts we had made from the standpoint of continuing the reform policies launched by the Hosokawa cabinet and of maintaining the framework of the coalition. -- It was agreed upon that a change in the formation of the government must be discussed among coalition parties. It is unpardonable for specific parties or individuals to ignore those processes and destroy the framework arbitrarily. -- The SDP cannot permit such arbitrary maneuvering by a new coalition government which amplifies the sense of distrust among the people in politics. Therefore, the SDP cannot remain as a member of the coalition, is determined to promote political reform together with the people, and cannot respond to calls for formation of a new cabinet. However, we will make every effort to help the economy recover, including the enactment of the fiscal 1994 budget as promised.
