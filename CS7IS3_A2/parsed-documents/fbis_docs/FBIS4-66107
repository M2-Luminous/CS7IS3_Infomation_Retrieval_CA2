In a confidential concept for the planned European armament agency, it says that the project is useful only if the national restrictions are abolished. The paper, which has been obtained by DPA, suggests giving up the passage in the Maastricht Treaty on Europe, which expressly leaves decisions about the production and trade with military materiel to the individual countries. In the future, the planned agency is to decide on armament deals instead. For this purpose, the paper recommends treating the future decisions of other countries on armament deliveries in such a way "as if the export decision of the partner were one's own, even if it has not been made for one's own country." In this way the looser restrictions of France, for instance, would be applied also to German armament exports. In addition, it is suggested that more restrained partners, such as Great Britain, be excluded. Instead of a forthcoming "minimal solution," Germany should join "four of five" really determined European partners for armament exports. Then the free competition would "bring a net profit to the efficient German armament industry as a whole." Obviously, the concept has not yet been coordinated with the Foreign Ministry and the Economics Ministry in Bonn. According to the defense minister, the point is not loosening arms export regulations but "harmonizing armament efforts." In a statement the Defense Ministry pointed to the decision of the Maastricht summit in 1991, according to which a "real European security and defense identity" should be developed. This includes more intensive armament cooperation with the goal of a common armament agency. The concept is only a "discussion paper at the working level," which presents first considerations. A Foreign Ministry spokesman said upon inquiry that the paper is not known to the Ministry.
