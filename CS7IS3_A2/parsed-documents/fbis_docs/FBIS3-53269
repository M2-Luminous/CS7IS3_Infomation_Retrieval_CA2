[passage omitted] After the meeting, Information Minister Safwat al-Sharif noted that this was the first meeting chaired by President Mubarak after forming the new Secretariat. He said the NDP has now formed all its leaderships and structures. Al-Sharif said that President Mubarak discussed party and national work at this stage and in the future, touching on several basic issues such as economy, economic reforms and the progress made therein, and the side-effects of the economic reform policy. The president also dealt with a number of political issues, notably national dialogue, democratic practice, confronting terrorism, and the role of the NDP in creating a climate for political and economic reforms and addressing people's daily concerns. [passage omitted] The information minister said President Mubarak pointed out that the economic situation looms as the most important issue for society. Addressing that issue and creating an appropriate living standard for society is not possible without a sound economy that takes into consideration population growth, the president said. Mubarak reviewed the developments of the economic crisis that face Egypt and explained the stages of the economic reforms. He noted that the reforms and their progress are not isolated from Egypt's internal and foreign policies. They were linked, he said, to Egypt's ability to restore its Arab and international status, to capitalize on its international relations, and to deal and interact with the issues of the region. He said this ability largely helped achieve international backing for Egypt's economy and cancellation of Egypt's debts. The president pointed out that the debts that were written off were equal in value to Egypt's investments in the rebuilding of the infrastructure during the first and second development plans. [passage omitted] Minister al-Sharif said President Mubarak pointed out the phenomenon of terrorism, which aims to harm Egypt's achievements and the interests of the people. The president stressed his eagerness to serve citizens' interests and ensure security and safety for all Egyptians, noting that all Egyptians reject terrorism. President Mubarak also discussed the role of the NDP in political and social work to strengthen society and mobilize its forces to confront terrorism, expose its false allegations, and protect youths from sliding into wrong notions. [passage omitted] On the national dialogue, President Mubarak said his call for a dialogue proceeds from the public interest and from a desire to preserve Egypt and the future of its sons. He said he hoped the dialogue will be objective, honest, and devoid of any maneuvers or one-upmanship by any party. [passage omitted] On foreign policy, President Mubarak discussed Egypt's Arab relations, noting that they are good with all the brothers. He said relations are strong and firm with the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz of Saudi Arabia; His Highness Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan, president of the United Arab Emirates [UAE]; and Sultan Qabus of Oman. The president noted cooperation with the leadership, government, and people of Saudi Arabia, and he also noted strong firm relations with Oman, the UAE, Kuwait, Qatar, and Bahrain. The president said the priority is now to achieve Arab reconciliation, and he noted the importance of Arab cooperation and coordination in facing challenges. President Mubarak said that despite differences, Egypt is against any attempt to harm the territorial integrity of Iraq or Sudan, and is against fragmentation and struggle in Yemen. He said Egypt is working with Africa to solve the deteriorating situation in Somalia. On Bosnia-Herzegovina, Mubarak said what the people there are facing can be described as an international scandal. The information minister said that President Mubarak explained Egypt's role in the Middle East and its attempts to bring viewpoints closer, whether in the meeting between Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. President Bill Clinton, in overcoming the obstacles facing the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations, or in moves concerning southern Lebanon. The president noted that the road is still long and needs determination without relinquishment of rights. He also noted Egypt's efforts to solve the Libyan-Western crisis and said that Egypt interacts with the international community while preserving Egyptian dignity and appreciating the country's weight and culture. He said Egypt knows its Arab role as a backer of the brothers, its African role in defending the causes of the continent, and its Islamic role as an influential country.
