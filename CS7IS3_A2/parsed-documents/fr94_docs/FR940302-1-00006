FR940302-1-00006 FR940302-1-00002 We are proposing to amend §94.11(a) by adding Hungary to the list of countries that have been declared free of rinderpest and FMD but from which the importation into the United States of meat and other animal products is restricted. The countries listed in §94.11(a) are subject to these restrictions because they: (1) Supplement their national meat supply by importing fresh, chilled, or frozen meat of ruminants or swine from countries that are designated in §94.1(a) as infected with rinderpest or FMD; (2) have a common land border with countries designated as infected with rinderpest or FMD; or (3) import ruminants or swine from countries designated as infected with rinderpest or FMD under conditions less restrictive than would be acceptable for importation into the United States. Hungary supplements its national meat supply by importing fresh, chilled, and frozen meat of ruminants and swine from countries designated in §94.1(a)(1) as countries in which rinderpest or FMD exists. In addition, Hungary has common land borders with Slovakia, Ukraine, Romania, Yugoslavia, Croatia, and Slovenia, which are designated in §94.1(a)(1) as countries in which rinderpest or FMD exists. As a result, even though Hungary appears to qualify for designation as a country free of rinderpest and FMD, there is the potential for meat or other animal products produced in Hungary to be commingled with the fresh, chilled, or frozen meat of animals from a country in which rinderpest and FMD exists. This potential for commingling constitutes an undue risk of introducing rinderpest or FMD into the United States. Therefore, we are proposing that meat and other animal products of ruminants or swine, as well as any ship's stores, airplane meals, or baggage containing such meat or other animal products, offered for importation into the United States from Hungary be subject to the restrictions specified in §94.11 of the regulations in addition to the applicable regulations of the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service, which are located in 9 CFR chapter III. Section 94.11 generally requires that the meat and other animal products of ruminants or swine be: (1) Prepared in an inspected establishment that is eligible to have its products imported into the United States under the Federal Meat Inspection Act; and (2) accompanied by an additional certification from a full-time salaried veterinary official of the national government of the exporting country, stating that the meat or other animal product has not been commingled with or exposed to meat or other animal products originating in, imported from, or transported through a country infected with rinderpest or FMD. We are also proposing to add Hungary to a third list, this one in §94.1(d)(1). All countries in which rinderpest or FMD has been known to exist that have been declared free of rinderpest and FMD on or after September 28, 1990, must be added to this list. Adding Hungary to this list would mean that no llama or alpaca could be imported or entered into the United States from Hungary unless in accordance with 9 CFR 92.435. We are not, however, aware of any llamas or alpacas in Hungary that are available for export. Miscellaneous In addition to the proposed changes set forth above, we would correct the paragraph designations used in §94.9(b)(1)(ii) and (iii). In each of those paragraphs, italicized lowercase letters were used where normal uppercase letters are needed. Also in §94.9, we would make several nonsubstantive editorial changes for the sake of clarity or to correct grammatical errors. Finally, in §94.11(a), we would adjust the order in which three countries appear to restore alphabetical order to the list of countries in that paragraph. Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. For this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived its review process required by Executive Order 12866. This proposed rule, if adopted, would amend the regulations in part 94 by adding Hungary to the list of countries declared to be free of rinderpest and FMD. This action would remove the prohibition on the importation into the United States, from Hungary, of ruminants and fresh, chilled, and frozen meat of ruminants, although those importations would be subject to certain restrictions. This proposed revision would also relieve restrictions on the importation, from Hungary, of milk and milk products of ruminants. Based on available information, the Department does not anticipate a major increase in exports of ruminants and fresh, chilled, or frozen meat of ruminants from Hungary into the United States as a result of this proposed rule.
