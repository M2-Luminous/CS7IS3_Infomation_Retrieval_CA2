Politics touches particularly complex and sensitive social relationships of which class relationship is the core. Politics is the relationships among social classes and groups in the competition for and the maintenance and use of state power. Therefore, touching politics is touching the state, the social system, the survival of the social system. Concentration on renovation is possible only if there is political stability; if there is no political stability, nothing can be done. For this reason, political stability is the basis for social stability in general; political instability is likely to result in instability in other areas of society. Two forms of political stability can be seen in reality. There is a form of stability that is synonymous with sluggishness and nondevelopment. Naturally, such stability can hardly last; very often it becomes the cause of instability later on. The form of stability we would like to talk about here is the one linked with development, the form of stability with development and for development. This stability is not a purpose in itself; on the contrary, this stability is only a condition, and it is development that is the purpose. In this sense, political stability becomes an indispensable condition for and factor of development. Political stability is not in opposition to political renovation. Therefore, we should not fear political renovation because of our desire for political stability. To carry out political renovation we must achieve political stability, but to achieve basic, lasting sociopolitical stability, political renovation must be carried out in the right direction and in an efficient manner. Stability must be achieved by means of renovation and through renovation. So, political stability is both a precondition for and a result of political renovation. Political stability is dialectically unified with political renovation; in stability there is renovation, and in renovation there is stability. Thus, political stability implies alteration and change, but such alteration and change must be in harmony with the set socioeconomic development objectives instead of running counter to it, and basically must be controlled by the leading and managing subjects, namely the party and state. It can be said that, political stability is political renovation carried out in a principled manner and in conformity with our party's renovative line. According to the aforementioned concept, the task of firmly maintaining political stability in order to renovate politics and other aspects implies the following basic factors: -- Firmly maintaining the party's right to leadership over the political system and all society. This means that the party must really holds power and its objectives, viewpoints, and principles must be thoroughly reflected in its renovative line. -- Firmly maintaining the political system with the state apparatus as a state of the people, by the people, and for the people. Although the organizational structure and personnel of the state may change, the political character of our state must not be changed. -- Firmly maintaining our legal system. Laws may be revised, amended, and refined, but their class nature and their focus on the people's interest must not be altered. This legal system compels all citizens, including cadres, party members, power holders, and party and state organizations to abide by the law. Over the past years we have recorded very important initial achievements in firmly maintaining political stability and renovating the political system in an extremely complex international and domestic situation resulting from the collapse of the socialist system in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, from the intensification of domestic hostile forces' scheme of sabotaging our regime, and from the socioeconomic difficulties which became severe at times. The successful maintenance of political stability, as it was done in the recent past, has become a prerequisite for ensuring the success of the renovation undertaking. Political stability is also a very basic factor in broadening international relations and attracting foreign capital investment. Political stability has contributed to checking the drop in public confidence in the party and state. Looking back at the past few years, we can see that our political system has taken a step in renovating the organization and mode of operation of the party and state. The sociopolitical organizations have developed in a more diversified manner, and their social character and initiative have been enhanced. A democratization process has been initiated within the party and in society at large, and democracy has developed further in the economic, political, cultural, and ideological fields. The roles of the National Assembly, the mass organizations, and the mass media have grown markedly. These achievements would have been impossible if there had been no achievements in economic renovation. Recent economic renovation has been the most outstanding achievement of all, and it is due to economic renovation that political stability has been maintained and the political system has been renovated in accordance with the demand of economic development. However, the achievements in maintaining political stability and in renovating the political system are attributable not only to economic renovation but also to other important factors such as: -- The roles of various elements in the political system, especially the role of the party. Our party has been able to set forth at an early date a correct renovative line that conforms to objective realities and responds to the masses' aspirations, and has known how to carry out renovation in a principled manner and through appropriate steps. -- Our people and nation, with their tradition of following the party, have voluntarily accepted the party leadership because they do not want to lose political stability and do not want to see the social system collapse. All our people want political stability so that they can "earn their living," develop the economy, and raise their living standards. They do not want political pluralism and multiparty opposition, which will only cause social chaos. -- Our army and security forces, which are always loyal to the party and the people and have considerable experience in defending the fatherland and in firmly maintaining political security and social order and safety, have actively and effectively opposed the "peaceful evolution" scheme of the hostile forces. However, next to the achievements already recorded, there remain numerous problems that we must continue to resolve. Specifically, they are the following: -- Recently, our economic renovation undertaking has only recorded initial achievements, and the market economy mechanism has just begun to take shape. There has been considerable confusion in determining the socialist orientation in the conditions of market economy, and both the theoretical and practical aspects of this issue have not yet been clarified. Development of the market economy and multisectorial economy has inevitably altered the social and class structure and, through this, will affect the political system and may cause new complications in the political domain. In addition, the hostile forces are taking advantage of our economic and cultural open-door policy to carry out sabotage with the aim of causing political instability and eventually changing the political direction. -- The regulatory and managerial capability of our state in the market economic is still weak, which may easily lead to chaos and confusion in the economy and society and violations of the law and morality (such as the phenomena of tax evasion, counterfeiting, corruption, smuggling, and so forth...). This is a favorable environment for speculators to collude with degenerate and deviant persons in various state agencies, and this is the chief, direct cause of corruption and smuggling. -- A section of the people, including cadres and party members, and especially the youth, still vacillate in their faith and their socialist ideal, and in their confidence in the socialist path. -- The renovation of organization and of the mode of operation of the party, the state, and the various mass organization is still ineffective. Renovation of the political system is not yet really commensurate with economic renovation, particularly with regard to organization and the management apparatus. The state machinery remains bulky and bureaucratic and has not yet been reformed to any appreciable extent. The legal system is still deficient and lacks uniformity, the effectiveness of laws and regulations remains low, and laws and social order and discipline are still being seriously violated. The party's activities in the market mechanism still show no little confusion. Many problems concerning the building of the rule-of-law state remain unclarified. An operational mechanism ensuring the unification of power while effecting a division of labor and responsibility among the legislative, executive, and judiciary organs in the conditions of market economy has not yet been clearly established. -- There have appeared a number of factors that may cause political instability: the activities of "peaceful evolution," sabotage, violence, and subversion of reactionaries at home and abroad. Although these factors have not yet led to political conflict, they should not be lightly dismissed; on the contrary, we must fully perceive their complexity, dangers, and consequences at an early date in order to take active measures to guard against, prevent, and overcome them. From the realities of firmly maintaining political stability and renovating the political system over the past years we can draw a number of conclusions as follows: 1. Resolutely and firmly maintain and renovate the party leadership and do not accept political pluralism and multiparty opposition. Recognizing political pluralism and multiparty opposition is tantamount to creating proper conditions for the enemies of the class to rear their heads and to contend with our party for the right to leadership, thereby causing political instability and sabotaging and toppling our regime. 2. Correctly combine economic renovation and political renovation, using economic renovation as the basis and political renovation as the key link. When we say using economic renovation as the basis we mean that political renovation must proceed from the economy and in accordance with the demand of economic development. However, this does not mean that political renovation is dependent on economic renovation in a mechanical, totally passive manner as "the tail" of economic renovation; on the contrary, politics must play an active role because it is a subjective factor. When resolving economic issues we should have correct political viewpoints. Therefore, to carry out economic renovation there must be at least some political renovation and some renovation of the economic thinking among the basic elements of the the political system, namely the party and state. For this reason, economic renovation is possible only if there is a gradual political renovation; we must take the initiative in gradually unscrambling each link of the political system to create proper conditions for economic renovation. For this reason, Lenin on the one hand regarded politics as the concentrated manifestation of economy and on the other hand held that politics must take precedence over economy. 3. Continue to consider economic renovation to be the focal point, actively develop the economy, and resolve the pressing problems concerning the people's living standards. Through this effort we must continue to restore the people's confidence in the party and to unravel psychological and ideological entanglements. 4. Resolve social problems to create a wholesome social environment for political stability and renovation. To this aim, we must resolve the burning issues; for example, we must effectively combat corruption and smuggling, struggle against obnoxious cultural products coming from abroad to cause moral "pollution," reduce social injustice, create many more jobs for the people, limit the division between the rich and the poor, and satisfactorily resolve the land issue in the countryside to avoid turning it into a "hot point" likely to cause social explosions. We must heighten vigilance against the "peaceful evolution" scheme and resolutely suppress sabotage, rebellious, and subversive activities of the reactionaries at home and abroad.
