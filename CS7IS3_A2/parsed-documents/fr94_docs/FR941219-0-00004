FR941219-0-00004 FR941219-0-00002 5 CFR Part 1201 Practices and Procedures AGENCY: Merit Systems Protection Board. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Board is amending its rules to update and clarify various provisions and to ensure that the rules in this part, as a whole, are effective, consistent, sensible, and understandable, in accordance with Executive Order 12866 of September 30, 1993. By making this amendment, the Board is providing current and consistent information to its customers regarding its adjudicatory practices and procedures. EFFECTIVE DATE: December 19, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert E. Taylor, Clerk of the Board, 202&hyph;653&hyph;7200. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Merit Systems Protection Board is amending its rules at 5 CFR part 1201 to add a new appealable action and to correct the citations for two others in §1201.3(a); to delete §1201.3(d); to clarify the place of filing requirements in §§1201.4(d), 1201.22(a), and 1201.182 following the realignment of the Board's regional and field offices; to correct a cross-reference in §1201.37(a); to conform the method of filing requirements for original jurisdiction cases in §1201.122(c) to those for appellate jurisdiction cases; to replace the July 1991 edition of the MSPB Appeal Form in Appendix I with the revised October 1994 edition; to add information regarding the TDD (Telecommunications Device for the Deaf) capability of facsimile numbers in the regional and field offices, add the suite number of the Atlanta Regional Office, and change the address and facsimile number of the Denver Field Office in Appendix II; and to add and delete approved hearing locations in Appendix III. (a) Section 1201.3(a)(6) is amended by adding 5 CFR part 844 to the citation so that the citation refers to the part of the regulations of the Office of Personnel Management governing disability retirement determinations under the Federal Employees' Retirement System, as well as to 5 CFR parts 831 and 842. (b) Section 1201.3(a)(7) is amended by correcting the citation to read ``5 CFR 731.103(d) and 731.508.'' The corrected citation refers to the regulations of the Office of Personnel Management providing for appeals to the Board of suitability determinations made by an agency acting under authority delegated by OPM (5 CFR 731.103(d)) and such determinations made by OPM (5 CFR 731.508). (c) Section 1201.3(a) is amended by adding a new subparagraph (21) to include as an action appealable to the Board a reduction-in-force action affecting a career or career candidate appointee in the Foreign Service. Public Law 103&hyph;326, effective April 30, 1994, amended the Foreign Service Act of 1980 (22 U.S.C. 4001 et seq.) by, inter alia, providing authority to the Secretary of State to conduct reductions in force affecting career or career candidate appointees in the Foreign Service and by granting those appointees the right to appeal such reduction-in-force actions to the Board. (d) Section 1201.3 is amended by deleting paragraph (d). This paragraph was added to the Board's rules in this part to implement 5 U.S.C. 1221(j), as added by the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;12). Subsequently, the Board ruled in McCann v. Navy, 57 M.S.P.R. 288 (1993) that 5 U.S.C. 1221(j) and the Board's regulation at 5 CFR 1201.3(d) should be construed to apply only to individual right of action appeals and other actions established by 5 U.S.C. chapter 12. Because the provisions of part 1201 are applicable to appeals that arise from actions other than those established by 5 U.S.C. chapter 12, the Board has determined that the continued inclusion of §1201.3(d) in this part is likely to prove confusing to parties and that it should, therefore, be deleted.
