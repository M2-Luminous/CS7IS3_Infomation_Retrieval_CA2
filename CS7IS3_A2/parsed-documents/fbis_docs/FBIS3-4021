Liu Zheng, deputy secretary general of the National People's Congress [NPC] Standing Committee, was invited to deliver a report on the study of the "PRC law on the people's deputies to the NPC and the local people's congresses at all levels." Chen Xitong, Li Qiyan, and Wang Daming attended the report meeting. Chen Guangwen, deputy secretary of the municipal party committee, presided over the report meeting. In his report, Comrade Liu Zheng vividly expounded the nature, substance, and meaning of the "Law on Deputies" in line with China's fundamental political system--the people's congress system. He pointed out: The "Law on Deputies" is one of the laws related to the people's congress system. This law has further defined the legal status of deputies and specifically stipulated the work of deputies during the people's congress session, their activities after the conclusion of the session, and the guarantee for deputies to exercise their duties. The promulgation of the "Law on Deputies" has provided a legal basis for deputies to exercise their functions, authority, and obligation, and to give play to their role. It is also conducive to further improving China's people's congress system, promoting socialist democracy and the legal system, and guaranteeing the smooth progress of reform, opening up, and modernization. Addressing the report meeting, Comrade Chen Xitong pointed out: In order to promote the study of leading cadres at all levels, the municipal party committee has held several study and report meetings. To strengthen study, the most fundamental thing for the leading comrades to do is to study well Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and Volume No. 3 of "The Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping" and to conscientiously study the "decision" of the third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and a series of supporting laws, regulations, and methods related to the "decision." Only by conscientiously studying the law can we implement it and accelerate the establishment of the socialist market economic structure. Comrade Chen Xitong also pointed out: All county and district end-of-term elections have ended recently. Leading cadres at all levels should pay attention to studying and implementing the "Law on Deputies," and the relevant substance of the People's Congress system. We must clarify that if party committees and governments at all levels want to do their work well, they must respect deputies, support their work, and give play to their role. The people's deputies represent the interests and will of the masses of people. Practice has proved that if greater attention and support are paid to deputies, they can carry out their work more smoothly and do more things in conformity with the will of the people. We should welcome supervision from deputies and regard their supervision as their help to the work of the party committees and governments at all levels. This will help us to do a better job in serving the people and realizing the objective of becoming well-off three years ahead of schedule. Leading comrades of the municipal party committee, the municipal people's congress standing committee, the municipal government, the municipal committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and the municipal discipline inspection commission, principal responsible comrades of departments, committees and offices of the municipal government and of various districts, counties, and bureaus, and principal responsible comrades of the municipal Trade Union Council, the Communist Youth League, and the Women's Federation also attended the meeting.
