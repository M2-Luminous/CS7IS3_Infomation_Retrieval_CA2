The OECD predicted Japan's economy will grow 0.8 percent for 1994 from a year earlier, revised upward from a 0.5 percent growth forecast made last December. The figures, to be submitted to an OECD ministerial meeting to be held Tuesday and Wednesday in Paris, are in terms of gross domestic product (GDP), which measures the total value of goods and services produced within the country. The OECD officials also said the U.S. economy will advance 4.0 percent, compared with 3.1 percent estimated previously, and the German economy was forecast to grow 1.8 percent, up from the earlier prediction of 0.8 percent. The average projected growth figure for the 25 OECD member countries for 1994 was given as 2.6 percent, compared with the previously estimated 2.1 percent. The officials attributed the upward revision to the advancing U.S. economy, boosted by growing domestic demand and steady exports, and improved exports from Germany and other European nations as well as the ongoing effect of Japan's economic pump-priming measures launched in February. They said, however, that Japan's economic growth will remain sluggish, in contrast with the recovering world economy. The Japanese Government has forecast a 2.4 percent growth for fiscal 1994 that started April 1. For 1995 projections, Japan's economy is forecast to show a 2.7 percent year-on-year expansion, while the U.S. is projected to expand by 3.0 percent and germany by 2.6 percent, the officials said. Following are the real economic growth rates in percentage for 1993 and their forecasts for 1994, with the December 1993 projections in parentheses. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Real GDP Growth | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |1993 |1994 Forecast | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Japan |0.1 |0.8 (0.5) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |U.S. |3.0 |4.0 (3.1) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Germany |-1.3 |1.8 (0.8) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |OECD |1.2 |2.6 (2.1) | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
