Ahtisaari noted, in connection with an article that appeared in the newspaper SAVON SANOMAT last Tuesday [26 April], that such a debate should have taken place at the time when Vayrynen was also in the cabinet and was party to the decision to apply for membership. Ahtisaari said that he had not noticed Vayrynen's comments receiving any significant support from within the party. "This is the opinion of a single citizen, who, of course, is entitled to voice it," concluded Ahtisaari.
