Sometimes, nature surrounding us can cause us -- tired and nervous with everyday complexities -- to become wild, and then we claim that protection of nature is not our affair. Our correspondent queried Alyaksandr Matsyasovich, head of the Information and Public Relations Department within the State Committee for Ecological Issues, on the pressing ecology issues in Belarus. Matsyasovich: At the start, I would like to note that our Republic is characterized by an irrational use of natural resources. Before, we connected this fact with domineering economic relations: Energy and natural resources had to be used most effectively and no one was interested in the effectiveness of production [as published]. Low quality production brought about a lot of waste which was not processed. For example, yearly, around 4.5 tonnes of domestic and industrial waste (per capita!) is being produced in Belarus. Only two enterprises in Belarus -- in Minsk and Mogilev -- are dealing with the partial processing of waste. A powerful Minsk factory is processing barely 30 percent of this waste. The unprocessed waste is being dumped. Officially, our dumps occupy an area of more than 10,000 hectares. However, no one has ever calculated the area occupied by unofficial dumps.... A second problem is the large-scale intrusion into nature. Many types of plants, animals, and insects have disappeared. We are currently living in a situation where former wet regions of Polesye are suffering from lack of water, especially, in Gomel Oblast. Hyerasimaw: Alyaksandr Alfonsavich, could you please remind us what natural resources we are rich in and how we are using them? Matsyasovich: First, our water resources. Almost all our cities have more or less effective purifying stations. However, purifying stations in some of our regions are overloaded and overutilized. Minsk purifying stations are in the latter category. We cannot drink water from our rivers. Due to the improper use of fertilizers and insecticides, the agricultural sector of Belarus presents the greatest danger to our rivers. However, it is because of the improper behavior of people that nature suffers most of all. The main polluter of our rivers is ... oil! If in southern Belarus -- where oil lies close to the surface -- the outer surface is polluted due to the oil's outlet to the surface, the oil pollution of our remaining areas is caused by the improper use of oil resources. Our water purity records usually exceed normal levels from one- two to 40 points, like in Soligorsk. Verkhnedvinskiy, Nesvizhskiy Rayons, and some rayons of Brest and Grodno Oblasts suffer from a high level of water pollution as well. Further, some 3 million tonnes of polluted substances are discharged in the air. This equals the amount of toxic substances polluting the air of Zaporozhie and Krivoy Rog taken together. Maybe this is not much, but Belarus, located in a specific geographical zone, is to a greater extent polluted by transferred air masses from other territories. If we are to believe West European experts, the Belarusian atmosphere is polluted in 18-20 percent by its own sources and in 80-82 percent -- by someone else's. From all the Belarusian cities, Novopolotsk is in an extremely serious ecological situation. However, in 1993, air pollution in Novopolotsk was decreased by 22 percent. This time, it is connected not to the upgrading of the production capacity, but to the fall of the economy. The Kuybyshev factory in Mogilev is very harmful from an ecological standpoint. To my regret, we cannot do anything to improve the situation because this factory is located in the center of the city. We cannot move people, or this enterprise, or close this dangerous giant producing one of the most poisonous chemical substances. In addition, there is not enough room to build effective purifying stations. Many years ago, Belarus signed a range of international agreements, one of which stipulates specific amounts of nitrogen oxides discharged into the air. These agreements hamper the development of our power industry. These agreements do not allow operating the new electric power plant No. 5 which was built in Minsk. At the same time, the Republic badly needs electric energy. We cannot afford to buy a good purifying installation from Japan or Germany. Power engineering in Belarus is going to ask the international community for permission to temporarily sidestep the above-mentioned agreements until the Republic stabilizes the work of power engineering. Recently, Portugal has received such permission. By the way, Portugal, Poland, Rumania, and Malta are leading polluters in the world. Hyerasimaw: Our Republic should have an effective legal footing and appropriate state institutions and organizations to resolve ecology issues. Are we moving forward in this direction? Matsyasovich: First of all, responsibility for the protection of nature should be carried out by environmental users themselves. We have the ``Law on Nature Protection.'' Therefore, any enterprise, including small ones, should keep to existing norms. It is difficult because they lack proper technologies and purifying equipment. Our State Committee for Ecological Issues controls the implementation of ecological laws. Violation of these laws brings about financial and administrative penalties. We can even close enterprises that violate these laws. Yes, this issue is not properly organized in our Republic. In my opinion, hereditary factors of the old administrative system still affect our actions. [Matsyasovich continues] Anyway, we could improve the entire ecological situation, especially our specific institutions dealing with Chernobyl issues and following their own programs. We require perspective, and a scientifically grounded ecological policy. We require systematic monitoring, scientific vision, etc. We have a relatively high research potential. Already in the 1970's, Belarusian researchers conducted a scientific prognosis for the next 20 years, and they had prognosticated much of what we are experiencing today. However, nobody wanted to listen to them then. We have interesting research projects. It is essential to find such economic levers that could make our producers use natural resources rationally. It sounds incredible, but our legislation has no notion of the so-called ``ecological crime.'' Following is one of many examples. In Novopolotsk, around 90,000 tonnes of high toxic substances have been spilled into the Dvina river. Later, they reached the Baltic Sea and caused the death of fish. The operator and the security engineer were tried for violation of security rules but not for any serious ``ecological crime.'' Violators of ecological laws are fined for polluting water or for poaching. So, what about the land and air? Currently, an ecological code of laws including 16 laws is being drafted. We have adopted the ``Law on the Protection of the Environment,'' ``On Ecological Examination,'' ``On Ecological Taxation,'' ``On Waste.'' The laws ``On Protected Territories,'' ``On Ecological Education,'' and ``On Regulation of the State Control System'' are being drafted. We should create a single system of state control. Just at the moment, the state control system is split. The State Committee for Protection of the Environment, the State Committee for Land Reform, the Ministry of Forestry controlling the use and protection of forests, the Chief Department of Belarusian Fish Industry, the Chief Committee for Water, Meteorology [Belhidramet], and various sanitary services do not cooperate. None of these institutions has enough powers. We should also speak about the examination of projects by state experts, the system for the ecological education of experts, the ecological culture of the population, and the use of international experience. Hyerasimaw: Yes, there are a lot of problems. However, can we hope that they will be resolved? Matsyasovich: In my opinion, we will be able to resolve them. In the spring of 1993, the Belarusian Cabinet of Ministers adopted a decree stipulating the upgrading of the monitoring system. This decree will be implemented in 1994-95. The decree on the introduction of regular land surveys has also been adopted. This means that the use of all natural resources will be strictly controlled, and the natural resources will be subject to normative use. If we consider forestry, I can say the following. The corresponding laws that had been adopted are being currently implemented in this sphere. Felling does not exceed the growth of forests. You know, after the 1941-45 war, the greatest part of our forests was destroyed. Only 2.5 percent of the mature forest is left. Currently, a third of Belarus is covered by forests. In other words, the program of use and restoration of forests is being implemented. First of all, we require a protection system for all our natural resources. Of course, if new laws are adopted they will be implemented and we will make progress. Hyerasimaw: I wish you success. Thank you for the interview.
