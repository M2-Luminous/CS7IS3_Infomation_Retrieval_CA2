Meanwhile, concerning the voluntary market-opening package aimed at cutting the trade surplus which the government will formulate within this month, most executives noted a need to formulate concrete measures to ease regulations and expand domestic demand, including tax cuts and increased public investment. In reply to a question on the Japan-U.S. summit breakdown, executives of 67 companies stated, "It was regrettable, but for the sake of building new bilateral relations it could not have been avoided." Only three answered, "It was only natural because the U.S. demand was unreasonable." In the meanwhile, only four executives answered that "Japan should have compromised." What is noteworthy is that as many as 26 executives gave other answers, and most of them pointed out that the government had failed to make sufficient efforts to establish a "mature relationship." For example, several chemical company executives said, "What the government should have done was not only to reject U.S. demands but also to present alternative plans for cutting the trade surplus while taking the other side's position into consideration." The results of the poll have revealed companies' strong hopes for the market-opening package now being formulated by the government. A financial company's executive said, "It is desirable that the government indicate definite measures to cut the trade surplus." Executives of 81 companies requested that "demand be expanded by taking such microeconomic measures as tax cuts and increased public investment." Also, executives from 71 companies called on the government to include in the package "concrete goals to achieve deregulation and to correct the gap in prices between goods at home and abroad."
