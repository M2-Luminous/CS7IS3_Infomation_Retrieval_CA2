A comparison study of two polls carried out in January and February shows the trust Cubans have in the results of this consultation process, said Dario Machado, director of the social political studies center, in charge of the polls. Preliminary data shows that the percentage of people who responded positively to the question of whether the consultation process has awakened enthusiasm among workers, climbed from 62 percent in January, to 80 percent in February. Local authorities have put off taking any measures to reduce the imbalance of domestic finances until the results of the broad study made in factories and other work sectors are received, including private farming, which began in January at the initiative of the Cuban Workers Federation. The official decision to face the difficult economic moment (caused by the loss of the country's main partners, the former Soviet-European socialist field) without changing principles of social justice, encourage financial maladjustments or its worsening, local sources indicate. State Committee for Finance Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez recently recalled that despite the situation, Cuba maintains average employment and income levels, similar to 1989; in addition, Cuba raised health and social security budgets 10 percent and 33 percent, respectively, compared to 1989. President Fidel Castro said that to face the economic difficulties, neoliberal mechanisms of dramatic consequences in other countries would not be used, and no Cuban will be left unprotected. In the work site debates, popularly known as the workers' parliament, workers suggest ideas to improve productive efficiency in their direct activity, and immediately afterward, they propose alternatives to solve the country's problems. Results from the polls by the social economic center show that the percentage of people who trust that this consultation process will yield useful proposals, increased from 75 percent in January to 84 percent in February. Likewise, Machado reported, the number of those who believe that this consultation process is worthwhile increased from 86 percent in January to 91 percent in February. Conversely, the first poll showed that only 0.2 percent of those polled called for a change in the economic system, 0.3 percent were concerned that workers' suggestions were not taken into account, and 4.7 percent believed that these measures would not be effective. Work site meetings will last until 15 March and the workers' proposals will be taken by the Cuban Workers Federation to the country's highest levels, including the National Assembly of the People's Government. The parliament, which last year made a preliminary analysis of the situation, plans to hold an extraordinary session -- date has not been announced yet -- to consider the domestic financial situation.
