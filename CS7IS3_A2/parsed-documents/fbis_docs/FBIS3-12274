They also denounced the 27-month-old Arab-Israeli peace process and demanded that the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) renounce its Sept. 13 autonomy agreement with Israel and leave the peace talks altogether. Calls for retribution for the attack in the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron, where an Israeli settler opened machine-gun fire on worshippers early Friday, were a dominant theme for a demonstration in this camp of nearly 100,000 residents. "Where are you Saddam, where are your missiles," chanted the crowd, repeating after half a dozen masked youths perched atop a pickup truck mounted with loud speakers. They were referring to Iraqi President Saddam Husayn, who fired more than 40 long-range missiles at Israel during the 1991 Gulf War over Kuwait. For many residents of this squalid camp, President Saddam, despite Iraq's defeat in the war, remains a hero who was entrapped by the U.S. and other Israeli allies into a war aimed at eliminating Iraq's military power which they saw as a potential threat to the Jewish state. "Would the Israelis dare to slaughter Palestinians if Iraq was as strong as it was before the war?" asked Husayn who wore a headdress to conceal his face. The situation in al-Baq'ah appeared under control, but residents said emotions ran high and that they could not rule out individual acts of violence similar to an attack in downtown Amman where a British tourist was stabbed by a native of Hebron. "People are enraged and seething with anger and frustration over their inability to do anything to avenge the killings," said an elderly grocer in al-Baq'ah. "Many people here are from Hebron and no doubt some of their relatives were among the dead and injured at Ibrahimi Mosque." Black flags hung over electric poles and men and women gathered at street corners listening to radios and exchanging information to find out whether any of their relatives were among the victims of the attack. Rejection of the peace talks with Israel was another dominant call of the protesters as they wound through the narrow streets of this camp, one of 11 camps housing nearly 300,000 Palestinian refugees in Jordan. "No to peace and yes to the gun," they chanted, demanding an end to Palestinain participation in the peace negotiations. "No to self-rule, yes to holy war." Despite the relative strength of PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat's mainstream Fatah among al-Baq'ah residents, many of those taking part in the protest said they felt the PLO-led peace talks with Israel were getting nowhere. "As the talks get from one round to another, it is becoming increasingly clear that Israel has no intention of returning the land to us," said Walid Nash'at, who was seven when his family fled their home village in the West Bank in 1967. "I supported the autonomy accord from the very beginning, hoping that it would lead to a just solution to our problems," said 'Amr, an electrician who declined to give his second name. "But it seems that our problems are only getting worse, if Israelis can massacre Palestinians with impunity," he said. Muhammad 'Uwaydah, an Islamic Action Front (IAF) member of Parliament from al-Baq'ah, told the rally: "Today's killing has proved that there cannot be any coexistence with Israel." "I call on the Palestinian leadership to withdraw from the peace talks," he said as the crowd shouted: "Allahu Akbar" and "Jihad (holy war) is the only road to Palestine."
