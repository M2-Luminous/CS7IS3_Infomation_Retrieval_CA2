According to Krylov, previously, President Snegur declared that the president should be above any party's interests. "It might seem that the president has changed his political views, thought it is possible that he follows two objectives: to give more strength to the PDAM before local elections and to prepare to run as an agrarian for President in 1996, which are expected to be multi-party," said Krylov, mentioning that "today it is not too early to consider the next presidential elections and the PDAM will gain much strength from Snegur's membership."
