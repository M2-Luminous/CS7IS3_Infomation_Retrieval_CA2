FR941026-0-00050 FR941026-0-00018 FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION 47 CFR Part 1 [FCC 94&hyph;258] Ex Parte Rules AGENCY: Federal Communications Commission. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Commission has amended its ex parte rules to provide an exemption for presentation between the Commission and the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission, the other principal agencies responsible for promoting or ensuring competition in the telecommunications industry. This exemption will promote the public interest through the exchange of information and ideas between the Commission and lead to more effective enforcement and protection of the public interest. EFFECTIVE DATE: October 26, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Stephen Bailey, Office of General Counsel, (202) 418&hyph;1720. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Order Adopted: October 7, 1994. Released: October 21, 1994. By the Commission: 1. By this Order, we amend our ex parte rules to provide an exemption for presentations between the Commission and the Department of Justice or Federal Trade Commission relating to telecommunications competition matters. The rules are further amended to provide for disclosure of any new factual information obtained by the Commission in such presentations if such information is relied on by the Commission in the decision-making process. This exemption would not apply if the Department of Justice or Federal Trade Commission becomes a party to the proceeding, e.g., by the filing of comments in the proceeding. Nor would it apply if the proceeding is designated for hearing. 2. We believe that this exemption will promote the public interest through the exchange of information and ideas between the Commission and the other principal agencies responsible for promoting or ensuring competition in the telecommunications industry. It should lead to more effective enforcement and protection of the public interest, development and application of more consistent analytical methodologies, an improved, expedited license transfer process, and the possible avoidance of unnecessarily duplicative efforts. At the same time, the requirement for disclosure of any factual information relied on by the Commission will protect the rights of the parties. 3. Because the amendment adopted herein relates to agency practice and procedure, notice and comment is not required. 5 U.S.C. §553(b)(A). 4. Accordingly, it is ordered, that Part 1 of the Rules and Regulations of the Federal Communications Commission are amended as set forth below. 5. It is further ordered that these amendments to the Commission's Rules shall become effective upon publication in the Federal Register . See 5 U.S.C. §553(d). 6. Authority for this action is contained in Sections 4(i), 4(j), and 303(r) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. §§154(i), 154(j), and 303(r).
