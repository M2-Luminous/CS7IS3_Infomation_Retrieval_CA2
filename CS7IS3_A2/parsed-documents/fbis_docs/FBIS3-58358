The mere thought of such a trade-off has caused Agriculture Minister Karl-Erik Olsson to lash out, most recently after a DAGENS NYHETER interview with European Affairs Minister Ulf Dinkelspiel on Wednesday [5 January]. When DAGENS NYHETER wrote in its article that such a situation could arise, Karl-Erik Olsson rang Ulf Dinkelspiel and was, by his own admission, "a little heated." As a result Ulf Dinkelspiel contacted DAGENS NYHETER and underlined once again what he said in the interview: that each specialist area will be negotiated on its own merits. "I will not accept any trade-off or agree to these things being played off against each other," Dinkelspiel said firmly. Nevertheless, both Karl-Erik Olsson and Ulf Dinkelspiel admit that even though the Swedish Government's intentions are the best, no one can prevent the EU's negotiators from making such a linkage in the final phase of the negotiations. "That is the time when we could find ourselves in such a situation," Ulf Dinkelspiel said. "In the final stage of the negotiations you have to look at things as a whole." According to DAGENS NYHETER's information, the risk of this will probably be greater, the greater the number of agricultural issues which remain unresolved in the final phase. That is why the agriculture negotiations are under time pressure so that they do not give rise to the risk that money for farmers will be played off against the contribution to the EU budget from Sweden's state coffers. Ulf Dinkelspiel also revealed that Sweden is refraining from pushing its demand for a change to the basis on which membership contributions are calculated. This means that today Sweden is remaining firm on only one demand relating to its membership contribution -- namely that a phasing-in period of several years is granted before full contributions are made. The Swedish membership contribution is expected to be about 22 billion kronor. From the treasury's viewpoint a cut in agricultural subsidies would not be very much help. On the other hand, it could placate certain EU countries and help them accept a phasing-in period. The agricultural support which Sweden is granted and the membership contribution which Sweden will have to pay are not amounts of money which can be arrived at through rough estimates. There are clear rules for how they are to be calculated. This is the second time that the agriculture minister has reacted sharply to a cabinet colleague's presumed treachery vis-a-vis the farmers. The last time was when Finance Minister Anne Wibble said in Brussels on 23 November that the government must be prepared to "trade off one thing against something different." After a sharp reaction from Karl-Erik Olsson she was forced to say publicly that she was not referring to agriculture. There still seems to be a thorn in the side of the agriculture minister. "At the time Wibble was actually talking about budget, regional policy, and budget policy. It is not difficult harbor the suspicion that she was linking precisely these areas," Olsson said. He reminded DAGENS NYHETER that there was a discussion "in parts of the Finance Ministry" and also in Social Democratic circles with the thrust that certain sections of agricultural support would be excluded in the event of Swedish membership to reduce the burden on the EU's budget. But it turned out that that model proved impossible, he said.
