What is your frank view of this? [Kumagai] I feel exactly the same way. I would prefer to use the expression damage control rather than failure. As the President says, let's cool our head down, and then take up the issues once again. This attitude was clearly revealed in the joint news conference of the two top leaders. The talks started last July. There were problems from the beginning, and it can be said those problems surfaced prominently only recently. But I am relieved very much to see from the joint news conference that there is a common recognition that bilteral relations between Japan and the United States are one of the most important of bilteral relations. While the economy is a very important matter, and even though there remain unresolved issues between the two countries, there is a common recognition that these issues must be resolved. If I may compare it to mountain climbing, the two countries agree which mountain top to climb, but disagree on which routes to take. As long as both countries can discuss and agree on which route to take, I do not think Japan-U.S. relations will rupture. There may be some minor tremors. Basically, I can see the strong relations of trust between the top leaders of the countries. As such, I think we need not be worried even though there are problems. [Kobayashi] Regarding the setting of numerical targets -- for example, in use of U.S.-made semiconductors -- do you as the minister of international trade and industry think this is a sort of managed trade and is against the spirit of the GATT? [Kumagai] I would like to set the issue of semiconductors aside. There is a long history to it. But doing something like that in other areas is unacceptable. We cannot accept it. That is going completely contrary to the direction aimed at by the Hosokawa government. That is going against the basic thinking of deciding things based on the functioning of open markets. I think we can never accept it -- even in the future. [passage on Omori's comment omitted] [Kuroiwa] Mr. Omori says the U.S. Congress may agree on taking retaliatory actions against Japan. Minister Kumagai, how do you intend to respond to that? [Kumagai] It will not come just from the U.S. Congress, but also from the administration. Naturally, it is possible to think that they will do something with the exchange rate or make verbal threats. The U.S. Congress in particular has been very aggressive in this regard. That is why I used the expression damage control. What is important is that whether it be the exchange rate or reinstituting the 301 provisions, I think there are ways to respond to them. In the case of the exchange rate, I think there are limits to what it can do. Eventually, the rate will come to change by the logic of the market. There is no doubt that the Japan's surplus has peaked and is coming down. The rate might fluctuate for the time being, but I think we can cope with it in a calm manner. As regards the 301 provisions, I think we can take care of them in the multilateral arena of negotiations. What is important is for Japan to not act emotionally as they do. What is most important is for Japan to open an arena of talks and to resume negotiations soon -- since it is true that there is the trade gap between the two countries and we have this problem of the gap needing to be narrowed and removed. [Kuroiwa] If the retaliations come to be enforced in fact, will you appeal this to the GATT? [Kumagai] Of course, I will if the retaliations have no legal grounds. For instance, if they abolish taxes on parts or if the 301 provisions are reinstituted, I think we can act against it based on pertinent rules. [passage on Takeuchi's and Omori's comments omitted] [Matsuyama] Mr. Kumagai, the United States is saying it will decide on retaliation before the Napoli summit in July. That means Japan will have to do something before July? [Kumagai] Yes, in fact way before that. In areas other than numerical targets, the talks were making smooth very progress -- with respect to procedures, deregulation, and so forth. Hence, if the issue of numerical targets is resolved in a way that those things are not necessary... [changes thought] We need to recall why the issue of the numerical targets was raised to begin with. There was the following line of thinking: If regulations are eased and trade is allowed to be conducted in a freer manner, things normally improve automatically, but in the case of Japan, it is not going well. Hence, the most effective way to deal with Japan is to assign numbers -- shares or growth rates -- to it. This is the rationale given by those who say Japan is different from other countries. It is important to deal with this problem of the U.S. mistrust in Japan. For instance, to take negotiations on the construction market, there is an agreement on the score report system under which when there is no improvement over the past, both parties will get together and think up new ways of making improvement possible. Under the agreement, what the governments will do and what the private sectors should do are distinguished. In this manner, much progress has already been made in this area. I think the same degree of result can be achieved in other areas. Right now the United States is distrustful of Japan. If Japan can present leads that can remove this mistrust, I am sure we can bring the talks to a conclusion. Mr. Omori gave a pessimistic view. But as far as we -- the people at the front of the negotiations -- are concerned, we feel we were only a short way away from the goal. [Kuroiwa] Mr. Omori mentioned the possibility of the United States inciting yen value to rise in the exchange market. Do you see that possibility? [Kumagai] To talk about inciting the yen rate, it is unthinkable that they would intervene in the market and pump in a huge amount of money. In other words, inciting will come verbally. Oral intervention is effective when the market is already flowing toward that way. But Japan's surplus is heading for the direction of being eased, and it is losing its competitiveness very fast. Changes are taking place in Japan. Supermarkets want to buy cheap foreign products, and the Japanese consumers have become price- conscious, too. They are no longer sticklers for Japanese products. When taking these conditions into account, I think it is possible that the high yen will impact the Japanese economy, as Mr. Omori has said, but it will be for a short while and will not last long. That is what I think. [passage omitted on Omori's comment on U.S. mistrust of Japanese bureaucrats] [Kuroiwa] Mr. Kumagai, what is your view on the question of U.S. mistrust of Japanese bureaucrats? [Kumagai] They are very emotional. That is why such criticism is fired against us. To take the auto issue for instance, Japan's purchases of auto parts from the United States have grown drastically. But they do not want to confirm this fact. I am sure the auto part companies and auto manufacturers of the United States are aware of this very well. I feel the warriors of Washington are firing verbal barrages at us without confirming this. After all, we are talking about economic negotiations. Judgments should be based, based on given facts. What is important is that we are not saying that existing conditions are desirable. Japan must make it clear it will take concrete actions to resolve this trade surplus issue. But there are things that cannot be done, and about those things we have no choice but to abide by our stand. [passage omitted on Kobayashi's comments on Japan's problems] [Kumagai] We explained to them about plans on deregulation to liberalize and open up the market further and progress has been made in the negotiations. After hearing what Mr. Omori said to me a little while ago, I feel I must make clear to the people of the United States one point -- that framework talks are not an arena of negotiations where only Japan talks but both countries do talk. If sales of autos or medical supplies to Japan are to be raised, both countries must make efforts. To take autos for instance, Neon is said to be a very good car with steering wheels on right hand side. But that car is not coming to Japan. They don't want to sell it in Japan until two years pass. I would like to say sales can be made only with both sides agreeing. The summit meeting ended only just now. Verbal barrages may not be inevitable for now. But both countries' economy is dependent on each other. Where economy is concerned, Japan is not a country that can be ignored by the United States -- more so if the political and security issues are added to it. So is the United States to Japan. I think we need to think coolly and calmly in this respect. [passage omitted on comments by Takemura and writer Susume Nishibe] [Kuroiwa] Minister Kumagai, what is most important to make the Japan-U.S. relationship the real adults' relationship? [Kumagai] That is to make clear Japan's resolve to redress the problem of the conspicuous current-account surplus. The way of doing is to depart from the past bureaucratic ways and to do it through basic reforming of economy. To see from statistical numbers, the current-account surplus ran to 3.8 percent of the gross domestic product at the peak point. Germany's record topped 4.0 percent once, and at that time it came under heavy attack from all over the world. At present, that percentage for Japan has come to below 3 percent. It will go down to 2.8 percent next year, and will go on down further. I am sure the problem is being resolved. It is not desirable to get excited [words indistinct]. The Hosokawa government should return to the starting point, and should become a government which is friendly to the world -- by carrying out economic, administrative, and political reforms.
