The get-together, scheduled for June 16 at a Tokyo hotel, aims to promote exchanges among companies in different industries on the multimedia business, the official said. "The most important characteristic of multimedia is border crossing. Barriers between industries and those between broadcasting and telecommunications, or those between areas will be lowered or disappear," he said. "Because of this, we need to right now promote exchanges among different industries," the official added. The move comes amid a race that is heating up among government ministries to take the lead in administering and supervising multimedia. The ministries traditionally compete with each other for administrative authority. The businesses invited include banks and wholesalers, which fall under the jurisdiction of the Finance Ministry and the Ministry of International Trade and Industry respectively. Multimedia, which came into the spotlight this year, combines telecommunications with broadcasting, allowing users to receive and send information whenever they want. According to an estimate by the posts ministry, the multimedia market is projected to grow to 123 trillion yen by the year 2010. But with the definition of multimedia still vague and too many related services involved in the concept, the ministry is receiving inquiries from many companies wondering what to do.
