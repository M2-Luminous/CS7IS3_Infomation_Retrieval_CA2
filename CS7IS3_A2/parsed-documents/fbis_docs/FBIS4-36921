We draw your attention to our correspondent's report from Bonn. [Unidentified correspondent] Foreign Affairs Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati met and conferred with German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel. In this meeting, which lasted for over two hours, bilateral relations in various fields, the expansion of economic ties between the two countries, as well as regional and international issues were discussed. [passage omitted] At the end of the meeting, the German foreign minister took part in an interview with the Voice and Vision of the Islamic Republic of Iran correspondent, and considered the talks as positive and constructive. Our country's foreign minister also spoke to us at the conclusion of the meeting. Referring to the outcome of his talks, he said: [Begin Velayati recording] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. The meeting with his excellency Mr. Kinkel was very positive and constructive. In this long meeting we discussed and reviewed relations between Iran and Germany in various areas. One of the key topics for our discussion was our bilateral cooperation during the forthcoming term of German presidency of the European Union. It was decided that such cooperation should take a more serious aspect once Germany assumes the EU presidency. In view of the fact that after Germany, France, and then Spain take over the presidency of the EU, we seek to give a more positive tone to our talks with these three countries. In today's meeting, however, we decided to hold meetings during the forthcoming UN General Assembly in New York between the foreign ministers of the said countries and the ECO [Economic Cooperation Organization] member countries. Cultural and economic cooperation between Iran and Germany will be pursued in a better and more positive way from now on. Mr. Kinkel is busy with elections right now, and we hope that the present German Government can continue and enhance its future cooperation with the Islamic Republic of Iran and the countries of our region, especially the ECO members.
