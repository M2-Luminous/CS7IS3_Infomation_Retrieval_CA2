Administrative Department of Security [DAS] members will also participate in the plan, which has been coordinated by the Defense Ministry. The Democracy Plan consists of three main facets: security of candidates, security at the voting sites, and security of National Civil Registry Office members, not only during the elections but during the vote counting and the transportation of ballot boxes as well. General Celso Suarez, the Armed Forces General Command's chief of operations, has told EL TIEMPO: "In most of the cases, the police will protect the ballot boxes, and the Navy and the Air Force will be in charge of protecting the general area surrounding the voting sites." Although no area in the country will be left unprotected, there will be priorities, according to the Defense Ministry. In the Uraba zone in Antioquia and Choco Departments alone, 8,000 Armed Forces members will guarantee normalcy before, during, and after the elections, Defense Minister Rafael Pardo Rueda has reported. Pardo visited the area this week with high-ranking Army and police officers and registry official Luis Camilo Osorio. EL TIEMPO has learned that the Armed Forces have decided to give special attention to the Santander, Boyaca, Cesar, Magdalena, and Meta Departments. The strategy adopted by the police and DAS establishes protection of the candidates, political centers, patrolling, and making available bomb squads and investigation squads. The candidates' protection includes making sure the candidates for president follow the instructions issued by their security chiefs and escorts. In theory, all candidates to public positions can have official escorts. The large number of candidates makes this difficult, however. For the time being, the Defense Ministry is trying to establish who really requires protection and determine priorities in the movement of escorts. Suarez said: "The Public Force has offered the highest security possible to those who request it. We must mention that we are inviting all candidates to regional and municipal security committees to present their concerns and needs." The high-level official confirmed consultations with the candidates had facilitated the study in each case to recommend the respective security measures. He also admitted that the military forces are analyzing the possibility of candidates' avoiding travel in certain areas of the nation with public order problems. When making reference to this week's attacks and kidnappings as part of the guerrillas' plan to hamper the electoral process, Suarez said that even though kidnapping and murder have become a profession for the rebels, neither the citizens nor the political class have been intimidated. He also responded to criticism according to which the Democratic Plan is only a transitory reaction that does not solve the true problem of the rebels. The officer said that the plan is not new. Nevertheless, he added, it goes without saying that "any person or group that tries to alter or hamper the normal development of the elections will be the object of a timely reaction by the Public Forces." According to military sources, the deployment of personnel to implement the Democratic Plan should not in any way hamper the development of offensive operations against the guerrillas throughout the nation. "It is important to highlight that this plan will be implemented without impairing the counterinsurgency offensive. Currently we have the capability to handle both fronts appropriately," Suarez noted.
