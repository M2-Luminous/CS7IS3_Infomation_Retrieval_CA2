As you probably know, the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] has just taken control of Kigali airport, which had been at the center of fierce fighting for several days. Gen. Bizimungu does not give the same version of events as the RPF. Here is Augustin Bizimungu's version given to Dominique de Courcelles: [Begin recording] [Bizimungu] The airport, we, the UN force requested control of the airport from the Rwandan Government to carry out humanitarian actions. We granted the neutrality of the airport. [Courcelles] Since you granted that neutrality, it appears that there was fierce fighting last night and that the RPF managed to seize control of the airport. [Bizimungu] No, let us say that we left, it was a preamble to remove our troops from the airport. I do not know if the RPF occupied it, it should have been under UNAMIR's [UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda] control. [Courcelles] Have you yourself pulled out all your troops from the airport? [Bizimungu] Yes. [Courcelles] Last night? [Bizimungu] Yes. [Courcelles] Where did you pull them back to? [Bizimungu] To the town center. [Courcelles] However there was fierce fighting at the airport last night. [Bizimungu] No. Fighting took place, it was extremely fierce in the past three days, and it intensified in the last two days. I believe that there is no more fighting now because it is supposed to be under UNAMIR's control. [Courcelles] You are saying that you voluntarily pulled out your soldiers from the airport to hand over the airport to UNAMIR, therefore the airport did not fall under the RPF's control. [Bizimungu] I do not know for sure now. The best might be to ask the UN mission if it is still controlling the airport or if the RPF, which was very close, 500 meters away, occupied it when we left. [Courcelles] What is the situation regarding the Kanombe camp, which is very close to the airport runways and which is one of the targets of the RPF? [Bizimungu] The camp is next to the airport. To control the camp it was necessary to control the airport. [Courcelles] So you also evacuated the camp? [Bizimungu] Yes, we did. [Courcelles] Where to? Kigali? [Bizimungu] Yes. We adopted a new defensive plan by supporting ourselves on a part near the airport. [sentence as heard] Therefore we control part of the town and we adopted a new plan. [Courcelles] Were there many casualties during last night's fighting around the camp? [Bizimungu] No. Not last night, but I told you that there was fierce fighting in this area for the past four or five days. Naturally there are always casualties when there is fighting. [Courcelles] Now general, what are your plans? [Bizimungu] My plans? We are reorganizing and the fighting continues. [Courcelles] Will the battle for Kigali start now? [Bizimungu] I believe so since when we occupied a position and when we defended it we were expecting to be attacked. I am not sure if the RPF will not continue its' attacks. If it does so, fighting will continue. [Courcelles] Are you rather on the defensive? [Bizimungu] In the town itself, yes. [Courcelles] Elsewhere? [Bizimungu] In the north, near Ruhengeri, the Rwandan Armed Forces have the upper hand. We intend to resume the offensive there. In the south, near Buyefera, our troops retreated two weeks ago, they are now reorganizing and we also expect to go on the offensive there too. [Courcelles] What can you tell us regarding the overall situation? Do you feel that you are on the retreat, or more or less holding? How do you assess the situation? [Bizimungu] We are not on the retreat yet. Let us say that the situation is complex for the time being, but it is not hopeless. We lose a battle here, we win one there. Let us say that we are not in a desperate situation. [Courcelles] Are talks with the RPF for a cease-fire possible? Do you wish them? [Bizimungu] We always hoped for an end to the fighting because we remain convinced that war will not solve the problems of the Rwandans. [end recording]
