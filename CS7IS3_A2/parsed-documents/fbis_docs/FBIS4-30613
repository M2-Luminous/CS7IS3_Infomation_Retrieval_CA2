Kumano told a news conference the yen's sharp appreciation against the U.S. dollar does not reflect the fundamental factors of the Japanese economy and the government is concerned about it. The yen closed at a postwar high of 99.93 yen against the dollar in Tokyo on Monday. Kumano disagreed that the dollar's weakness against the German mark and other European currencies reflects the loss of confidence in the U.S. economy and added the dollar's decline is not desirable for the U.S. economy.
