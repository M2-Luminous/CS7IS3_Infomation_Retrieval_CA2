The funds went to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to enable it to pursue its medical and sanitation activities in the capital Kigali and in the towns of Butare and Kibungu in the south and southeast. Two Rwandan Red Cross workers were killed and five others badly wounded on Wednesday in Kigali when a shell landed on their compound in the city as rebels fought fierce artillery battles with the army. But the ICRC said it had no plans to cut down on its staff or activities there. Wednesday's contribution brings to ECU2.63 million the total amount of humanitarian aid given to Rwandans since the start of the latest ethnic clashes at the beginning of April. By some estimates, the wholesale slaughter has claimed half a million lives in the Central African nation, while another 500,000 have fled abroad and many others are displaced inside the country.
