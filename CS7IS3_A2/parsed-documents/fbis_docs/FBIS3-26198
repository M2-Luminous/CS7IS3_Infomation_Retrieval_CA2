But Hong Kong people were kept in the dark, not knowing what kind of a package it was. Meanwhile, Chris Patten was boasting that the package was an "excellent Lunar New Year present" to the Hong Kong people and China. Chris Patten is totally devoid of self-knowledge. He has exceeded his role and subverted the truth and has only succeeded in helping Hong Kong people to see his colonial mind set clearly. The British are not sending money to Hong Kong to build the new airport; it is being built by Hong Kong people's money earned with sweat and blood. In throwing away Hong Kong people's money, British Hong Kong is at the same time expanding expenditure on airport construction, almost doubling quotations for all projects, thus greatly increasing the burden on the Hong Kong people and debts for the SAR [special administrative region]. Not long ago, Chris Patten bragged that Britain would give China the "largest dowry since Cleopatra" when it pulled out of Hong Kong. Now he is again bragging that he is giving an "excellent New Year gift" to the Hong Kong people and China. How generous he is! But should one open his "dowry" and "gift," one would find nothing but a heavy financial burden. If it has to be described a "dowry" or a "gift," the beneficiary will be the British. It is an expensive "tribute" forcefully wrung from the Hong Kong people by the British. The Tsing Yi-Ma Wan crossing is a case in point. On the surface, it was an open bid. But the British rejected a HK$4.7-billion [Hong Kong dollars] bid from the Korean Hyundai Corporation's and awarded the project to a British consortium quoting HK$7.2 billion. Some HK$2 billion was unjustifiably spent in this way. Was this not the Hong Kong people's gift to the British colonialists? When Richard Allen of the Provisional Airport Authority had his employment contract terminated for spending money like water, he was given a golden handshake of some HK$5 million, which indeed looked like "Cleopatra's" dowry. Every person in Hong Kong was distressed at being ripped off by British Hong Kong. But Chris Patten has the nerve to describe the fourth financial package as a "spring festival gift" to the people of Hong Kong and China. Is this not utter nonsense? He is only appropriating a little more from the financial surplus for the construction of the airport. Hong Kong people are still footing the bill, and costs have not come down either. How can this be described as "Chris Patten giving a gift?" In fact, in mid-July 1991, China and Britain signed the Memorandum of Understanding on the New Airport [MOU]. If Britain had not deliberately discarded the MOU to draft financial packages which created a bottomless pit of "callable equity" (HK$45 billion by now), deviated from the provisions of Annex III of the Joint Declaration, which states that China and Britain share equally the proceeds from the annual sale of 50 hectares of land approved by the Land Commission, and had not made the improper demand that all revenues from property developments above the 62-hectare [area of land for development] railroad line should go to Britain, agreement on a financial package would have been reached long ago and many projects launched already. It is British Hong Kong which has been stalling, turning the situation into a stalemate, and deliberately creating obstacles. British Hong Kong should be responsible for the consequences which have resulted from its opposition to the MOU and the first three financial packages in the Joint Declaration. Chris Patten is describing the fourth financial package as a "spring festival gift," but the Hong Kong people will not be deceived again. Who will accept confusing the agenda, stalling, and quoting unjustifiably high prices as the bestowal of a gift? Conducting business according to the MOU and Annex III of the Joint Declaration are the obligations Britain must shoulder. No civilized country honestly complying with an international treaty would consider implementing a diplomatic agreement as the bestowal of a gift. Whatever package is proposed by British Hong Kong, the Hong Kong people will strongly demand that its financial arrangements conform with the MOU and Annex III of the Joint Declaration. Only thus will the Hong Kong people's tax burden and "ticket fare" not be increased and can the new airport project avoid low efficiency or "degenerating into a mess."
