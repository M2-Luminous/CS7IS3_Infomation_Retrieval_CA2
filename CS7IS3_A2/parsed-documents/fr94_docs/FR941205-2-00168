Priority Priority_Rehabilitation Continuing Education Programs for Providers of Community Rehabilitation Services Background In section 2(a) (2) and (5) of the Act, Congress reported findings that, as a group, individuals with disabilities constitute one of the most disadvantaged groups in society subject to discrimination in many critical areas, including employment. Furthermore, Congress found that individuals with disabilities, including individuals with the most severe disabilities, have demonstrated their ability to achieve gainful employment in integrated settings if appropriate services and supports are provided. Community rehabilitation programs, working closely with individuals with disabilities, their advocates, representatives, families, labor unions, and employers, are a significant resource for addressing the national problem of unemployment and underemployment of individuals with severe disabilities. Those programs serve an estimated two million individuals with disabilities annually, many through referral arrangements with vocational rehabilitation State agencies. Ongoing post-employment training is needed for all who work in community rehabilitation programs to achieve improved employment outcomes for individuals with disabilities, especially volunteers, providers, and employers who fill key roles in staffing, directing, and using these programs. In the past, RSA funded many nonacademic training programs that maintain or upgrade the skills of currently employed individuals in community rehabilitation programs under the Rehabilitation Long-Term Training program. However, final regulations for the Rehabilitation Long-Term Training program (59 FR 31060) focus on the support of academic programs that award degrees or certificates. Therefore, support for nonacademic training programs will be carried out under the other applicable training program authorities, such as this Rehabilitation Continuing Education program, the Short-Term Training program, and the Experimental and Innovative Training program. The Secretary has identified a maximum possible project period of 60 months. The Secretary believes that at least 36 months will be necessary to meet the requirements of the priority. The Secretary will be assessing, during the third year of the project period, whether there is a need to provide funding beyond 36 months.
