Article by Bosnian President Izetbegovic 6. Shaykh Muhammad al-Ghazali's Column REACTION TO HEBRON MOSQUE MASSACRE In its 1 March issue, the newspaper AL-SHA'B, mouthpiece of the opposition Labor Party, carries extensive reports, comments, and articles on the 25 February massacre at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron. On pages 1 and 7, it features a 480-word statement issued by the Muslim Brotherhood denouncing this "ugly criminal, an incident that shows the perfidious and corrupt nature inherent in the treacherous enemy." The statement calls for placing the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and Jerusalem under international supervision and for sending international forces to protect the unarmed civilians. On pages 1 and 7, the newspaper publishes an 850-word statement issued by the Labor Party condemning the massacre and describing it as "one of the ugliest criminal acts ever committed." On page 7, the newspaper publishes a joint statement issued by the Muslim Brotherhood, the Labor Party, the Wafd Party, the Liberal Party, the al-Azhar 'Ulema Front, and some public figures, trade unionists, and writers denouncing the incident. On pages 1 and 7, the newspaper carries an 800-word report by Mahmud Bakri, who castigates the Egyptian Government for not being outspoken in condemning the attack. He says: "While the ugly massacre has exposed the indifference of the international community, especially the U.S., which colludes with and supports Israel, Egypt has contented itself with condemning the massacre." This Egyptian stance has provoked "broad popular anger," more so because the "Egyptian Government has not declared a state of mourning for the souls of the martyrs and has taken no measures to confront the aggressors." Blaming Israel for the blast at a Maronite Church on 27 February, Bakri says: "The Zionists have decided to escalate their war against Muslims and Christians by sowing sedition between them to deflect attention from the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre." On pages 1 and 7, AL-SHA'B also carries a 1,000-word report on the various demonstrations that have erupted at Egyptian universities to protest the "ugly massacre" against the Palestinians in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron. The reports adds that "violent clashes" occurred between the Cairo University students and the police, who used tear gas to disperse the demonstrators marching toward the Israeli Embassy. On page 2, the newspaper publishes a 1,500-word article by Majdi Ahmad Husayn in which he describes the massacre as "unprecedented" and the "fruit of the wicked policy" of the Arab and Muslim rulers, a policy that has led Muslims to be "slaughtered like lambs." He criticizes the Arab governments, especially the Egyptian Government, for saying that peace will be pursued despite the massacre. He goes on to say: "Israel's friends in Egypt and the Arab world are accomplices in this massacre, because they have taught Israel to do to us what it wants." He adds that the Egyptian Government, which has portrayed the "crippled" Gaza-Jericho agreement as a victory and a solution of the Palestinian issue, is now completely exposed, naked, without a "fig leaf" to cover itself. The writer calls for the "popular trial" of Yusuf Wali, secretary general of the ruling National Democratic Party, for his "subversive role in supporting Israel at the expense of his country's interests." He adds that force should be met with greater force, saying: "There must be revenge. We must inflict wounds on the Israelis. We must strike them on the head. We must strike them everywhere. This is God's law." On page 2, the newspaper carries a 700-word article by Dr. Mahjub 'Umar in which he says that Israel's current leaders, including Rabin and Peres, were directly behind the massacre to achieve external and internal political objectives. On page 3, the newspaper carries a 2,000-word investigative report by Mahmud Bakri in which he interviews several figures on their reaction to the massacre. Among those interviewed are Dr. Ahmad Sidqi al-Dajani, a Palestinian opposed to the Gaza-Jericho accord; Cairo University President Dr. Mufid Shihab; Hafiz Isma'il, former adviser for Egyptian national security; 'Ali-al-Din Salih, leader of the Misr al-Fatah Party; and AL-AHRAM Chief Editor Salah-al-Din Hafiz. They all denounce the massacre. On page 5, the newspaper carries a 1,000-word article by Mustafa Mashhur, deputy leader of the Muslim Brotherhood. He asks: "Who can guarantee that this massacre will not be repeated" and "How can peace be achieved in this charged atmosphere." He also asks what is the use of Rabin's expressions of regret over the incident and Clinton's remarks that it should not obstruct the peace process. Mahjub sarcastically congratulates 'Arafat on the condolences he has received from some heads of state and for the Israeli Government's readiness to compensate the relatives of the victims. He adds that the Palestinian people will not forget this incident and will take their revenge on the "Zionist enemy." SIGNS OF ISLAMIC VICTORY IN ALGERIA An unattributed 300-word report on page 1 describes the Algerian authorities' recent release of several Islamic Salvation Front [FIS] leaders as a "victory for the Islamist current in Algeria." The newspaper links this release with reports on "an impending Cabinet reshuffle in Algeria in which Islamist elements might join the government." This will be considered a victory for the FIS and an admission by the Algerian authorities of the broad popular support for FIS leaders. CALL FOR TRIAL OF MINISTER YUSUF WALI AL-SHA'B continues its long campaign against Dr. Yusuf Wali, deputy prime minister and agriculture minister and secretary general of the ruling National Democratic Party, for his alleged pro-Israeli views and stands. On page 5, it carries a 3,000-word article by Dr. Muhammad Hilmi Murad, deputy leader of the Labor Party, in which he urges a "popular trial" for Wali, who "deliberately" delivered an "official" statement before the People's Assembly praising Israel's scientific and technological superiority. He calls on the Egyptian people to act to remove this "shame." He maintains that Wali could be politically tried "according to Article No. 159 of the Constitution, which gives the People's Assembly the right to refer a minister to trial" for the crimes he commits while performing his duties. He further maintains that this popular move does not absolve the president from using his powers to question the minister about his actions and behavior; otherwise, the people will be excused for believing that the president approves of Wali's statement before the People's Assembly on 5 February. COMMENTARY ON KUWAIT AND IRAQ On page 8, the newspaper publishes a 1,000-word article by Mahmud Shukri entitled "Kuwait Celebrates the U.S. Victory and the Victim is the Iraqi People." He says: "Tomorrow, drums will be beaten in Kuwait on the anniversary of the Anglo-U.S.-Israeli victory in the Gulf." He adds: "Those who celebrate the 3d anniversary of the Arab massacre in Iraq, what do they celebrate?" "Do they celebrate because they have enabled the imperialist forces in the United States, France, and England to destroy a Muslim Arab country." "Do they celebrate because they have turned Kuwait into a Western military base?" ARTICLE BY BOSNIAN PRESIDENT IZETBEGOVIC On page 9, AL-SHA'B publishes an 800-word article by Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic entitled "Islam Between East and West." He maintains that Western civilization can't face the invasion of licentiousness that is destroying it. He cites the high crime and suicide rates in the United States and Europe and attributes them to licentiousness and alcohol abuse. SHAYKH MUHAMMAD AL-GHAZALI'S COLUMN On page 12, the newspaper carries a regular column by Islamic preacher Muhammad al-Ghazali entitled "This is our Religion." In his 500-word column, al-Ghazali says the United States is a superpower and a very civilized country. But there are disturbing health, social, and mental conditions in the United States, he says, citing the U.S. health secretary on the number of crimes and diseases. He says the United States, "which excels scientifically and industrially, is backward religiously and morally." He contends that instead of reforming its internal conditions, the United States is busy fighting Islam.
