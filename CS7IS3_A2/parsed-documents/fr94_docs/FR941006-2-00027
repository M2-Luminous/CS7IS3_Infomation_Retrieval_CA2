FR941006-2-00027 FR941006-2-00017 [Project No. 10873 North Carolina] Michael P. O'Brien and Robert A. Davis, III; Notice of Availability of Draft Environmental Assessment September 30, 1994. In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (Commission's) regulations, 18 CFR part 380 (Order No. 486, 52 FR 47897), the Office of Hydropower Licensing has reviewed the application for a minor license for the existing, unlicensed Cullasaja Hydroelectric Project, located on the Cullasaja River in Highlands, North Carolina, and has prepared a Draft Environmental Assessment (DEA) for the project. In the DEA, the Commission's staff has analyzed the potential environmental impacts of the existing project and has concluded that approval of the project, with appropriate mitigation or enhancement measures, would not constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. Copies of the DEA are available for review in the Public Reference Branch, Room 3104, of the Commission's offices at 941 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426. Please submit any comments within 45 days from the date of this notice. Comments should be addressed to Lois D. Cashell, Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426. Please affix Project No. 10873 to all comments. For further information, please contact Jennifer Hill, Environmental Coordinator, at (202) 219&hyph;2797. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
