U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen turned up the heat in a visit to Tokyo, vowing that the United States may "reexamine" the stalled bilateral trade "framework" talks if no agreement is reached before a Japan-U.S. summit on February 11 in Washington. Hosokawa told Bentsen that "if the time comes for a political decision, I hope to apply leadership, making efforts to improve" the outcome of the talks, according to a Japanese official who attended the half-hour talks at the prime minister's official residence. Bentsen told reporters that Washington "will not settle for any cosmetic agreement" on trade and that "if we do not have credible agreements by the time of the summit, we would have to reexamine the basis of the framework." "We would far prefer no agreements to weak agreements," he said. Bentsen said his remarks were not meant as a threat but were "just the logical consequence," reflecting "the realities of the situation." Hosokawa told Bentsen he hopes for "satisfactory results" to the talks, noting subcabinet-level meetings begin this coming week to discuss the matter "more deeply," according to Takatoshi Kato, head of the Finance Ministry's international finance bureau. Both sides remain far apart in the talks, which seek to expand access to the Japanese market in such areas as insurance, government procurement and automobiles and auto parts. Japan blasts as "managed trade" U.S. efforts to set standards such as market shares to mark progress. But U.S. officials have accused Japanese negotiators of foot-dragging and called for political leaders to go over the bureaucrats' heads. Bentsen reiterated at a press conference that "we have to have indicators to show if we're making progress or not in opening markets." Bentsen said President Bill Clinton asked him to add the hastily arranged trade talks with Hosokawa and an earlier hour-long session with Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii to the end of a lengthy trip to Russia and Asia. Both sides also said Japan reaffirmed its commitment to take steps to spur its slumping economy. "We said very strongly that we want a major stimulus package and that it be a sustained one," Bentsen told reporters, adding that a short-term stimulus, such as an income tax cut offset with a quick hike in the consumption tax, is "not effective." Fujii vowed "serious and vigorous efforts" to launch "a new economic stimulus package, including tax cuts," and said a forum of the government and ruling coalition parties will continue seeking an "acceptable decision" on tax issues, according to the ministry's Kato. Fujii told reporters that he asked Bentsen to "please trust us" to try to boost the economy in the wake of the upper house's rejection Friday of the government-proposed political reform package. But Japanese officials said that Bentsen and the Japanese leaders did not discuss details of a tax cut or other measures. Hosokawa sought support for his attempt to "pin efforts on political reform bills over the next week" because they are supported by the public and that the passage would have "favorable economic effects," Kato said, adding that Bentsen made "no specific requests." Bentsen told reporters he appreciated that Japanese leaders are "pushing" to craft stimulus measures and reach a trade agreement. "They said they're ready to go ahead," despite the current political turmoil, he said. He declined to comment on the "local political situation," except to say that Hosokawa "has his work before him." Bentsen also refused to discuss the foreign exchange market abroad, where the dollar temporarily sank Friday to a one-month low in the 109 yen range before rebounding. Currency dealers said the failure of the reform bills throws the stimulus package in doubt and increases chances that Washington will revert to high-yen pressure to cut Japan's trade surplus. Hosokawa remains committed to the February 11 meeting in Washington with Clinton, both sides said.
