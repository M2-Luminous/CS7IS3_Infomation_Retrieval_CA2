After the cabinet shake-up, the departure of several key figures from it, and a worryingly long pause by the premier the president and the cabinet head have made it clear that the course of reforms remains as before. The government does not intend to give in to pressure from sector lobbies which cause momentary embarrassment in the upper echelons or heed the advice of economic authorities fervently convinced that for the time being the market is not for us -- that the road to the market is a long and winding one that lies in some other dimension altogether. It is typical that both Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin recalled the program drafted last August, dismissing once again, as it were, the charges of unfocused, chaotic drift. If the program is a course (and it is), serious deviations really will not be seen, although modifications will have to be made to practice. Who could have planned, for example, for state orders not being paid for, for wages not paid out on time, or for those in the budget-financed sphere being so badly hurt. On the contrary, it was stressed that their incomes would grow almost in parallel with prices. It did not work out. It is now time to pay for past sins, and for virtually all of them at the same time. It has been stated that the government will in the very near future settle its accounts with the countryside, the defense sector, the miners, and the budget-financed sphere. Major credits have been promised on the surety of the spring sowing. Compensation for the population's savings will continue to be paid. All this will, of course, whip up inflation, but the new cabinet cannot be blamed for that. The third act of the drama has come, and it is time to fire the gun hanging on the wall. We have been able to see for ourselves once again that you can have the very best of intentions but you will build nothing durable on the basis of unreliability and disregard of the law. If the government has decided finally to clear its debts, its determination can only be welcomed. It is important not to overshoot the mark; it is important to keep a clear sense of proportion. Some people are asking that not just the budget debt but suppliers too be repaid. However, carrying out mutual settlement on the 1992 model means delivering a very heavy blow to the reforms. Others propose that working capital be indexed -- that is to say, you add several zeros to their value and then quietly slip that gain into wages. This has happened. We have experienced it. It is senseless to repeat it. It is not difficult to predict that new subsidies and cheap loans will be demanded from the government. Enterprises' market muscles have just begun to develop, and we are again providing them with hot-house conditions wherein they have to compete against no one for anything and where the young musculature will grow flaccid within a couple of weeks through not being wanted. And all this under the slogan of combating the reduction in output, of trying not to give way. Give way, and you will not keep inflation down. The 1994 draft budget is screwed down so tightly that you can hear the nuts squeaking. By tradition we do everything late. There are, it is true, nuances here. In the past we would simply fail to pay money to, say, the Army or the northern regions and then say: We will be making cutbacks. Such methods generated a wave of discontent -- society and the economy cannot be treated that way. First you plan what you will cut, you agree this, you make arrangements, and you cut whatever it is; then you make your expenditure savings. It is clear from the draft budget what will be curtailed and slimmed down. But time passes, and it gets lost again. If all the cuts had been announced at least one quarter ago.... I fear that it will be necessary to pay more than planned. Inflation will be not 3-5 percent by the end of the year but much higher -- given the payment of debts, prices will increase roughly fourfold, by my estimates. And that is at best, if the government avoids the aforementioned pitfalls toward which some people are stubbornly egging it on. Unfortunately the session said little about overcoming the investment crisis. This topic was touched on to a certain extent by Basin, chairman of the State Committee on Issues of Construction and Architecture. Revaluing fixed capital, he reported, will increase deductions set aside for depreciation to 40 trillion rubles [R]. But the problem is that enterprises will shamelessly consume this money and use it for wages. Basin suggested that we introduce separate accounts for depreciation, as was done in the past. I do not think that is enough. Tax is not levied on depreciation as distinct from wages paid out of profit or prime costs, and strictness here is therefore justified. Let them return everything they have consumed to the depreciation fund and then pay a fine in addition. The pointer of economic interest will then shift in the direction we desire and enterprises will be forced to think about the future. There is in general a strange prejudice abroad that no one will want to resort to investment under inflation conditions. Quite the reverse. They want to. They very much want to. It is precisely during inflation that investment is the best way to save money. Land and real estate are self-indexing, as it were. That the price confusion makes life difficult and that almost everything goes on wages is another issue. Last year only 15 out of 600 facilities under the state capital investment plan were commissioned. But what is significant here is that private and joint-stock enterprises, where one's own, nonstate assets increase, have a totally different attitude to investment. One-third of them are modernizing, expanding, and making improvements -- that is to say, are in some way participating in the investment process. And I am encouraged by the thought that by 1 July, when voucher privatization is completed, around 80 percent of state property will be joint stock or in private ownership. In other words, approximately 80 percent of enterprises will receive an investment incentive. There may be no money to start with, but there will be an incentive. And with time there will be money too. Incidentally, privatized enterprises have the right to obtain money on the security of their own property. The law on surety has been adopted, but a number of normative acts are required if it is to work. And why not consider investment concessions -- credit for investment needs which will be granted against specific business plans on a case-by-case basis rather than for whole sectors, as is current practice? This is an active state policy which is not even to be seen in embryonic form. I understand the difficult conditions in which the current budget has been drafted, and I am ready to resign myself philosophically to many things. Yet one feature does produce a sense of inner protest. Expenditure has determined the budget, and no weight has been placed on the other side of the scales, the revenue side, to counterbalance it. But, you know, you cannot go on like that forever, because by contracting expenditure you also cut back future revenue and reduce the tax base. Something has to grow, to ripen, and yield fruit, and this "something" must be identified by the state in good time and, if need be, supported. But it seems to me that we are reverting to discussion of investment policy.
