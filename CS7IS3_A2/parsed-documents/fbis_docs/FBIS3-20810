We have peace, we do not have order, and we have stability, Csurka said, but not the kind that the country's people want because it is not based on the will of the majority of the people, and because it is not just. Order and democracy can only be built on the basis of justice and can only appear with the support of the majority. However, the current leadership does not have the people's support because the government parties, just like the opposition parties, are not implementing the programs that they announced before the elections. Equality, of which nothing was implemented, was the great promise of socialism. Liberalism is the current promise. However, liberalism is only enjoyed by those people who have come through with an advantage from the previous regime. For the vast majority of people, there is no freedom. There is coercion, economic coercion, because power is concentrated in the hands of the same people as before. Two alternatives exist: the old and the new, the national and the non-national. The MIEP belongs to the national. Our political program is to gain economic power, which can only be successful with the help of state power. If this is not achieved then the state will remain exposed to the nomenclature that was created in the previous regime. The current leadership, including the government and the opposition, has failed. The reason has to be sought in the pacts that were used to deceive the masses. Who has acquired the factories that are worth huge amounts of money? The banks? Who skims off from the transformation? The privatization companies, many of which are joint ventures or foreign owned. The reason for this situation lies in the decision of the [former] Nemeth government to order that nothing could be privatized without the participation of a privatization company. In this way, he gave away the Hungarian state's revenue and profits from the change of ownership. All the enterprises of the State Property Management Corporation [AV RT] did not make as much profit as the amount that had to be paid by the AV RT for privatization. While news of scandals in the world of banking and brokering companies are emerging, the so-called bank consolidation has started. All of them have to be relieved, one by one, of their bad debts! The only thing that is not revealed is when these bad debts arose and why the taxpayers have to bear the financial consequences. Naturally, some of them arose in the glorious 1980's when the huge enterprises had to be supported, and they still collapsed. However, the banks are also to be relieved of those loans that they have given out since 1990. And to whom? Since 1990, the bad loans have originated from allocations to comrades. Now, Hungarian society should line up and pay for the opulence of the nomenclature, so that privatization can go ahead! This is what they want. Therefore, the task is to break the power of the banking oligarchy. If this does not happen, all the parties can keep promising anything that is pleasant to hear, but the system will not change at all. It cannot change because it has become an integral part of the world system based on the politics of the World Bank, that demands a significant influence on the various economies and financial systems. We have to draw up our own program. We are not living in a many centuries old economy that has developed through constant rationalization, but rather we are in a forced situation. Everyone has to be freed from this coercion; otherwise, people will never accept the current order, will not multiply, will let their territories be used by aliens, resign themselves always to be led against their own interests, and finally disappear. This danger will remain until they have a middle class and a leadership with national sentiments. For the emergence of this society with national sentiments, the National Basic Curriculum, which was completed as long ago as 1990, is indispensable, but the debates about accepting or, rather, rejecting it can mostly be called sabotage. Education was immediately removed from the program, and the Federation of Young Democrats was the leading force in this. It is unimaginable for the nation not to suffer serious damage if the ranks of the Hungarian middle classes are only filled through the Soros [Hungarian-American businessman] Foundation, and the young people of those groups of society that do not belong to this are automatically excluded. Money and state support is needed for education, and a nation state is needed to implement it. However, while the bourgeoisie that is kept in power by the World Bank defines the use of the money, very little is left for educational purposes. Together with education, we also want to strengthen the family, the basic cell of society. We say that every mother with three children should receive the minimum wage, regardless of whether she works, until the end of her life. Other state benefits should be added to this to form the basis for her pension. All this should be added to her pension basis acquired while employed elsewhere. The precondition for all this is that society must produce people who do not have to rely on society's help in their adult lives.
