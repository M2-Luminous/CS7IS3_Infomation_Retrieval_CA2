The agenda was discussed and adopted at the 16th Executive Meeting of the State Council presided over by Premier Li Peng. China is the first country to have worked out and adopted its own "Agenda 21," proposed by the United Nations at the Rio de Janeiro summit meeting in June 1992. At the summit, Premier Li Peng promised to carry out the UN agenda and other documents adopted at the meeting. China initiated and sponsored the ministerial meeting on environment and development for developing countries in June 1991. The "Agenda 21" was worked out by 52 departments under the State Council, including the State Planning Commission and the State Science and Technology Commission. The "Agenda" expounds China's strategy, policy and measures to secure harmonious and sustainable development out of the milieu of the economy, resources, environment, population, education and other social factors. The "Agenda" will also be an important directory document for China in making its mid- and long-term economic and social development plans. It will form an important part of the goals and content of the Ninth Five-Year (1995-2000) and the 2010 plans. The "Agenda" made clear the position and actual action of the Chinese Government in implementing the UN Agenda 21. Today's meeting of the State Council also adopted an outline program of state industrial policies for the 1990's.
