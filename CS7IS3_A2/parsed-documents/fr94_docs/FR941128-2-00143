FR941128-2-00143 FR941128-2-00079 The Real Property Interest 5. The Property Interest consists of a 3.125 percent undivided interest in a 117,956 square foot retail center with a 1,500 square foot addition and the underlying land (collectively, the Property). The Property is located at 5029&hyph;5139 Austell Road in Cobb County, Georgia. On November 30, 1988, the TMIS Plan participated with unrelated investors in a loan in the original amount of $1,600,000 to Atlanta Austell Plaza, Ltd. (Atlanta Ltd.), a California limited partnership which was unrelated to the Prior Plan Accounts. 3 The TMIS Plan's contribution was $50,000 or 3.125 percent of the total principal amount. A second deed of trust on the Property secured the loan. The first deed of trust, originally held by the Fulton National Bank of Atlanta, secured a loan in the original principal amount of $1,800,000. The first deed of trust note was subsequently assigned to Western Savings Bank and is now held by Meritor Savings Bank (formerly known as Philadelphia Savings Fund Society, successor by merger to Western Savings Bank). At the time that the parties entered into the second deed of trust loan, the unpaid principal balance on the first deed of trust loan was $1,113,000. 3 The Department expresses no opinion, in this proposed exemption, on whether plan fiduciaries violated any of the fiduciary responsibility provisions of Part 4 of Title I of the Act in acquiring and holding the Property Interest. Eventually, Atlanta Ltd. experienced difficulties and became unable to service the debt on the first and second deed of trust loans. In February of 1991, the Prior Plan Accounts and the other lenders foreclosed on the second deed of trust, thereby acquiring direct ownership of the Property. 4 In accordance with their original investment, the Prior Plan Accounts received a 3.125 percent interest in the Property. The other investors in the Property are unrelated to SEI and its affiliates. The Prior Plan Accounts and the other lenders contributed the necessary funds to make current the principal and interest payments on the first deed of trust loan. The Trust contributed a total of $11,406 to cover the costs of foreclosure, the payments of the first deed of trust loan and other costs which included operating, maintenance and advertising expenses. 5 As a result of such foreclosure, the Prior Plan Accounts and the other lenders assumed Atlanta Ltd.'s position as debtor on the first deed of trust loan. 4 The applicants represent that Atlanta Ltd. ceased making payments approximately three months prior to the foreclosure in February 1991. Accordingly, the Prior Plan Accounts' share of the interest which was due but never received under the second deed of trust loan will total $23,554 as of December 31, 1994. 5 The applicants represent that interest in the amount of $4,160 would have reasonably accrued on the $11,406 of holding costs, assuming an interest rate of nine percent per annum, for the period beginning on February of 1991 and ending December 31, 1994. In 1993, the Property owners, pursuant to the terms of a lease, were required to make tenant improvements in the amount of $225,000. Several of the Property owners objected to further mortgaging the Property in an effort to raise this additional $225,000. Finally, the tenant and the Property owners agreed that the tenant would pay for its own improvements but would be reimbursed in the amount of $225,000 by the Property owners out of any proceeds which resulted from the sale of the Property. As of December 31, 1993, the outstanding balance on the original first deed of trust loan was $617,000. Accordingly, the outstanding liabilities on the Property (the Liabilities), as of December 31, 1993, increased by $350,000 to $842,000. The applicants represent that the Property has been and continues to be leased to unrelated parties. As of December 31, 1993, the Property had a fifty percent occupancy rate with the average lease being a five-year, triple net lease with the tenant responsible for all of the actual tenant finish work on the space. The Prior Plan Accounts' portion of the lease income collected since 1991 will amount to $36,349 as of December 31, 1994. Roger R. Upton, MAI and Martha H. Mathis, MAI (the Appraisers) of Upton Associates located in Atlanta, Georgia appraised the Property as of January 14, 1994 on an ``as is'' basis, i.e., a fifty percent lease rate. Otter represents that both the Appraisers and Upton Associates are independent of and unrelated to SEI and its affiliates. In placing the fair market value of the Property at $2,650,000, the Appraisers utilized the income approach and the market approach, but gave primary emphasis to the income approach for the value estimate of the Property. Accordingly, the Trust's 3.125 percent interest in the Property minus its pro rata share of the Liabilities would be worth $56,500.
