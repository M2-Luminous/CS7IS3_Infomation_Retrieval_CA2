The Malian paper AURORE May 19 said that since the DPRK-U.S. talks for a solution to the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula broke up, the situation in the peninsula has become extremely acute. It charged that Washington and Seoul were stepping up nuclear war preparations, crying for "sanctions" against North Korea. The nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, it noted, can be resolved only through negotiations between the DPRK and the U.S. A radio of Iran May 31 said the United States is claiming pressure and "sanctions" against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea only, while failing to throw into question Israel that has many nuclear weapons. The U.S. hostile policy vis-a-vis Korea will fail in face of the resistance from the world people, it said. The May issue of the Dutch magazine INTERNATIONAL LIBERATION said the question of guaranteeing peace on the Korean peninsula in the future depends on the U.S. attitude. Noting that the U.S. troops stationed in South Korea are equipped with nuclear weapons and extensively staging war exercises against the DPRK, the magazine said the DPRK has its independent right to protect itself from a U.S. nuclear attack.
