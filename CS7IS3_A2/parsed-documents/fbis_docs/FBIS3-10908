They are alleged subversives Jose Luis Medina Soto and Omar Alejandro Hermosilla Marin, second and third in that terrorist hierarchy, respectively. It was reported that they, and the other group members, were preparing an "annihilation operation" against a bus of the 38th Carabineros Station in La Florida. The individuals were captured on 23 February as a result of investigations launched by the police following the attack against the "New Spain" Carabineros premises in La Cisterna on 21 February and a series of other actions, such as bombings of political party offices. These actions were considered a reaction to the transfer of 45 prisoners, who are in jail on charges of terrorist activities, to the new maximum security prison. The other FRPL militants captured with the first two were identified as Alma Magaly Victoria Salame Inostroza, Oscar Antonio Cruces Espinoza, Sergio Manuel Gonzalez Gonzalez, Ulises Antonio Manriquez Rojas, and Doris Marianela Ojeda Cisterna. It was also established that the group had direct links with Mapu-Lautaro [United Popular Action Movement-Lautaro] top leader Guillermo Ossandon Canas, alias "Diego Carvajal," who is still at large.
