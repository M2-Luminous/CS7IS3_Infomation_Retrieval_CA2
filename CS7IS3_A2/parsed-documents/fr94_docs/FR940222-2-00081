FR940222-2-00081 FR940222-2-00064 2. In addition, applicants believe that the establishment of a multi-class distribution system with the proposed fee structure benefits shareholders by providing predictability of expenses and ease of understanding the expenses that will be paid. The proposed arrangement provides an additional choice for investors to whom such predictability is important. The structure makes a party other than the Fund assume the economic risks of paying a Fund's operating expenses during the start-up phase, and bear the expenses of providing services to the classes. 3. Applicants also request an exemption under section 6(c) from sections 2(a)(32), 2(a)(35), 22(c), and 22(d), and rule 22c-1, to assess and, under certain circumstances, waive a CDSC on redemptions of shares. Applicants believe that their request to permit the CDSC arrangement would place the purchaser in a better position than if a sales load were imposed at the time of sale, since the shareholder may have to pay only a reduced sales charge, or no sales charge at all. Applicant's Conditions Applicants agree that any order granting the requested exemption shall be subject to the following conditions: 1. Each class of shares will represent interests in the same portfolio of investments of a Fund, and be identical in all respects, except as set forth below. The only differences between the classes of shares of a Fund relate solely to: (a) The impact of the disproportionate 12b-1 Payments and Class Expenses; (b) voting rights as to matters exclusively affecting one class of shares; (c) exchange features; and (d) class designation differences. Any additional incremental expenses not specifically identified above which are subsequently identified and determined to be properly allocated to one class of shares shall not be so allocated until approved by the SEC pursuant to an amended order or other relief from the SEC. 2. The trustees of PFAMCo Funds and of any subsequently created Funds, including a majority of the independent trustees, will approve the offering of multiple classes of shares (the ``Multi-Class System''). The minutes of the meetings of the trustees regarding the deliberations of the trustees with respect to the approvals necessary to implement the Multi-Class System will reflect in detail the reasons for the trustees' determination that the proposed Multi-Class System is in the best interests of the Funds and their shareholders. 3. The initial determination of the Class Expenses that will be allocated to a particular class and any subsequent changes thereto will be reviewed and approved by a vote of the board of trustees of the relevant Fund, including a majority of the independent trustees. Any person authorized to direct the allocation and disposition of monies paid or payable by a Fund to meet Class Expenses shall provide to such Fund's trustees, and the trustees shall review, at least quarterly after such initial determination, a written report of the amounts so expended and the purposes for which such expenditures were made.
