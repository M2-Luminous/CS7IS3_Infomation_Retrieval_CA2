Rich in natural resources, Sichuan boasts the biggest hydroelectric power and natural gas reserves in the country. The province has mapped out an ambitious plan to exploit its hydroelectric power, natural gas and coal resources. The investment needed will come from the state, provincial and local governments along with overseas investment and funds raised by enterprises. Already, power stations with a total investment of 30 billion yuan (about 3.4 billion U.S. dollars) are being built across the province. These power stations will be able to provide a total of 6.5 million kw of electricity a year by the time they are completed. The province plans to set aside another 60 billion yuan over the next few years on more such construction projects. Local governments are also building smaller ones with a total annual capacity of 1.3 million kw. As China's second-largest coal producer, Sichuan is busy developing coal mines which will be able to supply 2.97 million tons of coal annually. A natural gas field which can supply 1.3 million cu m of natural gas a year has been completed, and another of similar size is being planned. Natural gas development and energy saving projects in China have been listed as loan projects by the World Bank for the 1994 fiscal year with 255 million U.S. dollars in loans and 10 million U.S. dollars in free aid.
