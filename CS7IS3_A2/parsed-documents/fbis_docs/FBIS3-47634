The all-share composite stock price index was nearing 900 points on a three-day rebound when the announcement that the government wanted prices to drop sent it nosediving 15.85 points to 882.81 as of 2:15 p.m. It had diagnosed signs of overheating in the market, the government said, and so decided to cool things off by letting securities companies lend shares, making institutional investors put down deposits on stock like small investors, and encouraging banks and other financial institutions not to buy shares. This is to take effect on Monday. There was little change on the surface at first as the flood of sell offers generated by the rebirth of share loans and selling by the stock stabilization fund was absorbed, but the selling got the upper hand toward the end of the morning session. Just a few high PER (price/earnings ratio) shares such as Taekwang Industrial Co. and large manufacturing issues such as Pohang Iron and Steel Co. and Samsung Electronics Co. rose by the daily ceiling.
