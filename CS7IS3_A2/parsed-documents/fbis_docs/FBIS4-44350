The signing of the membership treaties with Austria, Finland, Sweden, and Norway, and the signing of the partnership and cooperation agreement with Russia made one thing clear: The EU has begun to successfully tackle the shaping of Europe, shaping a common future of the European peoples in an EU that is linked in partnership with Russia and which includes the Baltic Sea just as it does the Mediterranean. [applause] After the Austrians' impressive yes to Europe, I am confident that our Nordic neighbors will also vote for this community, because never before has it been clearer in Europe that there is no future in acting on one's own account. [applause] With this appeal to its partners, the Federal Government, which will hold the presidency as of 1 July, will now try to achieve a consensus on the succession of Jacques Delors, who has indeed gained great merit with his work for Europe. [applause] If necessary, it will convene an extraordinary European Council for this matter in Brussels on 15 July. The EU needs a strong European figure at the head of the Commission, and this decision must be made quickly. The last thing the EU needs at this decisive landmark is a lack of decisionmaking power and a lack of the ability to achieve consensus. Ladies and Gentlemen, in two days reunited Germany will for the first time take over the chairmanship in the EU Council. We will do everything in our power to make progress in the cause of Europe within this limited period of six months -- in closest coordination with France, which will follow us in the presidency and with which we will subsequently be in the troika, but also with the later presidencies of Spain and Italy. I am currently in the process of visiting all 12 European countries to prepare for that. We Germans see our future in the common European path. This must be our compass. [applause] And we do not want to make any promises that we cannot keep. We must dedicate ourselves to solid, consistent management. Very specific issues must be tackled, such as the employment situation, unemployment, and crime, which are truly burning problems for the people in Europe. At the same time, however, the issue is also the further shaping of our continent, that is, the deepening and enlargement of the nucleus of Europe that the EU constitutes today. In all this we must take our citizens, the people, along. Despite a turnout of only 56 percent in the European elections, I am convinced that the large majority of the people in Europe have indeed understood that no one in Europe can go it alone anymore. Solidarity in moving toward each other and standing side by side is indispensable for all peoples, whether large or small. However, the people expect Europe to contribute with determination to overcoming unemployment and to promoting peace and, above all, internal peace. These are the issues that were the focus in Corfu and will be the main points of emphasis during the German presidency as of 1 July. If we make progress in these fields, we need not worry about the citizens' support. [applause] The Europe of the citizens and democratic parliamentary legitimation -- these are inseparable elements. Certain things apply already: Without the approval of the European Parliament no commissions can be appointed, no budget adopted, and no accessions effected. During our presidency the Federal Government will take particular care to ensure close cooperation among the Council, the Commission, and the Parliament. And we know that we have the support of the Bundestag in this. [applause] Right from the beginning, we Germans have spoken out for increasing the powers of the European Parliament, and we will continue to do so after the Maastricht Treaty. [applause] The participation of two European Parliament representatives in the 1996 government conference, which has been strongly supported by the Federal Government and was agreed in Corfu, is a right signal. The report on enforcing the principle of subsidiarity, which is due at the European Council in Essen, is also of great importance for a sound balance of the different levels. Enforcing the principle of subsidiarity, also by getting back European decisions, has to be a top priority on our agenda. [applause] Ladies and Gentlemen, the preservation of our European way of life and our culture, and the securing of our social network decisively depend on our international competitiveness. With the aim of giving modernization an impetus, and removing obstacles to growth and employment, a number of important measures were agreed in Corfu. The projects to extend trans-European traffic, energy, and communication networks are a top priority in this connection. This includes two high-speed train links in Germany. For the Federal Government sound financing is an absolute must, and we have stated this clearly. What is needed in the member countries also applies to Brussels -- strictest budget discipline. [applause] The second important sector is the reform of the labor market, the creation of jobs in services, the promotion of medium-size companies, and concentration of resources in research. Everyone agreed in Corfu that the reform of the European employment sector, which is urgently required, must not be postponed just because the economy shows signs of recovering. That would be threatening the existence of Germany as a business location. [applause] It is against this background that the Federal Government sees the independent group of experts that is to help the Commission with deregulation. And we will also work toward participation by the social partners in this task. Modernizing Europe as a business location also means further ecological development of the European market. Environmental technology is the main growth sector of the future. We Germans are very far advanced and are international leaders in this field. [applause] It is clear for the German presidency that a carbon dioxide tax needs a European solution. In the field of domestic and legal policy, Ladies and Gentlemen, a report on the prevention of international crime, terrorism, and the drug Mafia will be presented at the Essen Council. These issues, as well as asylum and immigration policy, touch central points of national sovereignty, which makes specific measures very difficult. But in no other field is decisive action, that means effective protection of citizens, more urgent and expected. The new Europe has given its citizens more freedom, more opportunities. Now the necessary measures must be taken to ensure the personal security of citizens. The Franco-German initiative against racism and xenophobia has been welcomed by our partners. And this problem, this has to be pointed out clearly, concerns all the member countries. At the European Council in Essen we will present a common strategy on that. Ladies and Gentlemen, to overcome old, deep national rivalries in Europe and to face the major, vital questions of the European nation together and with great determination -- this was the motive that guided our founding fathers of the European Community. Five years after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the beginning of the major changes in Europe and the world, this is true more than ever. However, it is true in a new, pan-European framework. Today we have a clearer image of the challenges that we have to tackle, the risks that we have to avoid, and the specters of the past that we have to ward off. If there is a special German responsibility in terms of foreign policy in the context of history then it is this: To build the Europe that we are seeking together with the new democracies in Central and East Europe. [applause] The FRG remains an advocate for a whole Europe. The signing of the accession treaties with Austria and the Scandinavian countries, the resolutions on bringing the neighbors in Central and East Europe, the Baltic states, and Slovenia closer to the EU, confirm that Germany's picture of Europe is identical with that of our partners in the EU. Our partners also know that, in the long run, the West cannot do well if the East does not do well, too. [applause] The law on the accession of Austria and the Scandinavian countries has been submitted to the Bundestag today for discussion and a vote. This speedy procedure, which is supported by a wide majority, will be a clear political signal to the citizens in these countries, a signal saying: You are cordially welcome. [applause] Ladies and Gentlemen, new, concrete proposals are to be presented to the European Council in Essen for bridging the difficult transition phase in which the reformist states will be until they can join the EU. A further opening of markets and closer political cooperation even in a preliminary stage are important for us and, as Germans, we will make special efforts in this connection. Prior to the Essen meeting, we will also have to work on the idea, which came up in Corfu, of a conference between the EU and all countries on the shores of the Mediterranean, and to conclude the customs union with Turkey. The two agreements that were concluded with Moscow last week -- the agreement on Partnership for Peace with NATO, and the partnership and cooperation agreement of Corfu -- make it clear that Russia, too, has its place in the European home as a friend and partner. [applause] President Yeltsin is right when he says that this marks an important step for achieving unity on our continent. Ladies and Gentlemen, the Franco-German initiative for the prevention of a new Chernobyl, the consequences of which we dread even to think of, was also discussed in Corfu. It must be our objective to shut down this dangerous reactor type as soon as possible. [applause] This will require alternative energy sources, which, will, of course, cost money, but this money would be well invested in the interest of all people in Europe. At the world economic summit in Naples, the EU will ask the other G-7 partners to help solve the problem. This issue affects everybody -- the industrial nations, and, first and foremost, of course, the Ukrainian Government. The German presidency will take advantage of President Clinton's visit to Berlin on 12 July to reaffirm the friendly ties across the Atlantic. Without these, Europe can find neither its internal nor its external balance. [applause] Ladies and Gentlemen, the ghastly television images from Bosnia or from our neighboring continent, Africa, which we see on television day after day, demonstrate that peace and freedom have not become a matter of course after the end of the East-West conflict -- not even on our European continent, which today numbers 36 states, not including the CIS members. This means that we need a joint foreign and security policy that really deserves this title. [applause] This needs time, but the decisions of Corfu confirm the will to be serious about it. The talks with the parties to the conflict in the former Yugoslavia have entered a decisive stage. The Federal Government is involved in these talks within the framework of the contact group. Yesterday the contact group met and I think and know that it achieved good results. The EU, the United States, and Russia must offer a peace solution and make it clear that the patience of the international community is exhausted. This must be made clear to all three parties to the conflict. Decisive and cohesive action by the EU, Russia, and the United States is necessary. For us Europeans, taking over the administration of Mostar, headed by Administrator Hans Koschnick, is of particular importance. [applause] The Federal Government hopes that a model for the peaceful coexistence of various ethnic groups can be implemented there. This is the only way to ensure the reconciliation of the people in the former Yugoslavia. It is necessary more urgently than ever but it is still extremely difficult to achieve it -- unfortunately. Ladies and Gentlemen, the first presidency of reunited Germany means a particular political opportunity but also a particular obligation. Not only the eyes of the Europeans are directed at Germany and at this presidency. The Federal Government wants to make progress with the pending decisions. In addition, however, it wants to make clear that European integration continues to be a central issue also in reunited Germany. [applause] We have the largest number of neighbors in Europe. For the first time in German history relations with all our neighbors are characterized by mutual will for lasting friendship and cooperation under one common roof. We must and will make good use of this opportunity. Germany's future lies in Europe. [applause]
