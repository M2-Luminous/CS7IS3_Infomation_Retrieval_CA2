A source at the fisheries administration said that thanks to steady control, only 18 cases of illegal fishing in the Japanese waters were uncovered in the first four months of this year. The number compares with 374 cases in the corresponding period of last year. The source said Tuesday's decision came as illegal fishing is feared to swell in the Japanese waters in the high fishery season of June through August. Under the intensified control, the maritime police will assign more patrol boats to potential illegal fishing yards and will pursue and catch all boats involved, the source added.
