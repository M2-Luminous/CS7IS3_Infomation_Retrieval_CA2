The daily AL-QABAS said in its Sunday edition that Muhammad al-Rumi would return to Doha after celebrations for the end of Ramadan, the Moslem month of fasting. The paper said, quoting the Kuwaiti foreign ministry, that al-Rumi had been recalled for talks after television reports in Doha on the situation in Iraq and the impact of a UN-imposed embargo. Kuwait recalled al-Rumi in mid-February and protested to the Qatar government for allowing the official television to give airtime to Iraqi leaders. Apart from Oman, which never broke off links with Iraq, Qatar is the only member of the Gulf Cooperation Council, to have renewed ties with Baghdad since its invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 which sparked the Gulf war.
