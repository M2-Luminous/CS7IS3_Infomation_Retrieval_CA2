The new procedures will go into effect July 1. Extension of the period of stay will apply to foreign journalists, missionaries and other religious workers, company employees and investors in businesses, they said. The ministry will also simplify the papers required to invite foreigners and other attached documents, the officials said. In addition, the ministry will issue an approval paper for visa issuance (a kind of letter of invitation) to foreign science technicians, professors, religious workers and businessmen. Until now, the paper had been issued only to foreign interns for technological training here. Under the new procedures, the approval paper could be obtained from the ministry's immigration office by prospective Korean employers of foreigners. Thereupon, Korean embassies would issue visa to those who file approval papers. Foreigners who wanted to live in Korea for employment previously had to submit applications at Korean embassies for approval from the Justice Ministry. The ministry also required foreign religious or social workers aged 50 or older to leave the country at the end of a certain period of time to seek re-entry. But from now on, they would be allowed to stay permanently. Moreover, from July 1 the ministry will stop checking departing foreigners individually and instead let them be screened by automatic passport reading machinery. The ministry plans to install 43 of the machines, initially at Kimpo airport, with plans to equip all international airports and ports by 1996.
