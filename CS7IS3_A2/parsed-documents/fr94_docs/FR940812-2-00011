FR940812-2-00011 FR940812-2-00010 Procurement List; Addition AGENCY: Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled. ACTION: Addition to the Procurement List. SUMMARY: This action adds to the Procurement List a commodity to be furnished by nonprofit agencies employing persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities. EFFECTIVE DATE: September 12, 1994. ADDRESSES: Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled, Crystal Square 3, Suite 403, 1735 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, Virginia 22202&hyph;3461. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Beverly Milkman (703) 603&hyph;7740. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On May 6, 1994, the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled published notice (59 F.R. 23700) of proposed addition to the Procurement List. Comments were received from the current contractor in response to a request for sales data. The commenter indicated that its flexible disk contract with the Government represented a substantial part of the its total sales. As a result of this comment, the portion of the Government requirement for this flexible disk planned to be added to the Procurement List was reduced to avoid having a severe adverse impact on the contractor. After the comment period announced in the notice of proposed rulemaking closed, the contractor requested an extension of the comment period to file an objection to the Committee's proposal. An extension was granted to the contractor, but no comments were received during the extended comment period. After consideration of the material presented to it concerning capability of qualified nonprofit agencies to provide the commodity, fair market price, and impact of the addition on the current or most recent contractors, the Committee has determined that the commodity listed below are suitable for procurement by the Federal Government under 41 U.S.C. 46&hyph;48c and 41 CFR 51&hyph;2.4. I certify that the following action will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. The major factors considered for this certification were: 1. The action will not result in any additional reporting, recordkeeping or other compliance requirements for small entities other than the small organizations that will furnish the commodity to the Government. 2. The action does not appear to have a severe economic impact on current contractors for the commodity. 3. The action will result in authorizing small entities to furnish the commodity to the Government. 4. There are no known regulatory alternatives which would accomplish the objectives of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (41 U.S.C. 46&hyph;48c) in connection with the commodity proposed for addition to the Procurement List. Accordingly, the following commodity is hereby added to the Procurement List: Disk, Flexible 7045&hyph;01&hyph;283&hyph;4362 (15% of the Government's requirement) This action does not affect current contracts awarded prior to the effective date of this addition or options exercised under those contracts. Beverly L. Milkman, Executive Director. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;19739 Filed 8&hyph;11-&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6820&hyph;33&hyph;P
