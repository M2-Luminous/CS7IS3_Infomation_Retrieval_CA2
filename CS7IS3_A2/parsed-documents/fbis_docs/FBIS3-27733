The officials said the decision was made at a meeting of the Council on Economic Problems formed by the government and parties in the ruling coalition. "A decision (on the tax problem) will be made either Monday evening or Tuesday morning at the latest," Tsutomu Hata, deputy prime minister and foreign minister, told reporters. Shortly after a compromise political reform program was passed by both houses of the Diet earlier Saturday, Hosokawa told a news conference that he has no plan at present to raise the consumption tax rate from the present 3 percent. The officials said the council also decided to complete fiscal 1994 budget by February 15. Manae Kubota, director general of the Economic Planning Agency, said it would be difficult to set any definite timing for a consumption tax hike in view of the current economic situation. Government sources said the ruling coalition plans to carry out tax cuts totaling from 6 to 7 trillion yen, separate from a consumption tax increase. The sources said the proposed reduction, covering both income and local taxes, will be put into effect, retroactive to January 1, and deficit-covering national bonds would be issued to cover revenue shortfalls. The sources said discussions at the economic council focused on how to raise funds for the tax cuts. The Finance Ministry insists that the tax cuts be carried out in tandem with a hike in the consumption tax from the current 3 percent to 7 percent around April 1995, the sources said. They said the ministry wants to use the revenue increase from the consumption tax hike to redeem national bonds to be issued for the income tax cuts. The ruling parties, however, contend that measures to ease the tax burden on low income earners should be taken first, the sources said. They said discussions on the consumption tax hike will likely be carried over into fiscal 1996.
