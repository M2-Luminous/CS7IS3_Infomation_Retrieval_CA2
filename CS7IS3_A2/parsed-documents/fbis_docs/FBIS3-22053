Joy Way said he is concerned about everything having to do with freedom of expression--despite the fact that it is does not deal with his specific area--particularly because during the government of engineer Alberto Fujimori, "absolute press freedom has been guaranteed, with no restrictions whatsoever." For his part, Oswaldo Sandoval, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, said that the government guarantees unrestricted freedom of expression. [passage omitted]
