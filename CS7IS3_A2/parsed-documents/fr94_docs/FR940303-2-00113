FR940303-2-00113 FR940303-2-00065 Finally, section 10702(c)(2)(D) requires that the agreement ``(i) state that it provides for the assignment of motor vehicles for a continuing period of time for the exclusive use of the shipper; or (ii) state that the service is designed to meet the distinct needs of the shipper.'' This reflects the longstanding alternative statutory criteria for contract carriage at 49 U.S.C. 10102(15)(B) (i) and (ii). As we read this language, the agreement need not detail how it meets these statutory criteria, but rather simply must specify which of the two alternative statutory tests is met. We do not believe that Congress meant to make contract drafting an unduly burdensome task or to require a contract to contain legal argument. The requirement, however, does serve to remind parties of the statutory criteria that must be met to qualify as contract carriage. Those criteria (dedication of equipment or distinct needs) are flexible, and how they are satisfied can be tailored to the particulars of each contracting situation. As interpreted by the Commission, ``*␣*␣* assignment of equipment to the exclusive use of the shipper does not necessarily require that specific vehicles be used for one shipper to the exclusion of all others *␣*␣* [but] the contracting shippers must have primary access to the equipment, may view it as their own, and need not compete for its use among themselves or with others'', Continental Contr. Car. Corp. Ext._Modif. of Permit , 121 M.C.C. 882, 900 (1975). The distinct needs alternative has been the subject of numerous Commission and court decisions. Distinct needs can be price and/or service features tailored to the customer's requirements. For example, the distinct needs of a shipper may be met if: ``the new service is better tailored to fit the special requirements of a shipper's business, the length of its purse, or the select nature of the delivery service that is desired.'' ICC v. J&hyph;T Transport Co. , 368 U.S. 81, 93 (1961). Other services that have been found to meet distinct needs are: Special pickup and delivery requirements; special documentation requirements; shipper-carrier liaisons; specialized liability, claims, or credit terms; incidental transportation services; and special rate considerations. See, e.g., Interstate Van Lines, 5 I.C.C.2d at 187&hyph;89. Transportation services that meet a contract customer's distinct needs need not be unique. They may be services that common carriers offer to their customers as well. 4 The issue is whether the services provided are tailored to meet the customer's distinct needs in the context of an on-going contractual relationship. See Zoneskip, 8 I.C.C.2d at 653&hyph;55. 4 Central & So. Motor Frt. Tariff Ass'n v. United States , 757 F.2d 301, 311 & n.55 (D.C. Cir.), cert. denied , 474 U.S. 1019, 106 S. Ct. 568 (1985) (decision that exempted motor contract carriers from our tariff filing requirements). Section 10702(c)(3) introduces a new requirement that written agreements for contract carriage must be retained by the carrier for the life of the agreement and for 3 years thereafter, and that a copy be made available to the Commission upon request. The latter requirement relates to the new statutory directive in section 10702(c)(4) that we ``conduct periodic random audits to ensure that motor contract carriers are complying with [the requirements of section 10702(c)] and are adhering to the rates set forth in their agreements.'' We will be conducting these audits, on a random basis, beginning in May 1994.

This action does not require environmental review because it does not have the potential for significant environmental impacts. 49 CFR 1105.6(c)(7). Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Because this is not a notice of proposed rulemaking within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq .), we need not make the small business impact examination required by the RFA. Nevertheless, we welcome any comments regarding the small entities considerations embodied in the RFA. Decided: February 15, 1994. By the Commission, Chairman McDonald, Vice Chairman Phillips, Commissioners Simmons and Philbin. Sidney L. Strickland, Jr., Secretary.
