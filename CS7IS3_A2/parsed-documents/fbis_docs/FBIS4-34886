Meanwhile, Gonzalez claims the reward is part of a "blackmail campaign" being waged against him. The State Department has published advertisements in several Panamanian newspapers offering a reward to anyone who comes forward with information on the whereabouts of Pedro Miguel Gonzalez, Roberto Garrido, and Daniel Batista, who have been charged with Hernandez's murder and the wounding of another Southern Command soldier. [passage omitted] Meanwhile, Gerardo Gonzalez says the State Department intends to use his son as "a scapegoat to attack and blackmail me." The PRD leader also accused the judicial branch of thwarting his son's constitutional rights by not allowing him to retain a lawyer for the trial in the murder case of soldier Zak Hernandez. According to Gonzalez, Pedro Miguel's only role in the events that took place during former U.S. President George Bush's visit was his participation in the demonstration that took place at Porras Plaza. The Zak Hernandez case was investigated by the Fourth District prosecutor, who requested that Pedro Miguel Gonzalez, Roberto Garrido, and Daniel Batista stand trial. Second District Judge Sandra Huertas De Icaza will assess the merit of the arguments. Initially, the authorities arrested three other people accused of taking part in Hernandez's murder, but they were later acquitted. None of the three Panamanians sought by the State Department has retained defense attorneys, because the courts have not yet accepted the powers of attorney extended by their relatives to a group of attorneys.
