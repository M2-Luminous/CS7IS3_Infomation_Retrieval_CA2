FR941027-2-00103 FR941027-2-00061 IV. Discussion The Commission believes the proposed amendment is consistent with the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to OPRA and, in particular, with Sections 11A(a)(1)(C)(ii) and (D) of the Act. Section 11A(a)(1)(C)(ii) provides for the availability to brokers, dealers, and investors of information with respect to quotations for and transactions in securities. Section 11A(a)(1)(D) provides for the linking of all markets for qualified securities through communications and data processing facilities to foster efficiency, enhance competition, increase the information available to brokers, dealers, and investors, facilitate the offsetting of investor's orders, and contribute to the best execution of such orders. Further, the Commission believes that the amendment is consistent with Rule 11Aa3&hyph;2(c)(2) in that it is appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors and the maintenance of fair and orderly markets, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanisms of, a national market system. The new Data Control Service Provider Agreement and accompanying fee will help OPRA to assure the reliability and integrity of the service that these providers offer OPRA customers. The Agreement will permit OPRA to know the exact number of entitlements a subscriber has arranged for with the Control Service Provider. This will eliminate the need for the Indirect Access Fee, currently paid by those subscribers who receive an uncontrolled data feed whether they have one entitlement or 100. The Control Service Fee, payable by the Provider, will be the same as the fee charged to vendors, thus promoting uniformity and equality in pricing options information. It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 11A(a)(3)(B) of the Act, that the amendments to the OPRA Plan be, and hereby are, approved. For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority, 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(29). Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary.
