"For our party everything will be within the scope of law. May 9 will be just Victory Day," he emphasized. Zyuganov announced that the Communist Party continued to work in the conciliatory commission on the final version of the treaty on civil accord. He repeated that he had submitted the proposals put forward at the recent conference of the Communist Party to the Russian president during the signing ceremony in the Kremlin. Zyuganov himself did not sign the treaty. "We are waiting for a reply and we are ready to discuss the problems," he said. The present text of the document does not conform with aspirations to the national accord, Zyuganov suggested. "This is an accord by officers. Social accord is something different. It must come from the people. There can be no reconciliation in order to rob the people and to destroy the country," Zyuganov said. "On the other hand, it does not give much to entrepreneurs. At the moment entrepreneurs can only sell money instead of producing something," Zyuganov remarked. Speaking at a meeting of veterans of the Great Patriotic War (as World War II is known in Russia) dedicated to the 49-year anniversary of victory, Zyuganov repeated that the Communists were seeking the restoration of the USSR. He also apologized for the criminals who had been the party members and had betrayed their supporters. Now only people representing the cream and the conscience of the nation remain in the Communist Party, Zyuganov reassured.
