The new Security Secretariat, unveiled last week, is not intended "to suppress potential social unrest," the President told reporters at the opening of the fourth Ibero-American Information Science and Law Congress here. Rather, Menem explained, the secretariat is the product of six months of talks between himself and Interior Minister Carlos Ruckauf. He noted that other countries (the United States, France) and several provinces (Cordoba, Buenos Aires) already have similar agencies. Meanwhile in Buenos Aires retired Lieutenant Julian Licastro remained press shy about his position as head of the future Security Secretariat, but opponents of President Carlos Menem's plan to create a new super-agency redoubled their efforts to make their opinion heard. The former military officer and ambassador to Peru met with Interior Minister Ruckauf yesterday to analyze the structure of the new secretariat. The agency will be charged with fighting crime, terrorism, and drug trafficking and is to encompass the Federal Police, Border Guard, Coast Guard, intelligence forces, and Drug-Prevention Secretariat. The secretariat will likely be made a full ministry following the reform of the Constitution. Licasto declined to divulge details to the media following the talks, reporting only that he would hold a press conference at the "opportune moment." Justicialist Deputy (Federal Capital) Miguel Angel Toma, the head of the Lower House defence committee, met with Presidential Chief-of-Staff Eduardo Bauza to express his reservations about the new agency, which Menem may have to create via an executive decree if Congress withholds its support. "It is absolutely unviable, it has no legal basis and it will be quite difficult for it to provide results," Toma told the press before meeting Bauza at Government House. Charged San Isidro Mayor Melchor Posse, a Radical, in a press release: "(Menem) is more interested in purchasing vomit-inducing gases and special weapons for suppression than in attacking the causes of public misery." Buenos Aires Province Radical leader Juan Manuel Casella told Radio Mitre that the President's plans, also solidly backed by Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo, are "evidence of the executive branch's hegemonic purposes."
