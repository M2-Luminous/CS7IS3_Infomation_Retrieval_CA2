During the telephone conversation, he said that in comparison with the first round of the negotiations, the second one was a step forward because detailed discussion started on the issue of a future political statute of Abkhazia, of course, within the context of Georgia's integrity. Delimitation of functions of the central governing bodies, the parliament, various government agencies, and other issues have been discussed. The negotiations stopped at this stage. During the negotiations, Mr. Otar Beridze said, we had to speak about the recent tragedy in Galiy Rayon. Based on the official statements made by our government and the parliament, our group of experts made an appropriate statement, as well. It has been published in the Russian press. The text of the statement was sent to representatives of the United Nations and the CSCE. The Abkhazian party reacted to our statement in silence claiming that they did not want to be involved in arguments since they had their own views on the events. The issue of the return of refugees was also discussed during the negotiations. However, the Abkhazian party still insisted that the return of the displaced be carried out on the basis of the filtration. Unfortunately, the Russian representatives backed up this idea. The Georgian party considered this way of formulating the problem as absolutely unacceptable. In conclusion, Otar Beridze said that the group of experts would still have meetings in Moscow after the third round of negotiations on the settlement of the Abkhaz-Georgian conflict, planned to be held in Geneva on 22 February.
