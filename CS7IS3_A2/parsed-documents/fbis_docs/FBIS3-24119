In the final analysis this fact and the country's convenient location determined the clash of the neighboring states in Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan's former president Abulfaz Elchibei is interviewed by MN observer Sanobar Shermatova. When you were president, Mr. Elchibey, you tried to turn the country's political course away from Russia and towards Turkey and the West. Did you realize that the consequences of this course could be very serious for you? To some extent yes. I did not think that I would hold on for a whole year and allowed myself at the most 3-4 months. At the same time I pinned my hopes on Russian democracy and the West. I wanted to believe that Azerbaijan would begin to speak with Russia not as a slave does with his master, but in the language of civilized states. What was your top priority during your presidency? It was to build the economic basis for Azerbaijan's independence and to end the war. These aims were mutually interconnected. There was, for instance, the agreement with a consortium of nine oil companies to lay a pipeline. According to one proposal, the oil pipeline would pass on Armenia's territory. This was better than running it through Iran, for it would be 18 kilometers shorter, and Western companies prefer to be partners with Armenia, not Iran. We had contacts with the Armenian leadership. They were agreeable, but said frankly: "Neither you nor we will be allowed to do this." This variant would have enabled Armenia to get a profit of 100 million dollars, which would have ended the war. But Russia had its own plans for Azerbaijani oil. It proposed to lay the pipeline along its territory and transport it through Novorossiisk port, or to transport it through a "Friendship" pipeline. The territory of Azerbaijan has been historically an arena of rivalry between Russia, Turkey and Iran. Your pro-Turkish orientation is cited as one of the regions why you lost power. Yes. We Azerbaijanis have a special attitude toward Turkey. Our kinship is based on the language, common Turkic roots and secular mentality. Besides that, Turkey to us is a window to the West, to high technologies, and to economic prosperity. Why should we reject all this? It is interesting to note that when you were in power, Azerbaijan's No. 1 foreign economic partner was not Turkey but Iran, a country which you criticized sharply. Britain was in second place and Russia in third. What caused your negative attitude to Iran, with which Azerbaijan has a common border and maintains close economic relations? There are 20-25 million Azerbaijanis living in Iran, who don't have a single national school. Not only are Azerbaijani national sentiments being trampled on, but their human rights as well. Can we tolerate the oppression of our brothers? When I came out against the oppression of Azerbaijanis in Iran, I did so not as president but as a member of the People's Front whose program includes solidarity with oppressed brothers. I believe that they will be free. Was there any reaction to your statements against Iran? Naturally there was. The Iranian intelligence service worked very actively in our republic. We felt this. The work was done in two ways: they collected intelligence data and distributed religious propaganda. Azerbaijanis, like Persians, belong to the Shi'i branch of Islam, and the promotion of the way of life adopted in Iran after Khomeini came to power was conducted in many Azerbaijani mosques. Iran's parliament allocated 100 million dollars to conduct propaganda in Azerbaijan. We had information that money was distributed among young people who expressed a wish to study at religious educational establishments. It was also used to construct mosques and support pro-Iranian religious leaders. We knew all this, but I did not pay serious attention to these facts. Azerbaijanis are mainly secular people, which is one factor impeding "Iranization." Another important factor is that, as commonly happens, money allocated for propaganda of Iranian values simply ends up lining someone's pockets. The Iranians allotted money for the construction of three mosques in Baku and Gyandzha, but the mosques have not yet been built. I think that the desire for profits will ruin many of these initiatives. Do you intend to come back to power, Mr. Elchibey? If you do, do you exclude having Russia and Iran as close political partners? I believe that the Popular Front, allied with other democratic forces, will come to power sooner or later; it is only a question of time. I stand for close economic ties with neighbors, including Russia which, I think, will in time recognize our right to democracy and independence in foreign-policy matters. I would also like to find states in the West and Israel who could help balance the strong Armenian lobby.
