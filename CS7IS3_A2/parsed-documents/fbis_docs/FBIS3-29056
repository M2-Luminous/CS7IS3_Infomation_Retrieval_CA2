The coalition with some progressive-minded people in the Pusan area as its members, said in a statement the United States should retract an "arms buildup plan" forthwith. It said that in the buildup plan, the United States seeks to deploy Patriot missiles and Apache helicopters in Korea. "The arms buildup plan stands in the way to a peaceful resolution of the North Korean nuclear question," said the statement. "It is a conspiracy to heighten tension and thereby facilitate the sale of weapons whose overseas markets have been obliterated by the advent of the de-Cold War age." The coalition also asked the United States to be more sincere toward nuclear talks with North Korea and called on the South Korean Government to turn down the U.S. plan to deploy modern weapons in Korea and to resume the suspended inter-Korean dialogue.
