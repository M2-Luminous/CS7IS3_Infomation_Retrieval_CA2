The circular pointed out: The Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee set new demands on building a socialist market economic structure and socialist spiritual civilization. Jiang Zemin, chairman of the Central Military Commission, has stressed on many occasions recently that the army should lead the rest of the nation in building spiritual civilization. All army units should earnestly implement the guidelines of the party Central Committee and Central Military Commission's instructions and raise to a new level the learn-from-Lei Feng activities and the building of spiritual civilization. The circular says: In light of the new circumstances and problems in the new situation, all military units should organize officers and men to earnestly study the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and to learn from Lei Feng's glorious deeds and lofty thinking. All military units should guide their officers and men to take Lei Feng as their model; hold high the banner of patriotism and socialism; uphold the communist outlook on life and communist values; carry forward the "five revolutionary spirits" advocated by Deng Xiaoping and the "64-character" pioneering spirits put forward by Jiang Zemin; regulate their words and deeds with such ethics and lofty spirits as self-sacrifice, putting others before oneself, working hard, observing law and discipline, loving the army, and improving military skills; and consciously resist the corrosive effects of money worship, ultra-individualism, and corrupt lifestyle. We must perpetuate traditional Chinese virtues and, on this basis, establish and develop military ethics and standards suitable to our army's character and traits so that the vast numbers of officers and men will have higher ideological consciousness and moral standards, better behavior, and higher scientific and technological and cultural standards and will work hard to become soldiers practicing and spreading new socialist ethics and styles. The circular stresses: We must vigorously publicize and commend advanced models in learning from Lei Feng and building spiritual civilization. We must continue to bring into play the exemplar and guidance role of old models. At the same time, we must try vigorously to find, train, and publicize new models who have distinctive characteristics of our times and who will exert major influence on others. We must vigorously launch all kinds of activities to learn from Lei Feng and build spiritual civilization, actively participate in local public welfare services, transform prevailing habits and customs, assist people in poverty and difficulty, and take part in disaster relief to contribute to fostering new social ethics. We must earnestly strengthen leadership over activities of learning from Lei Feng and building spiritual civilization. We must guide the initiative of the vast numbers of officers and men displayed in learning from Lei Feng and building spiritual civilization at their work posts so that they will work hard to accomplish military training and related tasks.
