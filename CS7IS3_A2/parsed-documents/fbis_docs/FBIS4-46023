"I will direct the ministers not to speak on the nuclear issue or answer any question in this regard," Ms. Bhutto said at a Press conference. She said the nuclear issue was a specialised subject and some nonspecialists were spreading confusion by making statements or replying to questions asked by reporters. Complaining that some newspapers twisted statements in this regard, Ms Bhutto said that from now onward, no one except herself would speak directly on the issue. "Even the foreign minister will give a written statement on the subject so that no one can twist it," she said and added that if any cabinet member had to reply to any question on the issue he should seek its answer from the foreign minister. "Statements are printed to create confusion and that's why we say enough is enough," she added. Ms Bhutto said that first a statement on rolling back Pakistan's nuclear programme was published and, though the government denied it, it was made an issue. "They want to trap us by (printing) such statements" The Prime Minister regretted that every Tom, Dick and Harry had become an expert on this specialised subject. "They use terms like freezing, capping and rolling back, so loosely that Pakistan's interest is hurt."
