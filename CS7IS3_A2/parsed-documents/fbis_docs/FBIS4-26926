It is also true they represent the government, not the people of Hong Kong, and that their right to vote is an anachronism which distorts the democratic process. Both the present and future sovereign powers recognise this. But the demand from some in the Liberal Party that they be banned from voting on the electoral package tomorrow is self-serving. The main proponents of this attempt at rigging the vote in the opposite direction are Henry Tang Ying-yen, an appointee (who represents nobody) and Howard Young, who as tourism representative can hardly claim to speak for the people of Hong Kong. If those who argue against allowing unrepresentative members to vote were consistent, they would demand the abstention of all 10 appointed members. They might also urge the abstention of unrepresentative Functional Constituency members as well. Legco is not representative. That is why appointed members and the officials will be dumped on the scrap heap next year. It is also why Chris Patten is trying to extend the franchise and why the Basic Law recognises future advances in electoral representation. But it is simply not sensible, or desirable, to try to change the rules of the Legco game according to a standard of democratic representation which has never been applied in the past. Legco as it is currently constituted, flaws and all, is the only body which can decide on the competing electoral reform plans.
