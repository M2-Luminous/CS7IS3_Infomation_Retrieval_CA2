Dr. Valentim once again reiterated UNITA's willingness to reach a peace agreement with the Luanda government. The proof that the negotiations are continuing is that the two sides are discussing holding the second round of presidential elections. [Begin Valentim recording] I would like to assure the Angolan and international communities that the talks are continuing. They are not on the verge of collapse. There is no impasse. We are dealing with an extremely delicate issue relating to the final point of the national reconciliation agenda. This has forced us to make an in-depth assessment of the situation, like a submarine underwater, without much publicity. So, an in-depth work is under way. We are dealing with the second round of presidential elections. The issue was raised at a plenary session in which the two sides met face to face. It was a very positive meeting. The talks are continuing with the mediator. Today we had a very fruitful session with the mediator, lasting for hours. There is hope. A great deal of patience is required to hold a very frank debate. That is what we are doing right now, not undiplomatically, but in the interest of Angola. [end recording]
