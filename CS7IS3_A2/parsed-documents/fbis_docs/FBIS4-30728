The original Soviet Intersputnik dish now carries nothing except for occasional TV transmissions and Telstra OTC's expatriate technicians have nearly completed their job of setting up a brand new International Telecommunications Centre for Phnom Penh. The Standard 'A' satellite earth station is already completed and the necessary transmission equipment should be ready in time for commissioning in September this year. The relationship between the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MPTC) and Telstra goes back to 1990, when the Australian company first approached the Cambodians with a proposal to develop the telecommunications sector. Since then, Telstra has invested over U.S. $16 million of its own money in the Cambodian project. Russell Stuart, Telstra's senior representative in the country explained that telecommunications is "a revenue-generating industry...which can develop by itself". The present financial arrangement is that MPTC will receive 100 per cent of the revenue from outgoing calls as well as 51 per cent of the revenue from incoming calls. Telstra gets the leftover 49 per cent. The Australians are evidently making a long-term investment. This was confirmed by Minister of Posts and Telecommunications, So Khun, on a visit to the new centre recently. He anticipated his ministry's relationship with Telstra continuing into the next century and said he "very much appreciated" Telstra's co-operation. At present, subscriber calls first go to the General Post Office Exchange and then via fibre optic cable to the Bayon centre which currently has direct links to only four countries -- Japan, Australia, Singapore and Thailand. From September, Phnom Penh subscribers will be linked straight to the new centre's earth station which will provide access to more than 200 countries worldwide. Telstra brought in its own workers to install the telecommunications equipment but is training 150 Cambodian MPTC staff to take over the operation of the centre.
