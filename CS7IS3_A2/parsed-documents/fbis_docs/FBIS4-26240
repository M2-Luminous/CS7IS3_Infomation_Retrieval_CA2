The letter said that ARATS hopes the negotiations will help resolve disputes at an early date and help them to finalize three other agreements, including one involving the repatriation of people who entered the other side through illegal means. The fourth business-like negotiations, which were held earlier this year, did not reach expected results due to various factors, said the letter. Tang Shubei, executive vice-chairman of ARATS, said in a separate letter to Chiao Jen Ho [Jiao Renhe], vice-chairman of SEF, that he hopes both Jiao and he would make joint efforts to help promote cooperation between the two organizations and improve relations across the Taiwan Straits. The letter said that in accordance with agreements reached earlier, the time to hold the bi-annual meeting between officials in charge of the two organizations and the quarterly meeting between officials at the deputy secretary general level will come soon.
