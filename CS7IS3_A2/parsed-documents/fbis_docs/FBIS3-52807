[passage omitted] Asked about Israel's claims that the so-called Cairo document is the only basis for negotiations, Dr. Sha'th said that that which is agreed upon and signed will be the basis. This was the case with the Declaration of Principles, which was initialed in Oslo, he said, noting that the Cairo draft was not signed. We must not overtake events, he said. He explained that the Cairo document includes some disputed issues that must be resolved. But he said there are many points of agreement, which makes us hope a final agreement will be reached. On a linkage between the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations and the upcoming summit between Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. President Bill Clinton, Sha'th stressed that the summit is a contributing, not a frustrating, factor for the Palestinian-Israeli talks. We want Syria to return to the peace process armed with its right to a full Israeli withdrawal from the Golan, he said. When this happens, he added, it will reflect positively on the peace process and the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations. [passage omitted] Sha'th denied that Jordan told the Israelis it rejects a Palestinian presence on the crossings between Jericho and the Jordanian border. [passage omitted]
