We promised to give you the details about this event, so let us listen to a report by our correspondent Yevgeniy Nikonov. [Nikonov] Taking up office and placing his hand on the Constitution of the Chuvash Republic, President Nikolay Fedorov took the oath: [Fedorov] "I pledge, in carrying out my duties as president of the Chuvash Republic, to observe the Constitution and laws of the Chuvash Republic, the Constitution and laws of the Russian Federation, and to defend its sovereignty, to respect and preserve the rights and freedoms of the individual and the citizen, the rights of the peoples of the Chuvash Republic, and to conscientiously carry out the obligations entrusted to me by the people, which will be the guarantor of friendship and cooperation with all peoples, and to be responsible for my actions before the people." [Nikonov] In his inaugural speech, in which he set out his political credo, Fedorov said that as president he would sanction freedom, knowledge, culture, and morality, and in the sphere of the economy he would support the people who are working and producing goods. [Fedorov] "A politician can only become a professional and can only truly help Russia when we link him with the interests of the country's commodity producers and the will of the entities of the Russian Federation. The question is not so much one of dramatis personae as of the principle of shaping a mechanism to work out a policy that is answerable to the Russian people." [Nikonov] On behalf of Russian President Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin, Fedorov was congratulated by Sergey Aleksandrovich Filatov, the head of the president's administration. [Filatov] "Permit me, on the instructions of Russian President Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin, to heartily congratulate Nikolay Vasiliyevich Fedorov, the first president of the Chuvash Republic on his election, his taking of office, and the beginning of his work, and to wish him all the best on this path although it will be a very, very difficult one. I have to say that we have lived through a very tough and dramatic year, a year that has seen everything -- a crisis in the economy, a crisis of power, and a political crisis, and which, unfortunately, has ended in a dramatic way because of the fact, in the main, the structures of power have not been able to cope with the tasks and aspirations facing our country. It has to be said that the reformation of the power structures is under way, is continuing, and today the Chuvash Republic has also embarked upon the reformation of its own power structures, strengthening the authority of its executive structure."
