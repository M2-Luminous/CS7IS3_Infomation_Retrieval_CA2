Zhirinovskiy is expected to arrive on March 20 for a two-day visit. He was invited by Miroslav Sladek's Assembly for the Republic-Republican Party of Czechoslovakia (SPR-RSC) earlier this year, two days after Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus said he hoped the Russian leader would not come to the Czech Republic. The Czech Republic has no visa requirement for Russian citizens, and as a member of Russia's parliament Zhirinovskiy may also avail himself of his diplomatic passport, so that no legal obstacles exist to prevent him from entering the country. Nevertheless, Ruml said he would look into other possibilities. "In the law on foreigners' stays on Czech territory there is a passage I will make use of. It states that a visit can be denied for a year if, among other things, it is absolutely necessary for the state's security, the maintenance of public order, the protection of health, or the rights and freedoms of others.
