The source added that Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's special representative in Cyprus, is expected in Cyprus on Saturday [12 February] accompanied by a group of UN experts. The same source clarified that it is not the same group of experts who visited Cyprus earlier and prepared reports on the fenced-off area of Famagusta and the Nicosia International Airport. Referring to the UN secretary general's two-month deadline for the Nicosia-New York talks to conclude, government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said the government believes this is the maximum period that should be allocated, adding: Discussion on the substance of the Cyprus issue should begin immediately afterward. The spokesman said that negotiations are now being held with the UN secretary general's representatives to prepare a list of points described as key positions--the answers to questions such as how the Nicosia Airport will operate and how the fenced-off area of Famagusta will be opened up. Kasoulidhis added that this list will remain open until late next week for suggestions to be added by both sides. Answering another question, the spokesman said the National Council members will have the opportunity to express their positions on the points in the list before it is finalized.
