In the VIP lounge of the Bangui-Npoko International Airport, President Patasse announced that the Central African Republic [CAR] had joined the LCBC. He stated this during an interview with Adrien Ngueya: [Begin recording] Ngueya: Mr. President, you left Bangui yesterday and are back today. What was the CAR's interest in being at the LCBC summit? Patasse: Before answering your question I would first of all like to discharge a duty, that of thanking the entire population of the CAR, and informing them that I have returned very comforted. This is because Africa has woken up. I would also like to thank Gen. Sani Abacha, leader of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, and the entire Nigerian people for the reception accorded me yesterday and this morning. [passage omitted] As you know, the CAR is the main water source for the Lake Chad. As I speak, Lake Chad is in danger. From an initial area of 25,000 square kilometers, Lake Chad now covers only 1.5 square kilometers. Despite all that has been done, the encroachment of the desert and the sahel continues. The only thing we can do now is to try to save Lake Chad. Fortunately the heads of state of the LCBC member countries understand that they cannot find solutions to Lake Chad's problems without the CAR. In 1964 the countries bordering Lake Chad decided to create the LCBC. At that time there was plenty of water, and in our capacity as the then minister of rural development in this country, we called for the adhesion of the CAR to the LCBC. Our appeal was not heeded, and at that time we threatened to divert the waters of the Laou and the Louam to the south, but wisdom prevailed and today we have now become a member of the LCBC, not to ask for anything, but as a member who has something to offer. That is why the Abuja summit constitutes a decisive step on the way to true regional integration. The four member countries -- Nigeria, Niger, Chad, Cameroon -- (?border on) Chad Lake, but the CAR possesses the headwaters, which puts us in a privileged situation. That is why the heads of state asked for my presence, to know whether the CAR would like to be part and parcel of this commission. There will be some readjustments to make, because desertification is continuing, and it is not in our interest to let it encroach upon our respective countries. On this occasion we once again demonstrated our sense of solidarity [words indistinct]. All the member countries realized the looming danger, and we also stated that, since the CAR is the backbone of the Lake Chad basin and that of the Congo River, we will have a decisive role to play. That is why the heads of state are counting on the CAR, so that we can fully contribute to the achievement of this regional integration. We, therefore, hoisted the CAR flag among those of the LCBC member countries, and for us, within the framework of changes wanted by the CAR people, this membership in the LCBC is additional proof that we have recorded a victory. That is in a few words what I can tell you. I came back very (?satisfied). I spoke on behalf of the people of the CAR with pride and conviction that our country has a decisive role to play. The ideals of Boganda [deceased prominent political figure] and of the entire population of the CAR -- who struggled for regional integration -- are being proved correct each day. These are the ideals we have adopted. That is why we want a dynamic and concrete diplomacy, and why we have to use our knowledge and experience, so that Central Africa, and in short Africa, can say that at last Africans have understood the situation and are now pooling their resources for the welfare of the entire African people. I thank you. [end recording] Outside this summit, President Patasse and Chadian Head of State Idriss Deby held discussions this morning before leaving Abuja. Our colleague, Koudeyere Nokonk, who was present in Abuja, interviewed President Deby. [Begin recording] Nokonk: Mr. President, the deliberations of the summit were suspended yesterday to wait for the CAR leader. Can you explain the reasons for that decision? Deby: First of all I would like to air my views, that is, Chad's views, on the membership of the CAR in the LCBC. Chad is very happy about the CAR's new membership in the commission. It is a great event which contributes to the consolidation of the LCBC. In fact, we suspended the deliberations after the first plenary session at the level of the heads of state to wait for the arrival of my brother, President Patasse. This is because we know that the CAR's contribution to making decisions concerning the entire subregion is essential. There was also a need for the CAR to participate in decisions which had to be taken immediately after it joined the LCBC. Furthermore, Patasse was willing and fully ready to contribute, and that is why we deemed it useful to wait for him. The arrival of President Patasse -- who actively took part in very (?significant) deliberations yesterday evening, and in the decisions that you heard about and which continue (?to be commented) on -- was a major event in all that can affect the commission's future. I am happy about that, and I think that we have (?strong) support within the LCBC, not only concerning the CAR's membership, but also thanks to the new dimension that we gave to the LCBC.
