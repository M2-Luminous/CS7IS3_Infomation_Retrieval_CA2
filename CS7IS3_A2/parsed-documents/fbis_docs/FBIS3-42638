Aleksandr Vengerovskiy is the Deputy Chairman of the State Duma from the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] faction. So far he has not said much in parliament.... Biographical note. Born in 1953 in Moscow. Russian, from a family of physicians, graduated MAI [Moscow Aviation Institute], faculty of radioelectronics of flight equipment. Worked in civil aviation. Served as an officer in the Main Administration of Military Space Science as a specialist in the area of computer equipment and systems for control of objects in space. At the height of his administrative career, already a "civilian," he became chief of the Main Administration of the State Committee for Computer Equipment and Information Science. He oversaw and organized the development of software in the USSR. He entered the CPSU while in the army. He did not tear up his communist party card but he terminated his membership.... [Chaplygin] How do you evaluate the causes of the success of the LDPR in the recent elections? [Vengerovskiy] In Rus, for example, there was always a legal opposition. Under the tsar it was the court jester. But the people always respected members of the opposition just as they did God's fools. Recall Vasiliy Vlazhenyy. Our people understood why we conduct agitation and propaganda in precisely this way and no other. We speak the same language, using the same sign system. In the LDPR I handled purely specialized issues. I was deputy prime minister of the shadow cabinet of ministers, that is, I organized the intellectual team of the LDPR. [Chaplygin] Are you obliged to follow the party line? And if you were faced with a choice of whom to obey, yourself or the party, which so far is associated with one person? [Vengerovskiy] We have a party leader, we have a politburo, they are all the chairman's team. I am a member of the team of the party chairman, Zhirinovskiy. We hold the same positions and operate on the basis of the same argument-program of the LDPR. [Chaplygin] You have come to parliament. What is your minimum program? [Vengerovskiy] To work legislatively. The main aspects of my minimum program are to fight crime. The second is to change the economic course of reforms and foreign policy. And changes are taking place even now. For example, Kozyrev has begun to speak in a more pragmatic language. Moreover, we will defend the dignity of the Russian person regardless of where he may be. The success we have achieved is not the end of the line for us. Our plans for the next two years call for including the LDPR in the country's political structure and supporting multiparty democracy. If someone rocks the fragile boat of our democracy, we shall try to stabilize the situation. They all understand that we are not fascists, we are a party of realists and centrists who are not indifferent to the fate of our homeland. [Chaplygin] Maximum program? [Vengerovskiy] We will go to the presidential elections taking advantage of the parliamentary possibilities. [Chaplygin] And if it seems to members of the politburo of the LDPR that the party leader is too scandalous would it be possible to do without him in the future? [Vengerovskiy] Nobody has been tempted to create a schism in the LDPR. Our strength lies in unity. We have one leader, there are no doubts here, it is Zhirinovskiy. [Chaplygin] Statements on behalf of the LDPR abroad are alarming more than just politicians, they could evoke hostility toward Russians. [Vengerovskiy] There are two types of civilizations: They are the spiritual-Russian and the Western-consumer civilization. Countries and people must determine for themselves which civilization they will belong to. I am convinced that the victory will go to spirituality in any case. And Zhirinovskiy is the leader in this struggle. He is the one now who is restoring the real parity that should exist in the world. When the balance of forces--the United States on the one hand and the USSR on the other--is disturbed, this could lead to the beginning of a third world war. Until we put an end to this situation and polarity appears, the world will be on the brink of great trials. Therefore the LDPR sets for itself the task of restoring our country's might. Only a mighty Russia and her mighty people will make it possible to provide stability throughout the world. But there are forces who do not want this. And we can designate them with a general term of "world forces behind the scene." We have a strong intellectual group. We call it the "shadow cabinet of ministers." It is preparing many surprises for everyone.
