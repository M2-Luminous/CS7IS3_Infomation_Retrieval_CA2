In the past 18 months, more than R16-billion [rand] has flowed out of the country as international and local businesses react to political uncertainty and unrest. Since 1985, the figure is estimated at close on R50-billion -- money this country can ill afford to lose with massive unemployment and the expected demands on socio-economic programmes during the next five to 10 years. A senior Reserve Bank spokesman said it was difficult to establish exactly what percentage of the money that left the country was taken out illegally. "But we are aware of the different ways that companies and individuals use to take their money offshore. And the fact that several people have landed in prison because of illegal transactions and foreign exchange fraud confirms that we are ready to act and to act with the full force of the law," said the spokesman. [passage omitted] But the spokesman for the Reserve Bank warned that the bank and the commercial branch of the South African police had excellent relationships with the relevant departments in these countries and that details of these illegal accounts and transactions would be laid bare to the bone. "We view these crimes in a very serious light and will leave no stone unturned to expose and bring to book people who have committed these crimes. "Our courts have already shown that they have little sympathy for these so called white collar criminals." [passage omitted]
