Everything is ready so far as organization is concerned, and only the details need to be finalized. This was the report given today in Havana by Vice Foreign Minister Jorge Bolanos and Cuban Ambassador to Colombia Jesus Martinez. The Cuban ambassador said different versions of the summit's main document had already been analyzed, and that the first to receive copies were the host countries: Mexico, Spain, Brazil, Colombia, and Argentina. The fifth summit will be held in the last country. He added that he was here to convey the attention being paid to the Cuban position and to make recommendations concerning the contents of the various subjects. He said the Cuban position has achieved consensus among these five countries. Moreover, Bolanos referred to the previous three summits, the objectives concerning cooperation and integration, and the key factor for success. [Begin Bolanos recording] We made an assessment of the three previous summits because the results are not in keeping with the aspirations. Cuba has always tried to strengthen the [word indistinct] and the integration ideas, and we will continue working in this fourth summit toward those objectives. With this summit, we hope to break some barriers to adopt positive actions, not only in the cultural but in the educational areas as well, and to discuss some problems that might be hampering integration. [end recording] He added that this summit will be important so far as functioning is concerned, and that in addition to speeches by the chiefs of delegations, which will each be seven minutes in length, there will be panels to discuss different issues, and that these panels will be chaired by outstanding figures from the region. He also highlighted the position Cuba will take to the summit in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia. [Begin Bolanos recording] We are not leading preparations for the summit, but we are preparing proposals concerning trade violations, certain obstacles to integration, and cooperation on our commercial development with our economy, and investments that I think are very important.
