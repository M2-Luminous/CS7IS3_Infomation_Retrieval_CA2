This strategy was reported by congressman Fernando Olivera and it is obvious to all: First during an interview with the U.S. television station CNN, and then with the local RPP [Radio Programas del Peru], Garcia extends a bouquet to Fujimori, saying he agrees with him, that he recognizes Fujimori's good government. The political message is clear: If Alan Garcia gets what he wants, he would support Fujimori with his party's vote at the forthcoming elections slated for next year. That vote could tip the balance in favor of the president and end the virtual tie, as demonstrated by the polls between Fujimori and Perez de Cuellar, should the latter finally launch his candidacy. Strategists of this rapprochement between the government and APRA [American Popular Revolutionary Alliance] assume that the vote controlled by Alan Garcia would be about 15 percent of overall votes, based on the results of the 1990 elections. This may be somewhat exaggerated if we consider the latest municipal elections where APRA was practically torn to pieces at the ballot boxes. Also, nothing guarantees that APRA members will blindly follow Alan Garcia's electoral instructions, as happened over the order given by Haya de la Torres in 1956 and which led Manuel Prado to victory. Meanwhile, the possibility that Alan Garcia might be negotiating some sort of a pact with Fujimori is already rattling APRA. Agustin Mantilla, who was recently released -- was his release an offering to Garcia? -- claims that it is impossible to dialogue "with a dictatorship." This position was immediately supported by Hugo Otero, a tireless applauder of the former president of the Republic (as we see it, the most fearful enemy facing the unity of APRA continues to be the former president's self-exile). Worst of all, however, is the fact that members of the government seem to be flirting with the idea of negotiating with Garcia, of bartering his impunity for an electoral endorsement. If this is consolidated, it would be an even greater error than the clumsy rapprochement attempt with Abimael Guzman, which included sending a birthday cake to Iparraguirre, which deprived the government of so many votes in the 31 October 1993 referendum. Any whitewash of Garcia would be Fujimori's ethical and political funeral.
