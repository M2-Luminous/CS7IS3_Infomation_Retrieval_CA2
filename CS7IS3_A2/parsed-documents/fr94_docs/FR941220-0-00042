FR941220-0-00042 FR941220-0-00007 The change in this final rule will delay the applicability of the regulations where they may conflict with foreign law or policy. This rule imposes no additional burdens on the regulated industry. Without this delay in the implementation date, persons onboard U.S. vessels in waters that are subject to the jurisdiction of a foreign government would become subject to the requirements of part 16 on January 2, 1995. Delaying the implementation date ensures that the applicability of part 16 will continue unchanged. Accordingly, the Coast Guard finds that good cause exists under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) to publish this rule without notice and comment and to make this rule effective less than 30 days after publication in the Federal Register. Regulatory Evaluation This final rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6 (a)(3) of that order. It has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). The economic impact of these changes is so minimal that further evaluation is not necessary. This final rule modifies the effective date for compliance with Coast Guard regulations governing drug testing, insofar as those regulations would require testing of persons onboard U.S. vessels that are subject to the jurisdiction of a foreign government. It does not change the basic regulatory structure of that rule. Small Entities Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632). This rule does not require a general notice of proposed rulemaking and, therefore, is exempt from the regulatory flexibility requirements. Although exempt, the Coast Guard has reviewed this rule for potential impact on small entities. The amendment in this final rule only extends a compliance date, and imposes no costs on affected entities. Therefore, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Collection of Information This rule contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ). Federalism The Coast Guard has analyzed this rule in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and has determined that it does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. The authority to require programs for chemical drug and alcohol testing of commercial vessel personnel has been committed to the Coast Guard by Federal statutes. This final rule does, therefore, preempt State and local regulations regarding drug testing programs requiring the testing of persons onboard U.S. vessels in waters that are subject to the jurisdiction of a foreign government. Environment The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this final rule, and has concluded that, under section 2.B.2.1 of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, it is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. This final rule merely extends an implementation date and clearly has no environmental impact.
