I was surprised recently when I could verify that in fact many Brazilian companies have become smaller and more competitive. But there still is much to be done in this field, especially sectors that are lagging behind international quality standards." Interview published in JORNAL DO BRASIL on 6 February 1994. Industrial Policy "An industrial policy, which unfortunately we still lack, must be adopted in Brazil. The country opened its market and removed customs barriers, and the industrial policy model of replacing imports (a policy that privileged domestic manufacturing, imposing trade barriers on the importation of products similar to those manufactured locally), is no longer applicable. Brazil has not adapted its industrial policy to the reality of foreign trade." Interview published in JORNAL DO BRASIL on 6 February 1994. Inflation "The main problem with inflation, even with monetary correction, is that it destroys future expectations, making people live only in the present -- an increasingly short present. This trend is not compatible with the idea of investment because financial speculation is more profitable than economic activities." Article published in FOLHA DE SAO PAULO on 22 February 1994. Stabilization "The solution is stabilization. As the Catholic Church used to say before the Second Vatican Council: Out of stabilization, there is no salvation. There is no measure, no matter how appropriate it may be, nor any internal or external plan, that will work without economic stabilization." Interview published in JORNAL DO BRASIL on 6 February 1994. Social Pact "Since 1986 I have observed many similarities between what is happening here and in Russia (...) In Brazil, as in Russia, the old country resists changes. What is happening in Brazil and in Russia is that there is no consensus. Social pacts have been broken, there is an absence of hegemonic thought, and we are facing the situation that Italian politician Antonio Gramsci [1891-37] used to describe: The old resist dying, the new world cannot be born, and in this impasse all sorts of morbid symptoms appear. Corporate interests break up the political system in such a way that it is very difficult to make decisions for the common benefit because no one understands what the common benefit is." Interview published in JORNAL DO BRASIL on 6 February 1994. Social Action "To hamper the economic adjustment means running the risk of precipitating expectations capable of complicating the election process, restraining and paralyzing any future government, leaving the way open only for the destructive alternative of hyperinflation to break the impasse (...) To end inflation is the first and best social measure." FOLHA DE SAO PAULO on 31 December 1994. [date as published] Speculation "Among broad sectors of society, there is no true awareness about the need to curb inflation. On the one hand, we have half a dozen people who, in real partnership with inflation, are multiplying their wealth with no effort at all. On the other hand, the majority of the people, who are suffering the impact of the steep price increases, daily express their anguish in face of this reality, but in the end accept living with it." Article published in O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO on 8 February 1994. Political Transition "Political support -- as a result of consensus -- for the stabilization program will be capable of generating enough psychological power to turn around the negative expectations that still prevail in Brazil. The concrete chance to successfully walk along the path of economic stabilization will lead us to a much better political transition in 1994, free of the frights of 1989-90." FOLHA DE SAO PAULO on 22 February 1994. Democracy "The issue is not to support President Itamar Franco's government or a given minister, although the different political forces have promised to do so when he came to power. The presidential candidates must understand that the more they try to put off the struggle against inflation to 1995, the greater the risk of affecting their mandates, bringing forward voters' frustrations and wearing out people's confidence in the democratic system." FOLHA DE SAO PAULO on 22 February 1994. Elections "Now that we are approaching the time when people will elect their next rulers and representatives, it is our duty as citizens to unite in a national movement to stabilize the economy. (...) It is imperative that now more than ever the exercise of democracy go way beyond the act of voting." O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO on 8 February 1994.
