He disagreed with a news agency report that a passport had been seized from the accused "Ivan L." because he had refused the summons of the police corps investigator for quite a long time. Lexa said he had been deprived of his travel documents because of the character of his criminal activities and not because he had refused the summons. Slovak Alien and Passport Police seized the documents from Lexa in connection with the accusation of defamation of the state and its representative. Lexa is alleged to have cast doubt on the morals of President Michal Kovac and his professional capabilities due to his age. According to Slovak Radio, Lexa's lawyer lodged a complaint against the defamation charge and demanded that it be labelled as illegal.
