Yoneda, who belonged to the faction led by former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe, said he "cannot act freely inside the faction." Yoneda said he plans to team up with a group of five LDP defectors who quit the party Monday. The five defectors backed Watanabe in his bid for the premiership. Watanabe formally gave up the bid Tuesday. Another five LDP lower house legislators quit the party last Friday and formed a new party called New Party Mirai (Future) on Monday. Another LDP lower house member, Kenji Kosaka, left the party Monday. Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], the coalition's core party formed by LDP defectors last summer and led by Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, agreed in an executive meeting Tuesday to the entry of Kosaka, independent lower house member Shigeru Ishiba and House of Councillors member Hiroko Hayashi, a former LDP member, party officials said. Hata, also deputy prime minister, is regarded as a most likely successor to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa who has announced he is resigning to take responsibility for his controversial personal finance deals. The LDP had been in power for 38 years until last August when it was ousted by Hosokawa's coalition after a general election the previous month.
