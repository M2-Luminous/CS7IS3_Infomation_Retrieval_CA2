Last Friday [11 March] Prime Minister Berov underwent a quadruple bypass operation. In the absence of the prime minister parliament cannot exercise its right of control over the executive because under the Constitution the prime minister is solely responsible for his cabinet's policy, DEMOKRATSIYA, the daily of the Union of Democratic Forces (SDS), writes. The bill moved by National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov for amending the Constitution envisages a possibility for one quarter or more of the MP's to move for an early dissolution of parliament when parliament is unable to exercise control over the government. The Constitution provides for a dissolution of parliament only when it fails to form a cabinet. The bill adds to the characteristic features of the state as a parliamentary republic, DEMOKRATSIYA writes, expressing the belief that it would be realistic and sensible for the majority in parliament to support such a change in the Constitution. In its leader the socialist DUMA writes that President Zhelyu Zhelev invited former Foreign Minister Stoyan Ganev to head a caretaker cabinet, citing no source. According to this daily, the two of them met in Paris last week when the head of state paid a three-day visit to the French capital to attend the UNESCO commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the rescue of the Bulgarian Jews. It is hardly probable that the president's busy schedule would have allowed for such a meeting to happen, presidential spokesman Valentin Stoyanov told DUMA. After this possible meeting, however, the president "started a shuttle for recruiting candidate caretaker ministers", DUMA writes citing unnamed reliable sources. The frequently mentioned as candidate prime minister Dimitur Ludzhev (former deputy prime minister and present leader of the New Policy Centre centrist formation) is no longer a favourite of the president's because of his strong ties with Bulgarian and foreign business circles", DUMA writes. "Academician Blagovest Sendov Is Ready To Form a Cabinet", reads the headline of the leader in OTECHESTVEN VESTNIK today. KONTINENT runs similar information. After his meeting yesterday [16 March] with the leader of the ethnic Turks' Movement for Rights and Freedoms (DPS) Ahmed Dogan, the academician, who was deputy in the Grand National Assembly, said that he is ready to take the post of prime minister should the political forces desire this.
