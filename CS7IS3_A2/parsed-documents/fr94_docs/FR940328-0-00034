FR940328-0-00034 FR940328-0-00012 In the October 14, 1992, proposed rule and associated notifications, all interested parties were requested to submit factual reports or information that might contribute to the development of a final rule. The public comment period ended on December 14, 1992. Appropriate State agencies, county governments, Federal agencies, scientific organizations, and other interested parties were contacted and requested to comment. A newspaper notice inviting public comment was published in the ``Honolulu Advertiser'' on October 23, 1992. Only one letter of comment was received, from a conservation organization, supporting the listing of these taxa from the Koolau Mountain Range, island of Oahu, but raising no specific issues. Summary of Factors Affecting the Species After a thorough review and consideration of all information available, the Service has determined that Chamaesyce deppeana (Boiss.) Millsp. ('akoko), Cyanea truncata (Rock) Rock (haha), Cyrtandra crenata St. John and Storey (ha'iwale), Cyrtandra polyantha C.B. Clarke (ha'iwale), Eugenia koolauensis Degener (nioi), Hesperomannia arborescens A. Gray (no common name (NCN)), Lobelia oahuensis Rock (NCN), Lycopodium nutans Brack.
