FBIS4-33598 "drlat110_n_94004" FBIS-LAT-94-110 Daily Report 7 Jun 1994 Chile Court Sentences Leftist Daily's Director, Editor Court Sentences Leftist Daily's Director, Editor PY0706144894 Madrid EFE in Spanish 0044 GMT 7 Jun 94 PY0706144894 Madrid EFE Spanish BFN [Text] Santiago, 6 June (EFE) -- The Chilean courts on 6 June sentenced Juan Andres Lagos, director of EL SIGLO, and reporter Francisco Herreros to 541 days in jail for "serious offenses" against Supreme Court members. The process began with the charges filed by Supreme Court President Marcos Aburto after EL SIGLO criticized the Supreme Court decision to transfer the case of a missing political prisoner to the military court. In commenting on the decision made by Judge Maria Antonia Morales, the director of the newspaper with communist leanings said that, unfortunately, in Chile "freedom of expression and press has serious limitations." Lagos said: "We made a public judgment of political, legal, and justified nature regarding a decision by a Supreme Court chamber that created major commotion in our country that even led a court member to leave his post after Congress studied the situation." Lagos said that time has proven their position right because the military court definitely dismissed the case for the arrest and disappearance of Alfonso Chanfreaux in 1974. Defense lawyer Eduardo Contreras recalled that for a similar case and during the same time the director and a columnist for the conservative daily EL MERCURIO were acquitted. The two men announced they will appeal the court sentence, which they could serve in freedom but under the custody of a penitentiary guard. Lagos reiterated that with sentences like the one they received, serious obstacles are being established against freedom of expression and restrictions imposed on the critical judgment of certain branches of government.
