Cermak, ODS executive deputy chairman, said "the ODS is convinced that the issue could be solved relatively quickly." ODS Chairman and Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus said that the council had not discussed the restitution of gentry's property, but would deal with it later. He added that the party would not like all property relations in the Czech Republic to be complicated due to pure legislation. Some 200 restitution claims have been made by the gentry, including 75 cases which reportedly fall under the Benes decrees. The decrees of 1945 provided for the expropriation of Germans, Hungarians, and other collaborators with the Nazis. ODS Deputy Chairman Jiri Vlach said that the ODS staff in charge of the local elections, slated for the autumn, had convoked a meeting of all regions' representatives in Nymburk, central Bohemia, on January 31."
