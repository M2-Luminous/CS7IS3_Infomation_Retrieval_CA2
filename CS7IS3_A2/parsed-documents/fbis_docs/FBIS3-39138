A Minor Agreement...'"] [Text] Rome -- [LA REPUBBLICA] Mr. Maroni, did you know that there are now rumors of a secret meeting between [League Secretary] Bossi, [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi, and [National Alliance leader] Fini? [Maroni] That is quite ridiculous. You will never see any such meeting; we will never sit down at the same table as Fini. [LA REPUBBLICA] But Berlusconi, your great ally, has just signed an agreement with the Italian Social Movement [MSI]. [Maroni] It is not a political agreement nor an agreement on policy. It is merely an agreement to defeat the left in central and southern Italy. As far as we are concerned, they are still fascists; we will sweep them away. [LA REPUBBLICA] But this "triangle" has every appearance of a political calculation: If Bossi allies with Berlusconi and Berlusconi allies with Fini, Bossi is allying with Fini. [Maroni] That would threaten to split Italy, with the north going to the League and the south to the National Alliance, with Berlusconi acting as a link. In any case, how could we ally with a party that is waging war on us? [LA REPUBBLICA] What are you referring to? [Maroni] Fini will field his own candidates in all the constituencies of the north, which means against the League. [LA REPUBBLICA] The MSI's strength in those areas does not appear to be unstoppable. [Maroni] They will field Servello in Milan, and in any case, even if they were to field Almirante--brought back to life--those lists are stacked against us, irrespective of the names on them. But in this election we will have great pleasure in proclaiming the death of the DC [Christian Democratic Party] and the MSI. [LA REPUBBLICA] The end of [Italian Popular Party Secretary] Martinazzoli's party? [Maroni] Of course. They will not win a single seat in the north, at most two or three seats in the Senate as a result of the fragmentation of the vote. From the proportional quota, they will not gain the minimum 4 percent. Martinazzoli's idea is suicidal. [LA REPUBBLICA] Will you too not pay a high price for the MSI's "support." [Maroni] I repeat: We have nothing to share with them. Fini and his men will not be part of the single liberal-democratic parliamentary group. There will be deputies elected from the League, those of Forza Italia, and also those of the CCD [Democratic Christian Center] and the UDS [Union of Democratic Socialists]. [LA REPUBBLICA] But Fini and Berlusconi will be standing together in central and southern Italy. [Maroni] The National Alliance deputies will form a group on their own, while those of Forza Italia will join our parliamentary group. Berlusconi has a agreement covering policy and government with us, and with Fini only an electoral understanding. [LA REPUBBLICA] Do Berlusconi and, above all, Fini see it this way? [Maroni) Fini himself has said so, stressing that it is not an alliance on policy with Forza Italia. So everything is clear. We want to govern. [LA REPUBBLICA] With whose votes? [Maroni] In the 360 constituencies of the north we will win a minimum of 250 seats and a maximum of 300. [LA REPUBBLICA] How will you share candidates with Berlusconi? [Maroni] On the basis of specific responsibilities with regard to work in parliament. To be specific, there are 360 constituencies and 13 parliamentary committees; dividing one by the other, we will identify 27 individuals appropriate to each committee. What will happen in the case of the Justice Committee, for instance? Well, we will choose as our candidates 27 lawyers or attorneys.
