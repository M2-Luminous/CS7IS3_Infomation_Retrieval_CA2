Every day, the sewage discharged, without purification, from the fleet's boats into the Sevastopol Bay alone amounts to 1,000 cubic meters. The Black Sea Fleet fuel storage (Military Unit 62709) is the main polluter of the Sevastopol Bay with petroleum products. Subsurface water, soil, and the sea bottom have been polluted. Today, the Sevastopol Bay is practically dead. It must be cleared of metal scrap: About 30 ships, as well as munitions, spare parts, and so on lie on the bottom. One-third of all the land occupied by the Black Sea Fleet bases needs to be recultivated. There are four million cubic meters of contaminated subsurface waters. According to tentative expert estimates by specialists of the Ministry of Environmental Protection, the cost of the elimination of the harm inflicted on the environment as a result of the activity of the Black Sea Fleet units and facilities in the Sevastopol Bay constitutes $3.432 million, and the total cost for all places where the Black Sea Fleet is stationed on the territory of Ukraine is $17.160 million. Yet another round of negotiations on the division of the Black Sea Fleet has ended without any results. The Russian side continues to insist on getting the shore structure of the Black Sea Fleet. The cost of the entire fleet is estimated at between $5 billion and $6 billion, whereas the ecological aspect of the problem is not even put on the agenda. Well, who must pay whom?
