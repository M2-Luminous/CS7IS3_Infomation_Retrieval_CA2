Fidel pointed out the need to implement measures on the topics discussed and called the report presented at the meeting by CTC Secretary General Pedro Ross Leal very useful and extensive. If we do not achieve economic efficiency, there can be no cleanup of the nation's finances; and if there is no streamlining of the finances, we will not achieve economic efficiency, Fidel said, linking these two basic ideas as two parts of a single whole. Castro pointed out that the first decision, to take the subject of the economy extensively into the bosom of the National Assembly of the People's Government [ANPP], was a positive one. Castro pointed out that the second important step was to hold these meetings in the workplaces, so that we would all have a precise awareness of what is being examined. Fidel said this was a courageous decision on the part of the Cuban Revolution, because the country is currently in very difficult circumstances; he noted that in other countries this kind of thing is sometimes not discussed even in the legislatures, among a nation's deputies. Instead, such decisions are made by the government and the measures are out on the street the next day, with different results. Fidel said: The results of these discussions are very good, in our case, very positive; and this is a colossal experience which puts us in a position to make everything we do turn out much better. Fidel Castro reiterated that the plenum's report was objective and at the same time optimistic, and that the process has yielded positive results with a high degree of efficiency and awareness. The Cuban president said we have been subjected to difficult trials, tremendous tests from day one and have confronted them with dignity, courage, and patriotism. He pointed out that little by little, small advances are being made; now the task is to surmount the problems, always keeping in mind that we are not going to exit the special period overnight but rather, to the extent that we are capable of organizing everything, by working and applying measures that are correct in a difficult world. The commander in chief said: The last harvest was a difficult one. The drop in production was really brutal. Just figure what kind of situation we were in, what the situation was for all of us who had to confront all this alongside the Cuban people, amidst a harvest without fuel, without tires, without spare parts. That is why I say that, during this harvest, we must effect cane recovery -- and the recovery, too, of the grinding and the yields. That is the reason that, during this harvest, which is still going on, the workers movement should not drop its guard: not in the tobacco harvest, nor the potato harvest, nor the sugar harvest, said Fidel. Fidel pointed out that all of this is being done amidst the blockade by the United States but that a meeting like this is very stimulating, to study now the necessary measures and which the workers have discussed, measures that have been made public through all the media and of which the people are aware. Fidel reminded the group that certain measures might not be popular, but that there is an awareness of this just as there is of decriminalization of the dollar -- a measure that was taken with full knowledge of its consequences but which was necessary, even though the inequalities that have arisen hurt us, and a measure about which Fidel himself has spoken publicly on other occasions,. Fidel pointed out: In the last analysis, the economic cleanup is not the most important thing. Rather, the most important thing is the awareness that has been achieved, to date, about these problems the nation is facing. The measures will be discussed at the ANPP, and the ANPP will make the pertinent recommendations to the government, which, in the last analysis, is the body that has to apply them at the proper time. Castro pointed out the need for the deputies to have all the pertinent information, the most important aspects of what has been discussed in the Parliaments in the Workplace, because everything must be studied carefully, reflected upon carefully. There were numerous speeches made during the plenum by the members of the CTC's national committee, union leaders, and certain ministers and other government officials.
