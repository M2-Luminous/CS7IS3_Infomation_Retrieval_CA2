[Correspondent] In addition to China the trip also includes Hong Kong and Macao. This is the largest group ever to travel with the prime minister, with more than 60 businessmen -- a trip of great economic significance. Cavaco Silva returns to China seven years after the signing of the Macao Joint Declaration in Beijing. The accord has contributed to the stability of the territory, according to the Chinese ambassador to Portugal: [PRC ambassador in Mandarin with Portuguese subtitles] "The two governments have enjoyed good cooperation during the implementation of the Joint Declaration since its signing seven years ago. They have contributed to the stability and prosperity of Macao." [Correspondent] After 1999, Macao will be an integral part of China, a situation which raises many questions. Two such questions are whether the death penalty will apply in the territory and the other is the nationality of the residents. The Chinese ambassador believes that appropriate solutions will be found for these two questions. [PRC ambassador] "The Portuguese descendants who live in the territory have joined their efforts to help with Macao's economic and social development. We hope that even after 20 December 1999, they can remain in Macao in peace. It is certain that the Macao Special Administrative Region will protect their customs and cultural traditions in accordance with the Basic Law. China will apply the nationality law bearing in mind the historic reality of the territory in such a manner as to find an appropriate solution to the situation. "In relation to Macao, we believe that after the transition period the problem will be studied bearing in mind the social reality. The opinion of the residents on the death penalty will be sought and only then will the appropriate law on this matter be drawn up." [Correspondent] The Orient Foundation, created before the signing of the Joint Declaration and based in Lisbon, has been one of the problems in this period of transition. China wants the foundation headquarters to be directly accountable to it. So far no decision has been reached. [PRC ambassador] "The Orient Foundation funds come from Macao and should serve Macao. The contract, which gives part of the gambling profits to the Foundation, was signed before the Joint Declaration and will go beyond 1999. This question should be looked at by the Sino-Portuguese Liaison Group during the transition period. We are certain that through friendly negotiations we will find the appropriate solution."
