ACTION: Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 1994 for public housing development; invitation for applications. SUMMARY: This NOFA announces the availability of FY 1994 funding, and invites eligible public housing agencies (PHAs) to submit applications for public housing development. Applications are limited to: (1) Replacements for demolition/disposition subject to section 18 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (USHA); (2) Replacements for homeownership transfers under the HOPE I Program, and homeownership sales under section 5(h) of the USHA; (3) Unforeseen housing needs resulting from natural and other disasters; housing needs resulting from emergencies, as certified by the Secretary, other than such disasters; housing needs resulting from the settlement of litigation; and housing in support of desegregation efforts; and (4) ``Other'' applications. All successful applicants will be required to participate in the Family Self-Sufficiency (FSS) program, unless granted an exception. This NOFA also provides instructions regarding the preparation and processing of applications. The Department is also encouraging applicants to form ``partnerships'' consisting of cooperative arrangements with community-based entities to provide housing, and is encouraging PHAs to engage in ``mixed income'' development (wherein public housing units are integrated within market-rate developments). This is being done by providing additional points for such efforts (see sections III.E.5 and IV.E. of this NOFA). This NOFA is not applicable to the Indian housing program. DATES: Applications are due at the HUD Field Office on or before 4 p.m., local time, on July 8, 1994. See Section III of this NOFA for further information on application submission. If an application is mailed to the Field Office, the PHA must clearly write ``PUBLIC HOUSING DEVELOPMENT APPLICATION'' on the outside of the envelope and obtain a return receipt indicating the date and time of delivery. Hand delivered applications shall be date/time stamped and initialed by the employee receiving the application upon delivery. The application deadline is firm as to date and hour. In the interest of fairness to all applicants, HUD will not consider any application that is received after the deadline. PHAs should take this into account and submit applications as early as possible to avoid risk brought about by unanticipated delays or delivery-related problems. In particular, PHAs intending to mail applications must provide sufficient time to permit delivery on or before the deadline date. Acceptance by a Post Office or private mailer does not constitute delivery. Facsimile (Fax), COD, and postage due applications will not be accepted.
