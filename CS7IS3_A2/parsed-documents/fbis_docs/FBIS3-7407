Toyota Motor Corp., the industry leader, said its plan aims to increase worldwide procurement of parts and materials to 9.70 billion dollars in fiscal 1996 from 6.30 billion dollars in fiscal 1992. The company said its purchases from U.S. suppliers, including imports to Japan, will account for 6.45 billion dollars, up from 4.43 billion dollars in fiscal 1992. Mitsubishi Motors Corp. said its program for international cooperation calls for procurement and imports from U.S. suppliers at a maximum of 2.07 billion dollars in fiscal 1996. The company said it will promote localization of its global vehicle production and boost overseas production to 700,000 vehicles in fiscal 1996 from 520,000 in fiscal 1993. Its U.S. production base, Diamond-Star Motors in Normal, Illinois, will aim to boost the value of local procurement to 1.40-1.63 billion dollars in fiscal 1996 from 650 million dollars in fiscal 1993, the company said. The local content ratio of vehicles produced by Diamond-Star Motors will rise to 80 percent or more in 1996 from the current level of about 70 percent, it said. The company said its worldwide imports of auto parts will rise to 870 million dollars in fiscal 1996 from 680 million dollars in fiscal 1993. Toyota said its basic policy is to increase overseas production to raise the portion of locally assembled vehicles in total sales overseas. In line with this, the company said its production overseas will be raised by about 50 percent to 1.35 million to 1.40 million vehicles by the end of 1996 over the 1993 level of 890,000. The company said its wholly owned U.S. car plant will double its output to 400,000 vehicles from 200,000 while its production in Britain will increase from 37,000 in 1993 to 100,000 in 1994. Both Toyota and Mitsubishi said they will strengthen cooperation with local automakers and parts suppliers.
