Attilio Romita reports: [Romita] All the parties have entered the fray of the forthcoming European elections. Following March's electoral earthquake, we have a new test which will weigh heavily on the shoulders of the new political leadership. Partial local elections will be held on the same day; 9 million voters throughout Italy will have to elect a new regional council in Sardinia, 11 provincial councils, and 485 town councils. The local elections affect 92 cities with over 15,000 [as received] inhabitants, and of those cities 21 are provincial capitals. In the race for Strasbourg, all the parties are pitted against each other. Due to the system of proportional representation and the disappointments of March, the parties will run independently at the European elections -- both on the left and the right. The only alliance is that of the Italian Socialist Party and the Democratic Alliance. Silvio Berlusconi will head the Forza Italia list of candidates. [passage omitted] All the big guns will also be running in the election; Umberto Bossi, Gianfranco Fini, Achille Occhetto, Fausto Bertinotti, Mario Segni, Carlo Ripa di Meana, and Leoluca Orlando. Giorgio la Malfa is considering whether to participate. Finally, Francesco Moser, former world cycling champion, is preparing to run for the Union Valdotaine.
