The precise amount of victims from both sides has not been reported. Practically none of the political parties and movements in opposition to Dzhokhar Dudayev claimed responsibility for the clash. The Labazanov group has been acting openly on the territory of Chechnya for nearly a year and declared in the official media its claims to be regarded as a political party. The location of the leader of the group who managed to escape on Monday with several of his supporters has not been identified yet. The police admits the fact that he is now particularly dangerous as a source and instigator of terror. Russia's plenipotentiary envoy Schmidt Zablayev is expected to arrive in Chechen capital on Tuesday where he will try to re-establish dialogue between Moscow and Grozny, but few people believe his mission will be effective.
