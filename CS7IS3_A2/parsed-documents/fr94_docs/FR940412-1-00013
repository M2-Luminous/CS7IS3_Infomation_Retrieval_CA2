FR940412-1-00013 FR940412-1-00004 DEPARTMENT OF LABOR Occupational Safety and Health Administration 29 CFR Part 1915 [Docket No. S&hyph;047A] RIN 1218&hyph;AA68 Safety Standards for Scaffolds Used in Shipyard Employment AGENCY: Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Labor. ACTION: Proposed rule; limited reopening of the rulemaking record. SUMMARY: The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is reopening the record for the proposed revision of the regulation of scaffolds used in shipyard employment (part 1915, subpart N) (53 FR 48182, November 29, 1988). This reopening incorporates the entire record for scaffolds used in the construction industry (part 1926, subpart L) (Docket S&hyph;205, 51 FR 42680, November 25, 1986; Docket S&hyph;205A, 58 FR 16509, March 29, 1993; Docket S&hyph;205B, 59 FR 4615, February 1, 1994) including the scaffold-related materials from the record for the proposed general industry standard for walking and working surfaces (part 1910, subpart D) (Docket S&hyph;041, 55 FR 13360, April 10, 1990) that were previously incorporated into the subpart L record in Docket S&hyph;205B. Through this notice, the Agency also requests input on the scope and application of subpart N; the appropriateness of replacing the term ``capable person'' with the term ``qualified person'' throughout subpart N; the maximum permissible distance between the front edge of a platform and the face of a vessel or structure; the requirements for a scaffold that the Agency considers to be an interior hung scaffold; the frequency of scaffold inspections; the qualifications for persons performing scaffold inspections; and the requirements for the performance of electric welding operations from suspension scaffolds. In addition, this notice corrects a typographic error in proposed paragraph ยง1915.252(b)(18)(iv) and invites public comment on that paragraph as corrected. The information received as a result of this action will be used by the Agency in developing its final rule for scaffolds used in shipyard employment. DATES: Written comments on the materials incorporated through the notice of reopening must be postmarked by June 13, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments are to be sent to the Docket Office, Docket No. S&hyph;047A, U.S. Department of Labor, room N&hyph;2625, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20210. Written comments limited to 10 pages or less in length also may be transmitted by facsimile to (202) 219&hyph;5046, provided that the original and three copies are sent to the Docket Office thereafter. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. James F. Foster, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, room N&hyph;3647, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20210. Telephone (202) 219&hyph;8148. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background A. Scope and Application Proposed ยง1915.251(a)(1) reads as follows: (a) Scope and application. (1) This subpart applies to all scaffolds used in shipyard workplaces and operations (including shipbuilding, ship repairing, and shipbreaking), but does not apply to construction operations in shipyards covered under 29 CFR part 1926. OSHA received only two comments (Exs. 6&hyph;1 and 6&hyph;3) on this paragraph. Both of those commenters stated that the inclusion of the construction standards in the application of the shipyard standards is inappropriate and would be counterproductive to efforts to bring uniformity to shipyard employment through a vertical standard. They suggested that this paragraph be changed in order to apply part 1926 only to work being performed in a shipyard by outside non-shipyard employees. It should be noted that construction work in shipyards is performed by both shipyard employees and non-shipyard employees. Shipyard employees fabricate and construct smoke stacks, tunnel sections, railroad cars, and bridge sections when shipbuilding, ship repairing, and shipbreaking work are either unavailable or in short supply. This work involves the use of scaffolds in shipyards. OSHA is considering whether all scaffold-related work performed at shipyards, regardless of who performs the work, should be covered by standards in part 1915, subpart N. If the Agency adopts that approach, subpart N will apply whenever employees perform work involving scaffolds, including construction operations in shipyards. The Agency notes that several types of scaffolds specifically addressed in the proposed construction scaffold standards were not addressed in the proposed shipyard scaffold standards. If the Agency were to adopt a comprehensive approach to scaffold use in shipyards, it would incorporate the various construction scaffold standards into part 1915, except that the shipyard scaffold standard's threshold height for the provision and use of fall protection (5 feet (1.52 m)) would apply. Placing those standards in part 1915 would make the proposed reference to part 1926 unnecessary. In addition, the Agency is considering if the use of the term ``shipyard workplaces and operations'' in proposed ยง1915.251(a)(1) inappropriately limits the scope and application of proposed subpart N. Accordingly, OSHA is contemplating replacement of the proposed term with the term ``shipyard employment'', so that the activities covered by subpart N would be described accurately. OSHA is also considering whether the proposed exclusion of construction operations from the scope of subpart N should be limited to outside contractors using non-shipyard employees. Under such an approach, the scaffold operations of outside (non-shipyard) construction employers would still be subject to part 1926, subpart L. In addition, OSHA would require that scaffolds addressed by part 1926, but not by part 1915, comply with part 1926, regardless of who the affected employers and employees were. Accordingly, the Agency seeks comment on all or part of the following alternative language for proposed ยง1915.251(a)(1):
