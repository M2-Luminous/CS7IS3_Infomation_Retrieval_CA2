In a faxed message sent to Finance Minister Arlindo Carvalho and Central Bank Governor Adelino Castelo David, the World Bank said the country runs the risk of having the payment of new loans suspended because it has not met the bank's conditions. A copy of this message was also sent to AFP. The suspension of World Bank loans could have repercussions on the progress of the structural adjustment program agreed upon by Sao Tome and the IMF. The World Bank is accusing the Sao Tome Government of not achieving any "tangible results" in the implementation of its recommendations. These recommendations basically include the privatization of state enterprises, the restructuring of the financial system, and a reduction in the civil service work force. The government has been asked to cut down its civil service work force by half by January 1995. This means laying off nearly 2,000 workers. An emergency cabinet meeting was convened following the World Bank warning.
