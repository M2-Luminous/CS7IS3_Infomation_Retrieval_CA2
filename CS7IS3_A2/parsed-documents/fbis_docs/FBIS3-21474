This question is the keynote of a debate that has been going on in Moroccan economic circles since the successful conclusion of GATT's current Uruguay Round resulted in the agreement that will be officially signed in Marrakech, inaugurating an unprecedented new stage of international trade relations. Amid the ongoing debate, many warnings have emerged about negative effects on Morocco's exports and economy from implementation of the agreement, which aims at reducing trade barriers; but the official Moroccan agency responsible for applying the terms of the agreement holds a different view: that the Moroccan economy is ready for GATT. Morocco joined the GATT agreement on 17 June 1987, several years after it began to implement an economic liberalization policy in 1983 and apply a structural reform program in coordination with the World Bank and the IMF. The program involved gradual reduction of customs duties, which are no longer high, as they were before 1983. Another effect has been to cancel Schedule C, one of the schedules that listed imported goods deemed to compete with Moroccan-produced goods. Until Schedule C was cancelled in 1983 and Schedule A expanded to represent 78 percent of imported materials, authorities used to require that an import license be obtained. They now demand an import license only for 13 percent of imports, it being understood that the license will ultimately be repealed, so that the Moroccan market will become open to free importation. This change has been accompanied by a gradual reduction in customs fees. In 1987, these fees were of three kinds: customs duties, a special fee on importation, and customs revenue stamps. In January 1988, the 5-percent special fee and the 10-percent revenue stamp were combined and replaced with a single fee of 12.5 percent, with a few exceptions stipulated in the latest budget (1994). The law imposed rates of 12.5 percent on pharmaceutical goods, 10 percent on goods for finishing, and 15 percent on other goods. The latest budget has set customs duties at 35 percent, except for some agricultural products to which rates from 40 to 45 percent apply. Government circles consider the reduction to this level--rates were as high as 400 percent before the reform program was implemented--a major sign of the economic liberalization policy and of Morocco's gradual preparation to enter the stage of implementing the GATT agreement. To demonstrate that the current changes are no sudden event for Morocco, these circles note that 90 percent of Morocco's foreign trade takes place with member nations of the GATT. They say that, despite allegations in the economic press that GATT will not safeguard Morocco's economic fabric and that it will impact Moroccan exports negatively and flood the local market with imports, the Moroccan authorities have gone through 10 years of reform and economic adaptation. The economy has been liberalized on the ground that it has achieved a certain level of development, performance, and competition. When the time came to approve GATT, Morocco was not required to come down from 400 percent customs protection to 45 percent; the requirements will be much less. Industry thus will be able to compete. Since the announcement of a successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round and of a date for the signing of the agreement in Marrakech, business, media, and semiofficial circles have been debating the extent to which Morocco will benefit from implementing the GATT agreement and the extent to which its terms will affect the local economy. The positions that have emerged in this debate have proved to be personal impressions not based on a practical foundation or on familiarity with the terms of the agreement or the extent of the Moroccan economy's compliance with these terms. These positions have made it clear that their authors have not been keeping up with the gradual process of customs reductions and with economic policy goals. In the face of this situation, the agency addressed regarding GATT has come to be the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Foreign Investments, whereas once there were many addressed. This ministry has come to be entrusted with the GATT portfolio and responsibility for giving answers about it to the media and other bodies. Here is its view of the issue that AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT raised. It is followed by the view expressed at a Casablanca meeting on 10 February by exporters' and agriculturalists' associations. AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT asked Driss Taraki, director of the ministry's Rabat bureau, what effect implementing the GATT agreement would have on Morocco's domestic economy. Driss Taraki said that over 90 percent of Morocco's foreign trade is with GATT members. He added that because Morocco has joined the agreement, its foreign trade and customs tariff would become subject to the multilateral agreement's principles and requirements, especially respect for the most favored nation principle, national treatment, and not resorting to nontariff measures to protect national production, such protection being effected basically through customs duties. Regarding possible stages of a phased application of the agreement, what sectors would be affected in the first phase, and an assessment of these effects, Driss Taraki said that the answer involved one of the most important focuses of the multilateral trade negotiations that took place in the Uruguay Round--market entry. Three sectors were included: industrial goods, agricultural goods, and textiles. Preferential Treatment Tarraki said that the principle of phased application applies basically to the agricultural and textile sectors. He explained that with regard to the farming sector, the Uruguay Round's second convention stipulated a 36-percent reduction of total customs tariffs implemented over six years. However, at the level of domestic support for this sector, the scheduled reduction would be 20 percent, spread over six years. Subsidies earmarked for supporting exports would be reduced by 36 percent, and the quantities supported would be reduced by 21 percent, also over a period of six years. Tarraki stated that Morocco, as a developing country, would receive three sorts of preferential treatment: First, it would be possible to maintain high tariffs on imports. Second, the pledged reduction could be implemented over a period of 10 years, instead of the six years for industrialized countries. The reduction would be one-third lower than the obligations of an industrialized country. Third, Morocco did not pledge to lower support to the agricultural sector, as this support involved less than 10 percent of agricultural production. Agricultural Products Advantage Taraki explained Morocco's competitive strength in the area of agricultural exports on the basis of high production costs among Morocco's competitors. This high level is due to the lowering of support and subsidies to agriculture and farmers by two-thirds more than Morocco's. This difference between Morocco and the industrialized countries means that additional protection is afforded the Moroccan agricultural sector, increasing the competitive strength of its agricultural exports. As for the textile trade, it will be incorporated into the agreement in a three-stage process over a period of 10 years. At each stage a certain percentage of textile imports will be set, with a gradual raising of the quotas that the industrialized countries apply. Regarding industrial goods, Driss Taraki stated that Morocco has offered to stabilize customs duties on manufactured products at a level guaranteeing reasonable and sufficient protection for its national production. In return, Morocco will benefit from customs reductions and the removal of noncustoms restrictions resulting from the Uruguay Round of negotiations. This will broaden and diversify the markets for Moroccan exports. About policies and adaptation measures needed to enable the local economy to withstand the results of GATT and the resultant gradual liberalization of the local market, Taraki said: "Applying the results of GATT requires that one take adaptive measures to ensure good exploitation of available resources in this framework and to prepare the various sectors to face international competition." He said that Morocco basically is focusing adaptative measures on strengthening the competitiveness of production. The government is carefully studying a large number of measures in this direction, particularly ones related to improving the environment of companies and exporters and mechanisms to stimulate exports, diversify competition, lower production costs, and simplify executive procedures. On the question of whether the GATT rules will affect trends of foreign trade among the region's markets and stimulate these regional markets, Taraki said: "The question can be seen in the context of recent legal discussions about preferential agreements and GATT's position on such systems, which could be considered an exception to the most favored nation principle." GATT, he said, does not invalidate such preferential agreements, provided that their provisions conform to those of GATT, despite some people's belief that GATT would rule out regional cooperation. Such agreements, he explained, would have to implement the terms that GATT gradually introduces into every preferential agreement, so that they could continue to be applied in conformity with GATT rules. Six Arab States He said that thus far only six Arab states have joined GATT: Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia, Kuwait, Mauritania, and Bahrain. Saudi Arabia and Jordan have recently applied to join the agreement. This does not mean there are no bilateral trade agreements linking the Arab states among themselves--either bilateral agreements or agreements in which Arab states are party to an agreement to facilitate and develop trade exchanges concluded under the Arab League. Taraki stated that this preferential context has acquired an incentive coloration allowing for branches of foreign banks and the principles of openness and publication of budgets and other things. Summarizing the Moroccan position, Taraki said that the final treaty of the Uruguay Round embraced the principle of openness and gradual liberalization of this sector. Morocco, he said, has instituted reforms of the banking sector. It has issued a new banking law aimed at flexibility and openness. The law protects depositors, imposes monitoring of reserves and assets, and mandates simplified procedures to license foreign banks to operate in Morocco. The principle of gradually liberalizing the Moroccan economy over a period of 10 years has put Morocco in step with the GATT rules. Fears As part of the ongoing debate over the effect of implementing the agreement on the local economy, we shall summarize the demands and concerns voiced at a meeting held in Casablanca on 10 February by a group of associations representing Moroccan exporters of agricultural products. They expressed fears that a united Europe has designed a series of measures regulating its relations among its member nations on the one hand and with other nations on the other hand. They said that Europe is now working to bring its laws into conformity with the requirements of liberalized international trade under the Uruguay agreement. They thought that these measures would affect Moroccan exports to Europe negatively. They said that about 220 firms would shut their doors and about 5,000 workers be threatened with unemployment. They stated that the GATT agreement, of which Morocco is a member, does not guarantee the preservation of Morocco's economic fabric. An effort has to be made to shape terms to strengthen this fabric, so that it can sustain the challenge and in turn develop the national economy. The participants issued a communique, saying that they support government policy in the area of concluding a new agreement between Morocco and Europe in light of suggestions by the European Union in the context of the GATT agreement. At the same time, they demanded that the authorities spare no effort to defend agricultural exports and protect the gains realized in this field in the traditional markets of the European Union. They demanded that the coming bilateral agreement between Morocco and Europe protect the position of Moroccan products in their traditional European markets. The agreement should help improve conditions for the entry of Moroccan agricultural products, which have been suffering for some time from nontariff barriers that they believe are unjustified--such as the reference price and the compensatory duty. From the official position expressed by Driss Taraki and the position of these associations, it does not appear that the Moroccan Government will agree to GATT's not guaranteeing Morocco the preservation of its economic fabric. The government does not see GATT, as some see it, as a storm that will conquer everything in its path. Instead, it sees GATT as an agreement whose terms will be implemented gradually over 10 years, instead of six years for the industrialized countries. It sees GATT as protecting its agricultural products when support is lifted from agricultural products and farmers in the industrialized countries by two-thirds more than in Morocco.
