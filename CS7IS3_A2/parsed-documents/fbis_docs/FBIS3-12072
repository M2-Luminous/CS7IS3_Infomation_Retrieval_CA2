And it approved by 50 votes from the largest political forces of the country -- including PAN [National Action Party] Senator Hector Teran Teran, who did not attend the session in order to be part of the honor guard of politicians at Colosio's funeral -- reforms to Article 41 of the Constitution of the United Mexican States. Upon expanding the autonomy of the electoral mechanisms of the country, this reform makes electoral mechanisms citizen-oriented. The reforms to Paragraphs 8, 9, 17, and 18 of the aforementioned article were approved with the participation of 49 [number as published] senators -- all dressed completely black except Nuevo Leon Senator Maria Elena Chiapas, who wore a black and white silk dress. Henceforth, Article 41 shall read as follows: "The organization of federal elections is a state function that is carried out by an autonomous public agency, furnished with legal status and its own resources. It is formed by the Executive and Legislative Branches of the union, with the participation of national political parties and citizens, as established by the law. In exercising such state functions, certitude, legality, independence, impartiality, and objectivity will be guiding principles." Additionally, "the public agency will handle electoral matters, will be professional in its performance, and will make its decisions independently; its structure will consist of direction, executive, technical, and surveillance mechanisms. The higher direction body will be made up of counselors and citizen counselors appointed by the Legislative and Executive Branches, as well as representatives appointed by the political parties. The executive and technical mechanisms will have qualified personnel necessary to provide professional electoral service. The surveillance mechanisms will consist mostly of representatives of the national political parties. The direction board of polling stations will be formed by citizens." Independent Judges and Magistrates The reforms consider that "the Federal Electoral Tribunal will organize itself under the terms established by law. For carrying out its duties, it will have bodies of magistrates and judges, who will be independent and will only respond to the mandate of the law. The magistrates of the tribunal must satisfy the requirements established by law, which will be no less than those established by this Constitution to be a justice of the Supreme Court. They will be elected by two-thirds vote of the members of the Chamber of Deputies present, after being nominated by the president of the Republic. "The citizens counselors of the higher direction organ must satisfy the requirements established by law and will be elected by receiving two-thirds of the vote of the members of the Chamber of Deputies present. The counselors will be elected from the lists of nominees proposed by legislative groups in the very Chamber. The law will establish the corresponding regulation and procedure." The reforms, which presidential candidate Cuahutemoc Cardenas Solorzano termed insufficient, brought about differences between him and Porfirio Munoz Ledo, president of the PRD [Party of the Democratic Revolution], it was learned last 18 March at a crowded PRD rally in the Central Plaza. Commenting on those differences, Munoz Ledo said yesterday "some feel the direct representation of the public powers should be entirely out of the electoral organism." He added "that is where the country is likely to head, but for now the parties agreed to let the Executive Branch official in charge of the country's internal affairs remain the chairman of that organism although "now without casting the tie-breaking votes, and proposal to formalize a tradition that has been in practice until now, namely, to use his right to vote in the deliberations of this corps." "Majority and minority representatives from the two congressional chambers, where the parties can state their views through their representatives," also remain. "I must emphasize this because a very important step has been taken, meaning the political parties will no longer have the right to vote, only to state their views, in the organization. Thus, they will no longer be judge and jury in their own favor." Munoz Ledo added: "In our opinion, we abide by the principle we adopted by consensus. Unfortunately, this could not be done in the 1989 legislative period. According to the principle, no formal or informal party or government-party coalition will have a predetermined majority in the electoral organization." He said: "Six highly respected and honorable citizens will be confirmed by two-thirds majority in the Chamber of Deputies. These citizens will be elected by consensus among the parties and they will be a result of the two chambers' actual configuration." Munoz Ledo said he is "certain the reform, which firmly points toward the citizens' participation in electoral organizations, will allow the operation of subordinate agencies; abolish bureaucracy and unfair attitudes; and, if its implementation is correct, help increase the citizens' confidence in the elections." Carlos Jimenez Macias, directorate board chairman for this period of sessions, said that -- with these reforms -- "our legislation acquires a modern dimension which places it among the most advanced in the world, and among the ones which offer a higher degree of certainty." He said: "Within this important debate, legislators protected ideological pluralism -- which is characteristic of a democracy -- and the lofty dignity which corresponds to their investiture." The ceremony ended once the reform was approved, thus ending the second special period of congress sessions.
