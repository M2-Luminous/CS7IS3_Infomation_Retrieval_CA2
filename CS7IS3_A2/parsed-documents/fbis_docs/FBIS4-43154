Such talk may be exaggerated, premature, or perhaps even totally out of place, and some people may find comfort in the thought that it refers to a distant region in northeastern Asia, the Korean Peninsula. But once before, at the beginning of the Cold War, a Korean war shook the world. This time, too, we should let ourselves be deceived: The conflict simmering there now is explosive enough to rouse us from our self-contemplation. The talk about war has been caused by North Korea's refusal -- even though it is a signatory of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty -- to allow the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to fully inspect all its nuclear facilities. Since the spring of 1993, the regime in Pyongyang has fooled the inspectors. It is true that, following tough negotiations, they were occasionally admitted into the country, but they were never permitted to carry out the decisive inspection, namely, examine how much plutonium had been secretly extracted and put aside. In these weeks, the North Koreans are hurriedly exchanging the fuel rods in their nuclear reactor at Yongbyon, obviously in an intention to definitely thwart such examination. Since then, the world has increasingly been calling for economic sanctions. The North Korean "Committee for the Peaceful Unification of the Fatherland," a mouthpiece of the regime, has threatened that "sanctions mean war, and war is merciless." Optimists are trying to persuade people that this is just bluff, and North Korea does not want war or the bomb. They say that the regime of the country, which is isolated, economically ruined, and overshadowed by uncertainty about the successor to the old Stalinist ruler, Kim Il-song, is only seeking international recognition and support to stand its ground against the successful south and avoid the fate of the GDR. Granted, no one can say with certainty today whether the country already has some atom bombs, whether it intends to build them or can build them. However, the optimistic assessments meanwhile increasingly resemble broken straws, because there is no doubt that, despite all its efforts to hush up this fact, North Korea has long pursued a nuclear arms program. Following its recent move to sabotage inspection, it now even has an opportunity to secretly extract sufficient fissionable material for half a dozen nuclear weapons; more efficient reactors are already under construction. If the North considered the bomb only a barter object to win the largest possible international support, there would probably have been enough opportunities in recent months for such a barter deal. The United States, Japan, and South Korea all said they would be willing to make concessions if the IAEA inspectors could do their job unhindered. That is why North Korea's behavior suggests a much gloomier assumption. The country wants the bomb, it has only used the negotiations to cover up its intention to continue and step up its efforts. This concretely shows a dual danger. First, other countries in the region -- Japan, Taiwan, South Korea -- could follow the North Korean example, and the region could be driven into a nuclear arms race. Second, elsewhere, would-be nuclear powers could feel encouraged. The Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty would be nothing but a scrap of paper. Therefore, what is happening in Korea is not an Asian crisis; it is an international crisis. What should be done to cope with it? Economic sanctions are not an appropriate instrument; they are rather an expression of embarrassment. Even if China and Russia in the UN Security Council agreed to an embargo resolution, and even if subsequently China and Japan, the key states, energetically carried out the embargo -- both cases are more than uncertain -- this could not force North Korea to stop its nuclear arms production. Military sanctions, which U.S. Defense Secretary Perry does not rule out, could destroy North Korea's visible nuclear facilities, but they could not destroy the bomb, if it exists at all, because it can be easily hidden. Then there would only be the certainty of war. Instead of threatening sanctions and rattling the saber, the world should therefore remember that confrontation has never made a country give up its nuclear arms plans -- on the contrary. The fact that the number of nuclear arms states is today much smaller than had been predicted by experts several years ago is not attributable to the displeasure of other countries, but to the realization of possible nuclear candidates that the development of their own bombs is unnecessary or even harmful for their security -- Argentina and Brazil, which discontinued their bomb research; South Africa, which scrapped its half a dozen operational warheads when the apartheid regime collapsed; the nuclear successor states of the Soviet Union, which agreed that only Russia should have nuclear weapons. The attempt to make North Korea give up its nuclear program in exchange for special material benefits has failed. The attempt to exert pressure on the regime by imposing sanctions will also fail. As long as Kim Il-song's regime considers its own bomb more important than the whole Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, the international community will confront the nuclear shark like a paper tiger in its attempt to push through the contractual obligations. Antiproliferation policy should rather concentrate on the following three aspects: - Good old deterrence: It must be made clear to North Korea that the bomb will not give it any military edge over the South. This requires more support for the defense of South Korea; - Damage limitation: Pyongyang must be prevented from exporting nuclear material and nuclear carrier weapons. This requires a blockade of North Korean exports, possibly already in the near future; - The readiness of the other countries in the region to discuss, and thereby possibly reduce, Pyongyang's security policy concerns. That is why the Russian proposal to call an international conference with the participation of North Korea deserves to be approved. An appeasement program? Not at all. A guarantee of success? By no means. However, it is the consequence of the realistic realization that nuclear armament can at best be controlled indirectly, and that this is the only way to de-escalate a conflict, which may lead to war.
