Han, who arrived here on Wednesday, held talks with his Russian counterpart Andrey Kozyrev, Ivan Rybkin, speaker of the lower house of parliament, and Vladimir Shumeyko, head of the upper house. According to the ITAR-TASS news agency, the two sides "have similar views on international issues and are ready to expand bilateral cooperation and interaction on the international scene, primarily in northeastern Asia." It said Moscow and Seoul are "rather close" in their stands on nuclear non-proliferation on the Korean peninsula. After his talks with han on Thursday, Kozyrev told reporters that Russia "cannot allow violation of the nuclear non-proliferation regime in any area and by any state." Kozyrev also stressed that Russia is opposed to pressuring the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) by force on the nuclear issue. South Korea supports Russia's proposal to convene an international conference on the security and non-nuclear status of the Korean peninsula. But Seoul emphasized that preferably the Korean nuclear issue should be resolved at the UN Security Council. Russia said the proposed international conference should be held on a six-plus-two formula with participation of Russia, the United States, China, Japan, the DPRK, South Korea, the United Nations and the International Atomic Energy Agency. Another topic in Han Sung-chu's Moscow talks was preparations for the forthcoming visit of South Korean President Kim Yong-sam to Russia in June. At the Russian-South Korean summit meeting, the two sides are expected to sign a package of documents on cooperation in the economic and political spheres. It will be Kim Yong-sam's first visit to Moscow. Russian President Boris Yeltsin visited Seoul in November 1992. Leaving Moscow for home on Friday, Han expressed satisfaction with his three-day Moscow trip. For its part, the Russian side described his visit as successful, noting that relations between Moscow and Seoul are "on the rise."
