All the cattle herds in the region will now be inoculated, and restrictions will be imposed on moving herds. The northern settlements are called upon not to allow entry of unsupervised farming vehicles. Our correspondent Shulamit Schmerling reports that the disease broke out in Judaea and Samaria, and spread from there to Arab settlements in the north. Dozens of cattle have died so far.
