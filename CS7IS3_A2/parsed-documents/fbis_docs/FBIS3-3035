He also participated in discussions held by the Qinghai and Liaoning delegations. Jiang Zemin emphasized: Now that the guiding principles and major policies have been decided, the key to achieving success is to get down to work in a concerted way. Nationwide, we should always pay priority attention to two major issues. One is the rural economy; and the other is large and medium-sized state enterprises. When agriculture is truly enhanced as the foundation of the national economy, when state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises are truly invigorated, when the worker-peasant alliance under the new situation is truly enhanced, and when, as a result, work in all other areas is advanced and the unity of all nationalities is consolidated, China's reform, development, and stability will be reliably guaranteed. At the Fujian Hall of the Great Hall of the People, Jiang Zemin told the Fujian deputies: Fujian and Taiwan -- China's precious island -- face each other across the Strait. Fujian's development has a special meaning and impact. It is necessary to deepen reform, opening up wider, improve the investment environment, attract investment by Taiwan compatriots and overseas Chinese, promote Cross-Strait economic cooperation and trade, and develop Cross- Strait exchanges so as to make still greater contributions to the peaceful reunification of the motherland. "Zha xi de le!" [preceding words in Tibetan] As Jiang Zemin arrived at the Qinghai Hall, the deputies, who were warmly discussing the government work report, happily greeted him in a style unique to Tibetans. Applause and laughter interweaved as they presented the general secretary a hada [a piece of silk used as a greeting gift among Tibetans] and a cup of liquor made of highland barley. After hearing the speeches by Wang Hanmin, Qinghai executive vice governor, and Dajie, Golog Tibetan Autonomous Prefectural Government head, Jiang Zemin said: Qinghai is a province where people of minority nationalities live in compact communities. In the socialist big family, we should promote the inter-ethnic relations of harmony, equality, mutual assistance, unity and cooperation, and steer a course toward common prosperity. This represents an essential guarantee for the success of our causes and it also represents the common wishes of people of all nationalities. Jiang Zemin expressed the hope that people of all nationalities in Qinghai will further enhance ethnic unity, fully and correctly implement the policy concerning religion, maintain social stability, and bring about smooth progress in reform and opening up amid stability. He emphasized that economic development of ethnic regions must be firmly based on local conditions and full utilization of local advantages. The key is to develop resources. They should boldly introduce foreign investment and undertake joint development. Meanwhile, the state must also do its best to help them. Other regions -- the developed coastal regions in particular -- should actively help them so that all ethnic groups and all regions will develop side by side toward common prosperity. In the Liaoning Hall, Jiang Zemin discussed ways to deepen reform and quickly invigorate state-owned enterprises with delegates from Liaoning, a province with a concentration of state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises. After hearing a speech by Liaoning Governor Yue Qifeng on strengthening agriculture and invigorating state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises, Jiang Zemin said happily: Liaoning is a major industrial province. After years of hard work, it is now self sufficient in meat, eggs, poultry, and vegetables. This is inspiring news. It represents a historic change for Liaoning Province. He continued: Liaoning has many large and medium-sized enterprises. If these enterprises are invigorated in an all-round way, it will have a big impact on the rejuvenation of Liaoning and the country as a whole. You have upheld a policy of "emphasizing less on new projects and more on technical innovations." You have devoted major efforts to invigorate such enterprises mainly by way of technology upgrading. This policy is absolutely correct. It is very good news. It is hoped that Liaoning will create more good experience in invigorating state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises. To accelerate the establishment of a socialist market economic system and to improve macroeconomic regulation, control, and management, Jiang Zemin once again called on the leading cadres to study harder. He pointed out: Many party and government officials used to work in the fields of natural sciences and engineering. Today, however, they are taking the reins of economic development at central and local levels. They need to make up their missed lessons. They should learn more about basic Marxist economic theories, especially Comrade Deng Xiaoping's economic thinking, and general knowledge about the market economy. This is an urgent task. They should learn on the job and put into practice what they have learned so that they will quickly improve their leadership skills in developing China's socialist economy.
