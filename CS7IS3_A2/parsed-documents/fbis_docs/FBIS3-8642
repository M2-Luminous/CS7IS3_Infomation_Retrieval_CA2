The accord came after talks on forming a Croat-Moslem federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina resumed at the U.S. Embassy, amid signs that negotiators would probably reach an overall agreement later in the day. Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic earlier said: "We shall try to finish up this morning," while Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic said he was "still optimistic." Croat sources said late Saturday [12 March] only "a few technical problems" remained and a global accord would probably be announced Sunday. The behind-closed-doors talks began here on March 4 after Granic and Silajdzic signed an initial agreement on March 1 in Washington.
