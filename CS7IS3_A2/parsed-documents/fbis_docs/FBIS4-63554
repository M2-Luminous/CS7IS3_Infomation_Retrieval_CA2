When I read it, I recalled the old days -- we call it the time of the command system. Currently, we say we have nothing to do with it. Anyway, this document is strange.... [Bulakhov] I am angry that everything is being done in a hurry. Such an important issue -- issuing big loans to the government -- demands more than a five minute or even a full day discussion. A draft resolution was submitted to the members of the Supreme Soviet Presidium five minutes before the beginning of the discussion. Furthermore, this draft resolution gave neither the reasons, the arguments, or assessments of the consequences of this proposal. [Samoylov] Even the budget of a family undergoes a longer and more precise discussion! [Bulakhov] There should have been a financial-economic grounding, consultations should have been held in various legislative commissions, and so on. They did nothing of the kind. This is a gross violation of a range of legislative acts. [Samoylov] What legislative acts do you mean? [Bulakhov] I am speaking about the laws "On the National Bank," "On Banks and Banking System," and "On the Budget." The most essential is that the Presidium of the Belarusian Supreme Soviet is not authorized to resolve such issues. [Samoylov] In my opinion, the precedent was established when the Supreme Soviet Presidium adopted a decision to issue trillions of rubles to the agricultural sector for conducting a spring campaign. [Bulakhov] I said then that we cannot resolve the issue by violating the Constitution. Why did we adopt the Constitution then? [Samoylov] All of us remember how deputies congratulated each other when the Constitution was adopted. Currently, they propose either introducing an addenda to the Constitution or simply ignoring it. However, these are formal violations. What can you say about this? [Bulakhov] This is no secret. We lack money to pay wages to the budget sector employees -- teachers, physicians, servicemen, etc. Where can we take the money? As it is common with us, the decision is very simple: To take the Belarusian National Bank's profits and the working capital of the commercial banks. However, nobody ever says under what conditions. [Samoylov] They will probably conduct negotiations, as they put it, privately. [Bulakhov] If the Cabinet of Ministers begins conducting negotiations and refers to the Supreme Soviet's decision, this will mean extortion at the state level. Why are they doing this? They say they proceed from economic expediency. However, there is no such economic expediency. The problem arose due to our government's "activities." [Samoylov] What do you mean? [Bulakhov] It promised to freeze prices and rents and to raise wages on the eve of the election campaign. These promises should be covered by money. However, you patch one hole but a new one appears. The result of all this is that we cannot pay workers of the budget sector. However, the tragedy is that in one or one and a half months from now, this will come back to us as increased inflation. Prices will climb more quickly, the inflation rate will become uncontrolled. Already in July we will have to pay for this resolution. [Samoylov] That is, after the presidential elections. [Bulakhov] In June, we will cautiously cover this hole. The danger is also in that we take the working capital from commercial banks that, in fact, work for the economy. Actually, we take this money from enterprises which could invest this money. This is how we could finally ruin our industry. [Samoylov] Are our laws so ineffective that it is possible to ignore them? [Bulakhov] Any law is ineffective if the power does not want to implement it. [Samoylov] What will you do? Will you leave the people without money? [Bulakhov] This is the first time (however, not the last one) that we have had a nonpayment crisis. This disease is well known in Russia where the workers of the budget sector sometimes do not receive money for three to four months. This is the result of our economic helplessness. We should formulate a strategy of a credit and money policy which, to my regret, we now lack. This should be honestly explained to the people. However, this is unrewarding. The presidential elections are just around the corner. However, after elections, everything could go to hell! Therefore, this expediency was dictated by political reasons. The government, which had bet on Kebich, wants to save up additional points before the elections. The poor people will pay this bill.
