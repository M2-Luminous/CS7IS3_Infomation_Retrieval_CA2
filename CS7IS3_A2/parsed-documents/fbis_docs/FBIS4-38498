INTERFAX learned from sources in the government that this appointment was due to the increasing role of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations in coordination of foreign economic activities of the federation's constituent members and to strengthening control over the export-import operations. Earlier, Dagayev had headed the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations Department of Export-Import Operations for State Needs and had been responsible for registration of special exporters. He will continue to perform these functions in his new post. Dagayev said in an interview with INTERFAX that state control over export activities of the regions would be more important since the president had issued the decree cancelling quotas and licensing of export deliveries.
