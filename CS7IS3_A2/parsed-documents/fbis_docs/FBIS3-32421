Radio Reloj at 2030 GMT on 1 February reported that an agreement of cooperation was signed between the Cuban Ecumenical Council and the Sugar Industry Ministry to build a biogas plant in Matanzas to reprocess residues of other industries into cooking gas. The agreement establishes that German churches will finance the project while the Cuban Government will be responsible for the construction and technological assembly of the plant, which will also eliminate an important source of environmental pollution. Radio Reloj at 2030 GMT on 1 February adds that the Agriculture Ministry phytosanitary board saved $800,000 last year by conducting a biological control program in Matanzas. The program succeeded in controlling the spread of plagues and diseases, thereby saving money spent in the past to purchase pesticides. Tele Rebelde and Cuba Vision Networks at 2320 GMT on 1 February report that 11,000 people are self-employed in Santiago de Cuba Province with positive results for the economy of that province. According to estimates by the state labor committee, approximately 2 million pesos were collected during the last quarter of last year through registration fees. Drivers, craftsmen, tailors, and handicraft vendors are the services most in demand. Special studies are being carried out in Santiago de Cuba better to control and organize the self-employment jobs. Radio Rebelde at 1000 GMT on 2 February reports that Matanzas Province's farmers planted 330 caballerias of tubers, vegetables, and grains in January, the highest figure for a similar period in the cold-season planting campaign in the past 10 years. At the end of January, Matanzas farmers had planted a little over 810 caballerias of miscellaneous food crops in the cold-season planting, which includes 162 caballerias of potatoes that are looking good. Radio Progreso at 1200 GMT on 2 February reports that the Ministry of the Sugar Industry [Minaz] has announced that, nationwide, sugar sector workers planted a total 863 caballerias of cane in January, exceeding the month's plan by 48 percent. Minaz reports that all provinces except Villa Clara, Las Tunas, and Granma met their schedule for the month. This is a good beginning for the spring planting, which takes place "from January to 30 June," by which time 18,090 caballerias of cane are to have been planted. Radio Reloj in Spanish at 2030 GMT on 2 February reports that electricity supply to the eastern region has been increased by approximately 100 megawatts with the establishment of modern Russian-made equipment at the Vicente Substation in Ciego de Avila. Several towns between Ciego de Avila and Guantanamo will receive the benefits of this equipment. Radio Progreso at 1200 GMT on 3 February reports that the Claudio Arguelles Bicycle Factory in Havana has held a Parliament in the Workplace. During the discussions, one participant noted that no one wants Cuban bicycles "because they are very bad. They have no quality whatsoever, none whatsover." Another noted that the cost of producing a bicyle in 1993 was 140.95 pesos, and that the bicycle sold for 95 pesos; therefore, these bicycles were subsidized to the tune of "some 2 million pesos." A third participant pointed out that the poor quality was not the fault of the assembly plant but lay, instead, in the poor work done by the workshops that produce the parts assembled at the Claudio Arguelles plant. Havana Tele Rebelde and Cuba Vision at 0100 GMT on 4 February report the following: Three new 15-megawatt turbogenerators were installed at the Panama agricultural complex in Vertientes Municipality in Camaguey. In 1993, the Department of Transit in Havana City reported 1,825 traffic accidents, in which 348 people died and 1,605 were injured. Comparison to 1992 figures shows a 40-percent drop in the number of accidents and 16 percent in injuries. In 1992, one person died in every nine accidents; in 1993, one person died in every five. The Comandante Pinares General Hospital in Pinar del Rio Province benefited from a donation by the German Government to the Cuban Red Cross of 12 tons of food valued at $100,000. The German company, Mercedes-Benz, also donated an intensive care ambulance valued at $50,000 to the Cuban Red Cross. Radio Progreso at 1200 GMT on 4 February reports the following, citing the 4 February edition of GRANMA: Cuba had 6.644 billion cubic meters of water in its reservoirs at the end of January 1994, 74 percent of their potential. Cuba has almost 4,000 minidairy farms. Import costs of $5 million dollars were avoided in 1993 by practicing recycling. Of the over 800 Basic Cooperative Production Units in the agriculture-livestock sector in Cuba, 238 are in miscellaneous crops and 431 in commercial cattle-raising. The rest are in activities related to coffee, rice, and forestry.
