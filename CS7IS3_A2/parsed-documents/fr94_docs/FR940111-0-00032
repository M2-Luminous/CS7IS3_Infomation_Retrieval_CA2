FR940111-0-00032 FR940111-0-00008 8 CFR Part 214 [INS 1452&hyph;92] RIN 1115&hyph;AC72 Temporary Alien Workers Seeking H&hyph;1B Classification Under the Immigration and Nationality Act AGENCY: Immigration and Naturalization Service, Justice. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This final rule implements certain provisions of the Miscellaneous and Technical Immigration and Naturalization Amendments of 1991 (MTINA) by establishing petitioning procedures for H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants and new eligibility criteria for foreign physicians seeking employment in the medical professions in the United States. This rule contains the new procedures required by the legislation and makes Service policy consistent with the intent of Congress. This rule sets forth the new filing procedures and eligibility standards and clarifies for businesses, academic institutions, and the general public the requirements for classification and admission under section 101(a)(15)(H) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (ACT). EFFECTIVE DATE: January 11, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: John W. Brown, Senior Immigration Examiner, Adjudications Division, Immigration and Naturalization Service, 425 I Street, NW., room 7215, Washington, DC 20536, telephone (202) 514&hyph;3240. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Immigration Act of 1990 (IMMACT), Public Law 101&hyph;649, November 29, 1990, dramatically altered the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant classification. IMMACT, among other things, removed prominent aliens from the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant classification and required prospective employers to obtain an approved labor condition application from the Department of Labor prior to the admission of the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant into the United States. In response to concerns raised by a number of interested parties, Congress incorporated numerous provisions in the Miscellaneous and Technical Immigration and Naturalization Amendments of 1991, Public Law 102&hyph;232, December 12, 1991, which amended some of the provisions created by IMMACT. Specifically, Public Law 102&hyph;232 amended the definition of an H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant alien by removing the requirement that the intending employer obtain an approved labor condition application prior to the alien's admission into the United States, amended the criteria which the Secretary of Labor could use in invoking the penalty provisions relating to misrepresentations and omissions on the labor condition application, and, lastly, addressed the issue of foreign physicians coming to the United States to perform services in the medical profession. On April 9, 1992, the Service published in the Federal Register at 57 FR 12177, an interim rule with requests for comments to incorporate the changes contained in Public Law 102&hyph;232. Interested persons were invited to submit written comments on or before June 8, 1992. Discussion of Comments on the Interim Regulations The Service received comments from sixteen individuals on the interim rule. Some of the commenters addressed more than one issue in their comments. A number of commenters offered suggestions and improvements for the final rule, many of which have been adopted in the final rule. The following discussion addresses the issues raised, provides the Service's position on the issues, and, indicates the revisions adopted in the final rule based on the public's comments. Labor Condition Application_ยง214.2(h)(4)(i)(B)( 1 ) Prior to the passage of Public Law 102&hyph;232, petitioners in H&hyph;1B cases were required to submit a copy of an approved labor condition application with the petition. Public Law 102&hyph;232 amended this language by requiring only that petitioners attach a certification from the Secretary of Labor indicating that the petitioner has filed a labor condition application with the Secretary of Labor. The interim rule contained language reflecting this amendment to the statute. One commenter suggested that a petitioner could meet this statutory requirement by merely submitting a copy of the labor condition application without waiting for the Department of Labor to certify the labor condition application. However, submitting a copy of the labor condition application is not sufficient to show that the application has been filed. Only when the application has been certified can the Service be assured that the petitioner has complied with the filing requirement. Therefore, the Service did not adopt this recommendation. One commenter noted that IMMACT imposed a number of penalties on employers who failed to meet certain conditions of the labor condition application process. Section 212(n)(2)(C)(ii) of the Act states that in those situations the Attorney General shall not approve petitions filed by the offending employer under section 204 or 214(c) of the Act for a period of one year. The commenter noted that ยง214.2(h)(4)(i)(B)( 5 ) of the interim regulation indicated only that the Attorney General shall not approve petitions under the H&hyph;1B category. In response to this comment the final rule will be amended to indicate that this provision applies to petitions filed under both sections 204 and 214(c) of the Act as required by statute.
