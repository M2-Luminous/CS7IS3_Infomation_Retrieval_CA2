These binary oppositions with a happy ending are one of the shortest ways of describing the state-protocol battle of wits that the media promptly communicated to the people of both states before the unofficial visit of Milan Kucan, president of Slovenia, to Croatian President Franjo Tudjman. In spite of the hesitations of the important Slovene guest, the visit did take place as planned. The Slovene side first did not understand the circumstances of the presidential invitation, and then -- with the new summer wave of tightening the interstate ropes -- whether 7 June was the most suitable time for a one-day trip to Zagreb. Namely, the short distance from the Slovene capital to the Croatian one is still inversely proportionate to the great quantity of the unresolved diplomatic luggage that the representatives of the two states take out at the joint table. This should not be surprising, since the Croatian and Slovene presidents last met some 20 months ago -- although at that time they publicly stated the willingness to meet at least once a year to develop good neighborly relations. At any rate, everything Franjo Tudjman took out of his suitcase at Brdo near Kranj in 1992 to show Milan Kucan will now be presented by Kucan to his host in Zagreb in a somewhat different wrapping: the unresolved border issues, the untouched legal infrastructure regarding the property issues, the stagnation of the economic relations.... On the other hand, the unresolved regime in the bay of Piran, the arguments with which Croatia is building a border crossing at Plovanija, which Slovenia disputes, the Slovene ownership of the company vacation homes in Pineta, in which Croatia has accommodated refugees from central Bosnia, the Ljubljanska Banka issue, and similar issues will be discussed in a less abstract manner. Without the fear of prejudicing matters, one thing that can be said before the official announcements reach the media is that the two presidents will find no concrete solutions. One of the reasons is certainly the fact that the competences of the two state leaders, according to the constitutional organization of their states, are not the same: The Croatian president, who works within a semipresidential system, has more authority than his Slovene counterpart. However, even if this were not so, Croatian-Slovene relations have been so neglected and negatively warmed-over -- which both sides are responsible for -- that what is at the moment much more important for unfreezing them is genuine relaxedness in issuing public statements, rather than a false compromise that each of the sides would soon interpret in their own way. This would mean that the basic question -- if there is a joint willingness of the two states to resolve the problems -- has been given a positive answer, which would meet with quite a positive response of the wider European circles. Good vibrations between Tudjman and Kucan would also be an indicative message to the exponents of the political tendencies that have been waiting at the western side of the Adriatic for a chance to use the disagreements between the "premature European babies" to their own advantage. All in all, the greatest responsibility that Tudjman and Kucan bear lies in creating a good atmosphere that should soon prepare and prompt a new rythm at top-level meetings: from those of Prime Ministers Drnovsek and Valentic to those at the level of expert groups, which are dozing at the moment. Everything else is a matter of interests. Whether they will be coordinated or disunited depends on good will.
