FBIS4-36388 "drnes111dd_94002" FBIS-NES-94-111 Daily Report 8 Jun 1994 Palestinian Affairs 'Ashrawi To Head Autonomy Audit Committee 'Ashrawi To Head Autonomy Audit Committee TA0806160294 Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew 1400 GMT 8 Jun 94 TA0806160294 Tel Aviv IDF Radio Hebrew BFN [Text] Dr. Hanan 'Ashrawi asserted today that Israel has been grossly violating the agreement with the PLO and curtailing the freedom of action of the Palestinian institutions in East Jerusalem. This gross violation creates facts on the ground prior to the discussions about the permanent arrangement, 'Ashrawi said. In a news conference she called today, Hanan 'Ashrawi declared that the Independent Palestinian Committee for Civil Rights headed by her will be the comptroller of the autonomy and the Palestinian state. 'Ashrawi will fill this role after she received the approval of Yasir 'Arafat and the Palestine National Council. Our correspondent Avi Lifshitz reports: [Begin recording] [Lifshitz] Following the media and parliamentary uproar in Israel over Shim'on Peres' letter on the issue of Jerusalem, it is interesting to see how things look from the other side. 'Ashrawi, a Palestinian leader in the territories and the former spokesperson of the negotiating team with Israel, believes that the measures taken by Rabin to curtail the activities of the Palestinian institutions in East Jerusalem constitute a violation of the agreement with the PLO. ['Ashrawi, in English] I think that Israel is violating the agreement by trying to deal unilaterally with postponed issues. I think these are illegal. By law, Jerusalem, East Jerusalem, is part of the occupied territories. No amount of unilateral annexation, or manipulation, or distortion of the law by Israel is going to change that fact. [Lifshitz translates the above and continues] It further came out in the news conference that 'Ashrawi will be the Myriam Ben-Porat of the Palestinian autonomy. She presented the Independent Palestinian Committee for Civil Rights which will be the comptroller of the newly-established Palestinian Authority and, according to her, also of the future Palestinian state. This, with the approval of 'Arafat and the endorsement of the PLO institutions and the Palestinian Authority. This committee will not confine its work only to the boundaries of the autonomy, she said. ['Ashrawi, in English] We are not restricted to one phase, like Gaza-Jericho, or one geographic location. We will deal with Palestinian issues throughout the Palestinian territories. [Lifshitz translates the above and continues] We will operate everywhere, including Judaea and Samaria, 'Ashrawi said. The new body has the right to investigate irregularities, access information, and monitor processes in the making. Already, it has approached senior PLO officials and managed to solve the problem of the property of absentees in Jericho. By heading the audit committee -- which, incidentally, will reside in East Jerusalem -- 'Ashrawi is probably saying that she has disqualified herself from being a member of any executive council of the autonomy.
