FBIS4-8791 "dreeu074_i_94064" FBIS-EEU-94-074 Daily Report 18 Apr 1994 BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA Mladic Says U.S., NATO Supplying Muslims Mladic Says U.S., NATO Supplying Muslims LD1704005894 LD1704005894 BFN [Editorial Report] Zagreb HTV Television in Serbo-Croatian at 2200 GMT on 16 April carries what is identified as a rebroadcast of a recorded report from the Bosnian Serb Pale Television in Serbo-Croatian on Bosnian Serb Commander General Ratko Mladic visiting the Gorazde front. The time and date of the original report is not given. Mladic is seen showing a corpse of a Bosnian government soldier and scattered uniforms. He says that "a number of Alija's soldiers have been killed in this area. They are all dressed in American uniforms. We invited them to collect their dead but they did not come. Let us go on." Mladic is shown chatting with his soldiers, and the camera shows more close-ups of U.S. uniforms. Mladic passes by a crater, and pointing to it says, "That is U.S. democracy and they want to impose it on the entire world." An unidentified correspondent says, "what you said on many occasions before was confirmed today. Traces of U.S. supplies to the Muslim army have been found in this area." Mladic answers: "That is nothing new, as you can see all of the equipment from parachutes to soldiers' boots is American or belonging to the states of the NATO alliance. This confirms that NATO has been waging war against us for two and a half years, I would say a bit more, because NATO has trained in its countries those who attacked Yugoslavia and the Serb nation." The correspondent says that according to some reports, the bodies of British Special Air Service, SAS, members who fought together with the Muslims are in this area. Mladic says, "Well, I think that we will pass down by the village of Jabuka; I can already see our soldiers there. Yesterday our soldiers observed a clash there between members of that special SAS unit [pauses], their group was probably encircled by the Muslims who wanted to take them hostage. As far as we know two of them were wounded and two were killed there." The correspondent then says that the reports about the downing of the French plane are conflicting. Mladic responds, saying, "It is a pity you were not here yesterday with your cameras to record it. I think we recorded it with our cameras. In their despair, trying to provoke an international reaction and to get NATO to protect them, the Muslims fired Stinger missiles, which were dropped to them earlier with these parachutes, targeting NATO aircraft. NATO has had more losses than it has admitted."
