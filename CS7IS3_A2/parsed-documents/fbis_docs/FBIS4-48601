Just 13 percent of the agricultural land is owned by the black majority, a figure frequently quoted as illustrative of the injustice of apartheid. The ANC's ambitious Restructuring and Development Program will stand or fall on the thorny question of land reform. In August 1993, the World Bank forecast a violent uprising by farmers if the land was not shared out. Hanekom, who has headed the ANC Land Commission for the past four years, does not agree. "The World Bank has exaggerated the possibility of a revolt. If the people in the countryside had been at the point of rebellion, we would certainly have been able to mobilize them during the struggle for liberation." Hanekom believes that South Africa is very different from Zimbabwe where, following independence in 1980, the desire for land and the failure of Robert Mugabe's government to give land to farmers was one of the central political issues. "In Zimbabwe, there was a large population of farmers and very little land. They wanted their own land more than anything else. The liberation movement therefore had the support of the farmers." Hanekom believes that the population in the South African countryside wants facilities and services more than anything else, such as water, electricity, better health care, and pensions. "The PAC [Pan African Congress] judged the situation very badly. They considered land reform to be the most important question and stated that the rest would follow. Very few people in the countryside believed that." This does not mean that the ANC is not committed to ambitious land reforms. The aim is to redistribute 30 percent of agricultural land within five years. Hanekom does not believe he is promising something he cannot deliver. Hanekom's commission has drawn up a very detailed reform program for the ANC. His expertise is one of the principal reasons why he has been given this important job, although many in the ANC feel that, due to its symbolic value, the post should have gone to an African. The ANC wants to begin by the return of land to black communities which were forcibly evicted from it under apartheid. A special court will be set up to hear land claims. Special loans are also to be introduced to make it easier for poor farmers to buy their land. The government will help black farmers to start farms on land which is at present owned by the state or white farmers. Tenancy laws will be reformed, giving tenants, who had no rights to the land they cultivated, the right to buy. Supporting measures are also to be introduced for farmers who are already cultivating their own land. "Our land reform program can only be successful if the people support it. And that means also better planning, water, electricity, housing, and hospitals. Redistributing the land is not in itself enough." The land reform could result in a major conflict with one of the country's most powerful lobbies, the white farmers and their large-scale farming. This does not discourage Hanekom. He believes that talk of farmers about to oppose the schemes are exaggerated. He believes government intervention to be unavoidable, because at least one third of white farmers are so deeply in debt that they are never going to be able to get out of the situation without the state's support. "Even if we wanted to maintain the status quo, government intervention would still be necessary. The debts are the result of difficult trading conditions and poor financial management. In the past, it was too easy for white farmers to obtain loans. You can only keep these farmers in place if you agree to subsidize them. We find it only logical for some farmers, who are very heavily in debt, to sell their farms. Some farms have already been repossessed. That provides an opportunity to establish black farmers. We must make the most of these opportunities." "Our program is not based on repossessions and evictions. These measures will only be used in cases of extreme urgency. But if this program is not successful, we will then have to look at more drastic measures." Hanekom is not afraid of encountering opposition among the bureaucrats in his ministry who were once committed to the apartheid ideology of Verwoerd. "We have inherited people who, in the past supported the previous policy. But in general the ministry is staffed by very able people, that I have already noticed. It took us time to get to know one another. But some ministry staffers are already committed to the reorganization." As if they sought to emphasize Hanekom's words, we found that following the interview, the portrait of De Klerk and the old land law had been removed from the walls. Nothing has yet been put up to replace them.
