DATES: The public workshop will be held on January 18, 1994; 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. ADDRESSES: The public workshop will be held at the Volpe National Transportation Systems Center Auditorium, 55 Broadway Kendall Square, Cambridge, MA 02142.

There is no registration fee for this workshop, but advance registration is recommended. Space is limited and all interested persons are encouraged to register early. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Recent inspections of medical gas transfillers and processors have demonstrated an alarming rate of noncompliance, resulting in the issuance of numerous warning letters, recalls, and in some cases, voluntary suspension of operations. FDA investigators have documented that many operators of these firms appear to lack the fundamental knowledge necessary to ensure full and continued compliance with the CGMP regulations. This workshop is being presented to inform persons associated with this FDA-regulated industry about the applicable CGMP and other agency requirements. Dated: December 14, 1994. William K. Hubbard, Interim Deputy Commissioner for Policy. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;31251 Filed 12&hyph;20&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4160&hyph;01&hyph;F
