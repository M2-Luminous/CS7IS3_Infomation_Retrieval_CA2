The Tory row about a possible British referendum on EU [European Union] membership is seen as evidence of a permanent split on European policy in the party. Few EU leaders believe reports that John Major has considered putting membership of the EU to a referendum at the next general election. But some have already indicated to London their determination to move further towards a federal European Union after 1996 -- even if this has to be without Britain. "The British Conservatives seem to be tearing themselves apart and I really cannot understand what is at the bottom of it," a Dutch minister observed yesterday. "The wild men seem to be running your government's political agenda." A senior European Commission member said: "The Eurosceptics have no real alternative to offer except complete withdrawal and no British government will agree to that." Few people believe that the 1996 review conference set up under the Maastricht treaty will result in a fully federalist system for what will probably by then be an EU of 16 states. But the British government will come under pressure to allow a majority of EU countries to agree on steps to "deepen" political union -- with Britain being entitled to stand aside. "The most important decision in 1996 will be how to take future constitutional decisions," one EU ambassador said. "There may be a precedent in the Maastricht treaty. The British opt-outs on a single currency and social policy could be used again. This could allow a big majority of the 16 to agree on further integration within the European Union without obliging everyone to take part." The odds are that a majority of the 16 will decide to move to a single currency by the end of the decade. Technical work has begun to permit a single currency to be introduced, maybe in 1998, and optimism is growing that 10 or 12 of the 16 EU countries will be economically strong enough by then to take part. Senior British ministers have dismissed as "utopian" any prospect of monetary union this decade. But Sir Leon Brittan, European commissioner for foreign trade, warned last week that Tory Euro- sceptics were out of touch with developments. The 1996 conference of EU governments will almost certainly agree to create a European defence union by merging the Western European Union (the association of the European member states of NATO) with the EU itself. The signs are that the British government will back this move and may even join the existing multi-national Eurocorps -- seen as the embryo of a future EU army. "The British are quite right to see the 1996 conference as of crucial importance to the future of Europe. It will not decide the final shape of a federal union but it could go further in that direction than some in London realise," a senior member of the European Commission said yesterday. The starting point for the 1996 conference and reform of decision-making in the Union will be enlargement. Everyone accepts that expansion to include Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden next year is only the start of a process which will continue into the new century and may lead to an EU of between 20 and 30 states. Rather than risk the Union being paralysed, or even imploding, under the weight of new members, most EU governments accept the need for radical political reform. The 1996 review is likely to make fundamental changes to the voting system in the Council of Ministers, giving many more votes to the larger countries (of which the British government will approve) while making it easier to decide by majority vote (which London is opposed to). Mr Major will have little difficulty in agreeing to reduce the numbers of European commissioners to 12 or 14, but he will resist the German and French call for far greater powers for the future president of the Commission to pick the commissioners on merit rather than being forced to accept those chosen by national governments. Alongside reforms in the Commission and the Council of Ministers, the German government will also press hard for the European Parliament to be given further legislative powers over justice, policing and immigration, as well as foreign, security and defence policy. Some favour a committee of national parliaments being set up as an upper chamber of the European Parliament to rule on which issues are best legislated at European or at national or regional levels. The increasingly powerful regions, particularly in Germany, Italy, Spain and Belgium, will also demand a bigger say through the Committee of the European Regions.
