FR941125-1-00003 FR941125-1-00001 All written submissions made pursuant to this notice will be made available for public inspection in the Dairy Division during regular business hours (7 CFR 1.27(b)). Statement of Consideration The Carolina order requires that during each of the months of July through November, January, and February, the total quantity of milk diverted to nonpool plants by a cooperative association not exceed 25 percent of the producer milk that such cooperative caused to be delivered to or diverted from such pool plants. The proposed action would suspend the 25 percent diversion limitation for a cooperative association for the months of January and February. It would allow a cooperative association to divert an unlimited quantity of each member producer's milk to nonpool plants if at least six days' production was delivered to a pool plant during the month. Carolina Virginia Milk Producers Association (Carolina Virginia), a cooperative association with member producers pooled on the Alabama (Order 93), Georgia (Order 7), Tennessee Valley (Order 11), and Carolina (Order 5) Federal milk marketing orders, indicates that effective August 1, 1994, it lost Class I sales with a handler regulated under Order 7. The cooperative then gained Class I sales with a handler regulated under Order 5 effective October 1, 1994, and shifted the producer milk supply formerly associated with the Order 7 handler to Order 5. This realignment resulted in additional producer milk delivered to Carolina handlers during the summer and fall months of 1994. The cooperative states that it is the balancing agent for its Class I customers under Order 5 for their weekly and seasonal milk supply. It asserts that the proposed suspension is necessary to accommodate pooling the anticipated production of its member producers during these months. Accordingly, it may be appropriate to suspend the aforesaid provisions from January 1 through February 28, 1995. List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 1005 Milk marketing orders.
