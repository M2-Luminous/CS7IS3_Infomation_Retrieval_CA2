The news conference focused on the major results of the visit and revealed the wish of both countries to put an end to the period of stagnation in bilateral relations. Likewise, the sides approached the issue of the future meeting between Ion Iliescu and Boris Yeltsin and Vacaroiu and Chenomyrdin. General Grachev invited his Romanian counterpart to visit Moscow. The military cooperation agreement between the two countries was viewed by both sides as a beginning of a period of fruitful cooperation. During the news conference Romanian Defense Minister Gheorghe Tinca mentioned that neighborliness should not be understood as a strictly geographical term, as it is also a political concept. He also said that we consider Greece and Turkey to be our neighbors because good-neighborliness is a much deeper concept that reflects a system of relations based on certain principles that cannot have substance and vitality if they are not regarded in a broader context.
