Praise be to God, who said in the Holy Koran: And hold fast, all together, by the rope which God stretches out for you, and be not divided among yourselves. Blessings and prayers of God on His Prophet Muhammad, his household, and companions. The House of Representatives, the legitimate representative of all people of the united Yemen and the voice of their will, [words indistinct] the national responsibility it shoulders, and out of its understanding of the threats (?facing the country) these days has broken off its holiday [words indistinct] on 17 Dhi al-Hijjah 1414 hegira, corresponding to 28 May 1994 to discuss the (?criminal) act committed by 'Ali Salim al-Bid and his secessionist gang against the country's unity, sovereignty, and stability by declaring secession on 21 May 1994. In view of the seriousness of this act, which is considered high treason and a violation of the Constitution and an infringement on the Republic of Yemen's sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity, the people's deputies discussed this treacherous act from all Constitutional, legal, and political aspects in the light of the Constitution and the valid laws and the country's higher national interests. Based on these discussions and the constitutional and legal texts, the House of Representatives decides the following: 1. (?To condemn) al-Bid's declaration of secession as a violation of the Constitution and all valid laws in the Republic of Yemen. 2. The House considers this declaration not only a rebellion against legitimacy, but also a flagrant encroachment against the will of the Yemeni people and their unity, independence, sovereignty, security and stability. All unionist and democratic forces, as well as all citizens, must stand against this act and confront it through all means since it is a criminal act, which calls for bringing al-Bid and those who supported him to trial on charges of high treason on the basis of the Constitution and the valid laws. 3. The House of Representatives, as a legislative body, represents all the people and adopts its decisions by majority at official meetings and in accordance with the Constitution and its bylaws. No deputy or group of deputies has the right to hold a meeting or adopt a decision outside its headquarters and away from its speakership. This indicates that what these elements had done is null and void. These elements alleged that they represent the Yemeni Socialist Party bloc, and they approved al-Bid's secessionist declaration. Their action represented an aggression against the unity, independence, and territorial integrity of Yemen. 4. The House of Representatives urges all sisterly and friendly countries to respect their positions and commitments toward the Republic of Yemen as an independent sovereign state that is an Arab League and UN member, and not to interfere in its affairs, because what is going on is an internal affair in which no country has the right to interfere, in accordance with the Constitution of the Republic of Yemen, the Arab League Charter, and international charters. The House emphasizes that any interference by any country or any regional or international organization represents a dangerous sign that will prolong strife and shift it from the Yemeni horizon to the Arab and international horizons. This will also open the way for renegade movements in a number of countries, and will widen differences among the countries involved in this interference. The House of Representatives appreciates the heroic positions of the Armed Forces which protect unity and legitimacy. We pray Almighty God to grant these forces success, and we urge all sons of the Yemeni people to support the Armed Forces in order to protect unity and legitimacy by all material and moral means. The House urges the soldiers, noncommissioned officers, and officers who are subjected to the orders of the secessionist clique to join the army of unity and legitimacy in order to preserve the peoples' respect for them, and to protect their militant assets. We seek God's support, and peace be upon you. [Signed] The House of Representatives on 18 Dhu al-Hijjah, 1414 Hegira, corresponding to 29 May 1994
