FBIS TRENDS-11APR94-NORTH KOREA SPA Reaffirms Reformist Economic Agenda SPA Reaffirms Reformist Economic Agenda SUMMARY In an apparent at tempt to repair some of the economic damage done during the conservative backlash that followed the collapse of East Europe, Pyongyang has again affirmed a reformist economic agenda. Pyongyang's renewed stress on this agenda, combined with the regime's failure so far to place the economy on a war footing, suggest that it has not ruled out a peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue. END SUMMARY Pyongyang's reaffirmation of its reformist economic agenda came at the 6-8 April session of North Korea's parliament, the Supreme People's Assembly (SPA). The session was devoted mainly to mapping out economic policy for the next three years. In reiterating the economic policy of giving priorities to agriculture, light industry, and foreign trade, the SPA session continued Pyongyang's shift away from its traditional--and classically communist--emphasis on heavy industry. This shift, which has been proceeding with fits and starts in recent years, received a major boost at the December party plenum and in Kim Il-song's New Year's address(SEE NOTE). Justifying this shift, the keynote speaker at the SPA session, Premier Kang Song-san, claimed that Pyongyang's earlier policy of emphasizing heavy industry had been intended mainly as a way to rapidly develop light industry and agriculture and that the policy was never meant to develop heavy industry for its own sake. (NOTE: As usual for spring SPA sessions, whose main agendas are the state budget, the latest SPA session was not immediately preceded by a party plenum.) Kang's equivocation on the role of heavy industrial development amplified President Kim Il-song's call in his New Year's speech to invest "efforts" into the coal, power, and metal sectors "in a bid to develop" light industry and agriculture (New Year address, Pyongyang radio, 1 January 1994). Since the mid-1950's, Pyongyang had given priority to basic and heavy industry at the expense of the consumer goods sector. In the mid-198O's, the sagging economy and reforms in other socialist economies encouraged North Koreans advocating economic reform to start chipping away at the heavy industry-first approach, an effort which was rebuffed in the aftermath of the fall of communism. Other Reform Issues In addition to claiming that Pyongyang has always sought to develop light industry rapidly, Kang reaffirmed Pyongyang's commitment to a number of reform agenda items that had suffered setbacks in the conservative backlash of the past five years, among them: + Separation of powers. Kang seemed to echo the sentiments of reformers in trying to limit the party's domination of economic affairs. Laying out separate areas of responsibility for the party and the government, he said the government should serve as "the center" responsible for carrying out "economic works," while the party should be responsible for formulating those economic works. Like other officials before him, he claimed that separating areas of responsibility between the party and the government is the way to ensure that the party's leadership is "firmly established." + Material incentives. Indicating the sensitive nature of this topic in the current atmosphere of ideological rigidity, Kang made only a brief reference to the issue of promoting industrial efficiency by means other than political exhortation, another perennial item on the reformist agenda. Without mentioning the term material incentives, Kang endorsed reformers' assertions that industrial productivity can only be enhanced by rewarding performance. He said that plants and enterprises should enforce a strict cost accounting system, should be allowed to keep part of the profits they make, and by the same token, should be held accountable for any losses incurred. + Free trade zone. Supporting another putative reformist agenda item, Kang urged that additional "efforts" be put into the "free economic and trade zone" now being developed in the Tumen River basin so as to "fully ensure" conditions for foreign investment. However, suggesting Pyongyang's continuing uneasiness over the potential domestic impact, Pyongyang radio's coverage of Kang's speech left out his remarks on the trade zone. Only the shorter KCNA version for overseas audiences carried a summarized version of his remarks on the zone. Resource Allocation Finance Minister Yun Ki-chong's annual budget message, also delivered at the SPA session (Pyongyang radio, 7 April), similarly appeared to reflect a reform agenda. (As usual, Yun gave no actual figures for individual budget items and expressed the projected expenditures for some items in percentages, while using vague expressions such as "a huge amount" to describe other items of lesser priority.) + Foreign trade. Reflecting the regime's renewed interest in international commerce, Yun pledged to boost state investments in the foreign trade sector by 4.2 percent over the last year and called for building "more plants and shops" and organizing more "work teams" dedicated to producing exports goods. Furthermore, defying conservatives' pronounced misgivings about the processing trade," Yun vowed to build more bases for combining foreign capital, technology, and materials with North Korean labor to earn foreign exchange. + Light industry. In her speech, Yun projected an increase of 5.4 percent in state investment in light industry over last year. At the same time, Yun's speech also seemed designed to avoid raising popular expectations too much. Although the 5.4 percent increase in investment in light industry was a larger than usual proportionate increase, it still fell far short of the 13 percent figure used in 1989 to dramatize the Pyongyang regime's professed commitment to improving the consumer goods sector during what was touted as "the year of light industry." Moreover, in this year's speech she failed to announce construction of new light industrial plants, promising only to "modernize" existing facilities. In addition, she placed more than usual emphasis on increasing production of "3 August people's consumer goods." Named after the day in 1984 when Kim Chong-il visited a Pyongyang exposition of consumer goods made of scrap materials, these goods have been used to ostensibly relieve shortages over the years. Yun pledged to "expand and develop" production facilities and labor force for these goods, indicating that Pyongyang will be relying heavily on what had started as a stop-gap measure to meet an increased portion of consumer needs. Party Cell Meeting In contrast to the SPA's renewed emphasis on a more reformist approach to the economy, the SPA session coincided with signs that the regime intends to impose tighter social discipline, ostensibly to forestall any inflow of foreign influences. To this end, an unprecedented national conference of party cell secretaries was held from 31 March to 2 April. Touted as "the first of its kind ever" since the party's founding (Pyongyang radio, 25 March), the meeting pledged "infinite loyalty" to the party and promised to lead the masses in carrying out revolution (Pyongyang radio, 31 March-2 April). In a message to the cell secretaries, Kim Il-song called on them to prevent infiltration of any "alien ideologies or unwholesome life-styles" (Pyongyang radio, 31 March). Military Aspect Despite the crisis atmosphere Pyongyang has created in recent weeks over the nuclear issue, both Finance Minister Yun's SPA address and the keynote speech at the party cell conference seemed designed to avoid alarming the population: + In her speech Yun projected a only a modest increase in defense spending proportionate to the total national budget, claiming that 11.6 percent of state expenditure will be devoted to defense. Yun claimed that Pyongyang had actually spent 11.5 percent of last year's total national expenditure for defense. Although the publicized figures for defense spending may bear little resemblance to the actual outlays, Pyongyang has over the years used the proportion of defense expenditure to the total budget to signal the degree of tension on the peninsula. For instance, the announced figures for defense spending for the late 1960's were around 30 percent of the total state budget. + Similarly, the party cell keynote speaker, party secretary Pak Ki-nam, appeared remarkably restrained in his war rhetoric. Instead of the alarmist warnings issued routinely at mass meetings, Pak portrayed the army and people as united and ready to cope with any eventuality. He praised the army for having "honorably defended" the fatherland under the leadership of Kim Chong-il during last year's staging of Team Spirit military exercise in the South (Pyongyang radio, 31 March). He went on to promise that "the army and people" will do the same "if the United States and South Korean puppet clique" provoke a new war. Implications Pyongyang media treatment of the SPA session and the cell meeting indicate that, despite the heightened war rhetoric over the nuclear issue, the North Korean leadership does not wish to place the nation on a war footing at this point and risk disruption of the already bad economy. Pyongyang's current stance is consistent with its recent signals that the regime has not ruled out a negotiated settlement of the nuclear issue. (AUTHOR: YIM.
