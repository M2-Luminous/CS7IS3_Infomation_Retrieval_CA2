His position is clear. He says there are three groups in the Armed Forces. The first one, described as conservative, will follow ideas similar to the ones endorsed by the 27 November coup leaders and which are close to economic right-wing groups. Another one is located, as far as I understand, in the organization's middle ranks and has progressive tendencies. It maintains contacts with radical groups in our political sector. A third group prefers to give the Caldera government the military strength to face the current crisis. Cardozo is right. Three groups exist and have existed in the Armed Forces since 1958. We recall the initial efforts of Rodolfo Jose Cardenas, the right-wing trend of the conspiracy against Luis Herrera, and the first basis of military support for Romulo Betancourt when he decided to put a stop to leftist congressmen of the era following the Encanto train attack. I believe it is necessary to clairfy Cardozo's proposal. Two groups have always existed in the Armed Forces, united by a national feeling: one, a majority devoid of political passion, which carries out its professional military job, and the other, which thinks the Armed Forces is the path to power. What Cardozo failed to explain in his statement is that the politically-influenced group requires sufficient social deterioration to convince the majority of the Armed Forces of the need for a coup d'etat. Without those special conditions existing in the country, a coup simply would fail and would not be more than a coffee shop conspiracy. President Caldera and his government have sufficient political experience to prevent the forming of support around the minority group that might stage such a coup d'etat. I am certain of that. What does concern me is the vast popular unrest that exists against the leadership sectors for maintaining excessive privileges and unbridled ambitions. We Venezuelans blame that leadership for the misguided administration of the country. Until 1970, we had faith in creating a modern, developed, and different society. Expectations ended in utter failure and frustration. That perception permeated the Armed Forces and was the cause of the 4 February and 27 November coups. The prospect that Rafael Caldera would come to power, with all his moral authority and abilities, calmed the country during those historic moments and again created new confidence in the Armed Forces. That is the true origin of the existing institutional stability. Certainly, Rafael Caldera must reestablish a national consensus to avert a coup d'etat. Hilarion Cardozo is clear on this, but he does not interpret or say this consensus can only be secured by achieving profound national change. That is the government's dilemma. If it does not face the existing political, financial, labor, and judicial state of affairs and continues with sweeping reforms, popular resentment will again infiltrate the Armed Forces' ranks, creating the climate for a coup d'etat -- hence the real fear of Hilarion Cardozo and traditional party leaderships. They know the first obligation of a politician, moreso if he is a chief of state, is to preserve power. What will Rafael Caldera do if he feels that the very basis of his government is threatened? Will he permit a climate for conspiracy or, on the other hand, will he prefer to lead the national resentment, conducting the big changes required by the country? Only time will tell.
