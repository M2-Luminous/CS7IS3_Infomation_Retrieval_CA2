As London and Dublin began a two-pronged attempt to revitalise the stalled peace process, Mr Reynolds sought to send a conciliatory message to the Unionists. He said his own party, Fianna Fail, and the Ulster Unionist Party were the two largest parties in Ireland, and both had a responsibility to seek to "free our people from the present violent situation -- and to join in developing a better future for us all in the land we love." Speaking at a Fianna Fail conference in Dublin -- attended, for the first time, by a Unionist representative, Belfast councillor Michael McGimpsey -- Mr Reynolds said he did not believe unilateral British withdrawal from the North was the answer. "On the contrary, there would be a very real danger of communal violence and the type of violent community upheaval or worse which has characterised the political situation at intervals in the past," he said. "That is a scenario which must never be allowed to happen again." Realistically, a united Ireland by consent was a long-term goal, said Mr Reynolds, but both Unionists and nationalists could play an important part in governing the whole of Ireland. "I personally would be prepared to provide a guaranteed 30 per cent of places in an enlarged government -- and throughout the public sector -- for as long as was necessary, to members of the two communities in the North in proportion to their respective population, in accordance with systems that have been developed on parts of the European Continent." But Unionists were last night angered that Mr Reynolds had reopened the prospect of a united Ireland. The Rev Martin Smyth, Ulster Unionist MP for South Belfast and foreign affairs spokesman, said they would reject Mr Reynolds's offer "out of hand." It goes against the constitutional beliefs of all Unionists. "I cannot think of anyone who would support it in the community."
