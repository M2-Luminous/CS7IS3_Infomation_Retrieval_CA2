If the state were to incur sizable short-term debts, it would make the Bundesbank's policy of stability more difficult, Bundesbank Vice President Johann Wilhelm Gaddum said in an interview with FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE. Conversely, many large commercial banks in Germany would like to see the Federal Government issue short-term securities. Legally, the Bundesbank is not able to prohibit the Federal Government or other public entities borrowing short-term money by issuing tradable securities. Nevertheless, it can be expected that the Bundesbank's voice is heard in Bonn. So far, the Federal Government borrows money mainly through the emission of medium- and long-term securities and bonds quoted on the stock exchange. Federal one- or two-year financing treasury bonds have existed for many years, but these papers have not been quoted on the stock exchange and, compared with the major bonds, they are rather insignificant. Yet, in many other countries the state borrows money also through the emission of short-term securities, for example in the United States, France, or Italy. Particularly popular instruments are standardized, and thus tradable, Treasury bills with maturities between three and twelve months. In the past few years, this form of federal financing, for mere cost reasons, did not constitute an alternative, since short-term interests were quite often significantly superior to long-term rates (inverse interest structure). Yet, this is currently changing, which is why issuing short-term securities might soon become more attractive. Some time ago, the Federal Government created the legal conditions for major short-term borrowing, but has not issued such papers so far. The Bundesbank's reservations have to be seen from the angle of monetary policy. If one were to use the money market for financing state spending, one would narrow the Bundesbank's room to maneuver on the money market, Gaddum said. Yet, the Bundesbank must continue to be able to operate more or less freely on the money market. The Bundesbank obviously suspects that it might be maneuvered into situations in which it might no longer be able to decide on a major increase of the prime rate at the time it wants to, because this would conflict with the emission of short-term state papers intended for the same time or temporarily mess up an existing market for short-term papers. Such cases were reported from other countries in the past. In Gaddum's view, short-term borrowing is not only a disadvantage, but even unnecessary. The old principle that long-term investment spending should also be financed with long-term money is, after all, not wrong. Moreover, Gaddum regards it as evidence for the confidence in the stability of a currency when long-term spending can be financed through long-term borrowing. Should the Federal Government respect the Bundesbank's wish and do without issuing short-term securities, banking circles believe that this would be a severe blow for the new three-month interest rate future (Fibor-Future) at the German Options and Financial Futures Exchange. At the moment, there are only few short-term tradable financial products that might serve as the basis for three-month futures. These include short-term Bundesbank papers (Bulis) and the so-called "Commercial Papers" (CP), which are mainly emitted by private enterprises. The hopes of many bank managers have so far been based on the federal authorities, which were expected to issue short-term Treasury bills in large amounts. These Treasury bills should constitute the most important basis for transactions with the Fibor-Future. If the state were to do without the emission of short-term papers, it would, in the future, probably also affect transactions with money market funds. These are funds that invest their money mainly in shorts. While money market funds are quite popular in some countries, the Bundesbank's opposition has so far stopped the Federal Government from admitting German mark monetary funds in Germany. At the moment there are, however, efforts made in Brussels to permit money market funds in all European Union member countries. It may well be that the German law-makers will one day submit to this desire. In other countries, these funds are usually investing strongly in short-term state papers. Should these not be available in Germany, the investment possibilities of the money market funds would then no longer be legally, although economically, limited. One can assume that such a situation would quite suit the Bundesbank.
