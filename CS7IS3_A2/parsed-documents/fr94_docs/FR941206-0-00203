FR941206-0-00203 FR941206-0-00019 (i) A control device designed and operated to reduce the total organic content of the inlet vapor stream vented to the control device by at least 95 percent by weight; (ii) An enclosed combustion device designed and operated in accordance with the requirements of §265.1033(c); or (iii) A flare designed and operated in accordance with the requirements of §265.1033(d). (2) The control device shall be operating at all times when gases, vapors, or fumes are vented from the waste management unit through the closed-vent system to the control device. (3) The owner or operator using a carbon adsorption system to comply with paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall operate and maintain the control device in accordance with the following requirements: (i) Following the initial startup of the control device, all activated carbon in the control device shall be replaced with fresh carbon on a regular basis in accordance with the requirements of §265.1033(g) or §265.1033(h). (ii) All carbon removed from the control device shall be managed in accordance with the requirements of §265.1033(l). (4) An owner or operator using a control device other than a thermal vapor incinerator, flare, boiler, process heater, condenser, or carbon adsorption system to comply with paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall operate and maintain the control device in accordance with the requirements of §265.1033(i). (5) The owner or operator shall demonstrate that a control device achieves the performance requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section as follows: (i) An owner or operator shall demonstrate using either a performance test as specified in paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section or a design analysis as specified in paragraph (c)(5)(iv) of this section the performance of each control device except for the following: (A) A flare; (B) A boiler or process heater with a design heat input capacity of 44 megawatts or greater; (C) A boiler or process heater into which the vent stream is introduced with the primary fuel; (D) A boiler or process heater burning hazardous waste for which the owner or operator has been issued a final permit under 40 CFR part 270 and designs and operates the unit in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR part 266, subpart H; or (E) A boiler or process heater burning hazardous waste for which the owner or operator has certified compliance with the interim status requirements of 40 CFR part 266, subpart H. (ii) An owner or operator shall demonstrate the performance of each flare in accordance with the requirements specified in §265.1033(e). (iii) For a performance test conducted to meet the requirements of paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section, the owner or operator shall use the test methods and procedures specified in §265.1034(c)(1) through (c)(4). (iv) For a design analysis conducted to meet the requirements of paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section, the design analysis shall meet the requirements specified in §265.1035(b)(4)(iii). (v) The owner or operator shall demonstrate that a carbon adsorption system achieves the performance requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section based on the total quantity of organics vented to the atmosphere from all carbon adsorption system equipment that is used for organic adsorption, organic desorption or carbon regeneration, organic recovery, and carbon disposal. (6) If the owner or operator and the Regional Administrator do not agree on a demonstration of control device performance using a design analysis then the disagreement shall be resolved using the results of a performance test performed by the owner or operator in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section. The Regional Administrator may choose to have an authorized representative observe the performance test. §265.1089 Inspection and monitoring requirements. (a) This section applies to an owner or operator using air emission controls in accordance with the requirements of §265.1085 through §265.1088 of this subpart. (b) Each cover used in accordance with requirements of §265.1085 through §265.1087 of this subpart shall be visually inspected and monitored for detectable organic emissions by the owner or operator using the procedure specified in paragraph (f) of this section except as follows: (1) An owner or operator is exempted from performing the cover inspection and monitoring requirements specified in paragraph (f) of this section for the following tank covers: (i) A tank internal floating roof that is inspected and monitored in accordance with the requirements of §265.1091 of this subpart; or (ii) A tank external floating roof that is inspected and monitored in accordance with the requirements of §265.1091 of this subpart. (2) If a tank is buried partially or entirely underground, an owner or operator is required to perform the cover inspection and monitoring requirements specified in paragraph (f) of this section only for those portions of the tank cover and those connections to the tank cover or tank body (e.g. fill ports, access hatches, gauge wells, etc.) that extend to or above the ground surface and can be opened to the atmosphere. (3) An owner or operator is exempted from performing the cover inspection and monitoring requirements specified in paragraph (f) of this section for a container that meets all requirements specified in either §265.1087(b)(1)(ii) or §265.1087(b)(1)(iii) of this subpart. (4) An owner or operator is exempted from performing the cover inspection and monitoring requirements specified in paragraph (f) of this section for an enclosure used to control air emissions from containers in accordance with the requirements of §265.1087(b)(2) of this subpart. (c) Each closed-vent system used in accordance with the requirements of §265.1088 of this subpart shall be inspected and monitored by the owner or operator in accordance with the procedure specified in §265.1033(j).
