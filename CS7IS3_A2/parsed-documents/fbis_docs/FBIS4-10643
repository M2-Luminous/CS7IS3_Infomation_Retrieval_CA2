These former members had publicly criticized the presidential candidate and the party. This information was confirmed by official AD sources who explained that persons who were members of the parliamentary boards of other political groups were automatically suspended from membership. The cases of other persons who campaigned against AD, either because they were opposed to the present, national leaders of the party or for other reasons, were turned over to the AD disciplinary tribunal, with the recommendation that they be expelled, as agreed to by the National Executive Council early in 1994. It was stated on 4 March that, in addition to national AD leaders affected by this strong action, among whom were Juan Jose Delpino, Enrique Tejera Paris, Orlando Elbittar, Humberto D'Ascoli, and Roberto Pocaterra, the extensive list also included regional AD leaders such as Lucia Barrios de Miraglia, niece of Gonzalo Barrios, who had been president for life of AD, and in her own right was former governor of the State of Portuguesa for AD. The list also included Jose Ignacio Casal, former minister of development and a former AD senator, and Marcos Garzon Bolivar, a member of the Legislative Assembly of the State of Sucre.
