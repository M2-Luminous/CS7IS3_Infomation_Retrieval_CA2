Arde] [Text] Port Shepstone April 7 SAPA -- The Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] is forging ahead with arrangements for this month's elections in Natal/kwaZulu and does not think they should be postponed, IEC Vice-Chairman Dikgang Moseneke said on Thursday [7 April]. Speaking to reporters after meeting local IEC officials in Port Shepstone, Mr Moseneke said: "For better or for worse there will be voting stations for those who want to vote." He said he respected the right of people not to vote, but added: "Let it be peaceful." Mr Moseneke was speaking at the start of a tour of Natal/kwaZulu to assess the prospects for free and fair elections. He said although an IEC technical committee had disclosed this week that conditions were adverse for free and fair elections in certain parts of the region, the commission was pressing ahead to ensure voting took place. "We want to go ahead and establish a government representative of all of us." Mr Moseneke said the whole of Natal/kwaZulu was not a no-go zone. There were areas where voting was possible. "One shouldn't speak in absolutes." He said part of his mission was to make plans to ensure people in volatile areas were able to vote. The tour would focus on election readiness, determining locations for polling stations, securing people to staff them, and security arrangements. Natal electoral officer Thabani Jali said after the Port Shepstone meeting the province was not "very problematic...but there are flash-points". Of the seven districts in the greater Port Shepstone area, only two or three had been identified as flash-points. Mr Jali said one of the IEC's plans was to put more polling stations in areas around flash-points. Although the IEC trip was announced as a two-day affair, Mr Moseneke's programme states he will fly to Johannesburg at the weekend and return to Natal for three days next week.
