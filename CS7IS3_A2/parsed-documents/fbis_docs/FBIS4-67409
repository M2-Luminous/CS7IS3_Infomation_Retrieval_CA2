The regulations proposed by Britain and Australia urge tourists, explorers and travel agencies to control their own activities to protect the wildlife and environment of the continent. They will be formally adopted during the conference's final sessions Thursday and Friday. "Do not feed, touch, or handle birds or seals," "do not damage plants," and "do not use guns or explosives," are among the draft's guidelines urging visitors to refrain from activities that disturb the Antarctic flora and fauna. Tourists and adventurers are also asked to respect protected areas, to stay away from research facilities and study sites, not to dispose waste or collect rocks and fossils as souvenirs, and to plan their trips sensibly. The draft obligates tour organizers to notify national authorities about planned activities, assess and monitor the environmental impact of their expeditions and employ experienced and trained guides. Travel agents must inform tour participants about the requirements of the 1959 Antarctic treaty and its follow-up provisions and educate them about proper behavior in Antarctica. Delegates could not reach a consensus on how the guidelines should be implemented by national governments but decided to discuss national solutions at the coming Antarctica conference in South Korea next year. Restrictions on tourism have become a hot potato among treaty signatories since the adoption of the protocol on environmental protection to the Antarctic treaty in 1991. Countries like the United States and Britain, from where many tourists visit the area, were opposed to tough regulations involving liability for environmental damage as proposed by France and Chile. A major success of the Kyoto conference is that delegates reached an agreement on the tourism issue at all. However, a Japanese delegate decried that the guidelines were watered down to minimum requirements. "Their content is characterized by the thinking `let's start from the common ground for the time being,'" the delegate said. A U.S. delegate said the need for such guidelines on the other hand shows "how close the South Pole has moved to us." About 250 delegates from some 40 countries, international organizations and nongovernmental groups are attending the meeting which started April 11 and runs through Friday. About 7,000 tourists including some 100 Japanese visit the South Pole each year, but there have been reports of the tourists trampling penguin nesting grounds, damaging local plant life and disrupting scientific experiments being conducted in the area.
