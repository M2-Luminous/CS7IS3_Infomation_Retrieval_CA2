From the beginning of May, the mobilization of the mandatory state military service is canceled, due to the fact that the number of soldiers currently serving in the Army exceeds the number envisioned by the state budget for 1994 -- 4,323. In the beginning of April, there were 4,600 soldiers serving in the Defense Forces. The Chief of the Defense Forces Headquarters, Juris Arness, told DIENA that the reduction will be even larger -- the forces will be limited to 3,891 soldiers. According to him, the budget foresees a 10 percent reduction in the number of mobilized soldiers. However, the persons exceeding the number fixed by the Ministry of Finance cannot be released if they have not served a specific period of time. As DIENA was told by J. Kvelde, Latvia does not have any document or plan other than the defense concept adopted in 1992, which determines the number and development of separate structures of the Defense Forces. It specifies that the defense forces should number 9,000 people. The only law that effectively regulates this number is the state budget law for 1994 prepared by the Ministry of Finance. Raisa Bika, representative of the Budget Department in the Ministry of Finances, reported to DIENA that they have determined the number of soldiers for which support is available, and that the Saeima [parliament] has adopted this law. Officers of the Defense Forces are of the opinion that the reduction will have a negative effect on the activities of the Forces. Janis Adamsons, commander of the border guards brigade, told DIENA that at present they do not feel a lack of manpower, but in the autumn there will be approximately 750 fewer people. The largest segment of the mobilized soldiers -- 3,000 -- are serving in the border guards brigade.
