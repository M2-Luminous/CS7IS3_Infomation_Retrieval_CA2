This assertion was made here today by the republic's attorney general, Diego Valades. The official claimed that the drug traffic has not infiltrated the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic [PGR], remarking: "We shall fight to prevent that." He made these comments after a private meeting with Governor Ausencio Chavez and officials from both the state attorney's office and the federal department itself. The meeting was held to assess the effort being expended against the drug traffic in Michoacan. [passage omitted] He also announced the initiation, within the next few days, of a national system for complaints and charges against the PGR, "because we are striving to combat impunity and abuses, which will not be allowed in the department. Also, with that system, the citizens will be able to contact us free of charge to report abuses." Subsequently, Diego Valades also denied that there were "informers" in the Federal Judicial Police, claiming that the municipal policemen assigned to that force are only cooperating with the institution. "However, if they commit a crime, they are punished according to law, just as the agents in that department are." [passage omitted] On another subject, the attorney general refused to give statistics on the number of personnel killed in action during recent months in their confrontations with the "narco" rings. Nor did he specify the area in hectares that was confiscated from "narcos" in the country because it was being used to grow marijuana. [passage omitted] He claimed that good results have been accrued in the permanent campaign against the drug traffic in Michoacan, praising the work done by the Mexican Army in this respect. Concluding the interview, he declared that the action against drug planting, cultivation, and marketing will be intensified. In support of this, PGR local offices have been opened in the municipalities of Huetamo and Apatzingan, where the incidence of crimes against health is high.
