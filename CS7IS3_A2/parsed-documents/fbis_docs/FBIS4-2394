And the price of the U.S. and Hong Kong dollars remained fairly steady the past two days at the Shanghai-based China Foreign Exchange Trading Centre. The US dollar opened at 8.6889 yuan and edged up to 8.6948 yesterday. The average weighted price of the U.S. dollar yesterday was 8.6999 yuan, slightly higher than the previous average of 8.6967 yuan. Total transaction value on Monday and Tuesday was $89.77 million. More than 2 million Hong Kong dollars ($256,000) changed hands yesterday and the average price closed at 1.1275 yuan, slightly up from 1.1273 on Monday. The centre only handles U.S. and Hong Kong dollar transactions. But it has been hailed by market analysts as a major step forward in China's foreign exchange reform. They say it will help make the country's rate truly reflect the supply and demand of foreign exchange. Daily trading prices quoted on the market are referred to the central bank to set the next day's rate. The central bank adjusts the exchange rate by buying and selling hard currencies on the market. The official said it is hard to predict how the rate will change in the coming months, adding that its stability depends on the economy.
