It was the fourth pro-democracy letter sent to the Chinese authorities since the beginning of March amid the most serious challenge to communist power since 1989. State-security and police in Beijing, Shanghai, and other cities have tightened surveillance on the campuses and individual dissidents. Speaking in Shanghai yesterday, Bao Ge, a veteran activist, said the 19-point petition was sent last Friday to the reception office of the Chinese parliament. Called "Blueprint for the Political Democratisation of the State and Society in 1994" the petition was signed by people "from all walks of life in Shanghai intellectuals, academics, artists, peasants, workers and private businessmen", Mr Bao said. The names include prominent dissidents Yang Zhou, Wang Fucheng and Li Guotao, who are members of the Chinese Human Rights Association, based in Shanghai, he said. The list of demands in the petition include adoption of a law on press freedom and on a multi-party system, the authority to create independent unions, and abolition of the notion of "counterrevolutionary crime" in the penal code. The petition also demands an end to "re-education through work," imposed without trial by the police. It calls for a law to punish corruption and the opening of a national inquiry into the chain of events leading to the June 4, 1989, Beijing massacre. "It is our first signature campaign and we are going to extend the movement nationwide," Mr Bao said. "Several influential personalities have announced they share our point of view and are contemplating joining our movement," he said. Mr Bao said the petition is "the continuation" of the "Peace Charter" launched in mid-November in Beijing by several human rights advocates. "But the charter has limits because it calls for democratisation under the leadership of the Communist Party," he said. "We think that without party leadership, we can also reach democracy." Activist Mr Yang said signatories had discussed the points in the petition "in private" and had refrained from holding large-scale gatherings so as not to give police an excuse to crack down. However, sources close to the security establishment said both the Ministry of State Security and the Ministry of Public Security had deployed extra staff to keep tabs on the dissident community. They said at least one state security unit had been stationed in every major college in Beijing and Shanghai. Security in Beijing successfully prevented the holding of a gathering to mark the 15th anniversary of the arrest of Wei Jingsheng, the country's most prominent dissident. Wei, who was pressured into leaving Beijing on March 6, has not returned to the capital and it is understood the authorities were determined to keep him out of the way during the anniversary, which also marks the last day of his parole. A group had reportedly planned to hold a party in Wei's honour yesterday but police got wind of the scheme and intensified security in the capital accordingly. Former student leader, Wang Dan, said a group of police officers had been stationed outside his apartment building yesterday morning, while other dissidents said they too were being watched more closely than usual. The heightened surveillance of dissidents is expected to continue over the next few months.
