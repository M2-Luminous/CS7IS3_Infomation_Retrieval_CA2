Besides, Russian rockets do not destroy the ozone layer, unlike U.S. and French ones, which use powder-fuelled booster rockets. But the military-space forces are trying to minimize even this small risk. [Begin A. Kuzin, doctor of technological sciences, recording] We have raised the question of incorporating an ecological element in every launch of booster rockets. This element will include searching for and collecting metallic fragments and utilizing them, as well as carrying out restorative work in restricted areas. [end recording] [Correspondent Galkin] There will soon be nowhere in our country where someone wishing to sow or let cattle graze need fear a piece of rocket falling on his head or poisonous fuel pouring down on him. One can say that these problems have already been solved. The military ecologists are turning their gaze toward the next millennium, when space around the Earth will have to be cleared of space flight debris. [Begin Kuzin recording] These might be exotic methods using high-energy lasers to disperse relatively small pieces of space flight debris. These might also be minesweeper type facilities in space to gather large fragments and bring them back to land. [end recording] [Galkin] So there is every reason to believe that earth- dwellers can avoid a global ecological disaster, at least according to these sources.
