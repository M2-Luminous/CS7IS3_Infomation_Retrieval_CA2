He is eager to defend the "achievements" of his feeble presidency by fabricating crises abroad and spreading lies, something which a person assuming a public responsibility scarcely does! It has become completely clear to all observers that Clinton, before completing his first year in office, is being criticized severely by many domestic sides due to a series of defeats and failures abroad. On the domestic front, problems and scandals are raining on his head, including his love affairs before, during, and after the presidential elections and the exposure of financial irregularities that are being investigated in a climate of economic failure, and his failure to fulfill his tempting electoral promises. On the foreign policy front, defeats continue in Somalia, Haiti, and Russia, and plans to contain Japanese superiority and European independence have also failed. Moreover, Iraq has succeeded in rebuilding itself and safeguarding its national independence. Therefore, Clinton has been perpetually exposed to severe campaigns of criticism by the U.S. media, and many sides hinted that he might be fired before ending his second year in office. This makes him face difficult and bitter options and forces him to choose the easiest and shortest way to prevent failure and criticism; namely, fabricating crises abroad and diverting U.S. public opinion and making it accept confusing and misleading policies. The worst of his recent lies may be the ones he told in his periodic report to U.S. Congress two days ago because these lies express the U.S. President's state of misery and his disgusting moral retreat. He told his first lie to Congress when he said Iraq intends to rebuild its arsenal of weapons of mass destruction, especially the nuclear weapon! If Clinton had a balanced mind, logic, or memory, he would not have uttered such foolishness, simply because it is well known that the reports of the United Nations and its committees, particularly the International Atomic Energy Agency, which work at the instructions and supervision of the U.S. Administration, have all stated in their official reports that Iraq has no nuclear weapons and that these committees have destroyed Iraq's peaceful nuclear capabilities. One of the ridiculous and reprehensible ironies is that Clinton told that lie three days before the arrival of Rolf Ekeus, chairman of the UN Special Commission, in Baghdad. Ekeus had admitted in all his reports that Iraq was free of weapons of mass destruction in order to discuss the implementation of Resolution 715 after Iraq implemented the other resolutions, most important of which is Resolution 687. Clinton told his second lie when he said that Iraqi soldiers opened fire on a military convoy of the allied forces in northern Iraq last December. The Iraqi Foreign Ministry issued an official report at that time and refuted the lie. Raising this fabricated story that collapsed when confronted by reality is intended to incite the U.S. Congress against Iraq and justify the blockade. He also told a third lie to Congress when he said that the Iraqis are suffering from the blockade because Iraq refuses to export oil. Despite its silliness, this statement requires comment. Iraq did not refuse and will not refuse to export oil. The opposite is true. Iraq asks for permission to export oil to meet its people's needs, but the United States insists that a UN committee receive and spend oil revenues inside Iraq, as if the committee were a substitute for the Iraqi Government or as if it were in a country having no central government. While it is a big insult to the Iraqi people, this U.S. condition cancels Iraq's sovereignty and violates its national independence because allowing a foreign side to receive oil revenues and purchase and distribute basic goods apart from the Iraqi Government means accepting a disgusting trusteeship that conflicts with the Iraqi people's history and dignity. The Iraqi people rebelled against that trusteeship and offered thousands of martyrs to terminate it and prevent it from returning. Clinton knows that he is lying and that what he relates are sheer stories, fabricated and prepared to justify the continuation of the blockade. The issue may seem to be rather bearable, but if we take into account the fact that Clinton, a representative of the American people and their legislative organ, addresses Congress on such issues, we will understand the size of defect in the U.S. President. He lies to the highest legislative authority to mislead it and get it to support an unjust and inhuman policy in conflict with the values and principles of the U.S. Constitution; namely, the continuation of the blockade on a whole nation. This behavior also conflicts with the presidential oath in which he promised to carry out his duties honestly and sincerely. It also conflicts with the qualifications required in a president; namely truthfulness. Congressional leaders and members were toppled when their lies were proved. The Watergate scandal toppled President Richard Nixon when he lied and denied that he had known about spying on the rival party's headquarters. Clinton has not only committed the crime of insisting on killing thousands of Iraqis through the blockade, but has also gone beyond that to mislead the American people and Congress! If Congress is truthful and honest to the American Constitution and to its duties, it has to raise the issue of the President lying and misleading the American public and Congress and committing the crime of annihilating mankind! Finally, Clinton's lies are just more evidence of his political and moral failure and bankruptcy, his weakness, and his unstable policy and behavior. This is his Achilles' heel. Leading the world, which is Clinton's ambition, will never be achieved by charlatans, liars, and the weak. This is history's most important lesson.
