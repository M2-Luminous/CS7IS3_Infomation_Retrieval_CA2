FR941230-2-00146 FR941230-2-00072 Information and Statistics Projects_$625,000 OJJDP recently conducted an independent review of its Information and Statistics Program to help the Office develop a 5-year plan for information and data collection. As a result of this review, $625,000 would be allocated to the following new projects: National Juvenile Statistics Analysis Center; National Indicators of Risk and Protective Factors; Juveniles in the Criminal Justice System; National Program Directory; and Integrated Juvenile Justice, Mental Health, and Child Welfare Data Collection. National Juvenile Statistics Analysis Center OJJDP would establish a center denoted to collecting and analyzing statistics generated by OJJDP programs, State agencies, academic research, and other Federal agencies and programs. This National Juvenile Statistics Analysis Center would focus on two umbrella activities: (1) retrieving Federal, State and local research and data, and (2) providing quick analyses to inform Federal, State, and local policy and program decisions. The impetus for the Center comes from the recognition that many States are performing statistical analyses of their delinquency and juvenile justice systems. Other jurisdictions can benefit greatly from access to these data and analyses. The Center would function as a collection point for the research. With an increased national emphasis on juvenile justice issues, there is more need for specific and quick analyses of particular issues. The Center will provide such analyses on a wide range of subjects. Other activities of the Center would include: •Analyzing demographic, delinquency, and violence trends, including surveys of delinquency and related youth problems, Uniform Crime Report data, and victimization surveys. •Analyzing violent behavior trends and patterns, particularly assaults and robberies, to increase our understanding of these phenomena. •Maintaining national data sets on juvenile justice system handling of juveniles. Of particular interest would be State studies of disproportionate minority confinement and gender bias being conducted pursuant to the JJDP Act. •Retrieving statewide data sets for analysis and cultivating State resources for information and statistics. •Maintaining data sets produced under major studies of delinquency and related juvenile problems. •Distributing the results of statistical analyses conducted by others at the State and local level. The Center would be funded through a multiyear competitive contract award. National Indicators of Risk and Protective Factors Widespread adoption of the public health model as stimulated interest in viewing juvenile delinquency and other problem behaviors in terms of risk and protective factors. At the same time, interest in developing social indicators of delinquency has grown. Because of these two developments, a plan for collection and analysis of national indicators of risk and protective factors needs to be explored. State and community level baselines would enable measurement of the impact of delinquency prevention programs on risk and protective factors. A national baseline, with annual comparisons, could permit forecasts of changes in delinquency and youth violence levels and trends. Several projects have laid the foundation of national and state-by-state baselines: Kids Count, the National Youth Survey, OJJDP's Causes and Correlates Research Program, and Six State Communities That Care Pilot Program, and InfoNation. The key issue concerns the feasibility of nationwide establishment, at the State level, of reporting requirements necessary to generate comparable data. OJJDP would support a pilot study designed to test the feasibility of establishing comparable measurements of risk and protective factors, and prevalence measures for delinquency and other problem behaviors, at the individual, community, State, and national levels. The planning phase of the feasibility study would involve a wide range of expertise, including researchers, practitioners, and policymakers. The involvement of other Federal agencies and foundations interested in supporting such a program would be actively explored. OJJDP would award a single competitive grant to support the pilot study.
