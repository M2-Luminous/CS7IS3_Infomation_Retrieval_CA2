They said the chances of reaching agreement this week on EU farm prices for the new farm year looked very slim, and the majority of delegations consider measures suggested by Agriculture Commissioner Rene Steichen as insufficient or even unacceptable. Greece, the current EU president, wants quick agreement and was carrying out intensive consultations with the member delegations. But a suggested compromise worked out Monday night by Steichen and Greek Agriculture Minister Giorgos Moraitis got an unenthusiastic reception on Tuesday from some delegations. Discussions were made particularly difficult by numerous specific demands made by each EU delegation taking part in the price negotiations.
