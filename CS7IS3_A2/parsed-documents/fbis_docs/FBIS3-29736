The letter to the U.S. President said the U.S. Government's pressure and threat against people's Korea are not aimed at solving the problem peacefully but at rendering it complicated. Noting that a proper solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula is that the United States comes out again to the negotiating table with people's Korea, it demanded that the U.S. forces and nuclear weapons be withdrawn from South Korea and the double-standard policy be renounced in dealing with international issues. The letter to the United Nations secretary general voiced solidarity with people's Korea subjected to threat and blackmail and called on him to make responsible efforts for the discontinuation of such provocative moves increasing tension. It noted that the United States must be forced to end the presence of its forces with nuclear arsenal in South Korea, stop the "Team Spirit" joint military exercises and come out to talks, a proper way for a fair and comprehensive settlement of the crisis. The letter to the board of governors of the IAEA pointed out that the primary cause of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula is the presence of the U.S. Forces with nuclear weapons in South Korea. It urged the IAEA to free itself from the U.S. pressure in the campaign against people's Korea, refrain from applying double standards in dealing with the nuclear issue and take a responsible action.
