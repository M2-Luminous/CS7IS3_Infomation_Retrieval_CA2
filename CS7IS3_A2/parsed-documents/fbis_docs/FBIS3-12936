The Egyptian lawyer and author Hisham Mubarak has been to Denmark to interview Tal'at Fu'ad Qassim. Hisham Mubarak is writing a book about the Islamic fundamentalists and their international network. The following is an extract from the interview with Tal'at Fu'ad Qassim. [Mubarak] What are the Islamic Groups now concentrating their efforts on? [Qassim] We are taking a three-pronged approach. First, we are aiming at a military coup. On this front things are going very well. The state has absolutely no information about it, and the security police are being kept busy by a few small-scale actions which some of the Groups' younger members have carried out in the provinces. Secondly, the population as a whole has to be mobilized. In order to be able to carry out an Islamic revolution, the whole population must be mobilized. It is very important to prevent foreign intervention or, failing that, to delay foreign intervention for at least 18 days, in the view of our military people. We have organized many demonstrations and one of the purposes of these was to train the Groups' members to mobilize people, and we are experts in this field. Thirdly, special missions. These are of great significance, in that they involve the murder of some of the people in government posts. (...) This organizational unit (responsible for special missions -- POLITIKEN editorial note) has gained experience through carrying out a number of missions, it is now ready, and it will play a part in the implementation of the plan (to overthrow the regime -- POLITIKEN editorial note). This unit is active and it will not stop the death missions as long as circumstances make these activities necessary. It is a misunderstanding to think that the arrests of some members of the Groups or an absence of action over a period of time are a sign of weakness, since this is in accordance with a plan adopted for this organizational unit's activity. Preparations for a Military Coup The state knows nothing about the military organizational unit which is responsible for preparing a military coup, nor does it know anything about the organizational unit responsible for special missions. If some of its members are arrested, the only information these members have is about their own cell, and that is no help to the security police at all. As for the other cells, there is no connection between them at all. [Mubarak] The former members of the military or those who stood accused in the Jihad case (court case in connection with the murder of al-Sadat -- POLITIKEN editorial note) were rank and file soldiers and officers who had no power. If we assume that what you say is correct, this does not pose a great threat. What are your views? [Qassim] I disagree with you. It is the young officers who hold the real power, since soldiers do not take their orders from the generals, and we believe in the importance of lower-ranking officers; history has shown this. They are the most motivated people. Tourists Spread AIDS [Mubarak] Why have the Islamic Groups carried out terrorist acts against tourism? [Qassim] There is more than one reason for the policy of attacking tourism. Firstly, tourism is a major source of income which is incompatible with Islam and which goes to fill the state coffers. This means that the regime receives money which helps to keep it in power, while we think that the regime should be removed. So we have decided to strike this area in order to remove this source of income to the government, so that the regime loses its power. (...) Secondly, tourism in its present form is an abominable thing because it spreads prostitution and AIDS via female Jewish tourists. It is a vile means of spreading all forms of immorality. Tourism is also used to collect information on the Islamic Groups for foreign intelligence services. Therefore tourism, in our eyes, is an abominable thing which should be changed. These are the reasons for the tourist sector being hit in accordance with the Groups' strategy of damaging the regime. [Mubarak] But the acts of violence which you have committed were also intended to kill, since it was tourists who were killed. What connection is there between the tourists and the government? [Qassim] Some of the tourists are insured against being killed. That is why our slogan is tourism, not tourists. We have done a lot of planning and preparation because we wish to avoid killing tourists. So we took a number of measures. We issued various declarations, warning tourists against coming to Egypt where their lives would be in danger. We declared that anyone coming to Egypt was risking their life, because the tourist sector is targeted, and we sent declarations to all the competent authorities, in which they were urged not to admit tourists for the reasons mentioned. In the light of this, those who come anyway deserve whatever happens to them. Attack on Investments [Mubarak] You have issued a statement in which it appears that investments are shortly to become a target for the Groups' mission. When will you carry out violent acts against investments? [Qassim] The time when investments will be attacked depends on a number of factors. One of these is the Egyptian security police's treatment of us. We will assess how the struggle between the state and ourselves is progressing. If the state shows increasing violence towards us, we will attack investments in revenge and in order to prevent such violence. [Mubarak] Can you not here give what you see as valid reasons, as you can in the case of the tourist sector. What reasons are there for attacking investments? [Qassim] Our aim is to destroy all state institutions with the least possible bloodshed. These things are very simple. One of our military cells in the Groups has the capacity to attack investments in Egypt, when the time is ripe.
