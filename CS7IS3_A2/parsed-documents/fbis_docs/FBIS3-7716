The statement says U Myint Maung, NCGUB minister of agriculture and forests, disappeared on 25 March while en route from Chiang Mai to Bangkok. When the NCGUB began investigating the disappearance, it received news he had fallen into SLORC hands. U Myint Maung was elected as a representative from Einme Township constituency 2, Irrawaddy Division in the 1990 elections. Similarly, two NCGUB ministers -- Minister U Win Ko and Minister U Hla Pe -- were assassinated while traveling in 1993. The NCGUB is highly suspicious of the SLORC's role in the two murders and the recent disappearance of Minister U Myint Maung.
