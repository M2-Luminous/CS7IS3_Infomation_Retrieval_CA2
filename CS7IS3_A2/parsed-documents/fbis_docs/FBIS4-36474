FBIS4-36474 "drnes111_l_94011" FBIS-NES-94-111 Daily Report 9 Jun 1994 ISRAEL `Judaization' of Jerusalem Considered `Judaization' of Jerusalem Considered TA0306182194 TA0306182194 BFN [Editorial report] The HA'ARETZ supplement of Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ in Hebrew on 3 June carries a 5,000-word report by Mikhal Peleg on pages 36, 37, 38, and 40, on the issue of Jerusalem. Peleg asserts that in the 27 years since East Jerusalem was conquered, "Israel has done all it could to make the city one -- and Jewish. Yet one united Jerusalem -- the only national consensus that survived the evils of conquest -- does not exist in reality. In real life, the capital is a patchwork of Jewish neighborhoods densely interspersed with enclaves of alienated Arab population surviving in dire conditions. The border which once separated the two parts of Jerusalem has disintegrated into dozens of border lines of an elusive yet very tangible nature, and they are never crossed. The alienation between the two populations has created a situation no Israeli Government ever intended; construction and development were invested in the judaization of Jerusalem, and the discrimination practiced against the city's Arab residents made them a separate entity. Now it is easy for the Palestinians to demand separation because separation is already there." Peleg goes on: "The battle for Jerusalem did not end with military occupation. It has been going on since 1967 through vast investments in infrastructure and the expedited construction of Jewish neighborhoods over the entire annexed territory, even at the expense of irreversible damage to scenery and the city's special character. Today, East Jerusalem alone is inhabited by 160,000 Jews, versus about 155,000 Arabs. The takeover campaign is complemented by several steps: a wide-scale expropriation of Arab lands -- 26,200 dunam to date; systematic restrictions on Arab construction; and the deliberate disregard for basic services to the Palestinian population. Over the years, Jerusalem's Arab residents have opted for passive resistance, which was mainly reflected in the scant participation in municipal elections (6 percent after the outbreak of the intifadah in 1989, less than 10 percent in the last elections)." Peleg states that Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert believes the unofficial separation between the two parts of Jerusalem is "a temporary situation. Olmert plans to invest in improvements in the Arab city, and he accuses Teddy Kollek of neglecting and totally ignoring the Arab population's needs. He says he needs 140 million shekels of government funds to bring that part of the city up to date." "Two cities exist side by side in Jerusalem: In one of them, new neighborhoods are built at a rate unparalleled in the entire State of Israel. Thousands of housing units are built and enormous investments are made in infrastructure, roads, landscape planning, street illumination, shopping malls, industrial and trade regions. Israel has built 60,000 housing units for Jews in areas annexed in 1967 alone, and 10,000 more are currently under construction. On the other side, there is another city, which can be hardly called a city. It is made up of isolated enclaves which look like dusty rural areas; one- or two-story houses, hardly any sidewalks, many unpaved roads, few street lights, most of which do not work, several streets sharing a single garbage collection receptacle, no playgrounds or parks." "Jewish neighborhoods receive electricity from the Israeli Electrical Corporation. Arab neighborhoods receive theirs through the mediation of the East Jerusalem Electricity Company, a Jordanian-owned firm whose plants near Shu'fat were deserted when it was forced to stop producing power and made to buy it from the Israeli corporation. To reach West Jerusalem and the Jewish neighborhoods in East Jerusalem, one uses Egged buses; the Palestinians have buses operated by small private companies from nearby villages, such as Abu-Dis and al-'Ayzariyah." Peleg maintains that to facilitate Jewish construction in Jerusalem, the government has been expropriating and freezing Arab land. "In addition to the 73,000 dunam annexed in 1967," "26,200 dunam of privately owned Arab land were expropriated in 1968, 1970, 1980, and 1990." To accommodate construction plans, another 2,300 dunam will be expropriated in the near future; tens of thousands of housing units for Jews were built on that land. That was how Gilo, Talpiyyot East, Neve Ya'aqov, Pisgat Ze'ev, and other neighborhoods sprouted. Another 35,000 dunam of unused Arab-owned land in East Jerusalem were frozen, that is, construction is prohibited on them. The Arabs have been left with a 9,500-dunam area on which they may build. "A method of transferring lands to Jews was established under Teddy Kollek. The method consisted of marking map areas featuring privately owned Arab land in green. This was the sign allegedly indicating that the land was earmarked for public use and parks, and that construction was prohibited there. A few years after the land was marked green, some of it was expropriated and Jewish neighborhoods were built on them. For example, the Rekhes Shu'fat neighborhood, to be inhabited by Canadian ultra-Orthodox Jews, is in initial stages of construction, and planning has begun for two new neighborhoods, Har Homa and Sha'ar Mizrah between Neve Ya'aqov and the French Hill as well as a residential Jewish area in the heart of the Arab Ra's al-'Amud neighborhood." Peleg adds that while "West Jerusalem has a master plan, all East Jerusalem has are local master plans which, for years, referred only to the Jewish neighborhoods. Only six Arab neighborhoods have received official license to date, while eight others have been waiting for approval for 10 years. In 1980, a municipal committee submitted a plan which indicated a need for 18,000 additional housing units for the city's Arab population. Nothing of this materialized. The Arab population grew from 114,000 in 1980 to 155,500 today. On the basis of five persons to an apartment, about 26,000 housing units for Arabs should have been built in East Jerusalem. As a result of the shortage and the overcrowded conditions, 5,000 housing units were built -- many without a license. In 1990, for instance, 3,000 building permits were issued; of these, only 150 were for Arabs. Former city council member Sara Kaminker, who had been Kollek's adviser on Arab neighborhoods until her protest resignation, has amassed information indicating that about 21,000 Jerusalemite Arab families are homeless." Peleg maintains that "the war over Jerusalem has changed after the Palestinians began, for the first time, to take action to improve their positions. Last November, a committee initiated by Faysal al-Husayni was set up. Its objective is to establish the National Council for Jerusalem-Palestine and to outline an action plan for the interim period. The committee, which is headed by Dr. Mahdi 'Abd-al-Hadi from PASSIA (Palestinian Academic Society for the Study of International Affairs), has practically drafted a plan for every municipal council department, from construction planning and infrastructure down to services, such as education, health, culture and religion, public security, and tax collection, including a blueprint for a Palestinian police force in East Jerusalem. PASSIA holds workshops from which local leaders and professional teams are gradually emerging." "In other offices related to Orient House, such as the Palestinian Geographical Center, Israeli takeover of Arab lands is meticulously documented, and each change is immediately noticed. In addition, they draw maps for future negotiations." Khalil Tufakji, the Palestinian Geographical Center director, "claims that Ehud Olmert is trying to continue the Jewish expansion eastward, to the area outside metropolitan Jerusalem's boundaries, through the Sha'ar Mizrah neighborhood due to be built beyond road No. 9, linking Ma'ale Adumim to Pisgat Ze'ev." "Palestinians have a vested interest in launching the debate on Jerusalem before the two years stipulated in the agreement are out: Their argument is that by then, they may have no land to discuss. The Israeli Government is also aware of the fact that the mounting tensions in the city and the operation of its Palestinian institutions -- most notably Orient House, which even today is acting as a Palestinian municipal center and a quasi Foreign Ministry -- will force it to deal with the problem earlier than expected."
