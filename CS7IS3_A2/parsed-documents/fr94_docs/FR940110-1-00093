FR940110-1-00093 FR940110-1-00006 ยง960.5 Long-term requirements. (a) Rental housing units. (1) At least 20 percent of the rental housing units in a project financed under the AHP with subsidized advances or direct subsidies shall remain affordable for and occupied by very low-income households for a minimum period of 30 years or, at the election of the sponsor, the remaining useful life of such units, except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section. An applicant and the project sponsor shall state in the AHP application their commitment regarding satisfaction of the long-term income-eligibility, affordability and income-targeting requirements contained in this paragraph (a)(1). An applicant may commit to maintain additional units as affordable for and occupied by low- or moderate-income households, which commitment shall be for a minimum period of 30 years or, at the election of the sponsor, the remaining useful life of such units, except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.

(2) A household occupying a rental housing unit subject to the income-targeting requirement of paragraph (a)(1) of this section is required to satisfy the income-eligibility requirement of such paragraph applicable to such income-targeted unit, as committed to in the AHP application, upon initial occupancy.

The unit may continue to count toward meeting the income-targeting requirement committed to in the AHP application, provided the rent charged remains affordable to the household as defined in ยง960.1; however, if the household's income rises above 140 percent of the income-targeting level committed to in the AHP application, the sponsor must make the next available rental housing unit in the project affordable to and available for occupancy by a household whose income is at or below the income-targeting level committed to in the AHP application for the original unit, and once the next available rental housing unit is so occupied, the rent charged on the unit occupied by the household whose income has risen shall no longer be subject to the requirement that it be affordable for households at the income-targeting level committed to in the AHP application. (3) An owner of an AHP-assisted rental housing project may sell the project prior to the end of the long-term period during which the project's rental units, or applicable portion thereof, must remain affordable for and occupied by households with incomes at or below the levels committed to in the AHP application; however, either: (i) The purchaser must agree to continue the project's rental units, or applicable portion thereof, as affordable for and occupied by households with incomes at or below the levels committed to in the AHP application for the remainder of the long-term period committed to in the AHP application, and must agree to be subject to the same restrictions on resale that applied to the seller; or
