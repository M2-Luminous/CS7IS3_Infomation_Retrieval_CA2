Lamb described the meeting as constructive. Replying to a relevant question, he said we should not get involved with what he called artificial timeframes. We should proceed, he noted, toward the implementation of the confidence-building measures. Lamb also said he would leave Cyprus tomorrow. Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said Lamb sought to bring changes to the UN document so that the talks can continue. Even if there are changes, Kasoulidhis said, [Turkish Cypriot leader] Rauf Denktas will ask for more, since he does not have the will for a Cyprus solution. The government spokesman said that during the meeting, President Kliridhis repeated that the Greek Cypriot side showed the highest possible degree of constructive willingness to accept the UN document. The Greek Cypriot side, he added, will accept no amendments to the document and no new document from the United Nations. Kasoulidhis said that our side did not ask for timeframes but stressed that since they exist they should be followed. The spokesman also said that anyone who tries to change the UN document will find himself in front of Denktas' policy of differing. Kasoulidhis then said that with the changes to the document, Lamb appears to hope that an agreement will be reached. This is a view, he said, with which the Greek Cypriot side disagrees.
