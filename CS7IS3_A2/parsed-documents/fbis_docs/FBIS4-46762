Kh. Dzhurabekov. Participants in the meeting were the deputies of the chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Karakalpakstan, the khokims [administrators] of the oblasts and the city of Tashkent, and the heads of ministries, departments, concerns, corporations, and associations. The question of the situation with execution of the laws directed to ensuring preservation and rational use of petroleum products in the sectors of the agroindustrial and construction complexes was reviewed. Inspections conducted by the republic procurator's office and its organs in the local areas with participation by specialists showed that measures are being taken at the farms and in the administrative apparatuses of the Ministry of Water Management, the Ministry of Agriculture, the state concerns Uzvodstroy [Hydro Construction], Uzplodoovoshchvinprom [Fruit-Vegetable-Grape Industry], and Uzpishcheprom [Food Industry], Uzglavstroydrevprom [Main Administration of Construction in the Wood Processing Industry], and the Tashkentstroy [Tashkent Construction] State Corporation to stop mismanagement in the storage, transportation, and use of petroleum products. This reduced the number of violations of the law in the use of fuel and lubricants. At the same time the proper measures are not always taken with guilty parties. As the result of connivance on the part of ministries, departments, and officials at the farms and enterprises there occur cases or irrational use of petroleum products, unsatisfactory record-keeping on them, illegal writing off of fuel, poor technical condition in petroleum storage facilities, and operation of vehicles with malfunctioning speedometers. Petroleum products are squandered, stolen, and resold owing to the neglected state of record-keeping and relaxed monitoring of their preservation. The sources from which petroleum products sold by private individuals at speculative prices were obtained are not identified. A shortfall of 92,500 liters of various petroleum products was found at the petroleum storage facilities of just 17 farms in Andizhan, Bukhara, Dzhizak, Surkhandarya, and Navoi oblasts. The practice was followed where the customs services would use confiscated petroleum products for their own needs and sell them to various organizations instead of turning them in to state storage areas in Surkhandarya, Andizhan, and Bukhara oblasts. In just the first quarter of this year more than 88 percent of confiscated petroleum products were used for their own needs or sold to customs employees and various organizations. The attention of those at the meeting was called to compulsory execution of the Cabinet of Ministers decree entitled "Establishing Order in the Sale of Fuel and Lubricants." The decision adopted noted that many heads of ministries, concerns, associations, enterprises and organizations, and local governmental organs did not draw the proper conclusions from decisions adopted earlier and did not fully ensure their realization. The question of the use of gas, boiler fuel, and thermal and electrical energy at enterprises in Samarkand, Navoi, and Tashkent oblasts and the city of Tashkent was examined at the meeting. Study of the state of affairs in this sphere identified numerous substantial shortcomings, which lead to significant losses of gas. In a sample inspection of just 13 percent of the enterprises of the above oblasts and the city of Tashkent it was established that about 100 million cubic meters of gas is being lost because of direct mismanagement. The losses of other types of fuel, heat, and electricity are very large. The situation with the use of energy-conserving equipment remains unsatisfactory. The attention of the executives was directed to the inadequacy of the steps being taken on questions of the use of fuel-energy resources. It was recommended that the heads of khokim [administrative] offices, ministries, and departments review the personal responsibility of the officials guilty of offenses in the questions reviewed, going as far as discharging them from their positions. The commission also examined the question of switching diesel pumping stations to electric drive. It was noted that realization of these measures will make it possible to free a significant quantity of diesel fuel. A schedule was approved for switching diesel pumping stations to electric drive and switching machine irrigation systems to gravity flow watering in 1994-1995. Steps to realize this program were outlined. Deputy prime ministers of the republic A. Voznenko, K. Tulyaganov, M. Usmanov, and K. Khankulov took part in the commission meeting.
