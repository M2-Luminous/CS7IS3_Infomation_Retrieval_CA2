FR941103-0-00084 FR941103-0-00013 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 50 CFR Part 630 [Docket No. 931078&hyph;4286; I.D. 100593C] RIN 0648&hyph;AF42 Atlantic Swordfish Fishery AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: NMFS issues this final rule to implement a voluntary pilot program that will allow limited retention of undersized swordfish, in excess of the trip allowance, for scientific purposes critical to proper stock assessment. Swordfish so collected must be donated through the Second Harvest National Foodbank Network to needy individuals. The intended effects are to obtain additional information regarding the harvest, mortality, and biological characteristics of swordfish less than the minimum size, while investigating the potential for avoiding waste of swordfish that would otherwise be discarded dead. EFFECTIVE DATE: December 5, 1994. ADDRESSES: Copies of documents supporting this action may be obtained from Richard H. Schaefer, Director, Office of Fisheries Conservation and Management, NMFS, 1335 East-West Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910. Comments on the information collection requirements should be sent to Richard H. Schaefer and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Washington, DC 20503 (Attention: Desk Officer for NOAA).
