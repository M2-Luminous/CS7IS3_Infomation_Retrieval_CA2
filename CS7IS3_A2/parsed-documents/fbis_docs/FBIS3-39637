FBIS3-39637 "drweu034_n_94013" FBIS-WEU-94-034 Document Type:Daily Report 18 Feb 1994 NORDIC COUNTRIES Sweden Latest on `Satellite War' With Norway LD1602193294 Stockholm Radio Sweden in English 2130 GMT 15 Feb 94 LD1602193294 Stockholm Radio Sweden Language: English Article Type:BFN [Excerpts] [Announcer] Meanwhile the satellite war between Norway and Sweden continues. We've reported before on Norway's purchase of Britain's Marco Polo-2 satellite, which was repositioned at 1 degree west and renamed Thor. [passage omitted] On the other hand, the Swedish Space Corporation and Swedish Telecom have succeeded in buying the Marco Polo-1 satellite and is moving to position it together with Sweden's Tele-X at 5 degrees east. The Norwegians tried to block the sale in the British courts, since the two Marco Polo satellites operate on the same frequencies, and being placed so close together there may be interference. Since Sweden holds the rights to the frequencies and Norway doesn't, that's also a problem for the Norwegians. The move even prompted Norway to shift from the obscure D-MAC system for the Thor channels to the much more common D2-MAC system. Now, a consortium in Malaysia is threatening to sue British Sky Broadcasting for selling the satellite to the Swedes. The Malaysians say they offered more, but Sky wouldn't sell because the satellite would have been competition for Star TV, the huge Asian satellite broadcaster owned by the same company that owns Sky. So far, the Swedish Space Corporation hasn't said what channels may be on its new satellite, which has been renamed Sirius. It's been moving from its old position and should have passed Thor yesterday and should be in its final position on 20 February. And now, the latest crazy twist to the story. The four largest Nordic cable operators, including Swedish Telecom's cable company, and counterparts in Norway and Denmark, and the Helsinki Media Company from Finland, have started a joint company to distribute satellite channels via the Intelsat positioned with Thor. The new company is called Nordic Satellite Distribution, and hopes to compete with Astra. Claes Gustavsson is information director at Swedish Telecom's cable subsidiary. [Begin recording] [Gustavsson] Well, what we're doing is we're trying to bring the four largest companies in Scandinavia together, actually the largest cable TV operator in each country together, and form a large company that will be stronger, a stronger unit in every sense, to just get a better programming out for everybody and see if we can work together. [Unidentified correspondent] So you'll be picking up TV channels and relaying them over the Intelsat-702 satellite which is being launched later this year? [Gustavsson] Yeah, that's what we're going to do. And actually we're trying to, you know, we're entering into this, to the DTH [direct to home] (?or) satellite dish market with this, and see if we can get everything to come out from just one position. So, today, probably most households of Sweden needs probably at least three different dishes or one motorized one, to get probably the 10 most popular channels, but by doing this they can get everything from one position. [Correspondent] How many channels are you planning on relaying? [Gustavsson] Oh, as many as possible -- we're not, you know, we don't know at this point, but this, of course, is also looking into digital compression and what's going to happen with that. [Correspondent] What channels are you planning on? [Gustavsson] Actually everything we carry now, whatever is available in Sweden or in Denmark and Finland, plus the largest channels there are, CNN, BBC, etc., the movie channels, probably the 30 most popular channels in Scandinavia. [Correspondent] So you must be taking the entire capacity of that satellite, if you're going to carry 30 channels? [Gustavsson] Well, that has to do, of course, with digital compression and how that's going to work and how long this will take. [Correspondent] So, you're putting all this in at 1 degree west, but there's already a satellite at 1 degree west, Thor, which is actually owned by Norwegian Telecom, who offer a packet of channels, so you'll be competing with them. [Gustavsson] Well, the way we look, at this point we're not looking at competing with anybody, we're more looking at as, as, well, as trying to widen or broaden the market and get much more households involved, that's what we're trying to do right now, so we're just basically meeting with everybody and see how we can work together to get more people to either have, you know, satellite dishes or cable TV. [Correspondent] (?Because) meanwhile over at 5 degrees east we've got Sweden's Tele-X satellite and Swedish Telecom and the Space Corporation have bought and are moving the Marco Polo-1 satellite there, they're going to call it Sirius and offer a satellite package as well. So it seems like we've got two different Scandinavian hot bird positions competing against themselves here. [Gustavsson] Yeah, that's how it looks right now, but what we're doing is just basically meeting and discussing how to, you know, how to make this as, as possible for the customers and just trying to look at it as a way of developing the market and take a step forward there, instead of looking at it as a situation of competition at this point. [Correspondent] When are you planning on actually beginning operations? [Gustavsson] Well, we're hoping for this fall at the latest. But right now, well, like I said, we're meeting with everybody and then negotiating and then (?talking), getting through (?to your) additional parts etc, and trying to see where we stand.
