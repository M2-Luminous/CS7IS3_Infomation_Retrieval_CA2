This was because North Korea finally consented to the start of International Atomic Energy Agency nuclear inspections after delaying it during the ongoing negotiations with the United States. North Korea had accepted inspections on 15 February. Han Sung-chu was appointed foreign minister when the Kim Yong-sam regime was inaugurated February 1993 and has been entangled in the North Korean nuclear issue ever since. He could not help but be nervous whenever some progress was made in the North Korean-U.S. negotiations on nuclear inspections. While watching the North Korean-U.S. working-level contact in New York, Minister Han worried that something may go wrong because North Korea has persistently refused to accept North-South exchange of special envoys as a precondition for the third stage of North Korean-U.S. talks. When it was pointed out the letter of agreement between North Korea and the United States, which was released on 25 February in New York, does not say the North-South exchange of special envoys is a precondition for the third stage of DPRK-U.S. talks, Minister Han flatly said: "We can say the U.S. position that no third stage of North Korean-U.S. talks can be held without an exchange of special envoys was implemented." This means that even though North Korea opposed the inclusion of the special envoy issue in the letter of agreement to save face, it accepted this condition in actuality. Asked why he thought so, he said: "The United States immediately notified us of the results of the discussions at the New York contact. In doing so, it asked us whether we consented to such a letter of agreement. After confirming the U.S. will for the special envoy issue, we expressed our approval on the letter of agreement." Probably conscious of the domestic criticism that the United States took the initiative in the negotiations on the nuclear issue and that the ROK was detached from the negotiations between the United States and North Korea, Minister Han stressed: "I can say our government has taken the initiative in improving the situation. An example of this is that we have persistently pursued to resolve the issue through dialogue." Minister Han recently (from 9 to 19 February) visited the United States, where it was strongly demanded that sanctions be imposed on North Korea, and reconfirmed the ROK- U.S. basic position that the nuclear issue must be resolved through dialogue. Some people say this has affirmatively affected the negotiations between the United States and North Korea and led North Korea to accept nuclear inspections. It is not clear, however, whether the minister's policy of resolving issues through dialogue led North Korea to accept nuclear inspections or whether North Korea accepted nu?lear inspections because it had no other choice. North Korea accepted nuclear inspections while he was discussing the North Korean nuclear issue with U.S. leaders. As a result, his U.S. visit proved to be productive. In this sense, he was lucky. When Minister Han returned home from the United States, some people alleged that he leaned toward the North. Maybe conscious of the allegation, he cautiously talked about the improvement of North Korean-U.S. relations. He said: "One can think of several interim stages in North Korean-U.S. relations between the present status and the establishment of full diplomatic relations. Such stages may include lifting the virtual economic embargo imposed on North Korea, allowing businessmen to visit North Korea, and opening liaison offices." He stressed that when the nuclear issue is resolved, the improvement of relations between North Korea and the United States and between North Korea and Japan is not unfavorable to the ROK. He pointed out that North Korea must be cautious of its fixed idea of the zero sum game in reunification diplomacy. Minister Han had said that we must face the fact that matters that concern North Korea, will also be matters that will concern us. His view stems from the common principle that consideration must be guaranteed if one is to convince the other side. This takes root in the work of Harvard University Professor Thomas (Schilling) entitled, "Strategy in Disputes," which he was deeply impressed with during his school days. Professor (Schilling)'s book developed the theory on methods for contemporary and international politics, such as the theories of games. When asked if he had a hard-line view or moderate view in connection with the issues on North Korea, Minister Han said that he does not want to be classified as a hard-liner or soft-liner, but emphasized: "I believe that I am a realist." It seems clear that when we examine his remarks on North Korean issues and on how he handles his work, he is a "realist." When the nuclear negotiations were in a difficult situation, Minister Han minutely adjusted the priorities in his remarks, and considering his status within the government and the president's position, he refrained from making unreasonable acts. We cannot say that he has complete command over the career officials within the Foreign Ministry, but it also does not mean that he is being dragged around by the officials. When asked about the current reunification policy and the status of the National Unification Board, Minister Han refrained from making any remark by saying that it is not his field of work. He just said: "The Korean commonwealth reunification formula was announced in 1989. However, it seems that this formula does not sufficiently reflect the important changes that took place in the international environment since then." After teaching at New York University until the late seventies, Minister Han returned to the ROK to teach at Koryo University. Since then he has taken part in the government's foreign policies by becoming a member of the diplomatic policy advisory committee of the Foreign Ministry and a member of the ROK-Japan 21st Century Committee. He also accumulated a considerable international reputation as a guest columnist of NEWSWEEK. He is recognized as the minister among all former foreign ministers who has the best command of English. This is attributed to the fact that he lived in the United States for a long period of time. Prominent press and publications in the United States sometime show unprecedented friendliness by publishing special reports on him. The interview now changed to the subject of trade and pending economic issues, such as the issue of opening the rice market, NAFTA, and the issue of Russia repaying economic cooperation funds. In particular, the issue of opening the rice market and taking part in NAFTA are issues that remain a challenge to him. He said: "I believe that it will be inevitable to hold negotiations again on agricultural products because the countries participating in the Uruguay Round did not attach conditions when submitting the letter of content in the agricultural product field." He is saying that it is agonizing, but we cannot but keep the promise on opening our agricultural products, such as opening the rice market. There are pros and cons between the government and academic circles on our participation in NAFTA, which officially went into effect early this year. However, Minister Han presented a considerably clear countermeasure. Considering the pace of progress in our efforts to achieve internationalization, Minister Han thinks that the issue of joining NAFTA must be examined in the long-term, and that at the moment we must promote cooperation with NAFTA member countries--the United States, Canada, and Mexico. He said: "In July, the U.S. Administration is planning to submit to Congress a report on methods to operate NAFTA, including ways to establish relations with nonmember countries. After taking this into consideration, we must establish countermeasures regarding this matter. Rather than becoming an official member of NAFTA, we must try to utilize various forms, such as becoming an associate member or establish special cooperative relations." In connection with Russia's proposal to repay economic cooperation funds by providing up-to-date weapons and carry out joint venture projects, Minister Han showed a prudent attitude by saying: "Since this is an issue directly related to economic cooperation and security, the government's overall view will be provided after discussing this matter with related ministries." Minister Han has been criticized that he concentrates too much on diplomatic policy issues to the detriment of internal reform issues. This is because internal reform to resolutely improve irrational diplomatic manpower structures and revise the network of diplomatic establishments abroad are still at a standstill. Many diplomats observing him hope that rather than seeking a simply realistic attitude, he will join in the ranks of carrying out reform.
