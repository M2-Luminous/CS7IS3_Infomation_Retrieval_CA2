FR940705-2-00197 FR940705-2-00091 Appendix G&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;2&hyph;p. Hypodermic needles and syringes are used only for parenteral injection and aspiration of fluids from laboratory animals and diaphragm bottles. Only needle locking syringes or disposable syringe-needle units (i.e., needle is integral to the syringe) are used for the injection or aspiration of fluids containing organisms that contain recombinant DNA molecules. Extreme caution should be used when handling needles and syringes to avoid autoinoculation and the generation of aerosols during use and disposal. Needles should not be bent, sheared, replaced in the needle sheath or guard, or removed from the syringe following use. The needle and syringe should be promptly placed in a puncture-resistant container and decontaminated, preferably by autoclaving, before discard or reuse. Appendix G&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;2&hyph;q. Spills and accidents which result in overt or potential exposures to organisms containing recombinant DNA molecules are immediately reported to the Biological Safety Officer, Institutional Biosafety Committee, and NIH/ORDA. Reports to NIH/ORDA shall be sent to the Office of Recombinant DNA Activities, National Institutes of Health, Building 31, Room 4B11, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, (301) 496&hyph;9838. Appropriate medical evaluation, surveillance, and treatment are provided and written records are maintained. Appendix G&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;2&hyph;r. Baseline serum samples for all laboratory and other at-risk personnel should be collected and stored. Additional serum specimens may be collected periodically depending on the agents handled or the function of the laboratory. Appendix G&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;2&hyph;s. A biosafety manual is prepared or adopted. Personnel are advised of special hazards and are required to read and follow the instructions on practices and procedures. Appendix G&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;2&hyph;t. Alternative Selection of Containment Equipment (BL3) Experimental procedures involving a host-vector system that provides a one-step higher level of biological containment than that specified may be conducted in the BL3 laboratory using containment equipment specified for the BL2 level of physical containment. Experimental procedures involving a host-vector system that provides a one-step lower level of biological containment than that specified may be conducted in the BL3 laboratory using containment equipment specified for the BL4 level of physical containment. Alternative combination of containment safeguards are shown in Appendix G&hyph;Table 1. Appendix G&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;3. Containment Equipment (BL3). Appendix G&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;3&hyph;a. Biological safety cabinets (Class I, II, or III) (see Appendix G&hyph;III&hyph;L) or other appropriate combinations of personal protective or physical containment devices (e.g., special protective clothing, masks, gloves, respirators, centrifuge safety cups, sealed centrifuge rotors, and containment caging for animals) are used for all activities with organisms containing recombinant DNA molecules which pose a threat of aerosol exposure. These include: manipulation of cultures and of those clinical or environmental materials which may be a source of aerosols; the aerosol challenge of experimental animals; the harvesting of infected tissues or fluids from experimental animals and embryonate eggs; and the necropsy of experimental animals. Appendix G&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;4. Laboratory Facilities (BL3) Appendix G&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;4&hyph;a. The laboratory is separated from areas which are open to unrestricted traffic flow within the building. Passage through two sets of doors is the basic requirement for entry into the laboratory from access corridors or other contiguous areas. Physical separation of the high containment laboratory from access corridors or other laboratories or activities may be provided by a double-doored clothes change room (showers may be included), airlock, or other access facility which requires passage through two sets of doors before entering the laboratory. Appendix G&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;4&hyph;b. The interior surfaces of walls, floors, and ceilings are water resistant so that they can be easily cleaned. Penetrations in these surfaces are sealed or capable of being sealed to facilitate decontaminating the area. Appendix G&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;4&hyph;c. Bench tops are impervious to water and resistant to acids, alkalis, organic solvents, and moderate heat. Appendix G&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;4&hyph;d. Laboratory furniture is sturdy and spaces between benches, cabinets, and equipment are accessible for cleaning. Appendix G&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;4&hyph;e. Each laboratory contains a sink for hand washing. The sink is foot, elbow, or automatically operated and is located near the laboratory exit door. Appendix G&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;4&hyph;f. Windows in the laboratory are closed and sealed. Appendix G&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;4&hyph;g. Access doors to the laboratory or containment module are self-closing. Appendix G&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;4&hyph;h. An autoclave for decontaminating laboratory wastes is available preferably within the laboratory. Appendix G&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;4&hyph;i. A ducted exhaust air ventilation system is provided. This system creates directional airflow that draws air into the laboratory through the entry area. The exhaust air is not recirculated to any other area of the building, is discharged to the outside, and is dispersed away from the occupied areas and air intakes. Personnel shall verify that the direction of the airflow (into the laboratory) is proper. The exhaust air from the laboratory room may be discharged to the outside without being filtered or otherwise treated. Appendix G&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;4&hyph;j. The high efficiency particulate air/HEPA filtered exhaust air from Class I or Class II biological safety cabinets is discharged directly to the outside or through the building exhaust system. Exhaust air from Class I or II biological safety cabinets may be recirculated within the laboratory if the cabinet is tested and certified at least every twelve months. If the HEPA-filtered exhaust air from Class I or II biological safety cabinets is to be discharged to the outside through the building exhaust air system, it is connected to this system in a manner (e.g., thimble unit connection (see Appendix G&hyph;III&hyph;L)) that avoids any interference with the air balance of the cabinets or building exhaust system. Appendix G&hyph;II&hyph;D. Biosafety Level 4 (BL4) Appendix G&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;1. Standard Microbiological Practices (BL4) Appendix G&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;1&hyph;a. Work surfaces are decontaminated at least once a day and immediately after any spill of viable material.
