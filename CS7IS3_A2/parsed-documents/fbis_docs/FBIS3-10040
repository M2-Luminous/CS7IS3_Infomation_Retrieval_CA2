Rosada explained to PRENSA LATINA by telephone from Guatemala City that UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's suggested dates of 3 through 7 March for a round of talks in Mexico City was discussed with both sides. Meanwhile, the political-diplomatic representatives of the insurgent Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (URNG) said the guerrillas would not agree to hold the round of talks after 28 February. "In the presence of the United Nations we agreed with the government delegation during a meeting in Mexico on 10 January that we would formally resume the talks during the second half of February. For the URNG there is no other date," explained Luis Becker, a diplomat for the guerrillas. Nevertheless, Joe Sills, a UN spokesman, explained that the summons to a meeting presented by the United Nations to the URNG "came after negotiators from both sides were consulted." Meanwhile, Rosada said that the government always considered it counterproductive for the formal resumption of the talks (after nine months at a standstill) to coincide with the UN Human Rights Commission talks under way in Geneva. National and international humanitarian organizations attending the meeting in Switzerland are seeking formal condemnation against Guatemala for its alleged abuses against citizen freedoms. To this end, Rosada admitted that during the next Government-URNG round of talks an effort will be made to achieve a consensus on citizen prerogatives and a schedule to discuss other pending issues. Among the latter are the creation of a commission to investigate human rights violations, establishment of a cease-fire schedule, and discussion on disarmament and demilitarization. Although the Guatemalan Government and guerrillas held a preliminary meeting in Mexico City between 6 and 10 January, they have not held an official meeting since 8 May 1993, when the talks in Mexico City fell through without any agreements.
