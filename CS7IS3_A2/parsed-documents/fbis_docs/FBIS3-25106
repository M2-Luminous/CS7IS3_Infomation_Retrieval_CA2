FBIS3-25106 "drafr026_c_94004" FBIS-AFR-94-026 Document Type:Daily Report 8 Feb 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA KwaZulu Police Commissioner To Appear Before TEC MB0702154994 Johannesburg SAPA in English 1520 GMT 7 Feb 94 MB0702154994 Johannesburg SAPA Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Durban Feb 7 SAPA -- KwaZulu Police [KZP] commissioner Lt-Gen Roy During will appear before the Transitional Executive Council [TEC] on Tuesday [8 February] to supply information about alleged KZP hit squads, his lawyer confirmed on Monday. In an out-of-court settlement on Friday, it was decided Gen During would appear before the TEC in Pretoria on Tuesday afternoon. This averted Monday's planned TEC application for a Supreme Court order compelling Gen During to appear before the council, said the KZP commissioner's legal representative Patrick Falconer. Acting on the instruction's of kwaZulu Chief Minister and Police Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Gen During has until now refused to appear before the TEC. Mr Buthelezi and the kwaZulu government refuse to recognise the TEC's authority. In a statement on Monday, Mr Buthelezi said media reports stating his government had capitulated to the TEC were a "blatant misrepresentation of the facts". "Neither I nor my administration have deviated one iota from our rejection of the TEC which we regard as an undemocratic and politically biased structure which is embarking on a campaign against their political rivals." He said he had accepted the settlement based on the fact that SA Police [SAP] Commissioner Gen Johan van der Merwe had the authority to instruct Lt-Gen During as a seconded member of the SAP to appear before the TEC. "In my capacity as minister of the KZP I would not obstruct such a request by the commissioner of the SAP," said Mr Buthelezi. "Secondly, I point out that the settlement was also based on a withdrawal of the (Supreme Court) action by the TEC with each party bearing its own legal costs. This is hardly indicative of a successful suit by the TEC." Earlier, Mr Falconer explained that in terms of Friday's settlement, Gen During would appear before the TEC in his "private capacity" and not as KZP commissioner. In this way the kwaZulu government would not appear to be officially recognising the TEC. However, TEC Co-Chairman Zam Titus responded on Monday that "as far as I'm aware, that is not the situation". He could not comment further as the issue would be discussed at a meeting later on Monday. The meeting had not been concluded by early Monday evening. Gen During's expected appearance before the TEC follows a Goldstone Commission report last year on the existence of at least one KZP hit squad allegedly responsible for several murders in Natal. Five suspects -- allegedly linked to some of the murders -- have appeared in court in Mtunzini, near Empangeni, and will appear again next month.
