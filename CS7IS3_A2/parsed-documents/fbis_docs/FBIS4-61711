"On 8-9 May, 1995 the whole mankind will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the end of the World War II. The defeat of fascism meant a great victory of good forces over evil forces. But we paid a dear price for it. The war claimed over 50 million human lives. Hundreds of thousands of towns and villages were razed to the ground. Hundreds of millions of people were left without a shelter and means to live on. "There is not one family in Russia which would not be touched by the fire of that war. Our pain and sorrow will never abate, the grief of soldiers' widows will never be soothed. The tragedy of war and the happiness of victory will live in people's memory for ever. "The importance of the great victory won by joint efforts of the people of various countries cannot be tarnished even by time. One of its main lessons -- in order to defend peace, all peace-loving forces must act jointly, concertedly and actively. It is important especially now because a possibility of armed confrontation between countries still exists, blood continues to flow in civil, inter-ethnic and local conflict and the danger of the spread of weapons of mass destruction is growing. "Russia believes it is in the interests of mankind to actively help step up the role and increase the effectiveness of the United Nations -- as a pivotal element of the system of collective security -- in pursuing the lofty goal proclaimed in its charter -- `to save the succeeding generations from the scourge of war.' "Our people who bore the main burden of the World War Two and sacrificed dozens of millions of their sons and daughters to the alter of victory have been consistently opposing the settlement of disputes by force. It is our conviction that there are no such goals which could justify the unleashing of a war. The preservation of peace is the supreme goal of our state. "The Russian Federation calls on other countries -- members of the United Nations organisation, their parliaments and governments to do their best to stop the current armed conflicts and prevent new ones. "In memory of millions of people who perished in the fire of the World War Two we propose to hold, under the aegis of the United Nations organisation, broad and solemn celebrations of the 50th anniversary of the victory over the Nazi and declare 1995 the `year of memory of the victims of the World War Two.' We believe it expedient that the United Nations organisation address all nations of the world, their parliaments and governments with a call to declare 8-9 May, 1995 days without shooting. "Let the 50th anniversary of great victory give a new powerful impetus to the preservation and safeguarding of peace. Mankind must finish the 20th century and enter a new one with confidence in the future."
