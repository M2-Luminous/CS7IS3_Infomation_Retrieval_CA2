Riquelme's resignation from office as Colorado Party president, we received a message from Government House to the effect that the [Colorado Party] Executive Board would be taken over and [Second Vice President Juan Manuel] Cano Melgarejo would be named party chairman unless Riquelme tendered his resignation." Ecahgue, a member of Riquelme's faction within the party, further stated that one of the conditions for Riquelme's resignation -- imposed by Riquelme himself -- was that he would be replaced by Eugenio Sanabria Cantero, the party's first vice president. Echague concluded by saying that "the pressure exerted from Government House was the main factor determining the former president's resignation, especially if one bears in mind that ministers and high-ranking government officials were already in favor of this proposal at that time."
