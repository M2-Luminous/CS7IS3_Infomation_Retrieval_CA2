These activities proceed in the same way as drug trafficking and are therefore very hard to control. Recently, there have been many of these situations. The first took place at the Husi hospital. Aid that was brought into Romania from Germany included about eight tons of substances that fell under the category of toxic waste, substances whose expiration dates have passed or even prohibited substances. Discovered with the assistance of customs organs, the Vaslui environmental protection agency, and the police, the load was taken to the border under escort and left the territory of Romania. It was fortunate that it was identified in time, before the waste material was unloaded. Otherwise, the problem of sending it back would have been much more difficult."
