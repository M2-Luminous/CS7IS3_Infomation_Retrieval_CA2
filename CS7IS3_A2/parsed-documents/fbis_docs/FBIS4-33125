For this reason the government promoted a consensus pact with the political sectors that was joined by main enterprises a few weeks ago. Shumeyko, with a delegation of businessmen and deputies, began yesterday a three-day visit to Chile. Among other activities, he is scheduled to meet today with President Eduardo Frei, to whom he will deliver a personal message from Russian President Boris Yeltsin. Shumeyko arrived on the morning of 22 May, accompanied by his wife. He expressed optimism over the future of his country despite the economic and social problems it is currently facing. Shumeyko referred to the prospects of the Treaty to Attain Social Harmony [Tratado para el Alcance de la Concordia Social], signed on 28 April by the Russian president and 200 other politicians. He asserted: "The less fighting there is among politicians, the better it is for the economy." He added that on Friday [not further specified] the directors of the most important Russian enterprises signed the treaty. He explained the purpose of the pact, saying: "Our greatest concern now is to enjoy peace in the political arena, to establish a consensus in the political field, and to give the Russian Federation a chance to work in stability." The Russian delegation was met by Russian Ambassador to Chile Vasiliy Gromov and Mariano Fontecilla, the diplomatic coordinator of Congress, who represented Senate President Gabriel Valdes at the airport. Valdes held a private luncheon for Shumeyko and his wife at the Concha y Toro vineyards. Shumeyko said he hoped to make "important achievements" during his brief visit to Chile and to learn as much as possible about the political process and the country's economic situation. The Russian visitor said Russia and Chile have "a lot in common." He explained: "The Russian Federation is still going from a totalitarian phase to the construction of a democratic state, an open civil society." He added that Russia and Chile share celebration dates because "President Eduardo Frei was elected on 11 December while the Russian Federation's new Congress, with its two chambers, was elected and the new Russian Constitution was implemented on 12 December." Shumeyko announced that he will meet with Chilean senators and deputies with whom he hopes to tighten interparliamentary relations. He added that he hopes to increase intragovernment visits between the two countries, and to establish direct contact between Russian and Chilean businessmen. For this reason, he added, he is accompanied by Russian deputies, businessmen, and representatives of Russian corporations and banks. Shumeyko will meet tomorrow with Senate President Gabriel Valdes and acting Chamber of Deputies President Juan Carlos Latorre. In the afternoon he will meet with Finance Minister Eduardo Aninat and Planning and Coordination under Secretary Pedro Goic. Tomorrow he will meet with Santiago Mayor Jaime Ravinet; Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa, and the president of the Supreme Court Marcos Aburto. He is scheduled to lunch with businessmen at the Union Club. On Friday he will leave for Buenos Aires on a special flight. Shumeyko said he is optimistic over the future of his country although he admitted that Russia is facing difficulties in transforming a centralized economy into a free market economy. Shumeyko commented that the military industry faces difficulties because orders placed by the government have been cut to just 10 percent. He added that there are also serious problems in the agricultural sector, especially the kolkhoz and sovkhoz, the old socialist peasant organizations. Shumeyko added: "We now place emphasis on the business sector, on the private entrepreneur," adding that 40 million of the 150 million inhabitants work for enterprises that no longer belong to the state. He believes the lack of private sector statistics contributes to the somber panorama with which the Russian economy is described. He said that official data currently shows that 11 percent of the population lives under the minimum poverty level compared with 37 percent last year. "This is why we can state that currently nobody dies of hunger in Russia," he said. Shumeyko ruled out the possibility that Congress agree to bring forward the presidential elections, scheduled for June 1995, as Vice President Alexandr Rutskoy requested. "There is no room for this request. I do not think the Senate, which sets the date and calls presidential elections, will listen to Rutskoy's request to contradict the Constitution." Shumeyko said Congress and government authorities abide by the Constitution, which was amended almost six months ago. He denied that President Yeltsin grants less importance to the legislative branch which, in his opinion, plays a very important role in Russian politics. He explained that the Senate, over which he presides, has important tasks, among them approving decrees issued by the president regarding emergency issues, the use of Russian troops in foreign territory, and border problems. The Senate also approves the appointment of the attorney general and the members of the Constitutional Court and the Supreme Court. It also acts if the president resigns and is in charge of calling elections.
