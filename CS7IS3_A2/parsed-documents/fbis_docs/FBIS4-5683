The officials said a formal decision will be made by the end of this week. They said the decision is in line with a recommendation in June 1992 by the Insurance Council, an advisory panel to the finance minister. The officials said insurance companies are expected to issue their first commercial paper in May at the earliest. Insurance firms have hitherto raised necessary funds through sales of securities holdings to cover the extraordinary expenditure caused by natural disasters. They will be able to issue commercial paper to refund debentures issued by them in the past. The ministry conditionally lifted controls on commercial paper issues by leasing and consumer credit companies in June last year.
