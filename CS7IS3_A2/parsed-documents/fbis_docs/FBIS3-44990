In 1993, decisive steps were taken in the effort to reform China's economic systems, particularly in displaying the role of the market, with substantial progress being recorded in many areas. For instance, since last May, more that 90 percent of the country's counties and cities have opened their grain and oil market prices and abolished the food grain rationing system which had been in place for more than four decades. Simultaneously, price controls were lifted on iron and steel and a certain amount of coal subject to the government's unified allocation plan. In addition, the price of some crude oil was readjusted. As a result, the proportion of prices fixed by the state accounted for only 5 percent of the total retail sales volume of commodities, 10 percent of the total sales volume of farm produce, and 15 percent of the total sales volume of industrial capital goods. The gross industrial output value of the state mandatory plan dropped to around 5 percent. In line with the basic framework of the socialist market economic structure adopted during the Third Plenary Session of the 14th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held last November, China will advance reforms in a comprehensive manner and strive to make breakthroughs in some key areas during 1994. Priority will be placed on establishing a modern enterprise system; a unified, open, competitive and orderly market system; a macroeconomic control system; a rational social distribution system; and a multilayered social security system.

Reform of the Monetary System Ideas for the reform in this area include: -- Strengthening the role of the People's Bank of China as the central bank responsible for implementing monetary policies independently under the leadership of the State Council, regulating and controlling the money supply and supervising and maintaining financial order by implementing economic measures such as a reserve ratio on deposits, the lending rates of the central bank and open market operations. -- Organizing a monetary policy committee. -- Separating policy-related businesses from commercial operations, organizing the National Development Bank and Import and Export Credit Bank, reorganizing the Agricultural Bank of China, transforming existing specialized banks into commercial banks, and organizing rural and urban cooperative banks; -- Adopting modern bank management methods.

Principal measures to be introduced include: -- Replacing the current local fiscal contract responsibility system with the tax assignment system on the basis of a rational division of power between central and local authorities, and defining the categories of taxes as central, local and shared. -- Increasing the percentage of fiscal income in relation to the gross national product and the percentage of the central fiscal in come in the nation's total fiscal income. -- Introducing a double budget system, establishing a government public budget and a budget for management of state assets.

Reform of the Foreign Trade System The goal of expediting the reform of the foreign trade system is to accelerate the pace of opening to the outside world, bring China's domestic economy into line with the international economy, and enhance China's competitive capacity on the international market. The basic requirements for the reform are to unify policies, liberalize management, encourage equal competition, allow enterprises to assume responsibilities for their own profits and losses, integrate industry with trade and promote an agency system. The main measures to be adopted include: -- Transforming the management mechanisms of enterprises (chiefly those involved in foreign trade), reforming existing enterprises in line with the modern enterprise system, and energetically developing transnational industrialized comprehensive trading conglomerates. -- Improving the state's management of foreign trade by adopting measures such as exchange rates, tariffs and credit, abolishing mandatory planning for import and export commodities, and standardizing the distribution of the import and export quotas for commodities through bidding and auction. -- Lowering the general level of tariffs and constantly optimizing the structure of tariffs. -- Actively promoting the strategies of gaining a greater share of the market with quality products and developing plural markets. -- Constantly improving and perfecting a unified foreign economic legislation system, reforming the foreign exchange control system, establishing a market based floating exchange rate control system, and gradually converting the Renminbi into a convertible currency. In addition, a rational system of income distribution to individuals and a multi-layered social security system will be established according to the principles of placing priority on efficiency while taking fairness into account. Simultaneously, a large amount of meticulous work must be done to reform the scientific, technological and educational systems, and to strengthen legislation and the legal system to ensure their compatibility with a socialist market economy.
