Belarus's Joining the Ruble Zone in the Interests of the Two Countries"] [Text] The mass media have recently carried a whole series of reports on Belarus's joining the ruble zone. The agreement is regarded as extremely unfavorable to Russia. This, however, does not square with reality, to put it mildly. If only because no agreement has yet been signed and, accordingly, the terms have not been decided. There is only the intention of two friendly countries to create such a union, and its framework terms have been decided. The agreement itself, recording the basic principles for uniting the monetary systems, is still being prepared. For it is only possible to unite monetary systems if the two countries have tough, coordinated price, credit, tax, and budget policies. This also presupposes the presence of a single emission center in the united ruble zone, a switch to unified discount rates for central bank credits, and the implementation of a unified currency policy in respect of third countries. Opponents of Belarus's joining the ruble zone believe that this will have lots of highly negative consequences for the Russian economy. But is this so? We must obviously start looking for the answer by assessing Russia's strategic interests -- both economic and geopolitical. Nobody any longer disputes the existence of such interests. The question is different: Does closer economic integration with Belarus accord with these interests? It undoubtedly does. In the long term, from the viewpoint of Russia's strategic state interests, the policy of reintegration with all the CIS countries, including Belarus, is the only correct one because of a whole number of objective reasons. The most important of these is the smoothing of the consequences of the USSR's breakup in the economic sphere, which significantly deepened the crisis in all the states, including Russia. The former Union republics are the traditional market where Russia's output is competitive. Imports of raw materials and subassemblies from these countries also cannot be quickly replaced by Russian production or imports. In this sense Russia's losses from the breaking of ties clearly are not comparable with the possible expense of arranging trade and economic relations with partners in the CIS. All this, apart from Russia's dependence on imported raw materials, also applies fully to Belarus. A whole range of production facilities are concentrated there which are either absent in Russia (heavy quarry dump trucks, for example) or which produce output that is superior to analogous Russian output in terms of its technical and economic parameters (Belarus tractors). In addition, many Russian enterprises are linked with Belarusian ones by collaborative deliveries. Transit oil and gas pipelines pass over this state's territory to Europe, as do railroads and roads. Belarus has a relatively developed foreign trade infrastructure (customs, warehouses, transshipment bases), and Russia is extremely interested in using it. The provision of facilities on its own western borders is too much of a luxury, given Russia's present economic position. In addition, there have been very great losses in paying for Russian freight to transit Belarusian territory. Of course, the Belarusian market is also very large and attractive from the viewpoint of selling Russian output (and not just raw materials). It is plainly not in Russia's interests to surrender this market to other countries. Now about the negative consequences which might affect the Russian economy as a result of merging the two countries' monetary systems. These are undoubtedly possible if the mechanism of this merger is not worked out. The paramount need is to standardize economic legislation. We have already spoken of the need for a single emission center. The exchange rate for Belarusian rubles and Russian rubles is a very acute problem. It is obvious that a rate of one to one, given exchange quotations of at least three to one, will cause a sharp surge in inflation -- which will lead ultimately to negative consequences not only for Russia but also for Belarus itself. We should seek a mutually acceptable solution to the exchange rate -- a solution based on realistic assessments of the real value of Belarusian money. In this sense the exchange rate can serve only as a guideline. It does not reflect the actual correlation. As regards supplying Belarus with cash in hand, this can be done on a security. Only it should be remembered here that its terms must be acceptable to Belarus. If these requirements are fulfilled, the two countries' closer economic integration can even now ensure for Russia a definite economic gain. Since foreign economic ties are being activated, the problems of transactions and payments, which are currently exerting a highly adverse impact on our economy, will be simplified.
