On 16 February, the Chinese Government reportedly issued a protest note, accusing Thailand of violating the agreement and understanding between each other on the one-China policy and emphasizing its strong regret on the matter. The note was issued after the Taiwanese president's visit to Thailand, which took place between 14 and 16 February during which the Thai Government organized a reception in Phuket. Deputy Prime Minister Amnuai was at the reception, played golf, as well as discussed economic cooperation with the visitor. Thailand was the last leg of President Li's visit to the region. He was in the Philippines and Indonesia and was received by Presidents Fidel Ramos and Suharto despite the Chinese Government's charge that the visit would affect its relations with those countries. The Chinese Government issued two protest notes to the two countries and canceled a visit of Chinese parliamentary foreign affairs committee to those countries. The Chinese Government resorted to the same two practices vis a vis Thailand. There was a reminder from the Chinese foreign minister. The Thai Government, however, viewed the Taiwanese president's visit as private to "rest for three days to play golf." In any event, China has made an initial protest by canceling indefinitely an official visit by an NPC foreign affairs delegation, originally scheduled for 23 February-1 March. A protest note also followed. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Chuan Likphai told reporters that Thailand firmly abided by its one-China policy and that the Taiwanese president's visit would not affect that policy. He said the Thai Government should be able to practice a basic principle in the conduct of its fully independent foreign policy. China and Thailand established diplomatic relations in 1975, and Thailand ceased diplomatic relations with Taiwan, which China regards as one of its provinces. In any event, it was reported that on 16 February the king hosted a dinner for the Taiwanese president at Phuphing Palace, Chiang Mai Province. Prime Minister Chuan Likphai was present at the dinner.
