FR940208-0-00138 FR940208-0-00032 4. Section 511.11 is revised to read as follows: ยง511.11 Definitions (a) Reasonable suspicion. As used in this rule, ``reasonable suspicion'' exists if the facts and circumstances that are known to the Warden warrant rational inferences by a person with correctional experience that a person is engaged, or attempting or about to engage, in criminal or other prohibited behavior. A reasonable suspicion may be based on reliable information, even if that information is confidential; on a positive reading of a metal detector; or when contraband or an indicia of contraband is found during search of a visitor's personal effects. (b) Probable cause. As used in this rule, ``probable cause'' exists if the facts and circumstances that are known to the Warden would warrant a person of reasonable caution to believe that an offense has been committed. (c) Prohibited object. A firearm or destructive device; ammunition; a weapon or an object that is designed or intended to be used as a weapon or to facilitate escape from a prison; a narcotic drug, lysergic acid diethylamide, or phencyclidine; a controlled substance or alcoholic beverage; any United States or foreign currency; and any other object that threatens the order, discipline, or security of a prison, or the life, health, or safety of an individual. ยง511.12 [Amended] 5. In ยง511.12, paragraph (d) is amended by revising the phrase ``or is attempting to introduce'' to read ``or is introducing or attempting to introduce''.
