He said that "these reports are absolutely baseless." He added that "the contacts and talks he held with Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] in Damascus and with the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP], the PFLP-General Command, and other independent figures were aimed at finding a formula for coexistence among the Palestinian forces so as to spare the Palestinian people the internal sedition and massacre the Israelis are seeking to detonate in Gaza so that it becomes like southern Lebanon." In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, Zaki said that he was seeking during his contacts in Amman and Damascus to agree with the Palestinian parties on "a document of honor with which everyone would comply in the stage ahead." [passage omitted] Asked about the nature of the future relationship between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority, Zaki stressed that "Hamas' refusal to participate in the authority does not mean that it will not be in the self-rule institutions. The Palestinian police has welcomed it, and it too has agreed to participate in the rebuilding process." He added that the relationship with Hamas is continuing in a manner that allows agreement on specific issues such as the form and nature of the next struggle and the ability to spare the self-rule areas an internal conflict. He pointed out that, "despite Hamas' refusal to join the authority's formation, the door of dialogue is still open to it." [passage omitted] He pointed out that there is information about Israeli preparations to generate internal sedition in Gaza so that it becomes like southern Lebanon. They have been planning for that for some time." [passage omitted] Zaki said that the factions with which he met in Damascus "are convinced of the need to work to avoid Palestinian-izing the conflict." He pointed out that these factions still insist on the need to torpedo the agreement and its results. And that the talks with the factions in Damascus "focused on not harming the internal front and on continuing the democratic dialogue." [passage omitted] Concluding his statement, Zaki warned "of an approaching massacre for which the Israelis are planning." He wondered: "Should our hands remain tied?" He went on: "We have not obtained anything in order for us to change our alliances. We have obtained only 4 percent of the Yigal Allon plan. So we should not -- on the pretext that powers have been transferred to us -- play any tyrannical role. We should not fight one another. The authority should not claim that it has begun to replace its conflict with Israel with a conflict with the opposition, which, in turn, should not escape from the Israeli monster in order to fight the authority."
