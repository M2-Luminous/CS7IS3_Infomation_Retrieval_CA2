ACTION: Notice of Availability of Final Report. SUMMARY: The Task Force on Occupancy Standards in Public and Assisted Housing was established on December 31, 1992 in accordance with the provisions of section 643 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (P.L. 102&hyph;550) and the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) (5 U.S.C. App 2). The Task Force's charter was published in the Federal Register on January 7, 1993 at 58 FR 3039. The Task Force was created to review all rules, policy statements, handbooks and technical assistance memoranda issued by the Department on the standards and obligations governing residency in public and assisted housing; and make recommendations in its final report to HUD and Congress for the establishment of reasonable criteria for occupancy, so that HUD could revise its standards, regulations, and guidelines to provide accurate and complete guidance to owners and managers of federally assisted housing. The preliminary report of the task force was made available by a Federal Register Notice published on August 31, 1993, at 58 FR 45905. The public was given 60 days to submit comments on the preliminary report. This notice is to provide the public with the Executive Summary of the Report and announce the availability of the Task Force's Final Report from the Fair Housing Clearinghouse (1&hyph;800&hyph;343&hyph;3442) or (TDD) (1&hyph;800&hyph;927&hyph;9275), 1600 Research Boulevard, Rockville, Maryland 20850.

Preface_Funding and Finance Issues Throughout its deliberations and recommendations, one theme about which Occupancy Task Force members agreed was that low-income people should have more housing choices than they do at present.

The Task Force therefore proposes a number of recommendations aimed specifically at funding and cost issues. Chapter 1_The Application Process In preparing its report, the Occupancy Task Force decided that it would be more useful to begin by addressing the sequential tenancy process: the application process, occupancy and eviction. The first stage of this process, during which applicants are screened for eligibility and tenant selection criteria, is an extremely important one in that the applicants who are selected will become members of the resident community and those who are not selected will be denied the opportunity to live in federally assisted housing. Thus, the Task Force spent significant time considering the issues contained in the Application Process Chapter. In doing so, the Task Force balanced the rights of housing providers to choose residents who will fulfill their lease obligations and the rights of applicants to be chosen fairly. In addition to including the Task Force's specific recommendations, Chapter One describes the application process from start to finish in order to provide a full context for the recommendations. In particular, the application process issues addressed by the Task Force include the following:
