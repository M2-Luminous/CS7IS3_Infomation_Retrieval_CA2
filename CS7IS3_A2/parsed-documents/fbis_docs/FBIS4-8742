"I have spoken with our generals who have an insight into the situation and they told me that the Muslims have been activating remote controlled explosive devices in order to create the impression that we are shelling the town," Karadzic said. Karadzic said that new air strikes against the Serbs are possible because "despite being aware that Gorazde is a major Muslim stronghold, Washington is not satisfied by the degree of fear manifested by the Serb side." Karadzic believes that this is the reason why several (UN) monitors have been left in Gorazde after the evacuation of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] members, so that they could be used as an excuse for air strikes. Karadzic says Gorazde is no kind of "security zone" but is a military stronghold. He said the Muslims there have a full corps of about 15,000 soldiers, as a result of which the Srpska republic (of Bosnia-Herzegovina) was forced to use a full corps in order to bring Gorazde under control, he said. "The international community must finally state whether this is a protected zone or not," Karadzic believes. Butrus-Ghali also spoke about the redefining of Gorazde as a protected zone, "from which they are killing our people on a daily basis." According to him, the Muslims were much in favor of the latest offensive, which they began from the ostensible "security zone of Gorazde," in order to join together a section of territory stretching from Sarajevo, via this town, to Sandzak, and later they would seek to reestablish the same system as before the offensive. [sentence as received] "We, of course, could not permit this, and now all the villages on the right bank of the Drina are ours, and here we will form a Serb municipality of Gorazde," Karadzic said. Karadzic insists that the way out of the crisis in Gorazde is either peace or an escalation of the war in former Bosnia-Herzegovina. He confirmed again today that a political communication had been established with the UN secretary general's special envoy Yasushi Akashi and that their joint action yesterday "prevented another world war." "It is fortunate that we were together yesterday when General Rose asked for the bombing of Gorazde again because we were allegedly endangering UNPROFOR members," Karadzic explained. "Rose is very dangerous for Europe because he has disastrous assessments based on false reports he receives and then passes on." Karadzic confirmed that relations with UNPROFOR are suspended until further notice, i.e., that there will be no contacts between the Srpska republic and UN military representatives. He said that some UNPROFOR monitors had been only 500 meters away from the Serb lines near Gorazde without the knowledge of the Srpska republic army. "If they are on Muslim positions without our knowledge then we consider them to be members of Muslim units and not any kind of observers," Karadzic said. In his words, Gorazde is an opportunity for the Muslim forces to launch heavy offensive operations on other front lines, too, by taking advantage of this situation. [sentence as received] "For the Muslims the most important operations have been taking place around Gorazde, but they have also mounted offensives in Kupres, Srbobran, Teslic, Ozren, and Trebava," Karadzic said. "They have even scored some minor successes but our army has managed to eradicate all of them." The Srpska republic president also stressed that there are no hostilities as yet between units of the army of the Srpska republic and the Croat Defense Council, except in Posavina, where sporadic skirmishes have been taking place most of the time anyway. "There is some possibility of `the corridor' being cut by some operation from Croatia, in which case we would immediately declare our unification with the republic of Serb Krajina," Karadzic said. He could not confirm whether NATO forces had occupied Tuzla Airport, but he said he had reports that aircraft not belonging to UNPROFOR are landing there.
