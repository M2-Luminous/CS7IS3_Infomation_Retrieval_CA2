This present would be the most suitable for the Navy, which has somewhat under 19,000 personnel and is currently the branch of service with the largest shortfall in technical investment. Almost half of the 70 combatant units and about 60 auxiliary units have by all possible yardsticks exceeded their service lives, and, with an average age of 18 years, the shock core of the force makes the Navy of the Republic of Poland the oldest in the Baltic. In terms of personnel strength, our Navy is the third largest, behind those of Russia and the Federal Republic of Germany, but, in terms of equipment, it ranks next to last, ahead of Finland's, not counting the "pocket" navies of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. There is little prospect for any radical improvement in the situation because expansion, to say nothing of modernization, of a fleet usually takes anywhere from 10 to 20 years in view of the tremendous costs involved. And usually, as the last units of the new generation are coming into service, the first are nearing the end of their service life. The fleet modernization program that was started in 1980 was gradually put on hold as the crisis grew worse and ultimately fell victim to the draconian budget cuts of recent years. This neglect contributed to a drastic reduction in the fighting power of the Navy of the Polish Republic, as is especially evident now that we have to worry about defending our borders ourselves. In any case, the aid from our recent ally mainly took the form of deliveries of inferior-quality equipment and the imposition on us of the offensive doctrine of the Warsaw Pact. According to its precepts, a disproportionately large amphibious group numbering 40 units (23 landing craft and 17 cutters) was set up, whose mission, together with the East German Volksmarine [People's Navy] and the Baltic Fleet, was to seize the Danish Straits. Today all that is left of that impressive armada is the solitary ORP [Ship of the Polish Republic] Grunwald, but the money spent on those "amphibious forces" still haunts the remaining forces of the Polish Navy. In conformity with this same doctrine, during the latter half of the 1970's the coast guard removed the coastal artillery batteries deployed at Miedzyzdroje, Kolobrzeg, Ustka, Gdynia, Wisloujscie, Rozewie, and Hel Peninsula, and the Sopka shore-to-ship missiles that were expended were not replaced. According to the prevailing naval doctrine, a small, closed body of water such as the Baltic requires the use of fast, powerful weapon systems, as well as compact units, small submarines, enhanced mine-warfare forces, and modern naval aviation. Specialists have a saying that the best type of naval unit for the Baltic is really...an aircraft. Unfortunately, right now we can only dream of creating a real naval aviation force. No one can take seriously the sale of 30 obsolete MiG-21's and An-2 reconnaissance biplanes. The only modern element is 10 Mi-14 PL antisubmarine helicopters. Four other Mi-14's, along with four Anacondas (a variation of the famous Sokol) and several obsolete Mi-2RM's comprise the search-and-rescue flotilla. To set up a search-and-rescue station on the western coast, the need for which was forcefully demonstrated by the disaster of the ferry Jan Heweliusz, the purchase of additional Anacondas is needed. There is no chance of this, however, without special budgetary assistance, because the Navy cannot afford to maintain a naval rotary-wing search-and-rescue system on its own. In spite of the meager resources, the cooperation between the Navy and the national manufacturers of aviation equipment is good, increasing the chances of the survival of the defense plants. In the very near future, this may lead to series production of the patrol version of the An-28 Bryz, produced in Mielec, and the combat sister of the Anaconda from Swidnik, equipped for conducting antisubmarine search operations. Warships are the heart of a Navy, however. The flagship of the Polish Navy, the destroyer Warszawa, is a large unit but is equipped with basic weaponry and electronics that date back to the late 1950's. Because today it is not the calibers and numbers of the guns and missiles but, rather, the parameters of the combat electronics, the ranges of the radars, the weaponry reaction time from the instant the enemy is detected until the unit opens fire, and the resistance of the electronics to enemy jamming that are decisive as regards the combat value of a warship. Otherwise, its role is reduced to that of conducting training and ceremonial duties. The counterpart units of this warship, which was finished in 1970 as the Smielyj, have now been decommissioned from the Russian Navy. The only modern submarine (ORP Orzel) is basically too large for the Baltic, but the two other submarines and two-thirds of the missile ships are basically museum pieces. The others, despite their good speed and excellent handling characteristics, are of low fighting quality due to the purchase of substandard electronics and a shortage of specialists. The reduction in the basic military obligation for the Navy did not help at all. It takes years to train specialists in this highly technical branch of the armed forces. The now-common practice of contract-based service is turning out to be the best and most cost-effective way of professionalizing the crews. We are, however, far below the standard of, for example, the Bundesmarine [German Navy] where draftees make up only 29 percent of the personnel strength, contract personnel account for 46 percent, and 25 percent are professionals. The newest motor torpedo boat, Orkan, admittedly has a full and highly qualified crew (of 36 hands, 22 are cadre) but does not have such a basic item of weaponry as antiship missiles. The Russians do not want to supply the Urans that it had promised, we cannot afford the ones from the West, and installing the obsolete and jamming-prone Styx missiles that have been used on the other ships makes no sense, either. The complement for hunting submarines numbers 20 units "on paper." Unfortunately, 19 of these vessels are worn out or small, and, during a "surge," only two can be used to chase submarines--the Warszawa and the really substandard patrol corvette Kaszub. As far as minesweepers, or ships that are designed for clearing mines from sea lanes, are concerned, we have 25. Because they are limited to operating under sea conditions of no more than 3 on the Beaufort scale, 15 of the new vessels with nonmagnetic plastic hulls are suited for the Gdansk Bay and the Szczecin Straits rather than the high seas. Because of wear and tear and the development of mine weapons, the rest are virtually worthless. To supplement the regular minesweepers, two fishing trawlers have been adapted for mine-hunting tasks. If need be, there is the possibility of mobilizing 70 similar fishing vessels. Compared to the warships, the force of search-and-rescue, auxiliary, and special-purpose ships is relatively new and fairly well equipped. Of the Z3.8 trillion allocated this year for the purchase of equipment and weaponry for all branches of the armed forces, more than half has to go to the purchase of spare parts and the complete overhaul of equipment. The sum of Z3.8 trillion will purchase three-quarters of a submarine of the Kilo class (ORP Orzel), but the needs of the Navy are only a fraction of that amount. The services must carefully husband their resources in order to cover the costs of commissioning the motor torpedo boat Huragan and two minesweepers at about Z180 billion apiece and still put resources toward the purchase of the above-mentioned missile system. Next year, the last in the motor torpedo boat series and possibly two minesweepers will be completed. There is no way to hope for anything more than that. To be sure, consideration was being given to the possibility of immediately making up for the shortfalls through the purchase, if available, of East German corvettes, but the Germans torpedoed the deal by inflating the price and, subsequently, some of the ships were sold to Indonesia. Since the change in the geopolitical situation, there is no longer any pressure to rely on the services of a single exporter, the former Soviet Union. The switch to calculating in dollars, quality that is below world standards, and the inability to guarantee the continuity of deliveries of spare parts for equipment that is already in use are making the CIS [Commonwealth of Independent States] a less than reliable partner. In view of the high prices, it does not appear feasible to import finished warships from the highly developed countries. A kilogram of warship minus combat equipment and electronics, costs more than 100 German marks [DM]. The price for one kilogram of this kind of equipment exceeds DM7,000. The national shipyards (Polnocna, Marynarki Wojennej, Wisla) have the appropriate experience and, in the absence of orders, could immediately pick up the construction of the warships needed by the fleet, except for submarines. Even if resources were unexpectedly allocated to a program for modernizing the naval forces, given the current traditional structure that has resulted in a collection of highly specialized, obsolete warships and replacing them with new ones would take at least several years. Possibly the way out of the situation would be to look to the Danish experiments. Faced with the necessity of replacing a large portion of the Danish Navy, instead of designing new types of traditional warships, they shifted away from the previous approach and decided to limit the number and variety of ships without reducing the capabilities of the naval defense forces in the process. This was accomplished by building a series of all-purpose Standard Flex warships that can, in a few hours, alter their functions by installing modular containers holding items of equipment and weaponry. Depending on what is needed, a ship can operate as a patrol vessel, a search-and-rescue unit, a pollution-control vessel, a missile unit, a subchaser, a minelayer, and a minesweeper. For a country that has scarce budget resources and a relatively small fleet, this approach is virtually ideal. However, even in the event that the national shipyards are commissioned to build the ships, if we dreamed of owning ships of close to world-class level, there is no getting away from importing the electronic-warfare equipment. The country produces modern radars, good sonars of the Flaming series, and highly accurate Szop navigation gear (accurate to within 0.5 meter), but these are only a few of the items that are needed. The situation is worse with regard to weaponry because, for example, the Wrobel surface-to-air missile-artillery system has a long reaction time, on the order of tens of seconds, and can be used only against a target that has already launched an attack and is flying away. The Russian "last chance" guns currently in use are not economical, and Western ones (for example, the Goalkeeper, firing 4,200 rounds a minute, with a reaction time of 1 second) are excessively expensive. Work on the Polish Nawalnik was halted four years ago due to a shortage of funds. How can we think of modernizing the fleet when there is not even enough money for fuel? The destroyer Warszawa has an engine with an output of 94,000 horsepower, or the same as 1,150 1.5-liter Polonaise cars. Sailing "100" [kilometers] at cruising speed requires 11 tons of fuel; at top speed it takes 36 tons. To be sure, Polish warships did take part this year in joint maneuvers with NATO units and in several of their own exercises, such as "Reda" and "Rekin," but this does not change the fact that the number of training cruises was cut back considerably. A sailor can gain skills through "dry-fire" training on shore-based simulators, but knitting a crew into a unified team can be done only over the course of long hours at sea. It should therefore come as no surprise that achieving combat readiness now takes not just hours but also dozens of hours, and units that are sent out after the unidentified submarines that appear from time to time in Polish waters return empty-handed.
