Chairmen Kim U-chung of the Daewoo Business Group, Cho Sok-nae of Hyosung Group, Ku Pyong-hoe of Lucky-Goldstar Group and concurrently head of the Korea Foreign Trade Association (KFTA), and Chang Chi-hyok of Kohap Group, as well as presidents of smaller businesses -- Wang Ho-sang of Dongho International and Kim Yun-sik of Shindong Enercom Inc. -- will arrive separately in Moscow but travel aboard the president's plane to Uzbekistan due to poor air transportation there. It is the first time for businessmen to travel with Kim on his chartered plane. "We weren't planning to invite businessmen on this tour, but we finally decided to include six businessmen whose companies have made inroads in Russia and Uzbekistan to attend only economy-related events there at the request of the two countries," a Chongwadae (presidential office) official said. Just as some businessmen arrived separately to attend economy-related functions during Kim's visits to Japan and China, the business representatives will only take part in these events, he said.
