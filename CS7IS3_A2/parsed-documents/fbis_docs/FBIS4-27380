This visit is an extention of thse I made to the United States, Japan, and China over the past year. These countries have a very important influence on the stability and peace of the Korean peninsula. When I visited these countries, I stressed to their government leaders and people the need for their cooperation for peace on the Korean peninsula and won their support. Now I am going to visit Russia in order to conclude the quadrilateral diplomacy that I have sought for stability and peace of the Korean peninsula since I assumed office. In summit talks with President Yeltsin, I will sincerely [chinjihage] discuss the issue of peace in East Asia, security of the ROK, and economic cooperation needed by both countries. Particularly at this point of time, when the solution to North Korea's nuclear issue is urgently required, it is very significant to develop closer relations with Russia. This visit will be an occasion to confirm that the Cold War era between the ROK and Russia has clearly ended. During my visit at the Russian Federal Council and Moscow University, I will appeal to Russian politicians and young people, who face difficulties in a transitional period, to advance toward building a great Russia without giving up their hopes and dreams. Russia is vast and very rich in natural resources. Therefore, it has boundless potential for development. On the other hand, Uzbekistan is in a stable situation and rich in natural resources. Therefore, it is a country with many possibilities for economic cooperation with our country. In the summit talks with President Karimov, I will deeply discuss the issue of the advance of our enterprises into this country. In Uzbekistan, there are as many as 200,000 Korean residents who are descendents of people who were forcibly relocated from the Maritime Province of Siberia to Central Asia. I will meet these compatriots and console them. I will also discuss the matter of promoting their rights and interests. On my way back home, I will also visit the Russian Pacific Fleet in Vladivostok, where I would like to experience [silgam] the changes in ROK-Russia relations along with our people. Dear fellow countrymen, while in Russia, I will promise to establish constructive and complementary partnership [konsolchogigo sangho powanjogin tongbanja kwangye] with it towards the 21st century. With this as a momentum, our country will establish firm cooperative relations with the major countries around the Korean peninsula -- the United States, Japan, China, and Russia -- not only in security, but in economics. We should open the Asia-Pacific era of the 21st century with these four countries. Our nation's destiny was decided by these four countries 100 years ago. However, our current effort to strengthen friendly and cooperative relations with them contains the positive meaning [chokkukchok uimi] that we will explore our destiny ourselves. Our compatriots are evenly distributed in these four countries. Our position has greatly changed. As a result, we can discuss world issues with the four countries, and they also need our country's cooperation and coordination [chojong]. What is most important to us now is for people to achieve internal unity and accord, to develop the national destiny with that unity, and to increase the country's competitive strength with all our efforts. We have no time to pause for energy-consuming conflict. I, as president, will go even to the ends of the earth to do my best where our country's security and interests are concerned. Dear fellow countrymen, your encouragement will give me courage and strength during my trip. I wish you good health and fortune while I am away briefly. Thank you very much.
