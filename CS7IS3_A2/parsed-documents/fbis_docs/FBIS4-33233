Anything that infers a disavowal of the independence of one of those branches is against the Constitution. Second -- We reaffirm, now and always, the judicial branch's independence and ability to act in accordance with the exclusive authority the Constitution assigns to it. We praise the respect and observance used to express disagreement with one of its decisions which, although debatable, must not be attacked by turning the public against the institution that dictated it, as has been done by certain government officials whom the Constitution and the law have not given such attributes. Third -- The Constitution includes its reform and the mechanisms to be used to this end. Institutional stability is not furthered when each time an authorized judicial branch official makes a decision that does not satisfy certain interests, proposals to change the Constitution are made so as to invalidate the decision. [Signed] Constitutional Court President Jorge Arango Mejia, Council of State President Amado Gutierrez, and Prosecutor General of the Republic Gustavo de Greiff Restrepo.
