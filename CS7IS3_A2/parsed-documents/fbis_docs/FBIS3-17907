[Word indistinct] results of the election will probably not be made public until Wednesday, the general outcome is known. Our correspondent reported that (?so far) 12 deputies to the Crimean parliament were elected in single-seat districts. The Russia bloc, supported by 77 percent of the electorate, became the unquestioned leader in multiseat districts, where the elections were based on party preference. (?Most of) the 14 legislative seats earmarked for parties were won by this bloc. The Communists can count on only one or two seats in the Crimean parliament; as little as 11 percent of the electorate voted for them. In the Crimean Tatar national electoral districts, most of the seats were garnered by candidates proposed by the kurultay [congress of all Tatars], who won the support of 89 percent of the constituency. Representatives of the displaced Crimean people are allocated 14 out of a total 98 seats in the Crimean Supreme Soviet.
