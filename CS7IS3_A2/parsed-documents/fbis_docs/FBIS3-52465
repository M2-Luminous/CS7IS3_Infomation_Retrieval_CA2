In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT yesterday, Dhunaybat said: This matter has become just an excuse. The fact is that there is nothing but a number of options which some thought should be studied, but they were not presented as a proposal. He added: Every brother has a right to make suggestions and to think, but the option of dissolving the group and replacing it with a political party was never proposed. Dhunaybat played down the dismissal of Ziyad Abu-Ghunaymah from the group, pointing out that he was dismissed for reasons of misconduct. Abu-Ghunaymah had been dismissed from the group while on a visit to the United States but he remained an IAF member. A new IAF executive bureau, Shura Council chairman, and secretary general are due to be elected today. Dhunaybat had earlier denied that the group had nominated anyone for the parliamentary elections held recently.
