FR941205-0-00111 FR941205-0-00026 DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Fish and Wildlife Service 50 CFR Part 17 RIN 1018&hyph;AB97 Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Endangered Status for Three Hawaiian Plant Species of the Genus Melicope AGENCY: Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) designates endangered status pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act), for three plants in the genus Melicope (alani): M. adscendens, M. balloui, and M. ovalis. All three species are endemic to the slopes of Haleakala on the island of Maui, Hawaiian Islands. The three plant species and their habitats have been variously affected or are currently threatened by habitat degradation and damage to plants by feral and domestic animals (cattle and/or pigs), and/or by competition for space, light, water, and nutrients by naturalized, introduced vegetation. Due to the small number of existing individuals and their very narrow distributions, these species and their populations are vulnerable to reduced reproductive vigor and/or an increased likelihood of extinction from stochastic events. This final rule implements the Federal protection and recovery provisions provided by the Act. EFFECTIVE DATE: January 4, 1995. ADDRESSES: The complete file for this final rule is available for public inspection, by appointment, during normal business hours, at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Pacific Islands Office, 300 Ala Moana Boulevard, Room 6307, P.O. Box 50167, Honolulu, Hawaii 96850. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert P. Smith, Field Supervisor, at the above address (808/541&hyph;2749). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Melicope adscendens, M. balloui, and M. ovalis, members of the citrus family (Rutaceae), are endemic to the slopes of Haleakala on the island of Maui, Hawaiian Islands. The island of Maui comprises remnants of two large shield volcanoes, the older West Maui Volcano on the west and the larger and much younger Haleakala Volcano on the east. These two volcanoes and the connecting isthmus formed by lava flows make up an island 1,888 square kilometers (sq km) (729 sq miles (mi)) in area. Haleakala, on East Maui, erupted just 200 years ago and has an elevation of 3,055 meters (m) (10,023 feet (ft)). Haleakala still retains its classic shield shape and has somewhat less diverse vegetation than the older and more eroded West Maui Mountains. Rainfall on Haleakala averages about 890 centimeters (cm) (350 inches (in)) per year, with the mountain's windward (northeastern) slope receiving the most precipitation. However, Haleakala's inner crater is a dry cinder desert because it is above the level at which precipitation develops and is sheltered from moisture-laden winds (Gagne and Cuddihy 1990). Melicope adscendens occurs in Nestegis sandwicensis (Olopua) Lowland Mesic Forest. This vegetation type, which includes co-dominant Pleomele auwahiensis (hala pepe), now exists as scattered patches, much of the original area having been converted to pasture land. This forest occurs between the elevations of 30 and 1,600 m (100 and 5,250 ft). Rain falls mostly from October to March, and substrates are well-drained. Melicope balloui and M. ovalis occur in Acacia koa/Metrosideros polymorpha (Koa/'Ohi'a) Montane Wet Forest. This plant community occurs between the elevations of 1,200 and 2,200 m (3,900 and 7,200 ft). Annual rainfall is over 2,500 millimeters (mm) (98 in) and is evenly distributed throughout the year. The climate is warm, and frequent afternoon fog often results in fog drip. Substrates are volcanic with well developed soil. This is a highly stratified community, comprising, in order of canopy height: koa (up to 40 m tall); 'ohi'a (up to 30 m tall); several native tree species (10 to 20 m tall); Cibotium (hapu'u) (understory canopy); and shrubs, herbs, ferns, and mosses (shade-tolerant understory) (Gagne and Cuddihy 1990; Hawaii Heritage Program (HHP) 1992a, 1992c, 1992d, 1992f). The only known extant population of Melicope adscendens and one of two populations of M. balloui are located on privately owned land. The only known extant population of M. ovalis and the second population of M. balloui are in Haleakala National Park, which is owned by the Federal Government (HHP 1992a, 1992c, 1992d, 1992f).
