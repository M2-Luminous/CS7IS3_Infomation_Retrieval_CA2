GaAs MMIC is desirable for high frequency applications in which high output and high effective power are needed such as mobile and satellite communications. For these reasons, the gate pattern is narrowed from 0.5 �m to 0.35 �m. The characteristics which made it possible to succeed with 0.35 �m level phase shift exposure technology are: /m(1) Employment of shifter with sharp edge formation /m(2) Optimization of shifter placement /m(3) Optimization of image reversal resist process By employing an edge model phase shifter, when the shifter is in position (figure 1(a)), it reverses the light phase on the mask, and the phase shift of oscillation width of passing light is reversed at the right and left of the shifter edge (figure 1 (b)). When this image is formed on a wafer, light intensity at the shifter edge becomes almost zero (figure 1 (c)), and a minute dark area is transferred as a pattern, thus a 0.35 �m pattern is formed. In optimization of shifter formation and shifter placement, the width of the shifter was set to over 5 �m on the mask, thickness of the shifter was set 4000 +/- 450 Angstroms, and the angle of shifter edge was set 90 +/- 20 �, so that asymmetrical pattern due to aberrations of projection lens was controlled. Also although traditionally in formation of high output GaAs MMIC gate electrodes, recess etching in active layer, gate metal vapor adhesion, and recess model gate by a lift off process using an organic solvent were employed, a resist pattern process, which works well for formation of overhang as well as an effective organic solvent, were needed. For this reason a reverse image resist process, which can obtain a negative in order to form a minute small dark area by edge model phase shift, was developed. Formation of a stable 0.35 �m level recess gate was realized. In this process, tolerance of over 2 �m focus is obtained in pattern dimensions of 0.35 +/- 0.05 �m, and the value for the dimensions is 3 _s_ � 0.03�m which is quite comfortable for mass production.
