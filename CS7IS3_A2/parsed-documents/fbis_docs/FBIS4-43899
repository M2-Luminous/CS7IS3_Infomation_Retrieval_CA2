At a hearing of representatives from the German arms industry, Ruehe said in the Bundestag Defense Committee on Thursday [23 June] that in view of the armed forces in Europe becoming increasingly multinational, it is neither sensible nor worthwhile for states to make single-handed efforts at equipping their armies with modern material. The minister demanded that minimum capacities be preserved in the German defense industry. Ludolf von Wartenberg, the main manager of the Federal Association of German Industry (BDI), demanded that the arms industry be given security of planning and a "clear orientation." The committee agreed that a "defense technology basis" must be preserved in Germany. Ruehe pointed out that the German arms industry must maintain its capacities for the construction of aircraft, helicopters, tanks, submarines, for the production of modern ammunition, and in the field of electronics for modern weapons. The minister said Europe simply cannot afford several competing weapons systems of the future generation. All countries need fewer and different weapons, and they have less money and over capacities in the arms industry. According to Ruehe, almost 100,000 people in Germany have lost their jobs in the arms industry since the beginning of this decade. The current employment figure of some 140,000 could be further reduced by 30,000 to 40,000. In order to keep the Bundeswehr modern and operational, a sound relationship between operating costs and investment is necessary, Ruehe emphasized. The share of investments in the defense budget, which has dropped to almost 20 percent, must be increased toward 30 percent again. The German armed forces must cut down on personnel costs and use all possibilities of rationalization. The crisis reaction forces must be given priority with equipment. The deficit is to be removed gradually in this field, Ruehe said.
