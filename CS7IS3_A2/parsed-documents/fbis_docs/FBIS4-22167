Official Bonn Insists on It"] [Text] Berlin -- Soviet and Russian troops have been on German territory for almost half a century. Our last soldier will leave the now-united country 31 August this year, and a major military grouping that had once been abroad will return home. Many Western politicians, particularly in the FRG, are calling this a historic event, linking it to the end of the "Cold War." And they are right. Units of what was then the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany took part in the Berlin events of 1953 and 1961, went into Prague in August 1968.... At the same time, the almost 50-year presence of this military grouping in central Europe has been a deterrent. The same politicians are right to link peace on the European continent with the presence in Germany of the Western Group of Forces [WGF].... Thus, a dignified withdrawal of Russian troops from Germany is a matter of prestige for our country which enhances still further its authority in Europe and the world (particularly following our diplomatic successes in Yugoslavia). Speaking at a Berlin press conference at the end of last year, Colonel General M. Burlakov, commander in chief of the WGF, made public the Russian proposals for the ceremonial send-off, which, as he put it, had been submitted to the Russian president. They included two stages -- April-May (memorial to our fallen servicemen) and August (ceremonial assembly in Berlin of an honor guard made up of Russian and allied troops and the Bundeswehr, a march, a ceremonial Reichstag session with the participation of the two states' leaders, and a "roundtable" for World War II veterans).... The commander-in-chief then advised that the German leadership had not reacted in any way to these proposals, which had previously been conveyed to the German side. Last March I talked with Defense Minister Army General P. Grachev. Holding talks with his colleague (FRG Defense Minister V. Ruehe) he noted that the question of the send-off ceremony for the Russian troops comes under the jurisdiction of the two leaders -- President Yeltsin and Chancellor Kohl. Until recently official Bonn in its discussion of the Russian troop send-off had restricted itself to bland diplomatic formulas. The Berlin Senate was quite definite and did not indulge in any diplomatic equivocation in insisting on separate send-offs for the Russian and allied troops -- from the United States, Britain, and France. Although the last WGF soldier will leave Germany "quietly" 31 August, the allies can expect a triumphant send-off in Berlin in early September. The Berlin Senate's statement began to feature in the FRG newspapers, and was disseminated, with some confusion, by world news agencies.... An attempt was being made for the umpteenth time to put Russia in its place and silence it. And by whom -- the Berlin Senate! Was it right to resolve on behalf of the federal government political problems that are of European and world rather than municipal importance?... Unfortunately, the Russian Foreign Ministry, our Bonn Embassy, and its Berlin office failed to react at all to the Berlin Senate's move. As subsequent events were to show, this was wrong. At a Bonn press conference in late March Chancellor Kohl voiced his version (now the official version) of the allied troops' send-off from Germany. It differs little from the Senate version. The French Foreign Ministry, by insisting on a parade, forced Bonn to abandon its intention to give the allied troops a modest send-off from Berlin. Now the chancellor has promised our World War II allies a triumphant send-off ceremony with a military parade, banners, and music.... Explaining this sudden decision, H. Kohl stated that it was the logical conclusion to the stormy debates about the send-off to be given to the allied troops who had for 50 years guaranteed the preservation of the status of West Berlin.... What about the Russian troops? Bonn is insisting on a "quiet" send-off far from Berlin, at WGF Headquarters in Wuensdorf. Whereas the allied send-off will end, for instance, with a ceremony of mourning at the Brandenburg Gates, no such ceremony is envisaged for the Russian troops. I would recall that in the Berlin Operation our forces lost over 300,000 men. And it would be blasphemous not to pay our respects to them one last time. The German capital is going further in its division into worthy and less worthy. The allied ceremony on 8 September will be addressed by Presidents Bill Clinton and Francois Mitterrand, and by Prime Minister John Major. The Russian president and the federal chancellor will speak 31 August at the memorial to the Soviet troops in Treptow. ...Europe is no longer the way it was in the fifties and sixties, at the height of the "Cold War." There will be no return to a past which brought the peoples to the brink of a dangerous confrontation. History cannot be rewritten to suit short-term interests. People are in agreement on that in both East and West. But, on the other hand, how can we understand the Bonn authorities' decision to have separate send-off ceremonies for the World War II allies, dividing them into worthy and unworthy, and essentially revising this same history?
