At its session in Spindleruv Mlyn, east Bohemia, the ODS Executive Council decided to work out a "post-transformation" bill aimed at the regulation and termination of the restitution and compensation process in the Czech Republic. The left-leaning paper quotes Kalvoda as saying on his return from a Latin American trip on Monday: "If it (the bill) is a broad agreement on terminating restitution and settling controversial questions between coalition parties, then I support it strongly, in a general sense." At the same time, Kalvoda noted that it was the ODA which had already pronounced the words "the final point of restitution" a few months ago. RUDE PRAVO also quotes Josef Lux, chairman of another government coalition party, the Christian Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-CSL), as saying at a press conference on Monday [21 March] that his party, along with the ODA and the last coalition member, the Christian Democratic Party (KDS), clearly defined and presented the idea of concluding restitution some time ago. In view of this, Lux welcomes the Saturday [19 March] resolution by the ODS Executive Council to work out legislation on the issue. However, Lux admitted that the stances of the ODS and the KDU-CSL on the conclusion of restitution may differ, the daily writes. Lux confirmed that within a week, the cabinet, where he holds the post of agriculture minister, should discuss the KDU-CSL proposal that the government decide on the transfer of state property to churches and religious communities. Reacting to a remark by RUDE PRAVO that the ODS seems to have a negative stance towards this question, Lux responded that only the vote in the government would be decisive. He would not raise such a proposal if he saw no chance for its passage, he said. At the close of the report, RUDE PRAVO quotes KDS Chairman Ivan Pilip as saying to CTK on Monday that the ODS's views are becoming closer to the views of the KDS.
