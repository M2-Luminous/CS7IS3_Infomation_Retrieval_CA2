So far, the opposition United People Alliance has won 24 seats and the official Democratic Alliance has won 19. According to preliminary returns, Democratic Revolutionary Party [PRD] candidates have won 21 seats in the legislature, while its allies, the Liberal Republican Party and Labor Party, won two seats and one seat, respectively. Another 12 seats are still being disputed, 11 of them between PRD and Arnulfist Party [PA] candidates. With 68 percent of the votes counted -- some 733,885 valid votes -- the PA has won 12 seats; the Liberal Party has won three; the Authentic Liberal Party has won three; and the Independent Democratic Union [UDI] has won one. The Change '94 coalition, which supported the candidacy of former Comptroller General Ruben Carles, has won 8 legislative seats -- five by Nationalist Liberal Republican Movement (Molirena) candidates and three by candidates from the Civic Renewal Party. The legislative elections also resulted in the surprising defeat of the National Renewal Movement, which, despite its costly advertising campaign, failed to win a single seat. TE projections show that even Marco Ameglio, former president of the parliament, failed to get reelected. The Christian Democratic Party was dealt the harshest blow during the elections, winning only one legislative seat, thereby losing the relative majority obtained in the 1989 elections with 28 legislators. Ruben Blades' Papa Egoro Movement [MPE] won six seats, and the Solidarity Party [PS] won one seat. TE President Eduardo Valdes said projections show the PRD could win 11 more seats and the PA could win one. "From that total, 11 seats might go to the PRD and one to the PA," Valdes indicated. He stated, however, that the Molirena, UDI, PS, or the MPE might win one of the 11 seats that are virtually in the hands of the PRD.
