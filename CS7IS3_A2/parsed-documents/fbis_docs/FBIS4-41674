He was speaking before his meeting in Moscow with the Commander-in-Chief of NATO's allied forces in Europe George Joulwan. "They are political red-brown bastards who want to plunge Russia into isolation again. They need an enemy", Kozyrev said. He said that Russia would in any case take a decent place in the world and would most probably hold a joint military exercise with the United States. "We've got nothing to be afraid of. On the contrary, a refusal would be tantamount to sticking one's head in the sand", he said About the conflict in the Balkans Kozyrev said that uneasy calm had been established there and that it was still fraught with a slide into World War III. He said that the "parties of war" in the Balkans were trying to win support from the great powers and as a matter of fact provoking a collision between them. Kozyrev said that Russia was for addressing both sides with a firm demand to observe peace without giving preferences to either of them. "Those traitors in the Duma who demand supporting one of the parties thereby push us into a war with the United States. "Apparently they would like to fish in troubled waters, just as was the case in 1917, and Mr Ziuganov seeks to outdo his predecessor".
