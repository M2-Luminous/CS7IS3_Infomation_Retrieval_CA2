FBIS4-14011 "drnes080dd_94006" FBIS-NES-94-080 Daily Report 25 Apr 1994 Palestinian Affairs Palestinian Manifesto Attacks PLO, 'Arafat Palestinian Manifesto Attacks PLO, 'Arafat TA2504143394 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew 1400 GMT 25 Apr 94 TA2504143394 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el Hebrew BFN [Text] A group of 23 Palestinian leaders from the territories, led by Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi, today issued a manifesto expressing opposition to the concessions they say the PLO is making in the negotiations with Israel. The public statement says that any agreement which legitimizes Israel's unilateral and illegal actions in the territories -- such as the expropriation of lands, establishment of settlements, and the annexation of East Jerusalem -- will not bind the Palestinian people and its national institutions. At a Jerusalem news conference, 'Abd-al-Shafi, who headed the Palestinian delegation to the negotiations with Israel, attacked the PLO and 'Arafat. He claimed that they are cut off from what is happening on the ground and that the Palestinian people will pay a heavy price for their mistakes. He also demanded democratization of the PLO and for the entire Palestinian people to be involved in deciding on the composition of its institutions. Our correspondent Ron Nesi'el adds that among those who signed the manifesto are Ghassan al-Khatib and Dr. Mamduh al-'Akar, who participated in the Palestinian delegation to the Washington talks.
