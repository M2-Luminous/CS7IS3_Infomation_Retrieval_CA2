Closing the academic year at the War School in this coastal town north of Rome, he said planned armed forces reform should be followed quickly by the financial decisions needed to put them into effect. Two draft bills are currently pending before parliament to reform the armed forces' legislative framework and organisation, above all, by creating more streamlined command structures and admitting greater reliance on volunteers. "More quality and less quantity makes sense if you make new investments as well as making cuts," said Previti, "but if you just cut, the result is simple reductions which, in the long term, are harmful." In his first meeting with the army's top echelons, Previti, whose expertise in the defence field derives in part from a stint as a top executive at Alenia, the public-sector aerospace and defence contractor, urged the government to make adequate investments to give "new impetus to the indispensable process of renewal and modernisation" in the armed forces. "Without this," he pointed out, "it makes no practical sense to talk about a new defence model and role for Italy on the international scene so that it can make its due contribution to peace and security." He also told his audience that increasingly frequent international security commitments had been a great drain on defence funds as well as accelerating the wear and tear on equipment. Previti also said he would be working for a mix of national servicemen and volunteers, even if the armed forces are reduced in size as planned. He added that the draft could only be shortened substantially if sufficient national servicemen serve the draft and investments for the armed forces' qualitative growth materialise.
