In April, President Goncz referred the law to the Court for rulings on two aspects: The limit on the amount of land to be purchased by Hungarian individuals, and the distinction between companies and private individuals. The Court decided that setting an upper limit on the amount of farmland which can be purchased by Hungarian private individuals is not unconstitutional. However, it also ruled that the limit must be of temporary validity. The Court also approved the section of the law which excludes the purchase of farmland by foreign individuals and companies. This, it argues, is justified by the average price of Hungarian farmland, which is rather low by international standards. Banning Hungarian companies from purchasing farmland is in line with the Constitution, the Court declared. The reason is that individuals could otherwise set up a large number of companies expressly for the purpose of buying land. Thus they could acquire large tracts of land escaping the upper limit. Under the law, the maximum amount of farmland that can be purchased by Hungarian individuals is 300 hectares or 6,000 golden crowns. Foreign individuals are only allowed to purchase farmsteads with less than 6,000 square metres of land. Although Hungarian companies are not allowed to buy farmland, they may lease up to 2,500 hectares or 50,000 golden crowns. Foreign companies and individuals are allowed to lease up to 300 hectares or 6,000 golden crowns of farmland.
