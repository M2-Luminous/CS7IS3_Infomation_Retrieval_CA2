His commentary came to answer the interviewer's question whether the enhanced status Bulgaria will be granted on May 9 will provide greater security. Commenting on the Council of Europe (CE) Committee of Ministers presidency this country will take over on May 11, Foreign Minister Daskalov said it is a great responsibility and a prestige. "Bulgaria will be the first post-communist country to take the steering wheel of the Committee for a 6-months term," he said. During its tenure, Bulgaria will seek to further all major activities of the CE and particularly those implementing the decisions of the October 1993 summit in Geneva. Asked whether Bulgaria's internal instability affects his international political contacts, the Foreign Minister said this country remains true to its foreign policy principles in spite of the domestic instability and that over the recent year it proved to have a clear orientation and priorities.
