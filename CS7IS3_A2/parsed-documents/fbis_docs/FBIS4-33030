[Abreu] I believe it is the other way round. We have a positive view of Mercosur... [Ruiz] What are you basing... [Abreu] In a world that requires a gradual opening, with greater competitivity, it is significantly unfavorable for us to remain enclosed or isolated. Mercosur is a potential market of 200-million inhabitants. [Ruiz] Why then are we hearing so many warnings about the risks involved in Mercosur? [Abreu] There are two basic pillars we have to handle together: democracy and integration. Uruguay's Mercosur strategy is -- and I will stick to the words of Enrique Iglesias, a former Uruguayan foreign minister and current IDB [Inter-American Development Bank] president -- first, Mercosur; second, Mercosur; and third, Mercosur. [Ruiz] Do you believe Uruguay and Paraguay are unable to influence the two giants, Argentina and Brazil, which are apparently engulfing everything ...? [Abreu] Quite the contrary! Quite the contrary! We have the same possibilities as the smaller countries in the EU, despite all the differences ... [Ruiz] Not long ago, the newspapers seriously discussed the possibility of Uruguay withdrawing from Mercosur ... [Abreu] Uruguay is not linked to the possibility of withdrawing from Mercosur ... [Ruiz] This issue was discussed at length here in Asuncion ... [Abreu] Quite the contrary. Uruguay's stance involves confirming and strengthening Mercosur ... You must know that it is quite different to have four countries talking to other economic blocs than to have countries talking separately, especially if they involve Uruguay and Paraguay ... The president of the Republic issued a public denial ... [Ruiz] Why are importers against Mercosur? [Abreu] Of course, there are economic circles that will not be favored by a comprehensive strategy. Integration involves an adjustment process. It is a process marked by growing pains. It is very important here to handle conflicts and traumas ... [Ruiz] It will not be possible to achieve a zero common external tariff by 1 January 1995. What is your opinion? [Abreu] We are not so pessimistic. Uruguay does not believe the schedule should be moved back. The common external tariff as it is must be negotiated, but must be implemented ... [Ruiz] For Paraguay, a landlocked country, there is a key point, namely freight, the waterway. Some people fear the River Plate tolls to be collected by Argentina and Uruguay will increase freight ... [Abreu] As projected, the waterway links Puerto Caceres with Nueva Palmira. It is necessary to seek a sea outlet from Nueva Palmira. The channels will be dredged: the Martin Garcia Channel in Uruguay and the Mitre Channel in Argentina. Private companies will carry out the dredging and will charge a toll to recover their investment, but only for large ships. This toll will not apply to normal waterway transportation ...
