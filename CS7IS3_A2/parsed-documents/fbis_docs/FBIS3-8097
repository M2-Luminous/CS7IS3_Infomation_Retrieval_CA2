As we were told by prosecutor Ryszard Kucinski, who is leading the investigation, these are, for the time being, proceedings in a case and not against any specific people. The prosecutor's office decided to begin an investigation only after two months from the date that the Confederation of Republicans tabled a formal notice regarding the crime. In the opinion of the confederation, the price of the Bank Slaski shares had been seriously lowered and the Treasury had been the loser. A second motion asking for an investigation was tabled on 26 January by the Inspection Office of the Stocks Commission. This motion concerned the possible overestimate of the market price of shares at the first two sessions. Another line of investigation is to answer the question of how the process of setting the share price was carried out.
