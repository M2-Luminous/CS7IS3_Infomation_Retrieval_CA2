Does this not also mean that they decide on the role Germany will play in the future in the family of peoples, in the United Nations, in NATO? [Kinkel] Of course, they decide on that. Since we failed to reach a political agreement in the Bundestag on amending the Basic Law, now, unfortunately, the Federal Constitutional Court has to decide. At the end of the day, I am glad about it, because we will finally get a decision. [Mueck] If the Court comes up with a narrow interpretation, Germany's desire to get a seat on the UN Security Council would then be impossible to fulfill. [Kinkel] Well, I assume and hope that the decision will be positive, and that it will be a decision that will serve our foreign and security policy. As far as the Security Council seat is concerned, I believe that we could only get the seat after we had become fully capable of taking action, that is to say after we become able to participate in out-of-area missions. [Mueck] One will then hardly be able to decide on actions in which one is unable to participate oneself. [Kinkel] That is right, that is what I meant before. [Mueck] You have said that you hope that the judges will not produce an interpretation that is too narrow. Yet, would it not be better if they did, because then the pressure might be greater to amend the Basic Law? [Kinkel] We cannot have a Basic Law amendment at the moment, because the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] will not support it, but is obstructing the process. We need a two-thirds majority, which is why I do not see any chance in the foreseeable future. Yet, we need a solution fast. This is why I am hoping for the decision of the Federal Constitutional Court. In the election campaign I will of course clearly and outspokenly refute the SPD when it says that there is no difference to the coalition government in terms of foreign policy. This issue shows the most decisive difference, and it has to be emphasized; besides, the SPD is finding it difficult to make others believe what it says here; just look at Scharping's visit to Washington. [Mueck] You yourself said recently that, in the future, Germany would more often say yes than no. Is there not the danger again -- and the German defense minister warned against it today -- of Germany embarking on a course leading back to isolation, new nationalism, special status? [Kinkel] No, no. First of all, one has to say that the Bundeswehr has participated in all kinds of missions. Three such missions are to be the topic of this court procedure: Somalia, AWACS, and the Adriatic. Besides, we participate in the air drops and in the relief flights to Sarajevo; we are observers for the CSCE, and are engaged in many other spheres. One cannot say that the Bundeswehr does not do anything. In the humanitarian sphere, particularly as far as Yugoslavia is concerned, we are leading -- thank God. No, I do not see any danger of isolation. Our practice of being cautious -- I have said that in my statement today. Of course, we will have to say no much more often than yes in the future. This will not change. After all, I pointed out the high number of missions the United Nations are requesting today. We will not be able to participate in all of them -- for sheer problems of capacity. [Mueck] When you speak of this practice of being cautious, which one can very well understand as a neighbor -- I am Austrian -- could one not say that it is a kind of fig leaf, an excuse for dodging all other things, and to send the alliance, the others, into the fire? [Kinkel] I beg your pardon? First of all, we want the seat on the Security Council and, second, the Basic Law amendment so that we become capable of taking action, do not have to avoid responsibility, but that we commit ourselves in the community of peoples and in the United Nations in a way that is appropriate for a country of 80 million inhabitants. [Mueck] Yesterday, the German federal president, with a view to Bosnia, very explicitly said that for him the Bosnian Serbs are nothing but ordinary war criminals. If one hears that abroad, then one wonders why people in Germany are now seriously discussing whether one can participate in AWACS missions. [Kinkel] You cannot say it that way. Firstly, politically, we all wanted to participate in the AWACS missions. Only, the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] Bundestag group voiced its legal reservations regarding the legal basis: Paragraph 87 or 24 of the Basic Law. Second, we really did not shirk our responsibility in this connection -- but quite the contrary. In the future we want to help avoid such things. In Yugoslavia, we do have a special problem though as a result of historical events. So, even if the Basic Law had been amended and if we were able to participate in a mission under our constitution, there would probably -- that is my very personal opinion -- not be a majority in the German Bundestag for the participation of German soldiers in a mission in the former Yugoslavia. [Mueck] Do you not have the impression that the scenario that is currently developing in the Balkans, including the stronger involvement of the superpowers, such as Russia, might not once more become a question of security for Germany, and that your defense policy will be challenged? [Kinkel] No, not at all. I think that the Russians have acted most constructively so far. Without their possibilities of influencing the Serbian side, Sarajevo, Tuzla would not have been possible. Besides, you certainly heard what Kozyrev and Churkin said yesterday in connection with the behavior of the Serbs. The Serbs are the aggressors and they can obviously not be stopped and impressed by anything. As far as enforcing their policy is concerned they are obviously absolutely unscrupulous. They have to be told so, and we still need the Russians who have to bring their influence to bear, in the same way in which we need the U.S. influence on the Muslim side. [Mueck] It cannot be ruled out that, maybe even today, Clinton will make higher demands on the Europeans and say: You have to do more than you did in the past. What will you tell him then? [Kinkel] I will tell him that, so far, the Europeans have done much more than the Americans. I am happy about their commitment. The U.S. commitment is an air commitment, and an incredible political commitment, which we have always requested. It has helped bring about Muslim-Croatian rapprochement -- and we still have to get the Serbs into the boat. Yet, the ground forces -- this is where it is getting dangerous -- have been provided by the Europeans: 11,000 plus 13,000 men, which makes 24,000 men. [Mueck] But no Germans. [Kinkel] No Germans. This is what is worrying us greatly, and what is sometimes making life so hard for me as foreign minister in meetings with my colleagues and partners.
