Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong and Chinese Premier Li Peng will attend the signing ceremony at the weekend. Lee said that the prospects of the Suzhou project are "good", "a well planned township in Suzhou will proceed at a slower pace than Shenzhen, but the long-term results will be better." His remarks were contained in an written interview with XINHUA here today. Asked why Singapore chose Suzhou as the venue of the joint government project, Lee said because it is in the Chang Jiang delta and close to Shanghai, the dragon's head of the Chang Jiang valley. "It is a medium-size township, smaller than Singapore, and therefore its scale of work is what Singapore officials have handled before." He underlined that the main feature of the project "will be on long term planning which takes into account the environment, aesthetics, the convenience of the residents who will live and work in it, and of the commercial and financial services that will cater to the industries and the residents." In the Singapore-Suzhou industrial township, he said that industrial, residential and commercial facilities would be planned, implemented and administered as one integrated whole, as in Jurong town in Singapore. Lee Kuan Yew is the initiator of the Suzhou project, which has been supported by the Chinese Government. Singapore will develop a industrial town with an area of 70 sq kilometres in Suzhou in the next 10-15 years and will transfer Singapore economic development and management experiences to Suzhou. On "software", he said the hardware is the "tangibles", what people can see and feel in buildings, roads and physical infrastructure. But the software is "intangibles", which includes: drawing up and implementation of the plans, management of the township as well as creation of conditions which are attractive to investors and favorable to residents. He also saw some difficulties in the procedures. "The difficulties lie in transferring the methods developed in Singapore into Suzhou, because these methods have to be adapted to fit into the system in China. Therefore Suzhou, Jiangsu and Beijing officials have to encourage creative adjustments and adaptations." "It is like bud-grafting Singapore methods of urban and social organization on to a Chinese tree with roots in Chinese soil," he said. Lee will leave here on February 24 to visit Beijing and Tianjin.
