The source said: Such allegations which some Western information media have been circulating are totally untrue. He said: We are convinced that involving Libya's name in this seeks to harm Libya and, by the same token, to undermine the fraternal good relations that link it with fraternal Jordan. The source stressed that Libya has no connection with such actions which it condemns and rejects.
