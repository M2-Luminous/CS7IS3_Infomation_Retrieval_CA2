Since its establishment, Israel has been driven by a spirit of aggression and tyranny. Therefore, we are not amazed by any act produced by this deep-rooted Israeli aggressive spirit. All that we want to affirm to the international, regional, and local public opinion is that resistance in Lebanon will remain. It will not be discouraged by those blows, irrespective of how strong they are in terms of the disasters and the pain that they leave. This resistance is the product of a free national, popular will representing all Lebanese and all the free people in the world. In this regard, we would like to stress that the more blows they deal to the Lebanese and the resistance, the stronger and more determined this resistance becomes to continue its jihad and its approach, in order to enable our individual and land to attain freedom and independence, which are the token of our existence, especially at this critical stage. However, in view of this sick reality, the double standards of the U.S. Administration, and of the West in general and their biased view toward matters and issues that are related to peoples' freedom, pain us and incline us to hold those administrations politically and otherwise fully responsible for Israel's aggression. Israel would not have dared to defy all international resolutions, human rights, people's freedom, countries' sovereignty, and peoples' independence had it not been this U.S.-Western cover which provides it with all the elements of strength, in terms of money, weapons, and policy as well. As for our reaction, our natural reaction is continued resistance until all the holy land and our individuals are liberated from all the effects resulting from the marriage between U.S.-Western and Israeli interests on the basis of the spirit of colonialism and aggression. [Badawi] Haj 'Ali 'Ammar, first there was the operation that targeted and resulted in the kidnapping of Mustafa al-Dirani. A few later, attacks continued until they culminated in the Israeli raid against one of your positions in the al-Biqa' area, leaving dozens of victims. Do you not view these repeated Israeli attacks as a preparation for a certain objective that Israel has for some time been seeking to achieve, namely, liquidating Lebanese resistance and putting pressure on the Syrian-Lebanese negotiator by striking at Hizballah, Hizballah leaders, and the resistance? ['Ammar] Your question is politically multifaceted. I would like to clearly and frankly answer all the points included in your question. First, regarding the liquidation of the resistance, I would like to stress a point which is known well by Israel and the U.S. Administration: The resistance in Lebanon is not an armed organization or a specific group of Lebanese taking care of it. Resistance in Lebanon has become part of every child, woman, and old person. It has dug its roots deep into the Lebanese people and the Lebanese territory, beginning with those in their mothers' wombs, and ending with those elite struggling in a world that has lost its freedom, after freedom has been denied all factors of support and strength as a result of the arrogant Western-Israeli plotting against the region. This resistance is not easy to liquidate. This is despite the fact that we do not deny that there is a disparity between the strength of the resistance and that of the U.S. war machine that Israel is using to kill our people, children, and women, and to dominate our territory. However, the weapon of the resistance is in its being in the heart of those broad masses who took to the streets today to bury their martyrs and make their message quite clear. The gathering has been a true referendum as to the extent of support for the resistance. ['Ammar] Concerning the liquidation of the resistance, as we said the resistance is not an armed group with a limited base to be liquidated in this way. The real liquidation of the resistance can be effected by wiping out all levels of Lebanese society and annihilating the revolutionary and the ideological spirit which these people have been imbibing throughout history. As for the issue of the negotiations, the second issue I would like to talk about, you are aware that since the beginning of the negotiating process, from Madrid until now, we have never seen any benefit coming from these negotiations at all, because we perfectly believe that in light of the colonialist U.S. single-handed dealing with the region and in light of the aggressive spirit represented by Israel, which flouts all values, norms, and all the international, cultural, and humanitarian conventions, it is impossible to sit with this enemy at the negotiating table in any form whatsoever. If by these strikes Israel wants to influence the Lebanese and Syrian negotiators, and the Arab negotiators in general, we have said from the beginning that we have nothing to do with these negotiations and their results. I do not believe this situation will end in capitulation to Israeli demands, whether on the diplomatic level of negotiations or on the level of jihad, which we believe in and which we insist on continuing until the liberation of all the sacred soil. Therefore, I would like to say--and let public opinion be well aware of this--that the resistance is not a link in political investment or blackmail, neither on the negotiating table or away from it. This is because the resistance is the choice of people who want to be free and independent. [Badawi] On the practical side, within his warnings and threats, Yitzhaq Rabin asked the United States to intercede with Syria so Damascus would pressure you to stop your shelling of northern Israel. How true is this information? Have you received anything, any indications, any demands or requests from the Lebanese or Syrian authorities to stop the resumption of missile attacks on northern Israel? ['Ammar] First of all, our relations with sisterly Syria are strategic relations which cannot be affected by a casual event, be it an Israeli attack or anything else. We are aware that this recent spirit of aggression and the recent attacks were aimed at confusing the internal situation in Lebanon and disturbing the ties with fraternal Syria. We harbor appreciation and respect for Syria and its leader al-Asad for his sponsoring the resistance and for his defense of it and his protection throughout the recent history we have passed through. As for us being asked, we cannot allow anybody to demand anything from us, especially if the demand is related to our freedom, independence, self-respect, and our protection of our sanctities. We and al-Asad's Syria are on the same frontline against this Israeli aggression and domination and will not allow the Israeli-U.S. terms to pass even by one iota at the expense of our people. [Badawi] Therefore, the confrontation is there, the Israeli threats exists. Will you continue to shell the Israeli territory in case the Israeli Army attacks continue? You are, of course, aware that this will again lead to justifying an Israeli invasion of Lebanese territory, as happened last year? ['Ammar] Since the beginning of the resistance against the unjust Israeli occupation, we have adopted a sacred slogan, namely, kill us, because this will make our people more and more aware. We as a people have had a spiritual upbringing that rejects oppression, iniquity, occupation, and domination in any form whatsoever. We are free to use all the means available to us to defend our freedom, dignity, and independence. We will not spare any method to hurt this enemy, give it pain, and expel it form our land, and to remove all the effects of the international and regional imbalance on the military, political, and material levels. We do not care what the Israelis think. Our main concern is to defend freedom with all means available to us. Yes, the battle is open. Let them wipe us out if they want. If we can wipe them out, we will not hesitate to do so.
