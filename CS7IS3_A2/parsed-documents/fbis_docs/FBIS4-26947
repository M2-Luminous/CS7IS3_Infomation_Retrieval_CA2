Playing on China's eagerness for foreign capital, some foreign businessmen have exploited China's policy and management loopholes to engage in fraudulent practices and put up false fronts during the investment process in an attempt to seek profits by hook or by crook. During a recent investigation of some partly or wholly foreign-owned enterprises, this reporter found a whole range of falsehoods in the entire capital circulating process encompassing investment, operation, production, marketing, and profit distribution. To put it bluntly, these are "capital games" played by foreign businessmen. Such economic games cannot bring us real benefits. I. Where Have the Profits Gone? China's phenomenal success in using foreign capital since reform and opening up should be recognized. While foreign capital has largely been used in a healthy manner in various localities, we must take note of new circumstances and problems that have surfaced. According to incomplete statistics compiled by relevant departments, losses incurred by partly or wholly foreign-owned enterprises in China totaled 7 billion yuan in 1992, twice the amount of 1990. Their total losses from 1990-92 came to 16.2 billion yuan. Cumulative losses in some enterprises outstripped their registered capital, causing their debts to exceed their capital. It is reported that the losses were caused by many factors, chief among them being the false reporting of losses. Since its founding in 1986, a joint venture in Guangdong has reported losses every year and chalked up 920,000 yuan in total losses. However, it increased its capital by $3 million on three occasions in recent years. How did it manage to increase capital despite its losses? Behind this anomaly is the "business savvy" exhibited by some foreign businessmen in secretly diverting their profits. Profit diversion is a practice widely adopted by investors the world over to seek excessive profits and evade taxes, and examples of this practice abound among foreign investors in China. Some of these foreign investors provide high price quotations for the equipment with which they make investments in an attempt to disguise inferior quality, reap some profits early in the game, or exaggerate the investment-dividend ratio. Some control export and import channels, and divert profits to the companies in their home countries by providing high price quotations on imported raw and semifinished materials, and by depressing the prices of export goods. Some ask their partners to share unreasonable charges and fraudulently increase capital so that they can divert profits and increase their losses for purposes of tax evasion. Using the regulation that exempts partly or wholly foreign-owned enterprises from income tax within the first two years of profit-making, or that grants them income tax reductions within the first three years of profit-making, some foreign investors misreport their losses and intentionally delay their profit-making year to evade taxes. Still others set up "dummy companies" in tax havens around the world and divert their profits to such companies in what amounts to an international tax evasion exercise. The list of such practices goes on and on. Relevant experts have estimated that foreign joint-venture partners have spirited profits totaling several billion U.S. dollars out of China by resorting to two practices alone: importing equipment at high prices, and exporting goods at low prices. II. The Secret of "Contracted Capital": Large Sums of Contracted Capital but Small Sums of Actual Investment Although they sign many investment contracts covering sizable amounts of capital, some foreign businessmen make far smaller investments in reality, do not pay their registered capital, and default on payments in violation of contractual obligations, thus creating an illusory, bubble phenomenon. According to an investigation by relevant departments of 1,187 partly or wholly foreign-owned enterprises whose contractually stipulated deadline for paying capital was up, 668 of them, or 56 percent, failed to pay their registered capital in violation of contractual obligations. The defaulted capital totaled $900 million, or 53 percent of payable capital. According to the contract, the foreign partner of a joint venture which was set up in Beijing in November of 1991 is supposed to invest $100,000 in cash but has thus far failed to pay a single cent. The enterprise in question has become a joint venture in name. Real estate companies account for a high percentage of enterprises which have failed to pay their registered capital. In making investments, many foreign businessmen make every effort to keep their registered capital down. After making small capital contributions, they raise capital by taking out loans from domestic banks in the name of the joint ventures, with their Chinese partners undertaking all risks pertaining to their loans. Loans obtained by a foreign-funded enterprise in a certain province totaled $1.7 billion, or 46 percent of the paid-in capital, at the end of 1992. Using massive amounts of domestic capital to set up partly or wholly foreign-owned enterprises is contrary to China's goals of using foreign capital. Some foreign businessmen who use equipment as investment capital provide high price quotations for their low-cost equipment and fraudulently increase their paid-in capital. In evaluating some equipment whose prices were reported by foreign businessmen, relevant departments found that 83 percent of the prices were misrepresented and were substantially lower than the actual prices; some were even over-reported by several times. III. Being "Dummy" Means Lacking Foreign Capital Partly or wholly foreign-owned enterprises enjoy some policy-related preferential treatment, prompting some people to employ this loophole. The result is some "dummy partly or wholly foreign-owned" enterprises. According to one tactic employed by these people, they enlist the assistance of their foreign partners in completing relevant formalities without asking the latter to make capital contributions. A wholly foreign-owned enterprise in Inner Mongolia, for example, is actually a dummy one set up by local businessmen who pose as foreign investors. In east China, some foreign businessmen, using their passports and some assets certificates issued abroad, do business without capital investment, sign joint-venture contracts, and collect "service charges." According to another tactic, foreign partners make themselves available for relevant formalities while their Chinese partners remit foreign exchange out of China on their behalf. Some Hong Kong-registered enterprises or foreign representative offices in China make themselves available for relevant formalities while their Chinese partners remit foreign exchange out of the country so that the enterprises outside of China can reinvest those foreign exchange remittances in China. Still other foreign businessmen bring in capital in accordance with relevant provisions, and after obtaining capital verification certificates and joint-venture licenses, both the Chinese and foreign partners remit foreign capital contributions out of China under various pretexts in accordance with privately concluded agreements. Even more outrageous is that some foreign businessmen produce false capital verification certificates and false bank receipts. Last year, capital verification certificates and bank receipts produced by eight wholly foreign-owned enterprises in Haikou City were found to be fake. IV. Profiting From the Chinese With Their Foreign Exchange Receipts Virtually all foreign businessmen undertake in their contracts to balance their foreign exchange and to set ratios for sales to their home countries and for exports. Departments in charge of examining and approving their applications also specifically require them to do so. In reality, many partly or wholly foreign-owned enterprises only undertake to do so on paper. According to an analysis by relevant departments on the sales performance of partly or wholly foreign-owned, production-oriented enterprises, only 15 of them met the contractually stipulated export ratios in selling their products while the rest failed to meet those ratios. A significant number of those enterprises sold all their products on the domestic market. To solve the problem of balancing their foreign exchange, they brought in foreign currency through foreign exchange markets, imported raw and semifinished materials for processing and sale in China, earned large amounts of renminbi, and converted it into foreign currency in foreign exchange markets, thus giving rise to the bizarre phenomenon of "profiting from the Chinese with their foreign exchange receipts." Such actions not only have had an adverse effect on China's still fragile foreign exchange markets but also have compounded the country's balance of payments. Some foreign businessmen abuse their exclusive selling rights to quote unit prices or issue invoices on their own for export goods, which they sell at low prices to their parent companies, subsidiaries, or other affiliates abroad. Some foreign businessmen appropriate their Chinese partners' funds, default on payments, or swindle their Chinese partners of their money under the pretext of exporting goods. They also chronically refuse to remit their payments for goods. Consequently, a growing amount of outbound joint-venture capital fails to make its way back to China, an amount which sometimes even vastly outstrips the foreign partners' total capital contributions. V. Dispelling Illusions and Stressing Practical Results Faced with problems of every description in connection with foreign investment, people should seriously consider and study solutions to such problems. The first issue to be considered is how to stress practical results in using foreign capital and to pay attention to studying capital-related issues. In recent years, many localities evaluated their leaders' job performances in light of the number of joint ventures set up locally. They determined the number of new joint ventures to set up in any given year. This practice has fueled some illusory, bubble phenomena in the course of developing partly or wholly foreign-owned enterprises. At present, we should set our sights on improving the quality and efficiency of introducing foreign capital, focusing on solving such crucial problems as small actual foreign capital input, failure to pay registered capital, small numbers of joint ventures which eventually become operational, large numbers of deficit-ridden joint ventures, and capital flight. In evaluating the results of foreign capital utilization, we should consider actual foreign capital input and the resultant economic benefits. Activities involving dealings with foreign businessmen and setting up enterprises are graphically reflected in capital flow. Therefore, we should thoroughly study and explore capital-related issues within the context of the actual status of foreign capital utilization. This carries strong implications for China's current economic activity. The second issue to be considered is how to strengthen the legal system and improve the state's macroeconomic regulation and control. We should devise scientifically conceived plans regarding the development of partly or wholly foreign-owned enterprises to reduce the degree of recklessness in setting up such enterprises. Banks should develop rules governing loans for foreign-funded enterprises at an early date so that foreign capital will be truly used in China instead of letting foreign businessmen use domestic capital. We should explicitly forbid banks to grant loans for use as capital contributions by Chinese partners in state-controlled projects, so that our limited capital will only be used for projects badly needed by the country. The third issue to be considered is how to exercise strict management in accordance with the law and how to devise relevant preventive measures. We should earnestly carry out work pertaining to capital investment and resolutely plug the channels through which dummy joint ventures are set up. As a rule, we should revoke the business licenses of partly or wholly foreign-owned enterprises if their foreign partners have failed to invest capital or have made investments in renminbi without justifiable reasons after the joint ventures have been registered for more than one year. To prevent foreign businessmen from providing high price quotations on low-cost imported equipment in an attempt to disguise inferior quality, we should evaluate non-capital investments made by foreign businessmen. Economic, trade, industrial, commercial, customs, commodity inspection, foreign exchange, and taxation departments, as well as banks, should institute sweeping preventive measures regarding the capital of partly or wholly foreign-owned enterprises, so that an integrated and strictly regulated administrative system will take shape. The fourth issue to be considered is how to actively fight against tax evasion. Profit diversion and tax evasion involving international capital in multinational transactions demand urgent attention from tax offices. Currently, we need to urgently devise laws and regulations on fighting tax evasion and study the methods of combating tax evasion. The fifth issue to be considered is how Chinese enterprises should master the law of foreign capital utilization to reduce the degree of recklessness in using foreign capital. As China opens wider to the outside world, its enterprises should quickly learn the secrets of international capital flow, master the law of foreign capital utilization, and reduce the degree of recklessness in all stages of using foreign capital ranging from finding investment partners, determining joint-venture projects, and conducting feasibility studies to signing contracts, building and launching projects, engaging in production and marketing, and distributing profits. We should encourage a scientific and practical approach. In the volatile market economy, we should constantly sum up our experiences and learn from our mistakes in managing foreign capital so that our enterprises will operate more efficiently as they gain more experience. The sixth issue to be considered is how to deal with illegal foreign businessmen in strict accordance with the law. We should never accommodate foreign businessmen who amass ill-gotten wealth by hook or by crook in violation of Chinese law. We should let the whole world know that China welcomes foreign investment and protects foreign businessmen's legitimate rights and interests. However, we should never allow foreign businessmen to seek staggering profits by hook or by crook in violation of Chinese law.
