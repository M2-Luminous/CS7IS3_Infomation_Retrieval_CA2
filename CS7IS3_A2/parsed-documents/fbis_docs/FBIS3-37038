Funds To Pay Debts Have Been Raised but Problems Remain"] [Excerpts] The day of 10 February will go down in the history of domestic TV and radio broadcasting next to the other "black" date -- 3 October. Communication workers managed to do more than the coupists: in October, when Ostankino went off the air, Russian TV and radio worked all night. This time, however, both TV and radio went out completely in more than 60 regions of Russia. In a number of regions only morning and evening news bulletins were broadcast. Reports coming into Ostankino from the morning were reminiscent of front-line reports as though they were about an enemy capturing cities, one by one: Yakutsk, Irkutsk, Kirov, Kazan, Kemerovo, Nizhniy Novgorod, Saratov, Ivanovo, Ulyanovsk, Arkhangelsk, Smolensk, Voronezh, Volgograd, and Chita -- a total blackout. Tver, St. Petersburg, Novgorod, Krasnodar, and Izhevsk: Only "Novosti" and "Vesti" were aired. The greater part of Russia's population was on the verge of a full information vacuum. Moscow has avoided such a fate: the communication workers saved this "argument" as a last resort. According to another version, the director of the Moscow TV and Radio Center (as well as the main communication centers in several more oblasts) did not obey the decision of their trade union and boycotted the protest action. Be that as it may, the threat by the communication workers to reduce or stop TV and radio broadcasting, which many dismissed as not serious enough, was made good. And it worked, confirming the eternal Russian truth: Until thunder has struck, the muzhik will not cross himself. [passage omitted] What happened on 10 February has shown that our perception of the present information system as democratic is illusory. The system whereby TV is controlled from one point and can instantly be switched off throughout the country remains essentially totalitarian. [passage omitted] This time it turned out all right in the end. But everyone understands: The situation can be repeated. Something must be done. Even Viktor Chernomyrdin, who only a month and a half ago at a meeting with Ostankino's board of directors stated decisively: "The government will provide for state TV no matter what," on 10 February, in an interview with "Novosti," called into question the need for such a proportion of state TV (in Russia there are three federal and 90 regional companies): "One should look to see what needs to be corporatized and what should be privatized." Ostankino alone will require 1.267 trillion from the budget in 1994. Out of this amount, 88 percent will go to pay for communication services. Valentin Lazutkin, deputy chairman of the Russian Federal TV and Radio Broadcasting Service, is certain: the nongovernmental sphere does not have this sort of money. Additional funds received from corporatizing Ostankino (if it takes place) will allow to recoup program production costs, not pay for the transmission. Even if several large financial groups become stock holders, there will not be enough money to pay the communication workers. Nor is it possible, according to V. Lazutkin, to introduce subscription fees or a TV tax: First, the condition of the tax system and the way taxes are collected are well known; second, the population cannot be coerced to pay TV bills; third, it is politically inexpedient to impose high charges while the modest sums that will eventually be returned will not cover the expenses. Therefore, TV cannot do without large state subsidies. V. Lazutkin believes it necessary to undertake a qualified economic assessment of the whole system of financial settlements: with the communication services, the power services, and so forth. Many prices have been established arbitrarily: real prices, on the other hand, will allow to reduce these astronomical sums substantially. Reorganization within the companies themselves -- cutting bloated staffs (especially in Ostankino), streamlining advertising, rationalizing the broadcasting regime (eliminating what sociologists call idle time) -- all this will also save budget resources and allow state TV to survive. And that it is on the verge of collapse is clear to everybody. [passage omitted]
