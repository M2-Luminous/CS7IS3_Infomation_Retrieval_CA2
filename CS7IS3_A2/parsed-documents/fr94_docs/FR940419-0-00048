(i) A mobile service that does not meet the definition of commercial mobile radio service is presumed to be a private mobile radio service. (ii) Any interested party may seek to overcome the presumption that a particular mobile radio service is a private mobile radio service by filing a petition for declaratory ruling challenging a mobile service provider's regulatory treatment as a private mobile radio service. (A) The petition must show that: ( 1 ) The mobile service in question meets the definition of commercial mobile radio service; or ( 2 ) The mobile service in question is the functional equivalent of a service that meets the definition of a commercial mobile radio service. (B) A variety of factors will be evaluated to make a determination whether the mobile service in question is the functional equivalent of a commercial mobile radio service, including: consumer demand for the service to determine whether the service is closely substitutable for a commercial mobile radio service; whether changes in price for the service under examination, or for the comparable commercial mobile radio service would prompt customers to change from one service to the other; and market research information identifying the targeted market for the service under review. (C) The petition must contain specific allegations of fact supported by affidavit(s) of person(s) with personal knowledge. The petition must be served on the mobile service provider against whom it is filed and contain a certificate of service to this effect. The mobile service provider may file an opposition to the petition and the petitioner may file a reply.

(1) The applicant or licensee (who must file an application to modify its authorization) seeking authority to dedicate a portion of the spectrum for private mobile radio service, must include a certification that it will offer Personal Communications Service on a private mobile radio service basis. The certification must include a description of the proposed service sufficient to demonstrate that it is not within the definition of commercial mobile radio service in §20.3. Any application requesting to use any Personal Communications Service spectrum to offer service on a private mobile radio service basis will be placed on public notice by the Commission. (2) Any interested party may file a petition to deny the application within 30 days after the date of public notice announcing the acceptance for filing of the application. The petition shall contain specific allegations of fact supported by affidavit(s) of person(s) with personal knowledge to show that the applicant's request does not rebut the commercial mobile radio service presumption. The petition must be served on the applicant and contain a certificate of service to this effect. The applicant may file an opposition with allegations of fact supported by affidavit. The petitioner may file a reply. No additional pleadings will be allowed. The general rules of practice and procedure contained in §1.1 through §1.52 of this chapter and §22.30 of this chapter shall apply.
