Ingush President Refuses To Seek Second Term"] [Excerpts] Although most decisions made by the Russian president and government on overcoming the consequences of the Ossetian-Ingush conflict have not been implemented, the situation in the region has somewhat stabilized in the past few months. However, Ingush President Ruslan Aushev's unexpected announcement on Monday that he would not seek reelection for a second term may cause a new heightening of tensions. [passage omitted] The 27 February elections themselves, despite the incumbent president's short stay in office, did not come as a surprise: As soon as he assumed office, Ruslan Aushev promised to work out a new constitution and to hold new presidential and parliamentary elections in accordance with it. It always seemed obvious, however, that it would be he who would be the main and in fact the only actual candidate for a new presidential term. This is why Aushev's announcement surprised even many people from his inner circle, the Ingush president's press service told KOMMERSANT-DAILY. The reason given by the president himself does not appear very plausible, though: He and his government could have hardly done everything they wanted and were able to within one year. In addition, the "emergency rule" Ruslan Aushev referred to cannot be dismissed as a thing of the past -- at least the problem of refugees has not lost its urgency. Some observers attribute Aushev's exit to the election of his main rival, Akhsarbek Galazov, as North Ossetian president, implying that by doing so the Ingush leader recognized his inability to cooperate productively with his Ossetian counterpart. Given that there are no more or less prominent and authoritative figures behind Ruslan Aushev's back, however, one may state with assurance that any of his successors will be much less experienced and may bungle by breaking the fragile stability that has currently come about in the region. Nor will he enjoy so unanimous a support in society as the incumbent president. Still, it is too early to talk about Aushev's definitive departure, because his refusal to run for office has left only one candidate in the field, for which reason the elections may simply not take place at all.
