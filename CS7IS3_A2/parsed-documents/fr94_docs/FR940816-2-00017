FR940816-2-00017 FR940816-2-00014 Settlement Agreement and Order 1. This Settlement Agreement and Order, entered into between The Toro Company, a corporation (hereinafter ``Toro''), and the staff of the Consumer Product Safety Commission (hereinafter ``the staff'') is a compromise resolution of the matter described herein, without a hearing or determination of issues of law or fact. I. The Parties 2. The Toro Company is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the state of Delaware, with its principal corporate offices located at 8111 Lyndale Avenue South, Bloomington, Minnesota 55420&hyph;1196. 3. The staff of the Consumer Product Safety Commission (hereinafter ``the Commission'') are those members of the Commission's staff responsible for enforcing the laws administered by the Commission. The Commission is an independent federal regulatory agency established by Congress pursuant to section 4 of the Consumer Product Safety Act (hereinafter, ``the CPSA'' or ``the Act''), 15 U.S.C. §2053. II. Jurisdiction 4. On November 7, 1989, Toro acquired Lawn-Boy. Inc, (hereinafter ``Lawn-Boy''), a manufacturer and distributor of various models of lawn mowers. Lawn-Boy manufactured the lawn mowers at issue in this proceeding for sale to consumers for use around permanent or temporary households or residences. These lawn mowers are ``consumer products'' within the meaning of section 3(a)(1) of the CPSA, 15 U.S.C. §2051(a)(1). 5. Between approximately October 1, 1987 and August 29, 1989, Lawn-Boy manufactured and distributed over 160,000 lawn mowers, identified as ``L'' series lawn mowers, for sale to consumers throughout the United States. During 1989 and 1990, Lawn-Boy also manufactured lawn mowers under the ``M'' series and ``Model 8157'' designations, respectively, for sale to consumers throughout the United States. Lawn-Boy, therefore, is a ``manufacturer'' of consumer products which are ``distributed in Commerce'', as those terms are defined in sections 3(a)(4) and (11) of the CPSA, 15 U.S.C. §2052(a)(4) and (11). 6. After its acquisition by Toro, Lawn-Boy operated as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Toro until July 31, 1992, when its assets and liabilities were transferred to Toro. Since its acquisition of Lawn-Boy, Toro has been responsible for controlling the acts and practices of Lawn-Boy, including assuring that Lawn-Boy complied with the requirements of section 15(b) of the CPSA, 15 U.S.C. §2064(b), and the regulations issued thereunder, 16 C.F.R. §1115, et seq. III. The Products 7. The products at issue in this matter are walk-behind lawn mowers. IV. Staff Allegations Concerning the ``L'' Series, ``M'' Series and ``Model 8157'' Lawn Mowers and the Failure of Toro To Assure That its Subsidiary, Lawn-Boy Complied With the Reporting Requirements of Section 15(b) of the CPSA 8. Section 15(b) of the Consumer Product Safety Act, 15 U.S.C. §2064(b), requires a manufacturer of a consumer product who, inter alia , obtains information that reasonably supports the conclusion that the product contains a defect which could create a substantial product hazard or that the product creates an unreasonable risk of serious injury or death to inform the Commission immediately of the defect or risk. The ``L'' Series Lawn Mowers 9. Between October, 1987 and August, 1989, Lawn-Boy's ``L'' series lawn mowers were equipped with gas tanks that were susceptible to leakage because of improper bonding of the tank halves during a hot-plate welding process. Lawn-Boy learned of the leakage problem in 1988 and replaced leaking gas tanks on lawn mowers brought in for service through 1990. In early 1989, Lawn-Boy's fuel tank supplier modified the tank design to improve bonding of the gas tank halves. In August 1989, Lawn-Boy authorized its tank supplier to build new machinery to improve the hot-welding process to correct the leakage problem. 10. After Toro's acquisition of Lawn-Boy in 1989, Lawn-Boy continued to receive complaints about seam leakage on ``L'' series mower gas tanks, and Lawn-Boy dealers continued to replace leaking tanks on mowers brought in for service. In its capacity as corporate parent of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Lawn-Boy, Toro knew or, with the exercise of due diligence, should have known that the tanks were defective and that the defect could expose consumers to a substantial risk of injury from fire. 11. Despite the pattern of tank seam failures that continued after Toro's acquisition of Lawn-Boy, Toro failed to provide any information concerning the failures to the Commission until a Commission investigator inspected Lawn-Boy in November, 1990. Toro did not file an initial report under section 15(b) until March, 1991.
