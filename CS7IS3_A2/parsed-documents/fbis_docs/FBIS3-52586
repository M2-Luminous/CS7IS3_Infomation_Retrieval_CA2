According to Maj. Gen. Mordekhay, before such summits there is always an escalation in Hizballah activities and attempts to cause unrest in the area. Senior military sources in the Northern Command assessed that the rejectionist front organizations will also attempt to step up attacks against the IDF and SLA [South Lebanese Army] in the security zone in the week ahead. The IDF is consequently raising its level of alert in southern Lebanon. [passage omitted] According to Maj. Gen. Mordekhay, Syria must curb the terror activity: "Just as Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has said, Syria wields the decisive influence over Hizballah. The most important thing the prime minister and the chief of staff have said is that if Syria makes a real effort, it can curtail terrorism along our northern border." [passage omitted] According to Gen. Mordekhay, Hizballah has started firing from villages north of the security zone over the past few weeks, in violation of the understandings reached in the wake of Operation Accountability. According to Mordekhay, "during 1993, 124 terrorists were killed and dozens of others were wounded, Operation Accountability included. Our forces in the north are attaining their objectives. I believe the northern border settlements enjoy a high level of security thanks to IDF activity in the security zone and along the international border."
