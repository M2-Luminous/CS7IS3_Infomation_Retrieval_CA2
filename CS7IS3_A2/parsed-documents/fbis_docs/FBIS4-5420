Both consumer and corporate loans remained sluggish throughout the year that ended March 31, said an official of the Federation of Bankers Associations of Japan. The outstanding balance of lending by the 11 banks, known as city banks in Japan, came to 221.97 trillion yen at the end of the year, down 0.6 percent from a year earlier with a scant 0.1 percent growth in the latest reporting month alone, the federation said. The official brushed aside views that banks have been reluctant to expand lending after incurring huge bad loans from the collapse of the asset-inflated economy of the late 1980s. "Banks took an active posture with various measures to increase lending, (but) corporate demand for funds stayed sluggish," he said. Six city banks posted declines in fiscal 1993 lending, led by 2.31 percent at the Bank of Tokyo, 2.30 percent at Fuji Bank and 2.08 percent at Sanwa Bank. Daiwa Bank marked the highest growth of 5.85 percent among the five banks that increased lending. Mitsubishi Bank followed with 1.00 percent, and the Hokkaido Takushoku Bank with 0.87 percent. The ranking of lending balance remained unchanged from the previous year, with 32.37 trillion yen at Sakura Bank, 28.18 trillion yen at Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, and 27.28 trillion yen at Sumitomo Bank. The year-end balance of lending by Japan's three long-term credit banks also marked the first fall, falling 0.2 percent from the year- before level and dropping 0.1 percent for March alone to 47.45 trillion yen. The lending balance at Japan's seven trust banks stood at 25.43 trillion yen, up 4.1 percent from a year earlier and 1.7 percent in March. As for deposits released together, the federation said the outstanding balance of deposits at the city banks in fiscal 1993 rose for the first time in three years, climbing 2.0 percent from the year before to 196.17 trillion yen. The officials said deposits tended to be higher toward the end of the year, with a 4.0 percent growth seen in the second half after a 1.9 percent fall in the first half. Corporate deposits increased for the first time in three years as deposits by government-affiliated companies and temporary deposits of investment funds by insurance firms increased to more than offset declines in other general corporate deposits, the official said. Individual deposits remained buoyant led by demand deposits, he said. Real deposits, excluding checks and bills, rose a strong 3.1 percent in March alone. The balance of debenture issuance -- equivalent to deposits at other banks -- at the long-term credit banks for fiscal 1993 came to 51.33 trillion yen, down 0.9 percent to mark the second consecutive fall. The March issuance alone dropped 0.4 percent. The balance of deposits at the trust banks gained 4.9 percent in fiscal 1993 to 10.09 trillion yen, recording the first increase in three years.
