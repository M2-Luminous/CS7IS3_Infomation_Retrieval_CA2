[Suekoesd] Good evening. The atmosphere is quiet and calm here. [passage omitted] The party's chairman, who has just arrived, is not in a very good mood. What do you think of the results so far? [KDNP Chairman Laszlo Surjan] I think that many people are surprised by the partial results indicating an absolute lead by the MSZP [Hungarian Socialist Party]. According to our analysis, the MSZP's program and its present leadership does not justify this result at all. However, nostalgia -- wanting to bring back the calm of the 70's and the 80's -- can explain this. I think that those who have chosen the Socialists from the current political forces for this reason are mistaken. [passage omitted] [Suekoesd] Where did your party do well, in the larger towns or in the provinces? [Surjan] In my view, it is unequivocal that our party's strength lies in the smaller towns and villages. The party was not strong in Budapest even in the 40's and it seems that this is the same in the 90's too. All this means that we have to deal with strengthening and building the party before the local government elections. [Suekoesd] What can the second round bring? [Surjan] The second round could bring extremely significant changes. [passage omitted] Although it is true that in 1990 those leading after the first round kept their lead, this is not necessarily true. I think that the next three weeks will be spent trying to concentrate the forces in a way that a left-wing turnabout, which does not lead forward but back to the past, be held back or prevented.
