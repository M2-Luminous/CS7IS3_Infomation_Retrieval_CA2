Otherwise the union plans to intensify the protest action and restart the strike in brown coal mines. Strike committees of the hard and brown coal mining industries and power and heating industries took part in today's meeting of the Mining and Power Industry Secretariat in Katowice. Solidarity leader Marian Krzaklewski also took part in this meeting. After the failed culmination of the strike last Friday [6 May], which was announced by Krzaklewski, the trade unionists were discussing how the Solidarity protests would be organized in the next few days. Solidarity is not withdrawing its general demands but is now willing to agree to talk about the power industry demands on the condition that these would be two-way talks between Solidarity and the government. [passage omitted] It is possible that a meeting between Marian Krzaklewski and Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak or President Lech Walesa may still take place tonight after the premiere of the Kazimierz Kutz film in Katowice.
