It was once tolled contrary to usual practice 75 years ago, at the time of the March 1st popular uprising. The Buddhist monks defined rice market opening by the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique as contravening the Buddhist rules and sounded the bell while an all-people rally against rice market opening was taking place on the Seoul railway station plaza. This was an expression of their opposition to rice market opening and dismayed the puppet clique.
