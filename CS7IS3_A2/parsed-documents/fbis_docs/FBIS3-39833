"I want a UDF candidate," he said, "and I do not see how it could be otherwise.... A two-round majority election necessarily requires that there are two candidates in each camp in the first round." Mr. de Charette, who is close to UDF President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, said that he "had never been very much in favor" of the system of "primaries" for the presidential election which Charles Pasqua wants. "It would be very difficult to legislate on that," he said. Senate Speaker Rene Monory (UDF-Social Democratic Center) also said it is "probable if not certain that there will be a UDF candidate" in the presidential election. Mr. Monory, the guest on the France-2 "Hour of Truth" program, added that wanting "a single candidate" for the majority "at any cost," as Mr. Pasqua does, strikes him as "not a good idea." "There are two big groups which must help each other to win the presidential election," he stressed. Moreover, Mr. Monory thinks that the future candidate for the presidential election will have to promise to carry out "a far-reaching reform of society." "I am certainly not criticizing the government's record, but there are problems to be solved," he said. "What has to be done is not pleasant," the Senate speaker stressed. "A number of achievements must be questioned, but the closer we come to the election date the more this will have to be said to ensure that people are not taken by surprise.... What is tragic is that many promises were made in 1993, far more than can probably be kept." UDF spokesman Jean-Pierre Raffarin (UDF-Republican Party) also thinks it is "natural for the UDF to have a candidate in the first round" of the presidential election. The UDF "is exercising power on an equal footing, holding the speaker's post in the Senate, and with a majority in the regions and departments," he said. "The candidate will therefore run in the first round" of the presidential election "in a spirit of alliance," Mr. Raffarin said on Radio-J. Among the UDF's "men of stature," Raffarin cited Mr. Giscard d'Estaing, the president of the confederation; Mr. Monory; Raymond Barre; and Defense Minister Francois Leotard. In conclusion, Mr. Raffarin criticized the government's policy, calling for a "psychological impact" to combat "the serious risks of a social explosion." "I cannot be satisfied with a television program, whatever the talents and merits of the public protagonists," the UDF spokesman said with reference to Mr. Balladur's appearance on the "Hour of Truth" on 14 February.
