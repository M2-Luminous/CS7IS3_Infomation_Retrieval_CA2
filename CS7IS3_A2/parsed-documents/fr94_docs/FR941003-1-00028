FR941003-1-00028 FR941003-1-00003 Paragraph (b) of §1.653 is proposed to be amended to be consistent with the proposed redesignation of certain paragraphs of §1.672, to delete the reference to §1.684(c), which is proposed to be cancelled, and for clarity. Paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(4) of §1.653 are proposed to be amended to make it clear that the only testimony to be included in a party's record is testimony submitted on behalf of the party. Having copies of the same testimony appear in both parties' records unnecessarily encumbers the records and is confusing in that a given page of testimony will have different page numbers in the different records, with the result that the briefs of the parties will refer to different record pages for the same testimony. It is proposed that paragraph (c)(5) of §1.653 be deleted and reserved. Paragraph (c)(5) currently requires that the record filed by each party include each notice, official record and printed publication relied upon by the party and filed under §1.682(a). This requirement is considered unnecessary because such notices, official records and printed publications are in the nature of exhibits under §1.653(i), which are submitted with but not included in the record. The inclusion of exhibits in the record merely increases the size of the record without serving any useful purpose. Paragraph (g) of §1.653 is proposed to be amended and paragraphs (f) and (h) deleted and reserved to eliminate the current distinction between typewritten and printed records. Paragraph (g) is also proposed to be amended to change ``81/2 x 11 inches (21.8 by 27.9 cm.)'' to ``21.8 by 27.9 cm. (81/2 x 11 inches)'' and to delete the requirement for justified margins and to require that the records be bound with covers at their left edges in such manner as to lie flat when open to any page and in one or more volumes of convenient size (approximately 100 pages per volume is suggested) and that when there is more than one volume, the numbers of the pages contained in each volume must appear at the top of the cover for each volume. Paragraph (i) is proposed to be amended to state that exhibits include documents and things identified in affidavits or on the record during the taking of oral depositions as well as official records and publications submitted pursuant to §1.682(a). In §1.654, it is proposed to amend paragraph (a) by changing ``shall'' in the second sentence to ``may'' for clarity and also to reduce the time for oral argument by a party from 60 minutes to 30 minutes, because most hearings have required no more than 30 minutes per side and a panel has the discretion to grant more time at the hearing, where necessary. In §1.655, it is proposed to amend paragraph (a) by changing the standard of review from ``erroneous or an abuse of discretion'' to ``an abuse of discretion.'' The recitation of a separate ``error'' standard is unnecessary, because an abuse of discretion may be found when (1) the decision of an administrative patent judge is clearly unreasonable, arbitrary or fanciful, (2) the decision is based on an erroneous conclusion of law, (3) the findings of the administrative patent judge are clearly erroneous, or (4) the record contains no evidence upon which the administrative patent judge rationally could have based the decision. See, e.g. , Heat and Control Inc. v. Hester Industries, Inc., 785 F.2d 1017, 228 USPQ 926 (Fed. Cir. 1986); Western Electric Co. v. Piezo Technology, Inc. v. Quigg, 860 F.2d 428, 8 USPQ2d 1853 (Fed. Cir. 1988). It is proposed to amend paragraph (b) of §1.655 to clarify which matters a party is not entitled to raise for consideration at final hearing. As proposed to be amended, paragraph (b) would provide that a party shall not be entitled to raise for consideration at final hearing a matter which properly could have been raised by a motion under §1.633 or 1.634 unless (1) the matter was properly raised in a motion that was timely filed by the party under §1.633 or 1.634 and the motion was denied or deferred to final hearing, (2) the matter was properly raised by the party in a timely filed opposition to a motion under §1.633 or 1.634 and the motion was granted over the opposition or deferred to final hearing, or (3) the party shows good cause why the issue was not properly raised by a timely filed motion or opposition. It is also proposed to amend paragraph (b) of §1.655 to state that a change of attorneys during the interference generally does not constitute good cause for failing to file a timely motion or opposition. It is further proposed, in response to In re Van Geuns, 988 F.2d 1181, 26 USPQ2d 1057 (Fed. Cir. 1993), to amend paragraph (b) of §1.655 by adding a sentence explaining that a party who fails to contest, by way of a timely filed preliminary motion under §1.633(c), the designation of a claim as corresponding to a count may not subsequently argue the separate patentability or the lack of separate patentability of claims designated as corresponding to the count. The Patent and Trademark Office conducts interference proceedings to determine who, as between two or more applicants for patent or one or more applicants for patent and one or more patentees, is the first inventor of a patentable invention. A primary examiner determines in the first instance whether the claims in a pending application interfere with the claims in another pending application or unexpired patent. When the examiner is of the view that an interference exists, the Board is notified (§1.609). The interference is assigned to an administrative patent judge (§1.610), who issues a notice declaring the interference (§1.611). Each separately patentable invention involved in the interference is defined by a count, which is merely a vehicle for contesting priority of invention (i.e, who made the invention defined by the count first) and determining the evidence relevant to the issue of priority. A preliminary determination is made by the Patent and Trademark Office as to which claims should be designated to correspond to the count. The claims that are initially determined to define the same patentable invention are designated as corresponding to the count. All other claims are designated as not corresponding to the count. The designation of claims provides a starting point in an interference. There is a presumption that the designation of a claim as corresponding or as not corresponding to a count is correct.
