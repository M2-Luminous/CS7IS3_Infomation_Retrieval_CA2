The workers, who traveled from Guadalupe Tepeya to San Cristobal de las Casas today, said that the rebels have mined the road leading to Guadalupe Tepeya and kidnapped 100 civilians. The informants could not state whether there are any members of the Public Forces among the hostages. The workers added that the residents of Guadalupe Tepeya had noticed some unusual activity since 19 December, and that in the last hours the power lines were sabotaged. Thus far there are no reports of confrontations between the Army and the rebels in that area of the Mexican State of Chiapas. Guadalupe might be the only city that remains occupied by the EZLN, following its declaration of war on the Mexican Government on 1 January. Meanwhile, some fighting is still being reported in the neighborhood of Ocosingo as well as bombings on the outskirts of San Cristobal de las Casas. A radio station commentator said that the Mexican Army bombed three vehicles with 16 reporters that were heading to the combat zone near San Cristobal de las Casas, but the reporters escaped unharmed.
