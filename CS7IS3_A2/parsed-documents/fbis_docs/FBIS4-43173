Abizanda report: "Navy, Halfway There"] [Text] Halfway there. That is how the Navy has been left following the budget cuts that have sunk many of its plans for renewal and new shipbuilding laid down in the so-called High Seas Plan at the end of the last decade. What should have been an ambitious plan to create a Navy of the year 2000, modern and to the highest European standards, has been reduced to just a few plans subject to the danger of further cuts, which have also caused the ships and crews to spend fewer days at sea than are required for their training. The Spanish Navy's basic core remains based on the air-sea group headed by the aircraft carrier Principe de Asturias. This ship, the Navy's flagship, has performed and will continue to perform excellently, becoming, according to military experts, the best ship of its class currently in service. However, despite the aircraft carrier's excellence, the air-sea group has become "lame" as far as its escorts are concerned. The Navy's long-standing aim to have 15 frigate-type escorts has come to nothing, since right now it has only nine: five of the Baleares class, which have various maintenance problems, and four much more modern Santa Maria class frigates. This shortage means that the Navy has been unable to deploy more than two frigates at once in the operation to monitor the embargo against Serbia and Montenegro, since it has to honor other commitments, such as both national and international maneuvers, or because of these ships' maintenance cycles. This situation will be partially alleviated when the two new Santa Maria class ships enter into service. The first of them -- the F85 Navarra -- is to do so this year, since it will be delivered to the Navy by the Bazan National Enterprise 30 May. The F86 Canarias will be received by the Navy in December. In any event, future expectations fall far short of what was envisaged in the Master Plan [Plan Norte], with the construction of nine F100 class frigates starting from this year. The budget problems have caused those nine ships to be cut to just four, whose construction will not begin until next year at the earliest, if the most optimistic time scales are fulfilled. Right now, following the memorandum of understanding signed by Spain, the Netherlands, and Germany last January, the project's feasibility stage is coming to a close. These four frigates should strengthen one of the fleet's weakest points -- antiaircraft defense -- being equipped with a radar system capable of tracking and firing at more targets simultaneously than the Santa Maria class frigates can do. The drastic cuts came at a crucial time for the Navy, with a gradual involvement in international operations and greater participation in maneuvers with the allies. Moreover, Spain is one of those promoting the setting up of a European air-sea group in the Mediterranean, which undoubtedly means having a well-equipped Navy. As in the case of the Air Force, preference is also given by the Defense Ministry to transport and support ships, although new shipbuilding is also at a standstill, except for the AOR [expansion unknown], the supply ship which will be launched within the next few weeks. The AOR will have the capacity to transport 6,800 tonnes of diesel oil in order to supply the Principe de Asturias and its escorts, and 500 tonnes of JP-5 fuel for the Harrier aircraft of the air unit aboard the aircraft carrier. The High Seas Plan, drawn up during Fernando Nardiz' time as Navy chief of staff, envisaged the commissioning of five amphibious vessels, whereas the situation right now is that both the Aragon and the Castilla -- the two attack transport ships -- have reached the end of their useful lives without clear replacements. The first solution has been to hire from the U.S. Navy two amphibious vessels with 20 years on their logbooks, due to arrive in Spain between this year and the beginning of 1995. Another solution -- that of constructing a Landing Platform Dock amphibious vessel in Spain -- is also at a critical stage right now. Naval sources consulted stated that the work order should be carried out this year, since because this is a joint project with the Netherlands, which has already taken a decision to this effect, many of the results of this cooperation could be lost, with the consequent increase in the project's cost. The need for these ships, repeatedly expressed by Defense Minister Julian Garcia Vargas, stems from the support for the ground forces that have to be transported in carrying out international missions, as is the case with operation Alpha Bravo in the former Yugoslavia. But of there is a part of the Navy where the future is not at all bright, it is in the submarine fleet. While the above-mentioned plan forecast in one of its most optimistic sections the construction of up to 10 submarines to replace the Delfin and Agosta class submarines, the harsh reality is that the designing of this new type of vessel is at a standstill, and the current fleet of eight vessels could even be halved before the end of the century. It is acknowledged by the Defense Ministry itself that the submarine fleet is experiencing difficulties -- especially the four Delfin class vessels. In fact, the major refits of the S64 Narval, required in order to guarantee a submarine's safety, have been suspended, and this in turn is causing major difficulties in accomplishing the submarine force's operating cycle. Defense sources told ABC that the S64 will be dropped from the list of Navy vessels this year, although they emphatically asserted that it will not be scrapped. The submarine will be mothballed, as is done by the U.S. Navy with the units it decommissions, making possible its recovery if circumstances so require. For this reason, the Navy could begin the next decade with just four submarines, although it is a weapon of considerable deterrent capability because of the danger it poses to shipping and free movement in ports. Some sectors in the Navy are in favor of scrapping the oldest submarines to make it possible to use the funds earmarked for their maintenance for other, more pressing, needs. All this comes four years after Admiral Carlos Vila, Juan Jose Romero Caramelo's predecessor as Navy chief of staff, warned when he took office that he was unable with the resources then at his disposal to ensure the performance of all the tasks entrusted. And the fact is that Vila also had to see the Navy part with a large proportion of its patrol boats, partly because the Maritime Civil Guard took over responsibility for the surveillance of territorial waters and because scrapping those ships made it possible to earmark funds for other, more pressing, needs. Nevertheless, the Navy has strengthened its capability as far as deep-sea patrol boats are concerned. The program to construct four minehunters at the Bazan shipyard in Cartagena has also been activated. Although the High Seas Plan put at eight the number of ships for antimine warfare, their high cost made it advisable to reduce the plan to the aforementioned four ships. Air Arm The Fleet Air Arm has been strengthened through the purchase for 46 billion pesetas in 1992 of eight Harrier-plus aircraft that will replace the older models. Nevertheless, the cuts have affected the helicopters, since the number of SH-60 Seahawks -- six -- has proved too low to meet all requirements, especially with the entry of more frigates into the fleet.
