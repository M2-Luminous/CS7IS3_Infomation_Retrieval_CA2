Speaking here at ceremonies marking the 50th anniversary of the entrance of the Italian air force in the war of Liberation, Ciampi also said how "All of us, in their place of responsibility, are helping Italy along an important path towards its political and institutional renewal" and in this effort the armed forces are giving their firm and essential support "today as fifty years ago when, after the disaster brought by the dictatorship, hope was re-born and civil and moral reconstruction began, which came first and was more important than material reconstruction." Looking at the situation in neighboring Bosnia, the premier observed "Italy's role has been essential for the possibility of exercising international pressure aimed at halting the horrible massacre in Sarajevo and to pave the way for just agreements, acceptable for all sides involved." "We are giving to the UN and NATO operations in Bosnia" he continued, "the essential contribution of air bases and logistical support and command systems. Our presence in the international effort to restore peace in the ex-Yugoslavia is also in line with all the missions we are involved, under the banner of the United Nations: from Somalia to Lebanon, Mozambique to the Persian Gulf." Ciampi went on to state how Italy's commitment in international missions is linked to a world no longer divided into blocs which make it impossible for "isolationist policies" and also implies Italy must assume its responsibilities given "the difficulties the New World Order in having in establishing itself." Italy's position among other nations, Ciampi observed, "also depends on its ability to play an active role in operations to re-establish and maintain peace in areas where the risks are greatest. Among these areas the Mediterranean, not only for us, is of central importance. This government has worked in all forums for a new security alliance stipulated among the peoples of the Mediterranean." The Italian premier went on to recall how, at the last NATO summit, he underscored how "the Mediterranean question not only regards southern Europe, but the whole Alliance and all of Europe." Military alliances and agreements, such as between NATO and the Western European Union (WEU) or NATO's Partnerships for Peace with East Europe, "must be coupled with greater concentration and multilateral cooperation in the Mediterranean and a renewed effort against the dangers of the proliferation of missiles and weapons of mass destruction." What is needed, Ciampi said, is a "major diplomatic, political and economic effort which must continue to seek to stabilize the situation in the southern Mediterranean" and in this "Italy cannot allow itself to be the egotist short-sighted, nor stingy towards peoples distant only a few hundred kilometers."
