Filatov told the public chamber at the office of the President in the Kremlin on Saturday the diminishing threat of a break-up of the Russian Federation was a direct result of the treaty of social accord (Filatov is chairman of the conciliatory commission to effect that document -- INTERFAX). "So far 863 political parties, non-governmental organizations and associations have signed that treaty and the signature-raising campaign will go on", Filatov said. He pointed to what he described as society's "ever more neutral, in some cases negative attitude" to the opposition's attempts to resist reform. He said that under the influence of that treaty the opposition had shifted to "more civilized forms of confrontation". Filatov admitted that the social price of reform was very high: "The gap between wealth and poverty is keenly felt by society and crime and corruption rates are alarming." The chief of the presidential staff described the latest package of President Yeltsin's decrees on economic issues as an "instrument of the fairest distribution of problems in society during the transition phase". Filatov believes that resolving problems of the transitional period would be possible only in the climate of civic accord. He said society needed stable rules of political struggle. At the same time he said that the executive authorities were prepared for a dialogue with any political forces, provided they observed the Constitution of the Russian Federation. Filatov said that attempts to recreate the USSR by force might trigger a civil war. He said those who sought to revise the Belovezh agreements and restore the USSR by force must remember that they gamble with the lives of millions. "Attempts to act on such ideas is the surest way to civil war comparable in scale only to World War II". Alongside other favorable changes resulting from the treaty of social accord Filatov pointed to "other republics' growing confidence in Russia". President Yeltsin's chief of staff admitted that part of society was "ostalgic about real socialism and sweet deceit and self-deceit". Filatov said Russia's reformist and democratic forces had approached a dramatic frontier, where new ideas had to be formulated and strategy adjusted. The presidential chief of staff described the crime situation in Russia as "close to an emergency". He said that was the main reason that prompted President Yeltsin to sign the decree to protect the population from gangsterism and organized crime. "Ten explosions a day is a sure sign that criminal gangs impose their mode of life and ideology on society", Filatov told INTERFAX. Filatov believes that the main reason why society disagrees with the presidential decree is that it permits detaining suspects for 30 days. He said that that measure was "borrowed from the state of emergency law". Filatov believes that those who argue this provision of the decree should be compensated in legal terms, "by eliminating people's old-time fear of the sweeping powers of policing agencies" are right, too. The chief of presidential staff believes that that can be achieved with assistance from the conciliatory commission for effecting the treaty of social accord. The speaker of the lower house of the Russian parliament Ivan Rybkin believes that the presidential decree "On Urgent Measures to Protect the Population From Gangsterism and Other Manifestations of Organized Crime" is a necessary measure. At the same time he told journalists that in order to avoid "frictions between the president and the Duma" Boris Yeltsin should have presented in advance an appropriate bill of amendments to the criminal code. The State Duma last Friday included debates on the presidential decree in its agenda, however, failed to begin it due to the shortage of time. The State Duma's Security Committee drafted a resolution entitled "On the Protection of Constitutional Rights and Freedoms of Citizens While Implementing Measures to Fight Against Crime" asked the president to suspend the decree, because it ran counter to the Constitution and the criminal code [sentence as received]. The attention of the Supreme Court was drawn to the need to stick to the current legislation in administering justice.
