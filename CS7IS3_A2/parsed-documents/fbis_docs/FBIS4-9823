FBIS4-9823 "drlat064_r_94005" FBIS-LAT-94-064 Daily Report 4 Apr 1994 Peru _O_ Notes From Media _O_ Notes From Media 94P20591A 94P20591A CSO [Editorial Report] Poll on Fujimori, La Cantuta, Phone Company Sale A March poll shows that in a two-way presidential contest, President Alberto Fujimori would trail slightly behind former UN Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, but in a multicandidate election, Fujimori would lead, as he also would do in a two-way race with Lima Mayor Ricardo Belmont. In the same poll, 40.9 percent of the respondents thought that Fujimori's chances of being reelected had gone down "in recent months." The IMASEN poll shows that Perez de Cuellar has moved slightly up since January, with 45.2 percent in a two-way contest (from 43.1 percent in January) to Fujimori's 43.4 percent (essentially the same as in January). If the contest were between Fujimori and Belmont only and were held "tomorrow," Fujimori would lead Belmont with 49.6 percent of the vote to Belmont's 31.3 percent, while 19.1 percent did not respond to this question. If the candidates were Fujimori, Perez de Cuellar, Belmont, and "others," Fujimori would lead Perez de Cuellar by 3.2 percent (down from a lead of 4.7 percent in January), with Belmont and "others trailing far behind. The respondents were fairly evenly divided over whether Fujimori's reelection chances had improved or diminished in recent months, with 38.5 percent saying his chances had improved, 40.9 percent saying diminished, and 19.9 percent believing Fujimori's chances remained the same. There were 403 respondents interviewed. The March poll also showed that 69.7 percent approved of the highly profitable privatization sale of the Peruvian Telephone Company, with 24.3 percent disapproving. In a poll on the La Cantuta affair, 354 interviews were conducted. Asked whether all involved in the affair had been prosecuted, 84.7 said not all had been, and only 8.8 percent thought they had. Some 66.1 percent thought the speed with which the military trial was conducted was cause for distrust, while only 27.7 thought it was not. Asked whether the sentences had been just or light, 54.5 percent said they had been light and 34.5 percent believed they were just. The data indicate that gender, age, and socioeconomic status were not significant factors in determining responses. The polls were conducted 1-4 March and covered all age and socioeconomic groups. Margin of error was not given.
