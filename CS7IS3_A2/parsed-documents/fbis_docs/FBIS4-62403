[sentence as received] Gukasyan said Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh are fully independent of each other in their foreign political activity, which does not rule out coordination of certain positions. The views of Yerevan and Stepanakert differ on a number of points, but Armenia does not pressure Karabakh at all, the minister said. According to Gukasyan, Nagorno-Karabakh republic's foreign policy is worked out in Stepanakert, and "if it does not coincide with the viewpoint of Armenian authorities, Yerevan understands that the Karabakh side must stick to its own view."
