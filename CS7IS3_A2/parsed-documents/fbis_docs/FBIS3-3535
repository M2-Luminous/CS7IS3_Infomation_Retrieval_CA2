A survey report shows that more than 60 percent of the 12 million rural households in Guangdong, with a combined population of 50 million, have moved into such buildings over the past 15 years. The living space of Guangdong's rural residents now averages 12.71 sq m, one third more than that for urban residents. Guangdong, which borders Hong Kong, took the lead in China's national reform and opening further to the outside world. Benefiting from the reform and open-up policy, farmers have invested more in production and consequently improved their living conditions. By the end of 1993, villages and rural towns had built dwelling houses with a total floor space of 1.1 billion sq m.
