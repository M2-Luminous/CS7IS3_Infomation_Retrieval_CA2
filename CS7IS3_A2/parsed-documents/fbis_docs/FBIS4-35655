"The status quo is a transitory state between predemocracy and democracy, but staying in the same place for a long time is equivalent to a reversal (to the original status)," said Jamil al-Nimri, former chief editor of the opposition weekly AL-AHALI newspaper. "The presence of the old authority apparatus in power means the collapse of the democratic regime." In a conference entitled the Jordanian Democratic Path, organized jointly by al-Urdun al-Jadid [New Jordan] Research Centre and Friedrich Ebert Foundation and held at the Forte Grand hotel, Mr. al-Nimri said that enormous restrictions were introduced by the laws enacted after the introduction of democracy in 1989 and they can only negatively influence the progress of democracy in the Jordanian society. These laws, he said, include the political parties law, the press and publications law, the defence law, the state security courts law, and the elections law. He said they include articles that can be used by the government to restrict freedoms. Mr. al-Nimri, who is a member of the leftist party Hashd said the press and publications law "was used to file numerous cases against newspapers for publishing articles that were meant to enhance freedoms of expression. "Those negative developments had decreased the people's interest in democracy and weakened the party life in the country which is not in favour of social and democratic growth." Mr. al-Nimri said. The president of the Writers Association, Mu'nis al-Razzazz, said one of the most important factors influencing the "relative Jordanian democratic openness" is the developments in the Palestinian issue. He said that Jordan's envisioned role in the process had hastened the introduction of democracy. Mr. al-Razzazz, Jordan's leading novelist and a leading columnist, pointed to several other factors that he considered crucial to the enhancement of democracy in Jordan. First, the failure of political parties in assuming a leading role in the Jordanian political life; setbacks that influenced the democratic march "that the country was not able to overcome were it not for the intervention of the King personally", the lack of participation of the intelligentsia in the civil society organisations such as Centre for the Study of Freedom, Democracy and human Rights in the Arab World. "And perhaps the recent dramatic developments of the Palestinian issue can be considered as key factors leading to this reversal," he concluded. Participants in the three-day conference sought to determine whether April 1987 riots were behind the introduction of democracy or not. Most said they feared a setback. "More than four decades have passed since the promulgation of the Constitution, and, during this period, the Jordanian society had developed politically, socially and economically that it became necessary to amend and introduce changes to certain articles," Sulayman Sweiss said during the evening session. Dr. Sweiss, a prominent human rights advocate, cited the election law, prisons law, the press and publications law and the labour law as legislations that include articles that contradict human rights principles, and, therefore, should be amended. "Official statements regarding human rights and democracy are almost close to slogans...what we direly need is serious and pragmatic steps and political will to translate official commitment to human rights into a reality," he added. According to Dr. Sweiss, a national strategy should be adopted to enhance and develop human rights causes. Such a strategy, he said, should include the appointment of a national commissioner to protect human rights; official response to complaints filed by human rights organisations; the introduction of human rights principles in the school curriculum; the establishment of centres for enhancing democracy and human rights; and drafting a comprehensive plan for legal reform in order to revise laws and legislations in conformity with human rights principles and conventions. Musa al-Kilani, chief editor of AL-DUSTUR newspaper, believes that the democratic process is going to be slow but steady. While pointing to several factors that hamper the enhancement of the democratisation process that he thought were beyond the government control, Dr. al-Kilani also criticised government hegemony over the media. "The most powerful weapon the government uses in its control of the radio and television and the Jordan News Agency (PETRA), which are all promoting the government's achievements and its decisions," Dr. al-Kilani said. "As for those newspapers that oppose the government's policies, the government resorts to old laws to punish them," he added. "It would be sufficient to know that there are currently 50 cases filed against newspapers"
