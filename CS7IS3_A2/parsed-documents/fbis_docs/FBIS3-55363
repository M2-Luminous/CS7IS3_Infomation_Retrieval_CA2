IF Note: The Russian party expressed its readiness to withdraw Russian troops from Latvia by August 31, 1994, under the provision that the radar station in the village of Skrunda would be preserved for 6 more years until a comparable facility was built in Russia. The radar station in Skrunda was built in 1967. It consists of four space tracking antennas, each 250 meters long, which allows monitoring of practically all of Europe and the North Atlantic. The Latvian government has commissioned the state delegation at the negotiations with Russia to agree to the time of the troops' final withdrawal, namely August 31, 1994. However, it believes that the treaty on the status of the radar station must provide for conditions of its exploitation only during its dismantling, but this is not reflected in the draft document prepared by the Russian party. The governmental press center reported that the Latvian party insists that dismantling of the reinforced concrete building of the station start immediately after the agreement is set into force, at the same time the station's major functional element, the detector, would continue its work. The government has also decided to propose an alternative time to use this site, however it will officially announce its proposal only by the beginning of the next round of Latvian-Russian talks. In addition, Latvia will propose its rent payment for the exploitation of the station. The government's press secretary, Sergey Antsupov, declared to Interfax that "the presence of alternative proposals and additional issues should not be viewed as Latvia's intention to torpedo Russia's initiatives." Meanwhile, Latvian scientists and biologists believe that the republic must present a report to Russia due to the harmful influence on people and the environment exerted by this strategic radar station in Skrunda. A report of the scientific council of Latvian Academy of Sciences' Biology Institute points out that "the detector's electromagnetic radiation adversely affects people's nervous system, disturbs their sleep, and results in a state of depression and lowering of people's working abilities." The report also enumerates data testifying to the detector's negative influence on flora and fauna. The scientists believe that further existence of the radar station on Latvian territory is inadmissible.
