This in turn makes it possible to consolidate the program of structural reforms carried out by this government, reforms that are propelling the country into international markets. The main macroeconomic objectives set by government officials are to reduce inflation to 19 percent, keep to the course of high economic growth of about 5 percent, limit the accumulation of reserves to $450 million, and maintain a balanced foreign exchange rate. Authorities are employing two types of measures to achieve these objectives: moderate adjustments in the minimum wage, official wages, and prices for goods and public services based on the goal of inflation set, and a mixture of macroeconomic policies put together by the Bank of the Republic and the government in order to achieve the goals mentioned, based on consistent monetary, fiscal, and exchange objectives. Both types of measures must be adopted. If the basic factors of inflation are not controlled, inflation will persist even if increases in wages and prices on goods and public services are held down. Inversely, if only traditional macroeconomic instruments are used, the rate of exchange will tend to be revalued as the result of an inertial behavior of wages and prices on nonadjustable economic goods. Prices and Wages In order to control wages and prices for goods and public services, the government launched its attack on several fronts. In terms of wages, increases took both inflationary goals and an anticipated 2-percent increase in the average productivity of workers into account. These considerations gave rise to the wage goals promoted by the government. In addition, the Ministry of Mines and Energy Regulatory Commission set 19 percent as the average increase in energy rates. Consistent with them, the Ministry raised the price of gasoline 19 percent. The minister of finance simultaneously requested and successfully obtained the cooperation of mayors in setting increases in public urban transport rates not exceeding the inflation goal set. In Bogota and Cali, for example, increases averaging 19 percent were authorized. Finally, leases, which are tied to the rate of inflation for the previous year, cannot increase by over 20.3 percent. Macro Policies A. Monetary policy: In the monetary area, the Bank of the Republic board of directors established M1 growth rates consistent with the anticipated rate of inflation and will use the instruments it has to stay within them. M1 growth is associated, on the one hand, with a demand for money consistent with inflationary goals and growth in the product and with moderate, stable interest rates. With respect to the money supply, the main sources of expansion are the accumulation of reserves, the liquidation of exchange certificates issued in the past for the purpose of blocking foreign exchange income, and the payment of interest by open market operations (OMAS). In order to control the supply of money, it will therefore be necessary to prevent an excessive accumulation of reserves, which makes it possible to reduce the need to use open market operations. For that purpose, the government will make a basic contribution, inasmuch as fiscal measures will limit the accumulation of reserves and facilitate the task of controlling inflation enormously. The measures mean a spending cut of .7 percent of the GDP and a decision to use resources from the fiscal surplus to prepay the foreign debt and invest abroad. In addition, the recently approved exchange measures will also make it easier to control means of payment by allowing fluctuations in the rate of exchange within a margin. The size of that margin does not allow the government to monetize the fiscal surplus or act as a de facto mechanism to control public spending. B. Fiscal policy: Within the context of modernizing the government and spending priorities set by the provisions of the new Political Constitution, this Administration has, during its four-year term, maintained balanced public finances, thus helping achieve goals in terms of inflation and growth. The government will pass on a very favorable fiscal balance in 1994 and a surplus amounting to 2 percent of the GDP. This figure results from presuming that revenue from the consolidated public sector will increase by 37.4 percent, a projection which, in addition to anticipated collections of the principal tax resources, incorporates receipts from taxation and collection campaigns undertaken by DIAN [National Tax and Customs Directorate], a conservative estimate of monies collected from the sale of assets (600 billion pesos), and revenue amounting to $1.2 billion from the cellular telephone concession. Total expenditures of the consolidated public sector will rise some 30.7 percent in 1994, 41.7 percent in the Central Government, and 25.2 percent in the decentralized sector. This growth is under that of the previous year (33.2 percent) and achieved by a .7-percent cut in the GDP approved by CONFIS [Fiscal Policy Council] at the end of December 1993 and the Council of Ministers in January of this year. At the top of the list of the Central Government's spending is investment, up 45 percent over the 1993 figure. Likewise, transfers will increase an estimated 42.6 percent as a result of the Law on Competencies and Resources (regulating constitutional precepts governing the fiscal situation and the participation of municipalities in the nation's regular receipts) and the payment of back pensions. The 45.3-percent increase in spending for personal services reflects this government's priorities in terms of strengthening internal security, the effectiveness of the judicial system, and the quality of the system of education via wage increases for police officers, the military, and judges, and the hiring of thousands of temporary teachers. As noted, the public sector's surplus will be earmarked for reducing liabilities by prepayment of the foreign debt and Treasury investments abroad. C. Exchange policy: The Bank of the Republic's board of directors has just modified the exchange system in order to make the monetary and exchange markets more transparent. Exchange certificates were eliminated, meaning that the exchange rate will now be freely determined by the market. Nevertheless, the Bank of the Republic will continue to put pressure on the dollar exchange rate. Such intervention will take the form of the buying and selling of foreign exchange on the market, the establishment of a margin with maximum buying and selling rates so that the exchange rate will fluctuate, and the divulgence of a very short-term indicative exchange rate reflecting the intentions of the Bank of the Republic with respect to exchange objectives. It is hoped that these measures will cause the the exchange rate to fall gradually in keeping with the goal set for inflation. Financial Consistency The projected fiscal surplus is consistent with the aforementioned goal in terms of building up reserves and an annual 37.5-percent increase in credit to the private sector. The Ministry of Finance has drafted a financial plan to determine the deficit that could be financed based on new prospects for the balance of payments and the sale of government assets. Compared with similar programs drafted in the past, the current plan was based on far more restrictive hypotheses, which suggests a broad margin of security in planning. In particular, assumptions included increased credit to the private sector, less growth in the holdings of financial entities, and a higher foreign private debt. It was also assumed that the sale of government assets and government revenue from the cellular telephone system will automatically reduce the capacity of the consolidated financial system to grant credits for uses other than the financing of such operations. This would happen because the private sector would have to borrow (domestically or abroad) or liquidate assets in order to finance the purchase of shares and pay cellular telephone duties. The main assumptions of the program were: 19-percent inflation, a 5-percent increase in the GDP, the accumulation of international reserves held by the Bank of the Republic amounting to $450 million, a 27-percent expansion in the private sector's portfolio (financial savings), a 37.5-percent increase in the credit granted by the consolidated financial system to the private sector, and a 28-percent increase in the financial sector's holdings (excluding the Bank of the Republic). The results of an analysis of macroeconomic consistency show that a fiscal surplus of 298 billion pesos, equivalent to 1.48 percent of the GDP, would have to be generated. The required surplus is smaller than that projected for the public sector, as previously noted. This means that, instead of excessive financial pressure from the public sector, we shall have a promising situation from the standpoint of credit available to the private sector, which in turn will permit growth in credit, and therefore in investment, far exceeding the anticipated growth in the GDP. Conclusions We believe that the picture described in this article ends once and for all last year's debate on uncontrolled public spending, and completely frees the government of any fiscal responsibility for any possible increase in the peso. The government has taken the necessary measures to guarantee exchange stability throughout the year and achieve the goal set for inflation. In contrast with the views of economic experts connected with the different political campaigns, the government believes firmly that inflation should steadily drop by the year to one-digit levels and has made a major fiscal adjustment in order to achieve this goal. However, what is perhaps of greatest political importance is that the program will not only provide a balanced fiscal administration, but a prosperous one as well. We are working to provide the next administration with resources and room to work financially. Turning the good prospects that we present into a reality will then depend on the Bank of the Republic's proper handling of monetary and exchange policies and on the fiscal responsibility of the next administration. We have done all we could on the fiscal and exchange fronts.
