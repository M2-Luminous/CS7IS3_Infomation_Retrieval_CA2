This explosion came after the failure to sabotage the gathering held in the city to mark the first anniversary of the assassination of former Prime Minister Rashid Karami and the explosion of vehicles in west Beirut. Judge Joseph Mi'mari, assistant government representative to the military court, charged 12 LF members with the following crimes: carrying out terrorist actions; detonating booby trapped vehicles in various parts of Lebanon; contacting the Israeli enemy and undergoing military training in its territories; and killing many people. The charges were made in accordance with Articles 5 and 6 of the 11/1/1948 Law, Articles 549/201, 278, and 463 of the Penal Code, and 72 weapons. [sentence as published] Most of these charges are punishable by the death sentence. Judge Mi'mari referred the following arrested defendants to the military investigation judge: Pierre Rizq, alias Akram; Samir Abu- Yunus, George Lawun, Tony Khuri, Hasan Fawwaz, Michel Istifan, Hadi Mas'ad, George Makhluf, Hadi Sham'un, 'Azar Mukhawwal, Ghayth Zaydan, and Joseph 'Antar. AL-SAFIR has learned that "Akram" was charged with ordering the liquidation of detained supporters of Minister Ilyas Hubayqah and throwing of their bodies on the main roads between Nahr Ibrahim, Juniyah, and Beirut. "Akram", an official in the LF security service, put those tasked with liquidating six of Hubayqah's supporters during the 27 September 1987 operation under observation to ensure that they would not hesitate in carrying out the order and hence prove their loyalty to LF leader Samir Ja'ja'. Michel Istifan was charged with planting a device in Tripoli on the first anniversary of the assassination of Rashid Karami. When the device did not explode, he changed the detonator "so as not to waste it," as he said, and planted the device in the city's vegetable market. Many traders and pedestrians were killed in the explosion. The others were charged with "liquidating" Lore al-Hashim and her husband when they tried to blackmail her after detonating a vehicle in the western sector of Beirut during the war.
