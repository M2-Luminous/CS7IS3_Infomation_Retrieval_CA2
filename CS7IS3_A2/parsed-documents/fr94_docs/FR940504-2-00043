Applicant proposes to acquire the above companies simultaneously with the proposed acquisition of Dreyfus by its subsidiary, Mellon Bank, N.A., which has filed a notice with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency regarding such proposed acquisition of Dreyfus. Applicant proposes to acquire DSSB, DTC, DRA, DPM, MTC, and DAC through a wholly owned subsidiary, MBC Investments Corporation (MBC), and to acquire Truepenny directly. Section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act provides that a bank holding company may, with Board approval, engage in any activity that the Board, after due notice and opportunity for hearing, has determined (by order or regulation) to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. This statutory test requires that two separate tests be met for an activity to be permissible for a bank holding company. First, the Board must determine that the activity is, as a general matter, closely related to banking. Second, the Board must find in a particular case that the performance of the activity by the applicant bank holding company may reasonably be expected to produce public benefits that outweight possible adverse effects. A particular activity may be found to meet the closely related to banking test if it is demonstrated that banks have generally provided the proposed activity; that banks generally provide services that are operationally or functionally similar to the proposed activity so as to equip them particularly well to provide the proposed activity; or that banks generally provide services that are so integrally related to the proposed activity as to require their provision in a specialized form. National courier Assn v. Board of Governors , 516 F.2d 1229, 1237 (DC Cir. 1975). In addition, the Board may consider any other basis that may demonstrate that the activity has a reasonable or close relationship to banking or managing or controlling banks. Board Statement Regarding Regulation Y (49 FR 806, January 6, (1984). In order to satisfy the proper incident to banking test, section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act requires the Board to find that the performance of the activities of the subsidiaries that Applicant proposes to acquire can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public, such as greater convenience, increased competition, or gains in efficiency that outweight possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest, or unsound banking practices. Applicant believes that the proposed activities will benefit the public by enabling Applicant to provide a broader range of services to its customers and thereby enhance Applicant's ability to compete and expand its participation in the investment advisory business. Applicant also believes that the proposed activities will not result in any unsound banking practices or other adverse effects.
