The article was written by the same authors who prepared the publication "The Amber Chamber for General Dunayev" in September 1993. The press center of the Kaliningrad Oblast Administration is authorized to make the following statement: 1. An inquiry into the facts contained in the aforementioned article was conducted by procuracy. The inquiry did not confirm that these facts were linked with the head of the Kaliningrad Oblast Administration [Yuriy Matochkin]. Y. S. Matochkin has brought an action against the newspaper KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA. Currently, the case is being investigated by the Krasnopresnenskiy people's court in Moscow. The respondent (KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA) has not appeared before the court for a single meeting. 2. After the head of the Oblast Administration had sued the newspaper, he received proposals through different channels to withdraw his action. Otherwise, they promised to launch a series of publications "unmasking" him. It is common knowledge that the authors of the given article were in Kaliningrad between February and March 1994, when they engaged in collecting "discrediting" information. The fact that the authors did not try to meet with either law enforcement officials or the head of the administration demonstrates their specific orientation. 3. Regarding the contents of the article, it does not contain a single new fact unknown to the public. The authors again return to the story about the funds and the establishment of the RIFK "Alliance." There are the decisions of the prosecutor, law enforcement institutions, and the Oblast Soviet of People's Deputies concerning these issues. 4. In our opinion, the emergence of this publication is a continuation of the planned campaign by a group of defeated local politicians and representatives of semi-Mafia and Mafia structures, seeking to seize power in the region. They must be eager to have a submissive person as oblast leader, so as to be able to engage in illegal operations unpunished. It is no accident that attacks on the head of the administration intensified after his attempts to impose order in the sale of amber, toughen controls on customs, and vitalize the tax policy. Given the fact that any calls for honesty and decency are meaningless with regard to the authors and those who ordered this publication, the head of the administration reserves the right to defend his honor and dignity through legal channels.
