FR940822-2-00079 FR940822-2-00054 NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION [Docket Nos. 50&hyph;424 and 50&hyph;425] Georgia Power Company, et al; Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating License Nos. NPF&hyph;68 and NPF&hyph;81 issued to Georgia Power Company, Ogelthorpe Power Corporation Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia, City of Dalton, Georgia (the licensee) for operation of the Vogtle Electric Generating Plant, Units 1 and 2, located in Burke County, Georgia. The proposed amendment would revise the values of Z and S for the Pressurized Pressure-Low and -High reactor trip setpoints (Technical Specification Table 2.2&hyph;1, Functional Units 9 and 10, respectively) to allow the use of alternate types of pressure transmitters. Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations. The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 1. Does the change involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated? The proposed change revises the allowances Z and S in Technical Specification Table 2.2&hyph;1 for the Pressurizer Pressure-Low and -High trip setpoints (Table 2.2&hyph;1, Functional Units 9 and 10) to allow the use of Tobar, Veritrak, or Rosemount pressure transmitters. Also, the corresponding values of Z and S for the Pressurizer Pressure-Low setpoint for safety injection actuation (Table 3.3&hyph;3, Functional Unit 1d) are bounding for these pressure transmitters. The allowances for Z and S are not assumed in any of the initiating events for the accident analyses. Therefore, the probability of any accident previously evaluated will not be affected by the proposed changes. Furthermore, the setpoints, allowable values, and total allowances are not affected. Since the total allowances are not affected, it is ensured that the safety analysis limits for the trips are not affected. Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the consequences of any accident previously evaluated. 2. Does the change create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated? The safety function provided by the reactor trips and safety injection actuation and the manner in which the plant is operated are not affected. The setpoints, allowable values, and total allowances are not affected. Since the total allowances are not affected, it is ensured that the safety analysis limits for the trips are not affected. Thus, this change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 3. Does this change involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety? For both the reactor trips and safety injection actuation, there are no changes to the setpoints. The total allowance for each setpoint is the difference between the safety analysis limit and the setpoint. Since the total allowances are not affected, there are no changes to the safety analysis limits. Therefore the proposed change will not involve a reduction in margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However, should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the 30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission take this action, it will publish in the Federal Register a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need to take this action will occur very infrequently. Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, and should cite the publication date and page number of this Federal Register notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville Maryland, from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555.
