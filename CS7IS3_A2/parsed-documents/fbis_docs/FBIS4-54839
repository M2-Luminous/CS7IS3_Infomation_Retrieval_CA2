He said he also wanted such relations with Serbia but added that it had to be done in a correct and moral way. He made the statement at an annual rally at the headquarters of the CNN television network in Atlanta which was devoted to foreign policy issues. Clinton declined, however, to give a straight answer to the question put by a Yugoslav journalist on whether the time had come to start treating equally all parties to the Bosnian conflict (Moslems, Serbs and Croats) and stop threatening the Serbs alone. The U.S. President said he was not inclined to the lifting of the U.N. sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) and added, as an argument, that Serbia had allegedly violated the U.N. embargo on arms deliveries and had been arming the Bosnian Serbs. Serbia sends to the Bosnian Serbs only humanitarian supplies which include food, medicaments and clothes, while the U.N. arms embargo is being violated by the he former Yugoslav Republics of Slovenia and Croatia, which are directly arming Bosnian Croats and Moslems and allowing the Islamic and some western countries to smuggle arms into Bosnia-Herzegovina through their territories. Clinton said he agreed that there could be no military solution to the Bosnian conflict and, in corroboration of the view, mentioned a Serb attempt to "gain advantage" in the eastern Moslem enclave of Gorazde. He overlooked the fact that Gorazde -- a U.N.-designated "safe area" which should have been demilitarised last spring -- had been abused by the Bosnian Moslems and used as a military stronghold for launching an offensive on Serb territories late in March. When the Serb side launched a counter-attack and the Moslems faced a total defeat, U.S. NATO warplanes bombed Serb positions around the town on April 10 and 11. Clinton said that the U.S. was trying to use NATO's air force to protect "safe areas" but that the chief objective was the return to the negotiating table. He stressed that the U.S. did not want to get involved in the Bosnian war on the Moslem side either alone or through NATO. Clinton said the U.S. Administration had conveyed to the Bosnian Moslem [word indistinct] that it could not expect support from the U.S. to change the military balance of forces and that a peaceful settlement was the only solution.
