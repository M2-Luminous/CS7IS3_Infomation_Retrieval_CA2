Only some newspapers and journalists entertained doubts on this score, he declared on Tuesday [25 January] at a meeting with his Belgian counterpart, Leo Delcroix. The Belgian defense minister expressed satisfaction in this connection, since, as he put it, Grachev presents "a stabilizing factor" in Russia. Grachev and Delcroix, who came to Moscow for an official visit, intend to discuss military cooperation between Russia and Belgium, the results of the recent meeting between the Russian and American presidents, problems connected with European security, the role played by NATO in this, and ways to heighten the effectiveness of nuclear non-proliferation. Addressing journalists, Grachev said that he intends to exchange views on the American Partnership for Peace concept with his Belgian counterpart. This initiative is interpreted differently in the world, he stressed. Some people believe that all the countries can join Partnership for Peace, others maintain that the concept is acceptable only to specific countries, and there are those who claim that the concept is designed to unite several countries against some third party, he noted. Grachev called for determining this issue once and for all, and said he hopes that Delcroix will present Russia's attitude at a session of NATO's Security Council. The two defense ministers also discussed the possibility of a joint visit to the former Yugoslavia. As Grachev said, the Russian and Belgian peace-keeping contingents deserve high praise from the international command. During his two-day trip to Russia, Delcroix is expected to visit Russia's strategic troops. He will be the first foreign defense minister, particularly representing NATO, to see Russia's strategic troops and their combat installations, Grachev said.
