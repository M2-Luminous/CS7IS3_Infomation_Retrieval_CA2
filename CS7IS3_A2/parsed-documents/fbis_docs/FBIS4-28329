The government will present the proposal in Japan-U.S. framework trade talks on government procurement, where the setting of objective criteria has been discussed as a way to gauge the openness of markets. The proposal says standards should be established to assess efforts to increase the transparency of government procurement, efforts by U.S. firms to enter Japanese markets, and their competitiveness. It stresses that the competitiveness of foreign firms should be judged by such criteria as the difference between bidding and contract price, and not by a comparison of a product's market share among the other G-7 nations, as the United States is demanding. The proposal also says records of procurement in each fiscal year will be used as a yardstick, but any increase over past figures should not be taken to mean "there was no increase in the past in the procurement of foreign products." Japan and the United States agreed at unofficial negotiations in May on an "increase in competitive foreign products" as a target for the Japanese Government's procurement of telecommunications and medical equipment. It was at the same meeting that the two countries decided to resume bilateral trade talks. The focal point of negotiations now is the assessment of competitiveness. Washington wants to use as a standard the share of foreign products purchased by government procurement in other G-7 nations, but Japan has rejected this, saying: "This would lead to the setting of numerical targets and violates the principle of giving equal treatment to both domestic and foreign products." The government compiled an outline of external economic reforms in March. The outline says a successful bidder will be determined on such points as quality and performance of the product, as well as the bidding price for part of the government procurement contracts valued at more than 800,000 SDRs (special drawing rights; a currency used by the International Monetary Fund -- about 152 million yen). The proposal Japan will present to the United States says the assessment points and the difference between a foreign firm's bid and the contract price will help assess competitiveness. If the difference is big and the assessment points are low, the company will be classified as uncompetitive. The proposal says the number of bids by foreign firms, the number of consultations with them before bidding, and the number of announcements of planned procurement bidding on the 10 most expensive items in the medical equipment field for national hospitals will serve to assess the transparency of government procurement. The proposal notes that Japan will work to increase transparency while urging U.S. firms to make efforts to enter Japanese markets.
