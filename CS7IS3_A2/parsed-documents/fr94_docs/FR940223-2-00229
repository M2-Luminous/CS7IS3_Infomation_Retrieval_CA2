FR940223-2-00229 FR940223-2-00104 d. Education. Transit ambassador participating in programs with the elderly and disabled will learn about the needs of those populations and will help to integrate them into mainstream society. In addition, if cooperative partnerships are formed with other Federal agencies such as the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Education, the Transit Ambassadors Program will provide aides for Head Start programs and help make children more ``school ready.'' In such a partnership, transit ambassadors will be able to work with children on the bus and in class, and provide information to them and their parents. 2.3.3␣Anticipated Outcomes and Results a. The program will benefit the local community and transit operators. Elderly and disabled citizens will be able to participate in the community. Transit Ambassadors will develop knowledge of needs of the populations served and increase skills for dealing with these populations. b. Disciplines learned in this program can be carried over into careers in the medical field, social services, transportation and education. 2.3.4␣Funding Funding for this proposal will be available from the Federal Transit Administration at an anticipated level of up to $235,000 for program costs. DOT intends to apply for any additional funds needed for program costs, including living allowances, educational awards, health insurance, and child care costs, from the National Service Corporation. It is anticipated that direct funding for the Transit Ambassadors Program may be available from DOT in future years. 2.3.5␣DOT Agency Involvement and Expertise Available The Federal Transit Administration will be the agency within DOT that will implement the Transit Ambassador Program. 2.3.6␣DOT Contact Roger Tate, Federal Transit Administration, Room 6100 A, 400 7th Street SW., Washington, DC 20590, Phone: (202) 366&hyph;0235. 2.4␣Operation Lifesaver 2.4.1␣Description of Program ``Operation Lifesaver'' is an active, continuous national public information and education program that works in conjunction with the DOT Federal Railroad Administration. This program provides help in preventing and reducing crashes, injuries and fatalities and in improving driver performance at the nation's 300,000 public and private rail/highway grade crossings. Operation Lifesaver originated in Idaho in 1972 after Union Pacific Railroad and community leaders in the state decided to band together and fight the growing number of rail/highway grade crossing crashes, injuries and fatalities with a public education program. At the end of the first year the rail/highway grade crossing fatality rate dropped a resounding 39 percent. The program is now national in scope as all states have their own Operation Lifesaver programs. It is at the grassroots level_in the cities, in rural communities, and in the schools_where Operation Lifesaver has been most effective. States have reported fatality reductions at rail/highway grade crossings ranging from 28 percent to 100 percent one year after establishing the program. There are two concepts through which Operation Lifesaver may be incorporated within the umbrella of the DOT National Service program: a. The first would use a community service organization to assess the number and location of railroad/street, road, and highway intersections within the defined geographic area. Based upon the data developed, the community service organization would be responsible for developing and presenting an educational program suitable for elementary schools, secondary schools, colleges, civic organizations, service organizations and fraternal groups. b. The second would address the provision of organizational and administrative assistance to the various state Operation Lifesaver offices through the recruitment and placement of assistant program coordinators. These individuals would enhance the ability of the State office to acquire information and establish geographic databases; organize and plan educational programs and campaigns; coordinate media initiatives and relationships; and systematize internal procedures and processes. This concept involves placement of individuals in single positions in a number of different states, and would be part of a multi-state program that would fall under the national service provisions of the Act. This portion of the program would be implemented incrementally based upon fiscal considerations. Organizations that could participate in the first concept include community service organizations eligible to participate under the National and Community Service Trust Act (see Section 1.4.1 of the RFP).
