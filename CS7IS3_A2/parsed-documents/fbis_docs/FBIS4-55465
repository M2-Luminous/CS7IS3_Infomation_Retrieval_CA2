As Bela Bugar said in an interview for SME, "The Hungarian parties had a chance to prove that they are able to cooperate. They have been unable to accomplish this in four years." The process of approving the formation of such a union by the political bodies of the participating parties cannot be completed by the time of the elections, in his opinion. In view of the fact that the Hungarian People's Party does not engage in any activity, according to Bugar, the MKDH proposes the formation of a coalition of three partners: MKDH-Coexistence-Hungarian Civic Party [MOS]. According to MOS spokesman K. Petocz, MOS is open to talks on any alternative and positively assesses the fact that Coexistence proposes something common for all ethnic Hungarian parties. As Petocz went on to say, however, MOS "does not consider it fortunate to come up, a few weeks before the elections, with proposals that are legally vague and the practical implementation of which is unclear." According to Petocz, the union would be the sole legal entity within which the present parties could operate only as some kind of factions. "We do not advocate the liquidation of pluralism within the framework of the Hungarian minority and do not consider it necessary," the MOS spokesman added.
