According to the leader of the Estonian delegation Vaino Reinart, Estonia is ready to sign the agreement and "the only obstacle to the signing is Russia's desire to link the problem to the provision of social guarantees to the Russian Army pensioners residing in the republic". The Russian delegation leader Vasili Svirin met Estonian President Lennart Meri on the eve of the today's round of negotiations. According to him, the results of their conversation provide grounds for the hope that the parties to the drawn-out "divorce procedure" between Russia and Estonia will be able to muster enough strength and desire to get down to the search for compromise solutions. "Russia pursues no military aims or interests in Estonia," Russian President Boris Yeltsin declared in the Kremlin on Wednesday. He stressed that "Russia intends to withdraw all troops from Estonia, but we want this to be done on a legal basis, as is being done in relations between Russia and Lithuania, Russia and Latvia". If Estonia manifests good-will, we for our part will respond with full accord", Yeltsin said. Negotiations behind closed doors will last for two days. After the end of this, the nineteenth round of negotiations, the heads of the delegations are expected to hold press conferences on the results of negotiations.
