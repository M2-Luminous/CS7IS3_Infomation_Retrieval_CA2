He largely refutes the idea that the Turkish reaction to the meeting of the Kurds in Saint-Josse was spontaneous. Other Events Have Passed Without Incident The minister stressed that the demonstration by the Union of Patriotic Intellectuals of Kurdistan, who arrived from Bonn, had been authorized by the German and Belgian authorities. The march through Liege and an overnight stay in Hasselt -- both towns with a high concentration of Turks -- passed without incident. The visit to Saint-Josse -- the militants were to occupy the Flemish cultural center in the rue de la Commune for four days -- should not have been any more cause for tension, believes Louis Tobback. Did not the proximity of a large Turkish community in the area suggest possible problems? The interior minister does not think so, arguing that larger pro-Kurdish events have already been organized in other areas of the capital where many Turks live and they went off without incident. What Good Would Banning Do? Is the unfurling of the Kurdish flag enough to explain the sudden eruption of violence by the Turks? The interior minister does not believe so; he does not accept that the street demonstration was a spontaneous event and suggests another analysis. "To my knowledge, the incidents were not provoked by the Kurds," explains the minister. "The clashes were not spontaneous. On the basis of the report by the gendarmery, I note that the Turkish demonstrators included many members of the far right organization known as the `Grey Wolves.' This was not by chance." The interior minister goes further and does not exclude the possibility that the clashes were provoked in Brussels in order to induce the government to ban the activities of the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] and its satellite organizations, as Germany and -- to a lesser degree -- France decided to do at the end of November and the beginning of December 1993. Could this outcome be envisaged in Belgium? Louis Tobback is very skeptical. "First of all, our constitution provides no legal basis to allow us to ban a political party. Secondly, what good would it do? It is not by banning the PKK that you will cause it to disappear. But if we can bring to light the offenses committed by its militants, we will then take the necessary sanctions against them."
