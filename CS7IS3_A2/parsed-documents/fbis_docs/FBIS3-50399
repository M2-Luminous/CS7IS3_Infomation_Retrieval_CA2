Perisic Denies Army Fighting in Bosnia LD3001165094 Belgrade TANJUG in English 1528 GMT 30 Jan 94 LD3001165094 Belgrade TANJUG Language: English Article Type:BFN ["Pool" item] [Text] Belgrade, Jan 30 (TANJUG) -- Army of Yugoslavia (VJ) chief of general staff, General Momcilo Perisic on Sunday denied the allegations that VJ units were fighting on the side of the Bosnian Serbs in the war-torn former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. I claim that not a single unit of the army of Yugoslavia has crossed into or is fighting in either the Serb republic (RS) (the state of the Bosnian Serbs) or in the republic of Serb Krajina (RSK) (The serb state within the administrative borders of the former Yugoslav Republic of Croatia)," [quotation marks as received] General Perisic said on Radio Kragujevac. He said there was no organized departure of the Army of Yugoslavia for the RS, and there would be none in the foreseeable future. The U.N. and the U.S. Administration, themselves, have said that there is no evidence that VJ units are engaged in the fighting in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Asked to comment the NATO threats that it will launch air strikes against Bosnian Serb positions, General Perisic said he did not think the air strikes would take place since he said what was involved were threats and pressure from the architects of the so-called new world order. The VJ chief of general staff said the use of any significant forces in the air in Bosnia-Herzegovina would produce small results militarily and would not secure the desired goal. If such strikes are launched, however, I think that Serbs in the RS, especially their military leaders, are wise enough to avoid the strikes, that is, place themselves in a position in which they would maximally be protected, General Perisic said. Asked about the possibility of the war spilling over into the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Perisic said the forces which had undertaken to destroy the states on the territory of the former Yugoslavia wanted to apply the same scenario to the territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia using, among other things, on the basis of the same principle applied so far, internal factors which have directly placed themselves in the service of those forces and were working for their interests. It is for that reason that the situation in the F.R.Y. is very complex, and it is only thanks to the extremely wisely conducted policy that the scenario has not been applied on its territory. We must constantly be aware of that, of the fact that the enemy's ultimate goal is to place the Serb and Montengrin peoples in the position of the Palestinian people, that is, of a people without its own state. It is quite clear to everyone what has been and what is the faith of peoples with no state, General Perisic set out. Asked whether it was possible for the war to escalate and spread to other parts of the Balkans, General Perisic said the architects of the "new world order" had caused the war on the territory of the former Yugoslavia and for the time being, since the war had acquired such proportions and gotten out of their control, they feared the most that it could acquire proportions which would threaten Europe and the world. Faced with the unexpected resistance by the Serb people on the territory of the former Yugoslavia, the architects of the "new world order" are now afraid of a war on a larger scale, all the more so since they can no longer control it, just as they cannot Croatia's intervention on Bosnia-Herzegovina territory, or the activities of Muslim forces, General Perisic said. Roughly 60,000 of Croatia's regular army troops have been engaged in the civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina since it broke out in April 1992. The three warring sides in Bosnia-Herzegovina are the local Muslims, Serbs and Croats.
