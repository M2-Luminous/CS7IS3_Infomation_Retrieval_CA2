How to ensure the healthy development of the socialist market economy and promote a sustained, stable, and speedy development of the socialist economic construction are important problems confronting us. Modern economic theories believe: To ensure normal operation of the market economy, it is necessary to carry out macroeconomic regulation and control over the market. By macroeconomic regulation and control, it refers to regulation and control by the government over market operations, and is intervention by the government in the course of operations of the economy as a whole. For economic operations to reach a scheduled state, it is the conduct of carrying out regulation and control over national or social economic activities by comprehensive use of various means of regulation proceeding from the overall situation of the national economy. In his work "General Study of Employment, Interest, and Money" published in 1930, the well-known British economist John M. Keynes, in light of the failure of market economic setups that purely relied on the laissez-faire market regulation of economic operations, put forward the theory of expanding government functions of intervention in economic affairs and standardizing them. If we make a comprehensive survey of the history of development of the market economy and the practices of China's economic development, the socialist market economy likewise should not deviate from government macroeconomic regulation and control. I. The Building and Development of the Market Economy Should Not Deviate From Government Macroeconomic Regulation and Control The market economy emerged and developed in the capitalist society, and promoted a major development of capitalism, but the intrinsic contradictions of the capitalist society also became acute. By the early 19th century, periodic economic crises began to appear as one of the basic contradictions of the capitalist society. It later became increasingly acute, resulting in the closing down of factories. In 1929-1930, major crisis broke out in the Western world, the Great Depression led to an unprecedented social disaster of capitalism during peacetime, and various contradictions of capitalist society were thoroughly exposed. U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt put into practice the New Deal, and the administration intervened in the market economy, thus resulting in a turn for the better in the U.S. economy. The macroeconomic management theory represented by Keynes's "General Survey" was also gradually accepted by Western countries, and various governments carried out macroeconomic regulation and control over their economies by fiscal and monetary policies, and other means. These measures could not eliminate the basic contradictions of capitalist society, but greatly relaxed its periodic economic crises and social and class contradictions. Furthermore, powerful postwar tides of scientific and technological revolution not only made capitalism survive, but still have considerable vitality. Now the market economies of Western countries are fairly developed, but government macroeconomic regulation and control have never stopped. These countries intervene in economic operations by constantly making use of interest rates, tax policy, and other economic means, and provide a certain guarantee for the development of the national economy. This indicates that whether in an initial or highly developed stage, the market economy should not deviate from macroeconomic regulation and control. The socialist market economy which China is speedily cultivating and developing is different from the capitalist market economy, but the former too has general character with the latter. In November, 1979 when he met with (Gypney), deputy chief editor of the Encyclopedia Britannica, Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "It is definitely incorrect to say that the market economy is limited only to the capitalist society, thus the capitalist market economy. Why cannot socialism go in for the market economy? The market economy had rudiments during the period of the feudal society; socialism can also go in for the market economy." The socialist market economy, he believed, is basically similar to the capitalist market economy in method, but it is also different in the relation between ownership by the whole people, relations between collective ownership, and relations with foreign capitalist countries. But in the final analysis, it is socialist, the market economy of a socialist country. In his talks during his inspection tour of southern China, Comrade Deng Xiaoping clearly put forward that both planning and market were economic means. In terms of operational mechanism, there is no difference in the market economy under the two kinds of social system. If there should be any difference, it is not a matter of the market economy itself, but is brought by the basic feature of two kinds of social system. China is a developing socialist country, with relatively backward productive forces and unbalanced economic development. China's national conditions and its present stage of economic development require that China should all the more attach importance to strengthening and improving macroeconomic regulation and control. At present, China's socialist market economy is in its initial stage of development, its economic structure has not been rationalized, and new contradictions and problems have appeared in the course of economic development. Therefore, in developing the market economy, China must strengthen and improve macroeconomic regulation and control, should draw on the useful practices of capitalist countries in market control and their successful experiences in market regulation, and carry out effective macroeconomic regulation and control over the market economy. II. To Carry Out Macroeconomic Regulation and Control Is the Intrinsic Requirement for the Operational Mechanism of the Market Economy The market allocation of resources is generally achieved by bringing into play the functions of the competitive mechanism and the changes in the supply and demand relations according to the requirement of the law of value. By sensitive price signals and constant competitive pressure, it can promote the superior ones and the inferior ones will be eliminated, coordinate supply and demand relations, and effectively allocate resources. However, there are also unavoidable defects in market allocation, which itself has weak points and negative factors. For ensuring the equilibrium of the total economy, preventing drastic economic functions, rationally restructuring the economy, carrying out fair competition, preventing a wide gap between the rich and the poor, for ecological balance and environmental protection, and the relations between fairness and efficiency, it either does a poor job or is incapable of action. Market regulation has a certain blindness, and will easily give rise to economic fluctuation. Market regulation is a kind of local regulation, and it is impossible for it to achieve a comprehensive balance of the macroeconomics. Market regulation is a regulation of actual resources, and cannot bring into play the potential superiority of resources. It is a regulation of productive activities and cannot automatically regulate the social target of fair income distribution. Market regulation can only regulate the allocation of economic resources, and some nonproductive departments cannot carry out market regulation. It is impossible for market regulation to affect nonmarket behavior and it cannot safeguard fair market competition. Therefore, market regulation requires intervention by the state and the government, and requires constant macroeconomic regulation and control. Market without planning is incompatible with the increasingly socialized commodity economy. In building the system of the socialist market economy, we should better integrate planning as the means of regulation with the market. In the course of allocating resources, whatever problems can be solved by the market will be solved by the market; whatever cannot be managed or managed well by the market will be managed by the government through policies and planning. The modern market economy not only does not exclude government intervention and planning guidance, but also remedies the defects of the market by drawing support from and relying on them. This is what we should never forget even for a moment in shifting from the planned economy to the market economy, far less should we completely abandon planning as the means of macroeconomic regulation and control whenever we talk about the market economy. It seems once we talk about planning we are "taking the old road." When we say we should strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control, it absolutely does not mean to return to the old mandatory methods commonly used in the past under the unitary planned economy system, but to regulate the supply and demand equilibrium, the direction of funds investments, social distribution, and regional differences by interest rate, tax rate, exchange rate, prices, and industrial policies by using primarily economic means, legal means, and necessary administrative means that conform with the economic law of the market economy, and to standardize and constrain the behavior of the economic subject and the order of market activities by speeding up the legalization of economic work. We should take necessary administrative means to solve those problems of confused economic orders caused mainly by administrative behavior. Of course, this is not to replace economic means, but to ensure the implementation of economic means by administrative means. III. To Proceed From China's Practical Situation and Seriously Strengthen Macroeconomic Regulation and Control The development of China's market economy is different from that of the market economy in capitalist countries. They take different roads and have their own characteristics in macroeconomic regulation and control. The market economies of Western countries have experienced the process from laissez-faire development to constant government intervention. China's market economy has experienced a rather complicated historical process and has gone through an ever-intensifying process of gradual advance from taking on all economic affairs by the state and carrying out the management system of highly centralized planned economy to reform and opening-up and gradual establishment of the system of the socialist market economy. The planned economy management system China carried out during the early period after the founding of New China played a gigantic role in the rapid recovery of the national economy. However, with social and economic development, the drawbacks of the planned economy system also became increasingly apparent and seriously obstructed the development of social productive forces. Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Congress, the CPC put forward the theory of planned commodity economy, carried out the policy of reform and opening-up, vigorously developed the socialist commodity economy, and gradually reduced the state plans, especially mandatory plans. Based on the development of the commodity economy, the CPC then proceeded to put forward in time the theory of building the system of the socialist market economy, and cultivated and developed with great efforts the socialist market economy, thereby energetically promoting the development of the productive forces. This is a road entirely different from the building and development of the market economy in Western countries. Therefore, we must carry out effective regulation and control by combining with China's practical situation in the light of the characteristics of the socialist market economy. China accumulated rich experiences in macroeconomic management over decades of economic work in the past, which makes it possible for China not only to carry out macroeconomic regulation and control over the socialist market economy, but also to yield more fruitful results than the measures for macroeconomic regulation and control introduced in the Western countries. At present, China's socialist market economy is still in its initial stage of development, there is a process of transforming from the old to the new system, various kinds of relations still require further straightening out, and it is inevitable that drawbacks and problems will appear in economic development. But these are contradictions and problems in the course of development; they can only be overcome and solved by further in-depth reform and seriously strengthening macroeconomic regulation and control. It also determines that we must now still use necessary administrative means to guide the market when strengthening macroeconomic regulation and control, and escort economic development. We must further strengthen the building of the legal system, build up and improve as soon as possible the legal system of the socialist market economy, and try our best to rely on and use economic and legal means to regulate and control regular economic operations, thus creating a set of theories and methods for macroeconomic regulation and control over the market economy with Chinese characteristics, and ensuring that the socialist market economy will forge ahead along a healthy course.
