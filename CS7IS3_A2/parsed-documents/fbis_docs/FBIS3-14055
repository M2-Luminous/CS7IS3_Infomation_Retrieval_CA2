[words indistinct] outlaws have been receiving arms secretly and they think that United States and its alliance are the source of these arms. The British journalist goes on to say that Washington has offered the green light to one of its allies in the area to provide arms to the outlaws' movement from the American arms stores following the Gulf war. He pointed out that the plane which is now in Cyprus is a part of the campaign to overcome the lack of arms in the outlaws' hands, adding that the eyewitnesses said they had seen a number of trucks carrying arms in the borders.
