"Apoyo's" survey results show that Fujimori currently is behind Javier Perez de Cuellar in popularity, as the firm Mercadeo & Opinion reported on 20 March in an article published by LA REPUBLICA in its Sunday magazine. This time "Apoyo" gives Perez de Cuellar a 44 percent support rating while Fujimori gets 40 percent. Mercadeo & Opinion established that 47 percent of eligible voters would support the former U.N. secretary general while 38 percent would support Fujimori. Fujimori's support rating is the lowest since he was sworn in on 28 July 1990. The survey by "Apoyo," however, obtains different results when people are asked about the president's performance. A total of 61 percent of those questioned approve Fujimori's performance while only 30 percent disapprove it. This means that many of those who support Fujimori in general terms would choose Perez de Cuellar as the presidential successor despite the fact that the illustrious diplomat is staying away from the electoral infighting and still has not said if he will accept an eventual nomination for the presidency of the Republic. The "Apoyo" survey also shows other interesting results in regards to other possible candidates who might run against Fujimori if he runs for reelection. Fujimori would defeat Ricardo Belmont 49 percent to 26 percent; Fernando Belaunte Terry, 54 percent to 20 percent; and Luis Caceres, 55 percent to 17 percent. If voters have to choose between several candidates at the same time, Fujimori also will win. "Apoyo" says that in this case Fujimori would obtain 40 percent; Perez de Cuellar, 30 percent; Belmont, 10 percent; and Belaunte, 6 percent. All this figures were aired on 20 March during the news program "Panorama" broadcast by Channel 5. The data probably will be analyzed and discussed by politicians and the people in general.
