First, there was the announcement last week by American Ambassador Lawrence Pezzullo, special delegate on the Haitian crisis of the U.S. secretary of state, of the arrival of the humanitarian oil shipment for 12 January. The United States then announced at the last minute, on 11 January, the postponement of the shipment, with no explanation. This morning, an OAS spokesman made an announcement to the contrary. There is therefore confusion on the arrival of the shipment.
