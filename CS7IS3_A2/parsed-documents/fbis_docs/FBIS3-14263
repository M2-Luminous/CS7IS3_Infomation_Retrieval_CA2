Whether we accepted or rejected al-Sadat's initiative at the time -- and it had its fair share of regional and international analyses -- its results may be deemed satisfactory if we consider the current situation and how, although the secret Oslo talks expedited the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations, serious concessions have been made giving Israel control of the situation in view of the weakness of the Palestinian position, which is what Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad warned of when he said that the consequences would be devastating for the status of the Palestinians and for their rights to their land, to a state, and to repatriation. [passage omitted] If the al-Ibrahimi mosque massacre has removed the last Israeli fig leaf, it has also exposed the Palestinian weakness in the eyes of the peacemakers, so much so that U.S. President Clinton did not hesitate to declare Jerusalem Israel's capital and to block any UN Security Council resolution condemning the massacre, a fact which has set back the peace clock because the criteria have moved in the opposite direction through the actions of the prime peace sponsor. That outcome has so stunned and embarrassed the Palestinians that they called for a meeting of the Cordon States, which was tantamount to an admission of the bitter reality they had been driven to through uncalculated peace steps. Even assuming that the U.S. President was trying to rearrange his mental and political state in the face of his financial scandals, he did utter what he said he would during his election campaign -- thereby indicating that he was keeping his promise to Israel and that the Arabs should close this subject in peace negotiations to come later in the more distant future.
