FR940607-0-00046 FR940607-0-00016 Line pipe research has demonstrated that 125 percent of MOP is the minimum test level adequate to protect hazardous liquid pipelines against failure in operation from physical defects. A pressure test at this level for a sufficient duration provides a 25 percent proven margin of safety against failures caused by the growth of physical defects. Under §195.302, new steel pipelines must be pressure tested to provide at least a 25 percent proven margin of safety. Hazardous liquid pipelines must be pressure tested hydrostatically, but carbon dioxide pipelines may be tested pneumatically, using inert gas or carbon dioxide as the test medium (see §195.306). Portions of existing steel pipelines that are replaced, relocated, or otherwise changed are also subject to this pressure testing requirement. The requirement became effective as follows for pipelines subject to part 195: January 8, 1971, for interstate pipelines transporting hazardous liquid (35 FR 17183); August 1, 1977, for interstate offshore gathering lines transporting hazardous liquid (41 FR 34039); October 21, 1985, for intrastate pipelines transporting hazardous liquid (50 FR 15895); and July 12, 1991, for pipelines transporting carbon dioxide in a supercritical state (56 FR 26922). Section 195.302 also requires that certain older pipelines transporting highly volatile liquids (HVL) must have at least a 25 percent proven margin of safety. These pipelines are onshore steel interstate pipelines constructed before January 8, 1971, and onshore steel intrastate pipelines constructed before October 21, 1985. If an older HVL pipeline has not been hydrostatically tested to part 195 standards, §195.302(b) permits operators to provide the proven margin of safety either by hydrostatic testing or by establishing the pipeline's MOP under §195.406(a)(5) at 80 percent or less of a qualified prior test or operating pressure. Establishing MOP under §195.406(a)(5) and hydrostatic testing to part 195 standards provide equivalent proven margins of safety. Apart from these older HVL pipelines, the 25 percent proven margin-of-safety requirement does not apply to older pipelines constructed before the dates (stated above) the pressure testing requirement went into effect for new pipelines. Consequently, many older pipelines subject to part 195 are not operated with a minimum 25 percent proven margin of safety. It was not common industry practice to test to at least 125 percent of MOP or to test to that pressure level for a sufficient duration. Notice of Proposed Rulemaking Older pipelines that do not have a minimum 25 percent proven margin of safety are more susceptible to failures from defect growth in service than pipelines that meet the part 195 pressure testing requirements. They are also more susceptible to failure from defect growth during instances of overpressure permitted by §195.406(b). This increased potential for failure is prevalent in pipelines made of pre-1970 electric resistance welded (ERW) pipe. RSPA's pipeline accident statistics show the benefits of requiring older pipelines to have a minimum 25 percent proven margin of safety. September 15, 1985, was the date by which onshore interstate pipelines constructed before January 8, 1971, that transport HVL had to have a minimum 25 percent proven margin of safety. By that date these pipelines had to have been pressure tested hydrostatically to part 195 requirements or operated at 80 percent or less of a qualified prior test or operating pressure. To learn the effect of the 25-percent-safety-margin requirement, RSPA compared the period for which accident data were available before the requirement was adopted with the period from September 15, 1985, through December 31, 1989. Onshore HVL interstate pipelines had a 68 percent lower rate of failure from material defects and corrosion during the latter period. RSPA attributed this dramatic drop in failure rate to the 25-percent-safety-margin requirement imposed on the older onshore HVL interstate pipelines. In addition, RSPA concluded that operators could achieve a comparable reduction in failure rate on all other older pipelines subject to part 195 that lack an adequate proven margin of safety.
