Yesterday the ruling military regime of Sanaa initiated battles around Aden by means of its (?brutal) forces and used all kinds of destructive weapons. However, our Armed Forces and the masses of our people were lying in wait for the brutal enemy. They engaged the enemy with rare courage and legendary steadfastness and inflicted on the invading and aggressive forces crushing blows. They prevented the advance of the enemy forces and inflicted on them the following losses: the destruction of 25 tanks; 12 manned military vehicles, as well as other weaponry and equipment. They seized seven tanks. The enemy also suffered hundreds of dead and wounded. One of those taken prisoner by our forces said that the commanders of the destructive war against our people told them that the first commander of a tank who manages to enter Aden will be appointed governor of Aden. He also said other things which we do not need to talk about now. This morning the forces of the ruling military regime in Sanaa resumed their aggressive operations and their repeated attempts at attacks. The battles are still continuing. The morale of our forces is high and their confidence in victory is unlimited. God is great.
