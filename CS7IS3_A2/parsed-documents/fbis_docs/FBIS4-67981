The source said Fatah fighters are still practicing resistance to pressure the Israelis and are carrying out military operations. The source said that the person who carried out the 'Afula operation was from Fatah [see 13 April Terrorism Report]. Last week, the chief of the Israeli police said that the Palestinian youth who carried out an operation in Jerusalem was a Hamas member, but it turned out later that he was a Fatah supporter who wanted to avenge the death of a friend killed by the Israelis a few days before near Jerusalem.
