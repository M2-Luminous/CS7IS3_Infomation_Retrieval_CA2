FBIS4-4487 "dreas063_c_94006" FBIS-EAS-94-063 Daily Report 1 Apr 1994 North Korea Daily Criticizes Kim Yong-sam's Japan Trip Daily Criticizes Kim Yong-sam's Japan Trip SK0104061594 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0542 GMT 1 Apr 94 SK0104061594 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN ["Disgraceful Behavior of Flunkeyist Traitor" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, April 1 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim Yong-sam at "talks" with Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa a few days ago raved that his group "has striven to find a peaceful solution through dialogue" with the DPRK, that there "is a limit to patience" and that "the young people who are not swayed by the sentiments of the past should take the lead" in "upgrading the relations" between Japan and South Korea. MINJU CHOSON today brands this as a mean behavior of the flunkeyist traitor who tries to maintain power in league with outside forces, estranged from the nation. The analyst says: Still more intolerable is that the traitor Kim Yong-sam tried to completely cover up the crime-woven history of Japan, closing his eyes to it. Last year the traitor Kim Yong-sam invited Hosokawa to Seoul and assured the latter that he would make a clean sheet of the crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists against the Korean people in the past in reward for Japan's intensified clamor over the nuclear issue and cried for the "development of new future-orientated relationship". This time, he flew to Japan and flatteringly proposed it to promote from a new angle the "development of relations", not allowing Japan's crime-woven past to "affect the future." The humiliating act of the traitor Kim Yong-sam is an intolerable challenge to the unanimous demand of the Korean people that Japan properly liquidate its past. Far from asking the past crimes of the Japanese imperialists, he voluntarily proposed that they should no more be brought forward. This reveals the sinister intention of the traitor, a pro-American stooge, to carry his anti-DPRK scheme into practice at any cost, with the "help" of Japan. In other words, he intends to inveigle Japan with the United States into the "international cooperation system" by all means and step up his treacherous acts with the patronage of his U.S. and Japanese masters. History shows that those who committed treacheries, clinging to outside forces, are sure to face a stern judgement by the people. The destiny of Kim Yong-sam, a despicable flunkeyist traitor, cannot be otherwise.
