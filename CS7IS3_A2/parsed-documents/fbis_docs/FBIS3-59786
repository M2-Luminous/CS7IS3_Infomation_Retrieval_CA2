Yamamoto) recently released a report detailing its mid- to long-term vision of business activities over the next five years. The report touched on a number of key areas it considers to be important for the future. In the area of nuclear power, the report discussed making light-water reactor technology more sophisticated and developing and evaluating new FBR (fast-breeder reactor) technologies. In the area of fossil energies, it mentioned research on developing methane hydrate, the development of low-temperature carbonization methods for low-grade coal, research on perfecting effective uses for asphalt by-products (excess C-grade heavy oil), and research for developing methods to make low-polluting fuels (emulsion fuels) from ultra-heavy oil. The first mid- to long-term vision report was created in 1987, but now five years later, with a staff of more than 50 people and a budget for its programs reaching Â¥1.2 billion, a complete revision of its projects was in order. The mid- to long-term vision report said the Institute of Applied Energy Research was the leading research organization in Japan in the field of energy engineering. It said that the institute was committed to providing the most far-sighted and best possible research to meet the demands of both the public and private sector. In terms of business activities, the institute is involved with the following: (1) Collecting and evaluating data on energy technologies (2) Conducting surveys on energy technologies and setting directions of growth (3) Proposing policies and strategies for developing energy technologies (4) Conducting international exchange programs, and sponsoring educational programs related to energy technologies The key research projects covered areas such as nuclear energy, fossil fuel energy, new energy and/or energy systems, or those that combine one or another of the above areas. The research projects were further subdivided into those that have already begun, those with short-term goals, and those with long-term goals. Nuclear power is expected to become the main source of energy by the 21st century, but because of the strong anti-nuclear sentiments in Japan, the institute says it will work harder to make light-water reactor technology more refined and sophisticated by trying to depict nuclear reactors as beneficial and not dangerous. Another important area of research is finding a quick solution to the problem of treating and disposing of high-level radioactive wastes. In the area of fossil fuel energies, the institute plans to continue working on research to perfect the natural gas/methanol cycle, and at the same time promote research on methane hydrates, which are non-conventional sources of natural gas, by the electric power and gas companies. With respect to coal, the institute wants to subject coals such as lignite and brown coal to thermal decomposition and develop a low-temperature carbonization method for making a low-grade coal in which a 15% gasoline-diesel distillate and a 60% low-temperature coke (equal to average coal) can be obtained. By doing this, the institute hopes to use spontaneous combustion to find effective uses for brown coal resources which are hard to transport over great distances. As for oil, in addition to looking for ways to perfect uses for asphalt by-products, the institute will continue its research on developing a high-efficiency garbage burning generation system that uses oil. In terms of expanding the range of uses for super-heavy oil, it plans to develop emulsion fuels from asphalt distillates and tar sand by dispersing super-heavy oils in water, or conversely, dispersing water within super heavy oil, mixing this with calcium ions to improve combustibility, so that it can be used to desulfurize reactor cores.
