He stressed that European integration, which also guarantees the country's stability, will remain a cornerstone of Hungarian policy even after spring elections, as it is based on the complete consensus of all parliamentary parties and the whole of society. EU association means modernization and protection for Hungary, and a market to the western half of Europe, Goncz said. The agreement is seen as an opportunity for beginning substantive political dialogue and boosting economic cooperation. "Cooperation with our neighbours, mainly the Visegrad group, is indispensable during the process of integration as well as at membership stage. Unification sets an example of cooperation for all countries in the region," the president said. The meeting and the subsequent gala dinner were attended by Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky and International Economic Relations Minister Bela Kadar.
