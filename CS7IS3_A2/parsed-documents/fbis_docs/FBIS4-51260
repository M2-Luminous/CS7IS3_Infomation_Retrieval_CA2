The campaign, which will be initiated this year, is aimed at providing guidance to enterprises on tapping their potential, improving quality in an all-round way, better adjusting themselves to the market, and competing in the market. A State Economic and Trade Commission spokesman recently briefed reporters on the campaign's purpose and demands. He said: The purpose of launching the campaign is to proceed steadily in establishing a modern enterprise system in accordance with the need to develop a socialist market economy so as to lay the microeconomic groundwork for the market economy. Through the campaign, we will strive to raise or improve, with appreciable results, enterprises' technical and economic indexes for product development, quality, energy and raw materials consumption, capital turnover, and safety over the next two to three years. We will raise the leading economic and technical indexes of more enterprises, bring them up to or close to advanced international levels. Deficit-ridden enterprises will reduce their losses or turn losses into profits, and the general level of enterprise management will reach a new high. We will bring about remarkable improvements in managing basic affairs, financial matters, on-site operations, general affairs, and operating and marketing matters. Enterprises, which are basically well-managed and outfitted with advanced technology and equipment, should move toward advanced international levels in operation-related management. The spokesman said: To assess the campaign's results, we will generally adopt the single-index listing format. Each year, all localities and departments will list, index by index, the results of given industries as measured against specified evaluation criteria; they will then publish the results.
