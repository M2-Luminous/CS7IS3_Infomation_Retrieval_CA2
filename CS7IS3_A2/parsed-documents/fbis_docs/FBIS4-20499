The five research achievements judged by the experts as meeting 1990s international standards were all realized by the University of Electronic Science & Technology of China (UESTC). They are: a multichannel dynamic parametric real-time processing system, a HTS microwave resonator, a miniature HTS microstrip antenna and testing technology, a HTS filter, and HTS thin-film microwave surface-resistance high-accuracy measurement technology. The other seven achievements are: digital storage oscilloscope (DSO) technology developed by MEI's Institute 41, a 1.55-�m high-stability laser light source, a 1.5-�m optical time-domain reflectomer (OTDR), a HTS microstrip resonator developed by MEI's Institute 55, MEI Institute 13's technology for fabricating HTS thin-film-based microwave devices, [a microwave broadband low-noise mixer,] and the LA64100 logic analyzer developed by UESTC.
