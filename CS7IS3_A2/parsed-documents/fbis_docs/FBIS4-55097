Speaking during a pause in the council's deliberations, Klaus said the council "is afraid of creating complex electoral systems existing at one place somewhere in the world" and was resolutely opposed to it. The ODS Executive Council has recommended to create a comprehensible, clear system providing for one-round voting if possible, in which the winner of the biggest number of votes would be elected senator, Klaus said. He allowed for the two-round variant. The other three coalition parties, the Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA), the Christian Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-CSL) and the Christian Democratic Party (KDS), had favoured the creation of 27 "three-mandate" districts, each of which would send three senators to the new house. After a meeting of the four parties' chairmen last week, Klaus said the parties were now inclining to the opinion that elections to the as yet unformed Senate should take place in 81 one-mandate constitutions in a direct majority system. Klaus said today the Executive Council would not order party leaders to "run for the Senate at any cost if they prefer running for the Chamber of Deputies two years later." He called the chamber a much more important instrument of the Czech Republic's parliamentary system. The Senate elections will probably be held in the autumn, when also local elections are slated to be held. Elections to the Chamber of Deputies are to be held in 1996.
