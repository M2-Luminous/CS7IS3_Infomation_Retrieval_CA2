As Foreign Ministry spokesman Michael Gerdts affirmed, he will have a discussion with State Secretary Dieter Kastrup. The summons, which in diplomatic jargon usually means the presentation of a complaint, is a very unusual event in connection with the ambassador of the neighboring country, with which relations are very close and friendly. It is obviously supposed to express Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel's annoyance with Scheer's confidential comments to a small circle of journalists on Tuesday. Scheer had regretted the lack of frequency in German-French consultations and cautiously implied shock about Germany's tone at European Union meetings, also among smaller partners. His statements were disseminated without citing him by name. Ambassador Scheer had wanted in any case to discuss with the Foreign Ministry preparations for Kinkel's visit to Paris in the near future. On Wednesday evening, a Foreign Ministry official still emphatically denied that the formal summons was something completely unusual between friendly states.
