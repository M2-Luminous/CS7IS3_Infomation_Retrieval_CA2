FR940707-2-00168 FR940707-2-00092 [Docket Nos. 50&hyph;438; 50&hyph;439] In the Matters of Tennessee Valley Authority (Bellefonte Nuclear Plant, Units 1 and 2) Order I Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA or the applicant) is the current holder of Construction Permit Nos. CPPR&hyph;122 and CPPR&hyph;123, issued by the Atomic Energy Commission on December 12, 1974, for construction of the Bellefonte Nuclear Plant (BLN), Units 1 and 2. These facilities are currently under construction at the applicant's site on a peninsula at Tennessee River Mile (TRM) 392 on the west shore of Guntersville Reservoir, about 6 miles east-northeast of Scottsboro, Alabama. On April 19, 1994, the TVA filed a request pursuant to 10 CFR 50.55(b) for extensions of the completion dates. The extensions were sought because construction activities had been deferred in 1988 due, in part, to a lower than expected load forecast. On March 23, 1993, TVA notified NRC that it planned to resume completion activities 120 days from the date of the letter. However, as a result of the delay from the inactivity during the construction deferral and a need to conduct an Integrated Resource Planning (IRP) process to consider the lowest-cost options for providing an adequate supply of electricity to TVA's customers pursuant to the provisions of the Energy Policy Act of 1992, TVA is unable to complete the construction of the two units before the expiration of CPPR&hyph;122 on July 1, 1994, and CPPR&hyph;123 on July 1, 1996, and construction permits extensions now need to be extended. As part of the planning process, TVA will evaluate the completion of the BLN units along with other generating options. The IRP process is presently scheduled for completion in November 1995. Additional delays associated with these efforts to ensure that BLN complies with regulatory requirements and licensing commitments make it necessary for TVA to request extensions of the expiration dates for Construction Permit Nos. CPPR&hyph;122 and CPPR&hyph;123. II The NRC staff has concluded that good cause has been shown for the delays, the extensions are sought for a reasonable period, and this action involves no significant hazards consideration, the basis for which are given in the staff's evaluation. The NRC staff has prepared an Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact which was published in the Federal Register on May 26, 1994 (59 FR 27299). Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that extending the construction completion dates will have no significant impact on the environment. The applicant's letter dated April 19, 1994, and the NRC staff's letter and safety evaluation of the request for extensions of the construction permits, dated June 27, 1994, are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555&hyph;0001 and at the Local Public Document Room, Scottsboro Public Library, 1002 South Broad Street, Scottsboro, Alabama 37402. III It is hereby ordered that the latest construction completion date for Permit No. CPPR&hyph;122 is extended to October 1, 2001 and the latest construction completion date for Construction Permit No. CPPR&hyph;123 is extended to October 1, 2004. Dated at Rockville, Maryland this 27th day of June 1994. For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. William T. Russell, Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation.
