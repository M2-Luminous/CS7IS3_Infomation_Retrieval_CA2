Go ahead Jesus: [Cazasola] Yes, Ana Patricia, good afternoon. Both the rulers and the ruled must be subject to the empire of the law. No one should act beyond the law because the country's conditions so demand. Humberto Benitez Trevino said this after being sworn in as new DF attorney general. He said there will be no truce for crime and added that no economic or human resources will be spared to guarantee the security the people of Mexico City demand. He said he will act with energy wherever there is impunity.
