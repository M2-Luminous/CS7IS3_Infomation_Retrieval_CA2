They uncovered three opium manufacturing laboratories and confiscated 150 kg of poppy haulms, almost 1.5 liters of opium solution, and a Kalashnikov rifle. The operatives discovered the largest haul at a house on Kerch Street: A certain Gubanov was found in possession of 97 kg of poppy haulms. But it was detectives from the regional administration for combating organized crime who provided the high point of the operation. They basically brought to an end the "high" enjoyed by a Georgian criminal community resident in the "Rossiyanochka" Hotel on Leninskiy Prospekt. Seven addicts were caught red-handed.
