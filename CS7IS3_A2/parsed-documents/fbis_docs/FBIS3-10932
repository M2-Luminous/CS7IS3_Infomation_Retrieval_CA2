Rubiano, Cali archbishop, told Radio Cadena Nacional (RCN) the local media which had published information on the bishops' attendance to a "summit" with Colombian rebels in Havana should give the names of the alleged participants. The priest categorically denied Nel Beltran, bishop of Sincelejo (northwest Colombia) and mediator between the government and rebels, had traveled to Cuba, as reported by the Santa Fe de Bogota media. The worst thing that can happen to the nation during this election period is not to say the truth, said the president of the Episcopal Conference when referring to the conflict caused by the bishops' participation in talks with rebels. Rubiano Saenz added "there must be an intention behind the news that are given in that manner, with half truths, as they remain up in the air." Several Santa Fe de Bogota dailies and newspapers published on 8 March photographs of Luis Madrid Merlano, bishop of the Tibu petroleum area (northwest), meeting with guerrillas in the mountains. The priest explained these were "pastoral dialogues" seeking peace in his region.
