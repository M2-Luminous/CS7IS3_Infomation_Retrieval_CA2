FR941020-1-00013 FR941020-1-00003 Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service 7 CFR Part 782 RIN 0560&hyph;AD77 End-Use Certificate Program AGENCY: Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, USDA. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: This rule proposes to implement a U.S. end-use certificate program for wheat and barley imported from any foreign country or instrumentality that as of April 8, 1994, requires end-use certificates for imports of U.S.-produced wheat and barley, respectively, as required by section 321(f) of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (the Act). A notice requesting comments regarding a U.S. end-use certificate system was published in the Federal Register on April 13, 1994, at 59 FR 17495. Comments were solicited with respect to the alternatives and issues that need to be addressed in implementing such a program. These comments were taken into consideration by the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service (ASCS) with respect to the development of this proposed rule. DATES: Comments must be received by November 21, 1994 to be assured of consideration. ADDRESSES: Comments must be mailed to Deputy Administrator, Commodity Operations, ASCS, P.O. Box 2415, Washington, DC 20013&hyph;2415. All written comments will be available for public inspection in room 5755, South Building, U.S. Department of Agriculture, 14th Street and Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC, between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m., Monday through Friday, except holidays. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Steve Gill, Chief, Inventory Management Branch, Commodity Operations Division, ASCS, P.O. Box 2415, Washington, DC 20013&hyph;2415; phone 202&hyph;720&hyph;6500 or FAX 202&hyph;690&hyph;2221. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Executive Order 12866 This rule has been determined to be significant and was reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866. Executive Order 12778 This proposed rule has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12778. The provisions of this proposed rule do not preempt State laws, are not retroactive, and do not involve administrative appeals. Environmental Evaluation It has been determined by an environmental evaluation that this action will not have a significant impact on the quality of the human environment. Therefore, neither an Environmental Assessment nor an Environmental Impact Statement is needed. Executive Order 12372 This program/activity is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. See notice related to 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V, published at 48 FR 29115 (June 24, 1983). Paperwork Reduction Act This proposed rule contains new reporting and recordkeeping requirements. The public reporting burden for the information collection contained in this proposed rule with respect to a U.S. end-use certificate program is estimated to average 10 minutes for each end-use certificate and six and one-half hours for each quarterly report, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. These new reporting and recordkeeping requirements will be submitted to OMB for expedited approval under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. 35 (see appendix A). Send comments regarding this collection of information to: Department of Agriculture, Clearance Office, Office of Information Resources Management, Room 404&hyph;W, Washington, DC 20250, and Regulatory Affairs of OMB, Attention: Desk Officer for USDA, Room 3201, New Executive Office Building, Washington, DC 20503. Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis The Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis describing the options considered in developing this proposed rule and the impact of the implementation of each option is available on request from Craig Jagger, Grains Analysis Division, ASCS, P.O. Box 2415, Washington, DC 20013&hyph;2415; phone 202&hyph;720&hyph;4418. The analysis can be summarized as follows: The North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act requires that end-use certificates be established for wheat and barley imported into the U.S. from any foreign country that requires end-use certificates for imports from the U.S. Currently, Canada is the only such country. Three options are considered for the implementation of end-use certificates: Option 1: Border Certificate. Importers would file these certificates to show the intended use of the grain. No additional reporting or storage and handling requirements would apply. Option 2: Identity Preserve and Track Commingled Grain. Certificates showing the intended use would accompany the grain to the end user. Imported grain could be commingled with U.S.-origin grain and the commingled grain would be treated as imported grain that would have to be stored separately from 100-percent U.S.-origin grain. Holders of grain would file quarterly reports with USDA. Option 3: Identity Preserve and Track Imported Grain. Certificates showing the in ended use would accompany the grain to the end user. Imported grain would not be allowed to be commingled with U.S.-origin grain. Imported grain would be identity preserved and holders of the grain would file quarterly reports with USDA. This option most closely matches the Canadian system.
