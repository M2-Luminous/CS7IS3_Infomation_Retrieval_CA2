That is, already the department's former head.... The reorganization of the department had long been in the works, and that with the active leadership participation of Medvedev himself. However, at the last moment, an additional point appeared in the presidential edict approving the structural and compositional changes to be made, directing Sergey Filatov to engage in a search for a candidate to the post of UDT [territorial affairs department] head. Department officials were completely bewildered, for everyone knew that Medvedev was the protege of that same Filatov. Nikolay Pavlovich appeared in the president's administration soon after the arrival there of Sergey Aleksandrovich, who even during his work in parliament had had his eye on the energetic and efficient chairman of the Soviet of Nationalities commission on national-state structure and inter-nation relations. Filatov was bothered neither by Medvedev's "classical" cosmopolitan-party past nor by the fact that Medvedev had never had the reputation of a "convinced Yeltsinite," but had in parliament begun with cooperation with the Communists for Democracy faction and had finished as a member of the Left Center--Cooperation faction. Medvedev's promotion to the post of deputy head of the president's administration responsible for work with the territories was actively opposed by the leaders of Democratic Russia, who accused the promoted one of "insufficient democratism in his convictions" and of besmirching connections with the oppositionists. Nikolay Medvedev, for example, spoke out actively against the democratic Mordovian [Mordvinian] President Guslyannikov. Some even assert that Medvedev voted for the impeachment of Boris Yeltsin. Nevertheless, the appointment of Nikolay Pavlovich took place--in spite of, or perhaps thanks to, his aloofness, as it were, from the "president's team": Such a person, evidently, would have an easier time finding a common language with the heads of local administrations, far from all of whom were "Yeltsin's people." It soon became clear, however, that it was precisely with the regions that Medvedev could not find a common language. Almost from the very beginning of his work, complaints rained down from the localities on the administrative-command management style of the new deputy head of the presidential administration. Evidently, it was that same "cosmopolitan-party past" of Medvedev's, to which Filatov did not pay attention, that made itself felt. Nikolay Pavlovich often tried to build his relations with the governors of the krays and oblasts of Russia on a "departmental" or "directive" basis. Medvedev became particularly active during the days of the September-October opposition, sending out "to the localities" threatening directives that warned about the "personal responsibility" of people whose support was necessary to the president, but whom Medvedev almost set against Yeltsin with his harshness and peremptoriness. Even less satisfied with Medvedev were the president's representatives in the republics, krays, and oblasts. In the words of several of them, the territorial affairs department tried in every way to turn the representatives of the president into "state informants," but at the slightest conflict with the governors refused the president's representatives support. All of this, apparently, served as a reason for Nikolay Medvedev's current dismissal from the post that he held. Although this dismissal also has its own logic: People of a "command style" were in demand in the administration during the period of tight territorial management, whereas now in the relations with the governors' corps, a little more sugar and a little less vinegar is needed--the times are not the same. A successor to Nikolay Medvedev has not yet been found. But apparat life in the president's administration is not standing still: According to the latest information, by directive of Sergey Filatov, a new section is being created within the territorial affairs department, as whose head has been appointed Doku Zavgayev--former first secretary of the Checheno-Ingushetia Oblast Party Committee of the CPSU, who was divested of power by Khasbulatov for his support of the August putsch. A cadre, as they say, of proven worth.
