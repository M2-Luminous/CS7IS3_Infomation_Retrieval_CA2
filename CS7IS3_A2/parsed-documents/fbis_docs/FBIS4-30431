On 27 June, a relevant high-ranking government official said that "the North-South basic agreement stipulated that `the North and the South shall make efforts to turn the armistice status into a peace system.' Based on this, the government decided to make a proposal to conclude an `agreement for ending the armistice status and establish a peace system.'" This government policy is put forward on the basis of its judgment that at a time when a preliminary contact for a North-South summit is to be held and a North-South dialogue, including the summit, will likely be pushed ahead actively, and when North Korea-U.S. dialogue, including a third round of North Korea-U.S. high-level talks, which even envisages the establishment of diplomatic relations, is being accelerated, the present armistice system between the North and the South can hardly make the two sides coexist, and thus the turning of this system into a peace system is inevitable. This official also noted that "The present Armistice Agreement prescribes that the agreement is effective until it is replaced with another agreement. Therefore, it is necessary to conclude a new agreement." Although North Korea demanded to the United States in the past that the Armistice Agreement be replaced with a peace agreement, North Korea did not put forward this proposal to the South side owing to differences in views between the two sides.
