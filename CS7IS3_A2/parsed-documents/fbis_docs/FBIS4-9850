This is why, when Gaviria's victory was known on 27 March by 20 votes in favor and 14 against, the Argentine Government expressed its satisfaction and presented Gaviria's victory as its own achievement. The government changed candidates three times to obtain this victory. The first reason for a change was that Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella's hopes collapsed that his Radical predecessor, Dante Caputo, would be able to restore democracy in Haiti, and so gain enough political support to replace Brazilian Joao Baena Soares as OAS secretary general. In view of this situation, the Foreign Ministry, after unofficially promising its support for a Venezuelan candidate, endorsed with little enthusiasm the candidacy of Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus, after sounding out without success Uruguayan President Luis Alberto Lacalle and Chilean President Patricio Aylwin. The possibilities of transforming the OAS into a regional institution at UN level, and incorporating the Inter-American Defense Council into the OAS, which was one of Di Tella's more valuable projects, began to disappear with Niehaus' candidacy. This is another reason why Gaviria's candidacy came as a gift from heaven. Argentine sources told CLARIN that the first news about the bold step taken by Gaviria -- it was the first time that a president in office was a candidate -- was learned by the government from Argentine Ambassador to the OAS Hernan Patino Mayer. On Christmas eve Patino Mayer received the following message: The United States wanted Gaviria to become a candidate, but before deciding Colombia wanted to know if it had Argentine support. Four hours later President Carlos Menem phoned Gaviria to tell him: "If you become a candidate, you can count on my full support." Then, Di Tella had to carry out the difficult task of telling Niehaus -- who on 27 March in Washington charged that the United States was acting imperialistically, to its colonies, in opposing his candidacy -- that Argentina was withdrawing its support. Meanwhile Menem talked with other presidents. His agenda included the presidents of the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, and Chile, among others. Soon, most of the South American countries gathered around Gaviria, who had the blessing of Washington. It is assumed that Chile, more meticulous, kept its original commitment to vote for Niehaus (the vote is secret). Finally, the debate before the voting on 27 March ended in a scandal. Niehaus left the OAS in Washington denouncing those who had betrayed him, and now Gaviria will have five years to heal the wounds opened during this political debate.
