The three-day exhibition recording the partial work of the drafting and advisory committee members is aimed at commemorating the first anniversary of the publication of the Macao Basic Law. Qian Weichang, vice-chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office under the State Council will sponsor a series of commemorating activities here. These will help people understand China's basic policy toward Macao, its government's principle of "one country, two systems" and its unremitting efforts for the implementation of the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration on the Question of Macao, he said. He said that young students will witness the return of Macao to the motherland. Therefore, to run such an exhibition at Beijing University will be of vital importance to strengthening their national dignity and historical responsibilities. Chen Ziying, deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office under the State Council, said the principle of "one country, two systems" is China's basic state policy. China will resume its exercise of the sovereignty over Macao on December 20, 1999, which he said will be a major event in China's history. To enable residents from both the mainland and Macao to understand thoroughly the Macao Basic Law is an important long-term task to ensure Macao's stable transition and smooth transfer of its power, Chen said. Macao needs for both sides to work hard together to accomplish this task, he added. In addition, three documentary films reflecting Macao's history and economy will be shown and a seminar on the return of Macao and Hong Kong and prospects for these two regions will also be held at Beijing University. Taking part in today's opening ceremony were Qian Weichang and Ma Mankei, vice-chairmen of the National Committee of the CPPCC, Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office under the State Council, and Guo Dongpo, director of the Macao branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY.
