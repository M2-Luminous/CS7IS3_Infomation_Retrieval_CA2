Speaking at a press conference in Johannesburg, Mr Khoza said IFP stickers had not arrived on time at a number of polling stations in Soweto and African National Congress agents had marked ballot papers on behalf of some voters. Voters at the polling booth at Chiawelo, Soweto, were given second ballot papers if they filled their first ones in "wrongly", he said. Mr Khoza said voters at Bhukalani primary school in Zondi section and at a polling station in Mzimhlope were given "aggressive answers" by Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] agents when they complained there were no IFP stickers on their ballot papers. Because of this the voters had also been forced to expose their political affiliation. "It makes the election not private anymore." When IFP agents at Mzimhlope tried to intervene "they were chased away by ANC agents", Mr Khoza claimed. IFP stickers also failed to arrive on time at the voting station in Dube, and similar problems were experienced at Baragwanath Hospital and in Zola section. "And this is only Soweto I've talked about. There are absolutely no secrets in this election," said Mr Khoza. He said IFP representatives had already complained to the IEC. He would consult Ulundi about taking the matter further. Mr Khoza's comments followed complaints by IFP Thokoza Chairman Abraham Mzizi, who said the elections had to be extended if necessary to allow thousands of East Rand hostel residents, isolated by violence, to acquire identity documents and to cast their votes. Speaking at Thokoza hostel on Tuesday afternoon, Mr Mzizi said thousands of East Rand hostel residents still had no IDs. He would send a message to IFP leader Mangosutho Buthelezi, he said. East Rand defence force commander Col Chris du Toit had already agreed he would take the matter "to the highest levels of government", said Mr Mzizi. [passage omitted]
