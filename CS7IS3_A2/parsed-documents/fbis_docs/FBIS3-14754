Attention please. [Durdynets] The appeal by the Supreme Council of Ukraine: Esteemed Ukrainian citizens, Ukraine is experiencing hard times. The economic crisis has not been overcome. Social problems have become extraordinarily acute. Under conditions when trust in any branch of power has gone down, the Supreme Council of Ukraine, at the people's justifiable request, adopted the only right decision to hold early elections first to the Supreme Council in March and then to Ukraine's president and local authorities in June. So, Ukraine is on the threshold of undergoing new important changes to its political and economic life. We have a chance to continue the transformation of Ukraine in a peaceful way, doing this as it was done in the majority of democratic countries in Europe and the world: From an election to an election, replacing the Supreme Council and therefore, the government, i.e. making changes in the body of those who will determine state domestic and foreign policy. It is very good that Ukraine has avoided the use of armed force to change political power. However, in order further to ensure the peaceful way of revolutionary transformation in Ukraine, the elections to the Supreme Council of Ukraine on 27 March of this year have to take place successfully. Some facts and statements, however, demonstrate that not everybody in Ukraine has an interest in holding these elections successfully. There is talk about some kind of vacuum of power. Some are even openly interested in the sabotage and disruption of these elections. If the elections to the Supreme Council of Ukraine do not take place, this will only increase political and economic instability and lead to a constitutional crisis in Ukraine. However, there will be no vacuum of power. After all, the current Supreme Council convocation will retain its constitutional powers and work until March 1995. But do we really need to go back when a change in the body of the Ukrainian Supreme Council already can and must occur on 27 March 1994. This is exactly why the Supreme Council of Ukraine appeals to its citizens, every official and authority who is involved in organizing and holding the election campaign and asks them to demonstrate high responsibility at this time so important to Ukraine. Any actions and statements that lead to the disruption or sabotage of the elections, are inadmissible. Nor are any violations of the law on elections are admissible. The Supreme Council of Ukraine draws the attention of the central, district, and all area electoral commissions, state mass media and state TV and radio leadership, to the need essentially to improve their activity aimed at stepping up the preelection campaign, ensuring the objectivity and fullness of its coverage, and preventing restrictions of the rights of candidates for deputies and electors. Dear compatriots, let us realize our chance of changes in the life of each of us and our society as a whole. [Deputies then adopted the above appeal in a vote by raising hands.]
