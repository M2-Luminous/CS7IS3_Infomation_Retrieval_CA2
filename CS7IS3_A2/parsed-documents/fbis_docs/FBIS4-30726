According to the National Bank of Cambodia's [NBC's] Economic and Statistics Review for March, the breakdown of the deficit balances are U.S. $195.7 million for goods, U.S. $36.1 million for services and U.S. $42.6 million for the income account. The trade deficit in 1993 marked an increase of U.S. $16.8 million over the 1992 deficit, attributable to an 8 per cent increase in imports offset by a 7 per cent increase in exports. Imports were estimated at U.S. $479.3 million while exports stood at U.S. $283.6 million for 1993. Sixty four per cent of all exports were reported to be re-exports of imported goods to countries in the region while timber exports accounted for 29.8 per cent of total exports and rubber for 5 per cent. It is clear that Cambodia would benefit from preferential trading status with the U.S., which has yet to be granted. This would attract companies from the region to set up their labour-intensive operations here to take advantage of concessions not normally available in their own country. For example some observers suggest that Thai textile firms might set up manufacturing operations here. Currently, cloth and textiles amount to 16.3 per cent of total imports, thus adding to the burden of the trade deficit, which has to be improved, as increased exports of goods are a valuable source of much needed hard currency. The Cambodia Investment Board, the operating arm of the dormant Cambodia Development Council, has identified increase of exports as the primary "objectives of national and economic importance." The Cambodian Tobacco Company, to cite an example of a local firm, exports its products to South Vietnam, but cannot compete with the larger and more established foreign tobacco companies operating in the region, which are propped up by huge advertising budgets. Imported cigarettes amounted to 13.5 per cent of total imports, according to NBC estimates. Foreign tobacco companies use offshore media services to market their products, although a joint venture between a Cambodian media company and Singaporean media consultancy firm will fork out some of the profits to the resident owners of the service. Net travel services was put at U.S. $44.3 million, a decrease of 11 per cent from the previous year -- a result of the reduction in tourist arrivals for the first half of 1993 -- according to the NBC report. Construction materials chalked up 5.7 per cent of total imports of goods. In the services sector, the deficit was largely a result of imported construction services, standing at U.S. $57.3 million. According to the NBC report, this was "principally payments for infrastructure repairs carried out by non-resident contractors. A net surplus in current transfers helped offset the total deficit balance. The NBC estimates that the net surplus stands at U.S. $150.2 million, although it cautions that the figures are "estimates and that the accuracy and completeness of the information on which they are based is very variable." Furthermore, for statistical purposes, all payments made to non-residents by donor agencies are considered as having first being paid to the government, which then on paper, disburses this to non-residents. Such an arrangement places all non-residents working with NGOs [nongovernmental organizations] and other international organisations as government employees. These payments, mobilised as funds for the government in the first place, are included in the category of current transfers. The economy is still highly leveraged by transactions "reflecting international aid donations to the Government of Cambodia in the form of goods, short-term technical assistance and project aid" as well as capital project aid, under a separate account, which when combined with current transfers, amounts to U.S. $325.7 millions for 1993.
