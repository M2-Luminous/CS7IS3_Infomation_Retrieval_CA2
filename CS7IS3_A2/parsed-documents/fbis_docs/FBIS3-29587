[Win] We joyously welcome the meeting between Congressman Bill Richardson and Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. The meeting enabled Daw Aung San Suu Kyi to openly express her position not only to the Burmese people, but also to the whole world; and we hope it is the beginning of the resolution of various problems in Burma. [passage omitted] What we are talking about is our hope because things will work out only when the SLORC, all the democratic forces -- including the democratic forces led by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi -- and the national leaders meet and seriously discuss problems. Otherwise, there will be no comprehensive solution to the problems in Burma. We believe in this, and our hope is based on our belief. [Swe] It is true that Daw Aung San Suu Kyi once mentioned that national reconciliation is very crucial and she is ready to discuss the restoration of national reconciliation with the SLORC; but she has been out of touch with the outside world for a long time. And now the SLORC has even arranged cease-fires with small rebel groups. It is also planning to draw up a constitution and is laying down principles for it which will bar Daw Aung San Suu Kyi from a leading role in Burmese politics. Its relations with ASEAN are also improving. Therefore, the question is: who will benefit from the meeting between the SLORC and Daw Aung San Suu Kyi? The SLORC or democratic forces? [Win] As far as we are concerned, although it is holding talks with the national ethnic groups, the SLORC has not reached any agreements. It has not signed any agreements officially. These are just discussions. We believe that political matters must be included in the discussions. We also believe that, if the discussions concentrate only on the cease-fire, without the inclusion of political matters, then the discussions will not be fruitful and will not last very long. Similarly, laying down principles to ensure the Defense Services' leading role in the politics and exclude Daw Aung San Suu Kyi from Burmese politics at the National Convention will not get approval if people do not accept them. It doesn't matter whether it is the constitution or not. The constitution, which is not accepted by the people, will not last long. We also believe that the SLORC should think about this. [Swe] Following the meeting between Mr. Bill Richardson and Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, it has been learned that Japan is considering providing small-scale aid to Burma, not as a loan but as a small-scale financial aid. This news came almost at the same time as Mr. Bill Richardson's visit to Burma. Why does Japan have to announce its plan to provide aid to Burma at this particular time? What is your view, U Sein Win? [Win] We are still studying this. Why is Japan helping Burma? We have just learnt that it will provide something like a grant to Burma. If we have to express a position, we think it is premature. We believe Japan's move to provide aid to Burma is premature if it has only taken Bill Richardson's visit to Burma and improvements in other areas in Burma as positive steps into consideration. [Swe] During the last couple days, while Mr. Richardson was in Burma, the SLORC extended Daw Aung San Suu Kyi house arrest another year. What do you think about this? [Win] We believe that the SLORC has no honesty. The SLORC used Mr. Richardson's visit to improve its international image and, at the same time, extended her house arrest. The SLORC has no right to extend the house arrest. According to the SLORC's laws it cannot be extended. As long as the SLORC continues to do contradictory things -- breaching its own law and at the same time talking about the rule of law prevailing -- we will have difficulties believing the SLORC. Having these doubts, we believe that it will be very difficult to establish and restore national conciliation.
