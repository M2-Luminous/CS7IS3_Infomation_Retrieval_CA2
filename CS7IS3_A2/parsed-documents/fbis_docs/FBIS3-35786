Journalists did not tire of asking Andrey Kozyrev that question throughout the foreign minister's China trip. After all, as far as the masses are aware, the formerly hostile communist giants remain divided along ideological lines -- democrats are in power in Moscow, while Communists rule in Beijing. This is not important in practical politics -- unadorned pragmatism and a painstaking desire to avoid any potential conflicts currently define relations between the two capitals. Nonetheless, it is not yet entirely clear whether the call from the Russian diplomatic chief to "move from a full normalization of relations to constructive partnership" will meet with the response from Chinese leaders that the Kremlin is hoping for. Addressing members of the PRC People's Diplomacy Association in Beijing, Kozyrev explained that constructive partnership includes the strengthening of mutual trust, cooperation on the UN Security Council, and a qualitative improvement in trade and economic cooperation, not least in border areas. But you get the impression that the PRC leadership is in practice in no hurry to pick up on the ideas brought here by Kozyrev. It is not simply a question of the traditionally unhurried style of Chinese diplomacy, but also of the PRC political elite's lack of confidence about how events in Russia will develop. For China stability is the key concept of state life. It was in the hope of stability that Beijing rushed to show its favor for the State Committee for the State of Emergency, and was shocked by the collapse of the USSR which followed August 1991. Since then Chinese leaders have forsworn support for any specific political forces in Russia, cutting themselves off from what is happening in our country with a reliable shield of "noninterference in other countries' internal affairs." Interest in events in our country has now increased. Chinese diplomats have been persistently asking the delegation members and accompanying journalists about the changes in the Russian Government and Chernomyrdin's plans. The Chinese are particularly interested in the personality of the premier. For the first time recently they can see atop the Russian pyramid of power someone they can understand and who is close to them in spirit. The program for the Russian prime minister's visit to China, planned for late spring-early summer, has not yet been agreed, but it can be assumed with confidence that his talks with State Council Premier Li Peng will mainly address economic issues -- construction of a series of hydroelectric power stations and Russia's participation in modernizing more than 150 enterprises built in the fifties with the USSR's help. The Russian side plans to involve the stricken defense enterprises of Siberia and the Far East in the latter project. The Chinese are not rejecting this option, but nor are they rushing to commit themselves with specific pledges, leaving the door open for the time being for others who want to participate in the modernization -- specifically, Hong Kong investors. Military-technical cooperation remains another sphere of major mutual interest for Russia and China. Russian arms supplies to Beijing invariably arouse poorly concealed irritation in the West, and this was evident from the questions which foreign correspondents put to Andrey Kozyrev at the final press conference. The minister was quite dry and hostile in rejecting the suspicions of behind-the-scenes deals between our country and the PRC, stating that all contracts concluded in this sphere have been submitted to the UN register. Western journalists were clearly unhappy with this answer. The curiosity of the corps of journalists in Beijing was intensified by the presence in the Russian delegation of Colonel General Boris Gromov, deputy defense minister. He did not take part in the most intensive section of the bilateral talks -- the foreign ministers' meeting -- but appeared merely at protocol events. Interest in Gromov was boosted by agency reports on the eve of the visit about major differences between Moscow and Beijing over the delivery of Su-27 fighter-bombers. The Chinese are allegedly refusing to pay for a second batch of aircraft, insisting that Russia sell them the technology to produce the aircraft. It should be noted that neither the colonel general himself nor people in Kozyrev's entourage clarified the problem. The delegation members literally "clammed up" at the merest mention of the arms trade. The Foreign Ministry experts' explanation for the secrecy over this issue is that they wish to preserve commercial secrets. Despite this, various rumors and a lack of trust will undoubtedly continue to accompany the development of Russian-Chinese military ties. Whereas the mutual benefits of "constructive partnership" are more or less obvious in the economic sphere, in the political sphere the new concept at first glance holds out more advantages for Moscow, which is counting on Beijing's support on the issue of Russia's membership of Asia-Pacific Cooperation (APEC). Moreover, the Kremlin is expecting help from the PRC in its attempts to block the spread of Muslim extremism in the former Soviet republics of Central Asia. "Beijing has a better understanding than certain Western capitals of the danger that Central Asia faces from religious extremism," Andrey Kozyrev stated. He explained that for China, like Russia, Central Asia is their nearest neighbor. Needless to say, it is not simply a question of geopolitics -- the Chinese are worried about the spread of Islamic fundamentalism among the Uighurs, who make up the majority of the population in the northwest of the country. Incidentally, the scale of the Uighur separatism problem in China and the range of issues which Russia is encountering in the new states of Central Asia are hardly comparable. As for our country's membership of APEC, despite the Chinese leaders' official assurances of sympathy for this desire, Russian diplomats say that no real support from Beijing should be expected in the immediate future. Everyone is working on their own behalf in this area, and the PRC leadership is in no hurry to act as defender of the interests of a not entirely understandable or stable Russia. While expecting few benefits from cooperation with China, the Kremlin at the same time cannot ignore the problem of human rights in the PRC -- a problem which has caused so much lively interest in the West, and primarily in the United States. So far the criticism of Beijing from Russian representatives, including the foreign minister during the latest trip, has been absolutely unspecific. Kozyrev formulated Russia's official position as follows: "We are not making this subject a taboo, but nor do we plan to kick up a fuss about it." Foreign Ministry experts are privately voicing the following views: First, we should remember the Chinese political tradition, which has always placed the interests of state stability above the interests of the individual; second, we should be as active as possible in bringing China into contact with the outside world -- not least through work in international organizations -- gradually encouraging it to make concessions and to liberalize the humanitarian sphere. In the opinion of certain Russian foreign policy department staffers, the U.S. view of the human rights problem in the PRC is largely based on short-term considerations linked to the battle over most favored nation status in trade and the pressure from the strong Chinese lobby. At any event, Moscow's line essentially still maintains its continuity with Gorbachev's famous statement on the Tiananmen Square events of 1989: "This is China's internal affair." Russia is expecting a response from the PRC to the idea of "constructive partnership" and is hoping to get a more or less clear answer from PRC President Jiang Zemin, who is expected to pay an official visit to the Russian capital in the late summer or the fall.
