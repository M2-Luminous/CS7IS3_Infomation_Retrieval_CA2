ACTION: Proposed rule.

Additionally, there are technical changes updating references, correcting editorial errors, and clarifying language. DATES: Written comments must be submitted no later than December 30, 1994.

Review Under Executive Order 12866 B. Review Under Executive Order 12778 C. Review Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act D. Review Under the Paperwork Reduction Act E. Review Under the National Environmental Policy Act F. Review Under Executive Order 12612 I. Background Pursuant to section 644 of the Department of Energy Organization Act, Public Law 95&hyph;91 (42 U.S.C. 7254), the Secretary of Energy is authorized to prescribe such procedural rules and regulations as may be deemed necessary or appropriate to accomplish the functions vested in the Secretary. In accordance with this authority, the Department of Energy Acquisition Regulation (DEAR), 48 CFR chapter 9, was promulgated with an effective date of April 1, 1984 (49 FR 11922, March 28, 1984). The purpose of this rule is to amend the DEAR to formally establish policies, procedures, and contract provisions that reflect the DOE position relative to the allowability of IR&D/B&P costs and IR&D/B&P advance agreements and travel costs. Additionally, it reflects the recodification of the CAS into 48 CFR chapter 99, and its incorporation into FAR, Appendix B. Concomitant with these changes, there are several revisions which delete references to outdated policies or activities. A detailed list of changes follows: 1. The authority citation for parts 915, 931, 942, 951, and 952 is restated. 2. Subsection 915.805&hyph;5 is amended to delete the requirement in paragraph (c)(1) that a copy of the audit request be sent to the DOE Inspector General (IG). Pursuant to interagency agreements, the DOE contract audit agency is the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA); the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has audit cognizance for most educational institutions. 3. Subparagraph 915.970&hyph;8(d)(1) is revised to add a reference to the relocation of the CAS to FAR Appendix B (Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 90&hyph;12, August 31, 1992). 4. Subsection 931.205&hyph;18 is revised to add the acronyms ``IR&D'' and ``B&P'' to the title. The DEAR reference to the FAR is changed from (c)(3) to (c)(2), because the FAR amendment (FAC 90&hyph;13, September 24, 1992) deleted FAR (c)(3). Paragraph (c)(4) is deleted in its entirety, except for a portion of the first sentence of (c)(4) which was moved to (c)(2). Also, FAC 90&hyph;13 replaced the requirement for separate advance agreements with temporary limits (for a 3-year period) on allowable IR&D/B&P costs. DOE has chosen not to institute the temporary limits, but rather to allow for full recovery, immediately. Thus, the text was amended to reflect the DOE policy that generally IR&D costs are allowable if reasonable, allocable, and they have a potential benefit or relationship to the DOE program. B&P costs are generally allowable if they are reasonable and allocable. 5. Section 942.003, paragraph (a) is revised to delete references to the Department of Defense (DOD) services; the services no longer have individual plant residencies. This revision reflects the current DOD structure for contract administration. 6. Section 942.101 is amended by deleting the reference to the Air Force Contract Management Division (AFCMD) and the DOE IG in paragraphs (a)(2) and (c), respectively. The AFCMD no longer exists and the Office of Procurement and Assistance Management now negotiates the interagency agreements with DCAA and HHS. Paragraph (a)(3) is redesignated as (a)(2) to accommodate the deletion of AFCMD. 7. Subsection 942.705&hyph;1 is revised at paragraph (a)(3) by deleting the statement that a listing of business units, for which DOE has final indirect cost rate negotiation responsibility, is published in the DOE Order System. The listing is no longer published in the DOE Order System. The revised paragraph (b)(1) clarifies the proscription that contractors shall neither be required nor directed to submit final indirect cost rate proposals to the auditor. 8. Subsection 942.705&hyph;3 is revised to correct the statement that negotiated rates are ``centrally maintained'' when, in fact, they are only ``distributed'' by the Office of Policy. 9. Subsection 942.705&hyph;4 is revised to correct the statement that negotiated rates are maintained by the Office of Policy, when, in fact, they are only distributed by the Office. 10. Subsection 942.705&hyph;5 is revised to correct the statement that negotiated rates are maintained by the Office of Policy, when, in fact, they are only distributed by the Office. 11. Subpart 942.10 is removed as a result of concomitant changes to the IR&D/B&P advance agreements (see item 4, foregoing). There is no longer a requirement to negotiate advance agreements; thus, the coverage is removed in its entirety. 12. Subsection 942.7003&hyph;6 is revised to add the word ``Administration'' to the title of FAR Part 30, which was changed as a result of FAC 90&hyph;12, August 31, 1992. Additionally, the reference to Public Law 91&hyph;379, which established the CAS, is deleted due to the subsequent incorporation of the CAS in FAR Appendix B and their application to civilian agencies pursuant to Public Law 100&hyph;679.
