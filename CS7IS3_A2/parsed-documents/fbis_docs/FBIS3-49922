He said that unlike Hungary, Slovakia considered the implementation of the ethnic principle in building states to be overcome. Meciar said that ethnic conflicts benefited nobody and expressed the conviction that Slovaks and Hungarians would succeed in coping with the problem of ethnic minorities. He was reacting to a question about the role played by the problem of the Hungarian ethnic minority in Slovakia in the integration processes within the Visegrad Group. Meciar said each of the Visegrad Four countries (the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia) was partly responsible for the group's stagnation. He stressed that the possible withdrawal of the Czech Republic from the group would probably result in its disintegration, not in its transformation into a "Visegrad Troika." He added that Slovakia would continue to seek cooperation and coordination of its policies with the Czechs. In reference to the fact that Slovakia was often omitted from talks about possible admission of new members into NATO, Slovak President Michal Kovac said that U.S. President Bill Clinton had assured him that the United States had never excluded Slovakia and was not going to do so. This problem was in fact solved today when all the Visegrad countries accepted the Partnership for Peace project, which gives equal chances to all of them, Kovac said. He said it was not surprising that no joint statement was adopted at the conclusion of the Visegrad leaders' meeting with Clinton, because its main goal was to inform Clinton about the Visegrad countries' stands on Partnership for Peace. Kovac said that Clinton had accepted his invitation to attend the celebrations of the 50th anniversary of the Slovak National Uprising in summer, though he may send somebody else to represent him if he does not come himself. The anti-Nazi uprising broke out in Slovakia on August 29, 1944. The economic issues, too, were discussed by the Slovak delegation, headed by President Michal Kovac, during the talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton, Kovac told journalists today. Slovak leaders appealed to Clinton to bear Slovakia in mind when investment is considered, which Clinton promised, Kovac said. Several countries are striving to become an intermediary in trade between Europe, the United States, and Russia, noted Premier Vladimir Meciar. The Western economics will follow the easiest and most suitable way, he added. Meciar said that some questions of economic relations with the Czech Republic were still to be settled. The most delicate one is reclaiming joint foreign debts, where the two countries should establish a precise strategy, he said. Meciar mentioned the Slovak gold allegedly withheld by the Czech National Bank accumulated by the pro-Nazi Slovak state during World War Two, and the deficit of the Czechoslovak State Bank as the unresolved issues.
