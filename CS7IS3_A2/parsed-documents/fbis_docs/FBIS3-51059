Contino, marking the 35th anniversary of Fidel Castro's triumphant entry into the capital at the head of the rebel army, said the Cuban youth are saying this, and they have not borrowed someone else's head to do their thinking. We were born after January 1959 and maintain the principles with which we were raised. He affirmed that as long as U.S. presidents continue to try and bend us through hunger and by increasing the trade embargo, as long as they do not take honest steps and continue to hold us hostage to their political whims, all their efforts will be doomed to failure. As we celebrate 35 victorious years, they can set up a stage and commemorate three and one-half decades of continued failure, the young leader proclaimed. Contino stated that it is easy to say 35 years, but so many wagers and so many predictions have been made that each one of their 12 months have been a profound fiasco for the false prophets. The UJC leader pointed out that no one knows how many times they have proclaimed the death of the revolution, but they do not realize that we Cubans are capable of killing death because we have so much life to give to life itself. Later in his speech Contino indicated that in recent years Cuba has taken significant, decisive steps in its economy and will be forced to take some more by the pressing situation brought about by the fall of the European socialist bloc and the increasing pressure of the U.S. economic blockade. Cuba was left alone with its principles and its immense dream, which is humanly possible, he emphasized. For this reason, the UJC first secretary added, it is imperative that Cuba adapt its strategy to the unipolar, hegemonic world in which it lives without renouncing its efforts to build a society of free men. The dreams cost money, so we must finance them with the currency accepted in the world, Contino stated, adding that convertible currency is not our goal but the means to achieving our goal, which is financing a just society. That we will not renounce.
