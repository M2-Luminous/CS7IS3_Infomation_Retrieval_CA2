FR940711-1-00003 FR940711-1-00001 Appendix B_Model Clauses and Sample Forms The Board solicits comments on model clauses or additional sample forms that may be appropriate if the amendments are adopted. (3) Form of Comment Letters Comment letters should refer to Docket No. R&hyph;0836, and, when possible, should use a standard typeface with a type size of 10 or 12 characters per inch. This will enable the Board to convert the text into machine-readable form through electronic scanning, and will facilitate automated retrieval of comments for review. Also, if accompanied by an original document in paper form, comments may be submitted on 31/2 inch or 51/4 inch computer diskettes in any IBM-compatible DOS-based format. (4) Regulatory Flexibility Analysis and Paperwork Reduction Act The Board's Office of the Secretary previously prepared an economic impact statement on the proposed alternative dealing with noncompounding multi-year CDs that pay interest at least annually. A copy of the analysis may be obtained from Publications Services, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, DC 20551, at (202) 452&hyph;3245. In accordance with section 3507 of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 35; 5 CFR 1320.13), the proposed revisions will be reviewed by the Board under the authority delegated to the Board by the Office of Management and Budget after consideration of comments received during the public comment period. List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 230 Advertising, Banks, Banking, Consumer protection, Deposit accounts, Interest, Interest rates, Truth in savings. Certain conventions have been used to highlight the proposed revisions to the regulation. New language is shown inside bold-faced arrows, while language that would be deleted is set off with bold-faced brackets. For the reasons set forth in the preamble, the Board proposes to amend 12 CFR part 230 as follows: PART 230_TRUTH IN SAVINGS (REGULATION DD) 1. The authority citation for part 230 would continue to read as follows: Authority: 12 U.S.C. 4301, et seq. 2. In Part 230 Appendix A would be amended by revising the second sentence in the introductory text to Part I and the first sentence of paragraph A, and by adding a new paragraph E as follows: Appendix A to Part 230_Annual Percentage Yield Calculation * * * * * Part I. Annual Percentage Yield for Account Disclosures and Advertising Purposes * * * Special rules apply to accounts with tiered and stepped interest rates > , and to certain time accounts with a stated maturity greater than one year < . A. General Rules > Except as provided in Part I.E. of this appendix, the < The annual percentage yield shall be calculated by the formula shown below.␣* * * * * * * * > E. Time accounts with a stated maturity greater than one year that compound interest less often than annually For time accounts with a stated maturity greater than one year that do not compound interest on an annual or more frequent basis, and that require (or permit) the consumer to withdraw interest at least annually, the annual percentage yield shall be equal to the interest rate. Example: (1) If an institution offers a $1,000 two-year certificate of deposit that credits interest semi-annually solely by check or transfer, and there is no compounding at a 6.00% interest rate, the annual percentage yield is 6.00%. < * * * * * Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, July 5, 1994.
