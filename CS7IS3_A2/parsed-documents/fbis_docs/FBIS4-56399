The absence of Erundina, who held the highest public post the PT has ever achieved -- the post of mayor of Sao Paulo -- is another symptom of the great dilemma of the PT: The leaders of ideological groups, who define the course to be followed by the party, are not the ones who are tested by the ballot boxes and who are connected with society. People like Sao Paulo Senator Eduardo Suplicy or former Santos Mayor Telma de Souza, who stand at the party's forefront in electoral confrontations, were consulted even less. Their opinions awaken much less interest than the views of movement leaders like State Deputy Rui Falcao of the Leftist Option group, who should assume the presidency of the party, or economist Marcos Sokol of the PT Struggle faction, which represents the most radical trend. Sao Paulo Deputy Jose Genoino, who has become increasingly isolated as leader of the ultra-moderate Radical Democracy group, believes this lack of equivalence between internal power and social power will be resolved only with a membership campaign. "We must bring as many people as we can to the party," Genoino said. [passage omitted]
