What does it really mean? What will you do? [Degni-Segui] I have been appointed to investigate. According to my mandate I must see if these acts really took place and who the perpetrators of these acts are, I must establish the link between these acts and those who are suspected of being the perpetrators. This is my mandate. I will not be alone in this. I assume that the whole UN structure and all UN personnel there will help me. [Fall] What will your agenda be? Will you travel to Rwanda soon? [Degni-Segui] Yes. I believe that this is urgent because I was given four weeks to draw up a first report. I received a call from Geneva and I must leave for this long journey, for a meeting of university deans and continue therafter to Rwanda, but with stopovers in Geneva and Brussels. [Fall] Degni-Segui, you are the dean of Abidjan Law Faculty. The possibility of an international tribunal for Bosnia was mentionned. It is now being mentionned in the case of Rwanda. Can you define this notion of international tribunal? [Degni-Segui] Let's say that it is a matter of setting up an ad hoc structure with the task of trying those suspected of being responsible for the crimes. [passage omitted] [Fall] Last year you took part in -- you chaired -- an international commission in Rwanda. What were your conclusions at the time? [Degni-Segui] I must say that I did not chair the international commission of enquiry. Our conclusions covered three points: genocide, war crimes, and the impotence of the judiciary thus guaranteeing complete impunity to the perpetrators of these massacres. [passage omitted]
