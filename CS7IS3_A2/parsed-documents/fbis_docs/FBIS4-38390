Half the Peninsula's Population Awaits Action from Meshkov"] [Text] The Crimean Supreme Council session which has just opened showed that, despite ideological common ground with the parliamentary majority, President Yuriy Meshkov has failed to avoid traditional friction with people's deputies. After the session formed a working group on further talks with Kiev on the fate of the Crimean constitution the deputies went ahead with discussing the cabinet structure. The president's proposal to cut the apparatus of the ministries of culture, education, and public health by merging them into a social security ministry was rejected out of hand by the Supreme Council. Yet more important for the head of state was the confirmation of eight candidates from the Yevgeniy Saburov team who so far are only acting ministers. Addressing parliament, Mr. Saburov stated that Crimea has turned out to be not ready to rectify the "twisted economic relations" amid plummeting demand. The vice premier sees an answer in attracting foreign investments and swifter privatization and reform in general. This did not please the deputies who do not trust in the possibility of legal privatization while regarding calls for wide investments as attempts by "Moscow Varangians" to sell off the peninsula to foreigners. The house jeered and called for a concrete plan of action. It was in vain that Mr. Meshkov tried to remind the deputies about former cooperation, asking to confirm his men. The cabinet opponents were joined by communist and Crimean Tatar factions, with the result that the ministers were not approved. Meshkov, Saburov, and the government walked out of the house. Meanwhile, the popularity rating of Meshskov, who not so long ago scored a fairly convincing victory in elections, is falling. According to the Crimean Social Studies Center, only 12 percent of the respondents fully approve of the president's performance; 18 percent support it; the same proportion of respondents say they have never trusted him; and 43 percent want action from him.
