At the Xiamen delegation's discussion session, after hearing the deputies' speeches, Governor Jia Qinglin said: As a Xiamen deputy, I am pleased with Xiamen's economic achievements, which have attracted world attention. The party Central Committee, the State Council, and the provincial party committee, and government now have attached importance to Xiamen's development. The Xiamen Special Economic Zone is not just Xiamen's special zone; it is also the special zone of the whole province and nation. The governor put forward four suggestions for the construction of the Xiamen special zone: 1. We should redevelop the special zone's strong points. The Xiamen special zone should play a "dragon head" role in the province. 2. We should make flexible use of the free port policy and should promote the development of undertakings in various fields of endeavor. 3. We should build the Haicang investment zone on a larger scale. 4. We should pay attention to the construction of key development projects, such as airports and highways; run Xiamen and Jimei Universities well; turn the Overseas Chinese Affairs Museum into a window for attracting overseas Chinese capital; and build Gulangyu into an urban district with a high cultural level and one of Xiamen's major scenic spots, so as to attract more overseas investment. The governor also urged Xiamen to make full use of the legislative power entrusted to it by the state, manage the special zone according to law, and build itself better. At the Fuzhou delegation's discussion session, after listening to the deputies' opinions, the governor said: This year, stability is of overriding importance. Only when stability is maintained can our reforms in all fields forge ahead. Leaders at all levels must concern themselves with the weal and woe of the masses of people, and must alleviate contradictions among the people. This year, the provincial party committee and government are determined to carry out more investigation and study; adopt realistic measures to solve, in a down-to-earth manner, some hot-point and difficult problems in society, economics, and daily life; bring the enthusiasm of people from all sides concerned into full play; and cherish, protect, and direct their enthusiasm toward reform, development, and stability; so as to push foward the cause of reform.
