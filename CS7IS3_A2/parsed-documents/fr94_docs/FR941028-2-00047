EPA Region 9 has determined that disclosure of CBI to CH2M Hill is necessary in order that they may carry out the work required by that contract with EPA. The contract complies with all requirements of 40 CFR 2.301(h)(2)(ii), incorporated by reference into 40 CFR 2.310(h)(2). EPA Region 9 will require that each CH2M Hill employee sign a written agreement that he or she: (1) Will use the information only for the purpose of carrying out the work required by the contract, (2) shall refrain from disclosing the information to anyone other than EPA without the prior written approval of each affected business or of an EPA legal office, and (3) shall return to EPA all copies of the information (and any abstracts or extracts therefrom) upon request from the EPA program office, whenever the information is no longer required by CH2M Hill, for performance of the work required by the contract. These non-disclosure statements shall be maintained on file with the Project Officer. CH2M Hill employees will be trained on Superfund CBI requirements. EPA hereby advises affected parties that they have ten working days to comment pursuant to 40 CFR 2.301(b)(2)(ii), incorporated by reference into 40 CFR 2.310(h)(2).
