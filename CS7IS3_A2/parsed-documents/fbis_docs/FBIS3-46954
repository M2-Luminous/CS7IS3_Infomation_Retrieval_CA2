"If our nation who has lived as a homogeneous one for more than 5,000 years from the days of Tangun unites firmly as one under the banner of the 10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation, transcending differences in ideology and idea, political view and religious belief, it can found the pan-national unified state without difficulty while leaving the two systems and two governments existing in the North and South as they are," he said, and stressed: "The present South Korean authorities, however, broke off all the dialogues of both governmental and nongovernmental level between the North and South which had been held even in the days of the preceding military fascist 'regimes', saying they 'cannot shake hands with the partner possessed of nuclear weapons', and did not hesitate to commit such a treacherous act as trampling upon the historical North-South agreement and joint declaration on denuclearization which had already been adopted and brought into effect, like sheets of waste paper. "What our nation wants is national reconciliation and unity, not confrontation and war. "All the Koreans in the North, in the South and abroad should turn out more vigorously in the struggle for national reunification."
