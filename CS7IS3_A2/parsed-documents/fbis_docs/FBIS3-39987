There is a white paper out which reveals this, a kind of geostrategic manual containing some 150 pages, drafted by a commission chaired by Marceau Long. Edouard Balladur and his defense minister, Francois Leotard, presented it to the National Assembly and Senate defense commissions today before revealing its content to the media. Jean-Michel Blier: [Blier] It is a document made necessary by developments in the geostrategic context: the fall of the Berlin Wall and the splitting apart of the Warsaw Pact profoundly changed the nature of the threats. At the same time the upsurge of nationalism in several countries has brought about the appearance of conflicts of a new kind, and the former Yugoslavia is an example of this. What response, what means, what alliances should be implemented in view of this new situation? This is the subject of this white paper, which, compelled by the requirements of cohabitation, has been the subject of lengthy discussions with the Elysee [presidential office]. The document which was presented this afternoon should not affect the consensus, except on one point, the suspension of nuclear testing, which Francois Mitterrand has made a question of principle, and which is being maintained. Francois Leotard said clearly this evening that he, personally, was in favor of resuming testing, while at the same time acknowledging that for the immediate future the credibility of our deterrent was not in any way thrown into doubt. [passage omitted] This is Jean-Michel Blier at the Senate for France Inter. [Announcer] Jean-Michel Blier has just been talking to us about it. Let's now listen to Francois Leotard on this subject of whether or not to resume nuclear testing: [Begin Leotard recording] For 30 or so years now France has implemented with great persistence a nuclear policy which means that today it is the only, or nearly the only, one in Europe to possess a nuclear force which is produced by itself, produced for itself, and produced according to its own needs. It would be a pity to abandon a 30-year effort, and thus in order to ensure that this force responds to the requirements of the future, in other words the beginning of the third millenium, its suitability must be strengthened. At this time this force is in no way, and I repeat in no way, threatened by the moratorium on nuclear testing, I stress in no way affected. It is completely effective, it is completely credible, it is completely appropriate, and for a long time to come. [end recording]
