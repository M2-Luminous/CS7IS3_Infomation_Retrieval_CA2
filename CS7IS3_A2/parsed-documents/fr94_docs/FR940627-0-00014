FR940627-0-00014 FR940627-0-00005 After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed. There are approximately 203 Model 747 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 113 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 5 work hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $31,075, or $275 per airplane. The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Incorporation by reference, Safety. Adoption of the Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration amends part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. ยง39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive: 94&hyph;13&hyph;06 Boeing: Amendment 39&hyph;8946. Docket 93&hyph;NM&hyph;189&hyph;AD. Applicability: Model 747 series airplanes, as listed in Boeing Service Bulletin 747&hyph;53&hyph;2371, dated July 29, 1993; certificated in any category. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent rapid decompression of the airplane due to failure of two or more tension ties, accomplish the following: (a) Prior to the accumulation of 1,000 flight cycles after the effective date of this AD, unless accomplished previously within the last 2,000 flight cycles, perform a detailed visual inspection to detect cracking of the outboard end tension ties, in accordance with Boeing Service Bulletin 747&hyph;53&hyph;2371, dated July 29, 1993. (1) If no cracking is detected, repeat the inspection thereafter at intervals not to exceed 3,000 flight cycles until the repair or modification required by paragraph (a)(2) of this AD is accomplished. (2) If any cracking is detected, prior to further flight, repair or modify the cracked tension tie in accordance with the service bulletin. Accomplishment of this repair or modification terminates the repetitive inspection requirement of paragraph (a) of this AD. Note 1: Although AD 84&hyph;19&hyph;01, amendment 39&hyph;4913, requires inspections of the tension ties at body station (BS) 760 on a certain group of Model 747 series airplanes, and at BS 780 on certain other Model 747 series airplanes, the inspections required by this AD do not retract the inspection requirements of that AD. (b) Prior to the accumulation of 10,000 flight cycles following repair or modification of any tension tie in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this AD, perform a detailed visual inspection to detect cracking of the repaired or modified outboard end tension tie in accordance with Boeing Service Bulletin 747&hyph;53&hyph;2371, dated July 29, 1993. (1) If no cracking is detected, repeat this inspection thereafter at intervals not to exceed 6,000 flight cycles. (2) If any cracking is detected, prior to further flight, repair or modify in accordance with the service bulletin, and repeat the inspection required by paragraph (b) of this AD. (c) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Seattle Aircraft Certification Office (ACO), FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Seattle ACO. Note 2: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the Seattle ACO. (d) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with sections 21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. (e) The inspections, repair, and modification shall be done in accordance with Boeing Service Bulletin 747&hyph;53&hyph;2371, including the ``ADDENDUM,'' dated July 29, 1993. This incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Copies may be obtained from Boeing Commercial Airplane Group, P.O. Box 3707, Seattle, Washington 98124&hyph;2207. Copies may be inspected at the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. (f) This amendment becomes effective on July 27, 1994. Issued in Renton, Washington, on June 14, 1994. Robert C. McCracken, Acting Manager, Transport Airplane Directorate, Aircraft Certification Service. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;14903 Filed 6&hyph;24&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;13&hyph;U
