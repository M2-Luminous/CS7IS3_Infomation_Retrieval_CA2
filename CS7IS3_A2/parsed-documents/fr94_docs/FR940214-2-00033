FR940214-2-00033 FR940214-2-00018 [Docket No. CP94&hyph;175&hyph;000] Gas Transport, Inc.; Application January 21, 1994. Take notice that on January 7, 1994, Gas Transport, Inc. (GTI), P.O. Box 1323, Parkersburg, West Virginia 26101, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;175&hyph;000 an application pursuant to Sections 7 (b) and (c) of the Natural Gas Act for permission and approval to abandon a 360-horsepower compressor and to replace it with a 180-horsepower compressor in Washington County, Ohio, and to install a 360-horsepower compressor and appurtenant facilities in Wood County, West Virginia, all as more fully set forth in the application on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. GTI proposes to replace the existing compressor in Ohio to permit more efficient operation of its system along with lower operating costs. It is estimated that the cost of replacing the compressor would be $31,000. GTI proposes to install the compressor in West Virginia in order to provide gas supplies currently supplied by transportation by Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation. It is stated that this compressor would permit GTI to utilize its system more efficiently and to reduce the cost of service for its customers by avoiding transportation costs. It is estimated that the cost of installing the compressor would be $30,000. It is stated that the costs associated with both compressors would be recovered from internally generated funds. Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before February 11, 1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211) and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules. Take further notice that, pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to the jurisdiction conferred upon the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by sections 7 and 15 of the Natural Gas Act and the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, a hearing will be held without further notice before the Commission or its designee on this application if no motion to intervene is filed within the time required herein, if the Commission on its own review of the matter finds that a grant of the certificate and permission and approval to abandon are required by the public convenience and necessity. If a motion for leave to intervene is timely file, or if the Commission on its own motion believes that a formal hearing is required, further notice of such hearing will be duly given. Under the procedure herein provided for, unless otherwise advised, it will be unnecessary for GTI to appear or be represented at the hearing. Linwood A. Watson, Jr., Acting Secretary.
