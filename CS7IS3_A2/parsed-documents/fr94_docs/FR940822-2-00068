FR940822-2-00068 FR940822-2-00048 Therefore, the Department is not proposing relief for transactions involving the internal operation of general accounts at this time. Additional Transactions In addition to requesting broad retroactive relief for general account transactions, the ACLI application also requests relief for certain other transactions that may be viewed as being prohibited under the Supreme Court's analysis in Harris Trust merely as a result of a plan's purchase of a participating general account contract. As previously noted, the significant participation test contained in the plan asset regulation (section 2510.3&hyph;101) is a ``safe harbor'' provision which provides that the assets of an entity will be considered to include plan assets only if equity participation by ``benefit plan investors'' is ``significant''. The ACLI represents that, under regulation section 2510.3&hyph;101(f)(2), an insurance company investing general account assets in an entity could be viewed as a benefit plan investor for the purposes of calculating the 25 percent significant participation test. As a result, transactions between the entity and a party in interest to a plan with an interest in the general account could be prohibited under section 406 of ERISA. 7 Accordingly, the ACLI seeks broad exemptive relief for transactions that would be prohibited solely because an entity is deemed to hold plan assets under the significant participation test as the result of an insurance company general account investment in such entity. 7 In addition, the general partner of a partnership (or any other person with discretion over the assets of the entity) may be viewed as a fiduciary under ERISA which could raise issues under section 406(b) of ERISA. Based upon its consideration of the ACLI application and supporting documentation, the Department does not believe that it has sufficient information regarding the impact of the Harris Trust decision on entities that conducted their business operations in accordance with the significant participation exception contained in the plan asset regulation. Specifically, while the ACLI application generally identifies the potential impact of the Harris Trust decision on such entities, the application provides no specific information, either from the affected entities themselves or other independent sources concerning the makeup of such entities, a description of the transactions for which exemptive relief is necessary, or the standards and safeguards upon which exemptive relief for such transactions should be conditioned. The Department believes that it is important that the standards and safeguards incorporated in any class exemption be feasible, effective, and protective of plans, participants and beneficiaries. Accordingly, this notice is intended to provide interested persons with an opportunity to submit written comments which will be considered by the Department in deciding whether to propose additional exemptive relief. The following is a list of some of the issues that have been identified by the Department. The list does not purport to identify all issues relevant to the development of exemptive relief, and comments on other matters raised by this portion of the ACLI request are also invited. A. Need for Exemptive Relief 1. A description of the entities that may be affected by the Harris Trust decision in operating under the significant participation test by reason of an insurance company's investment of general account assets in such entity. 2. What types of transactions would require exemptive relief if the underlying assets of the entity include plan assets as a result of the Harris Trust decision? In this regard, please distinguish between transactions involving the internal operation of the entity and external transactions involving the entity and parties in interest with respect to plan contractholders of the general account investor. 3. What costs or hardships, if any, would result for plans if the Department does not provide relief for these transactions? B. Standards and Safeguards 1. Describe whether any of such entities are subject to federal or state regulatory oversight. The response should include a brief description of the specific regulatory environment applicable to the entity and how the particular regulatory scheme serves as a constraint on the exercise of discretion by the persons responsible for the management of the entity. 2. What limitations or safeguards should a class exemption contain in order to reduce the potential for abuse of discretionary authority? For example, what limitations, if any, should be included with respect to: (i) The types of transactions for which relief is provided? (ii) Transactions which inure to the direct or indirect benefit of the entity manager or an affiliated person? (iii) The scope of discretion exercised by the entity manager? C. Miscellaneous 1. Describe any agreements that limit the discretionary authority of the entity manager with respect to the management or operation of the entity. For example, to what extent do investors independent of the manager retain any decision-making responsibility or authority?
