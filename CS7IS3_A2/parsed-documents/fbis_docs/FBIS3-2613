The "Circular" noted: As rural reform deepened and as a market economy enjoyed development, a number of peasant specialized trade associations, including specialized technical associations and research societies, emerged as the times required. As of the end of 1992, there were over 1.4 million various peasant specialized trade associations spread over all fields of endeavor in the rural economy. Peasant specialized trade associations are privately run organizations for technical and economic cooperation initiated by peasants on a voluntary basis. They were established for the purpose of increasing members' income. Based on management by peasant households, they encouraged members to assist and cooperate with each other in respect of funds, technology, production, and supply and marketing. Practices have proved that the development of peasant specialized trade associations is conducive to increasing peasants' income more quickly, and gives tremendous impetus to peasant households' economic development and to the governments' market cultivation. The "Circular" stressed: All areas must correctly guide peasant specialized trade associations to develop steadily in line with the objective needs of establishing a socialist market economy. They must pay attention to grasping the following points when actually carrying out work: 1) The principle -- "run and managed by the private sectors who will benefit from their management" -- must be adhered to. The will of peasants must be respected when establishing and developing peasant specialized trade associations. They may join the assoications of their own free will and quit as they wish. An internal management system must be gradually established and improved. All areas must persist in the orientation of serving agricultural production, rural areas, and peasants; they must conscientiously focus efforts on offering good services to members. 2) Adhering to the principle of establishing and developing various forms of specialized peasant associations. As far as cooperation is concerned, technical-exchange associations, associations providing services for production and management, and associations in the form of technological and economic entities may be established in line with local conditions. With regard to initiation of such associations, both individuals as well as scientific and technical personnel may take the lead in initiating the establishment of such associations. With regard to their scope of activities, such associations may carry out activities within a community; they may also carry out inter-community activities. In line with practical needs, various types of specialized peasant associations may carry out various forms of cooperative activities. 3) It is necessary to respect the rights of specialized peasant associations to make independent decisions, and the relationship between them and other organizations should be handled properly. Being a part of the social service system in rural areas, state economic, scientific, and technological departments; township and village collective economic organizations; and specialized peasant associations should pay attention to exploiting their respective advantages, share work in a cooperative manner, and strive to provide service to peasant households to help them develop production. No unit or individual is allowed to transfer the property of specialized peasant associations and their members. 4) In establishing such associations, the authorities in various localities must take into account the practical needs of peasants and offer specific guidance in light of local conditions; under no circumstances should they insist on uniformity, still less should they rush headlong into mass action. 5) Higher and lower levels should coordinate with each other, and all sectors should cooperate in creating a good external environment for the development of such associations. The circular urged all localities to further create favorable conditions for the vigorous development of specialized peasant associations, adding that at present all localities should focus on carrying out the following tasks: First, they should conduct investigations and studies to get a good picture of the main types of specialized peasant associations, their number, and their organization in their respective areas, and should study new situations and new problems. Second, they should sum up experiences, and guide and help the steady development of various types of specialized peasant associations through experimentation and example. Third, they should organize various forms of training classes to gradually improve the skills of the managerial personnel of such associations. Fourth, all localities should assist specialized peasant associations in establishing sound regulations and rules in order to strengthen internal management. At the same time, it is necessary to provide specialized peasant associations with markets, scientific and technological information, and other services in order to help them grow.
