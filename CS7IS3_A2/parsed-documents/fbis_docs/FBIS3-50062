In December 1993, the Slovak Statistical Office put this question to 1,272 respondents representative of the adult population of Slovakia in terms of sex, age, nationality, education, size of community of residence, and geographical part of Slovakia. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Respondent's expectations |Percent | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Have mostly been fulfilled |4 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Some have been fulfilled, some not |22 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Have mostly not been fulfilled |44 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Did not have any expectations |26 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Do not know |4 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- A look at the structure of the sample of respondents regarding replies to individual questions shows that the most satisfied with developments in our society after 17 November 1989 (that is, those whose expectations have been fulfilled for the most part, or at least partially) are those sympathetic toward the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (45 percent) and respondents in the 40-49 (32 percent) and 18-24 (31 percent) age groups. The relatively most disappointed with the post-November developments are citizens who are currently unemployed (61 percent) and those who do not sympathize with any political party or movement (51 percent). No expectations regarding the development of society were harbored, in particular, by citizens showing sympathy for the Party of the Democratic Left (32 percent). The respondents were asked, furthermore, to reply spontaneously -- that is, without any possible replies being indicated -- in what specifically their expectations have or have not been fulfilled. Among the most frequently cited positive replies were the feeling of greater freedom and democracy in general (8 percent), as well as the freedom of movement and the possibility to travel. The freedom of enterprise and the possibility of self-realization were cited by 7 percent of respondents. Negative replies were more frequent, particularly those referring to the lack of an improvement in the living standards of the population (30 percent), in the economy (12 percent), in the sphere of political life (10 percent), and in unemployment (10 percent). A general turn for the worse was noted by 16 percent of respondents. In view of the fact that the smallest number of fulfilled expectations was in the sphere of the economy and living standards, citizens were asked to deliver their opinion on tasks in the economic sphere. In the respondents' view, in the interest of economic recovery the government should, above all, draft a comprehensive concept of economic policy (38 percent), support small and medium-sized businessmen by means of tax cuts (24 percent), extend financial benefits to employers creating new jobs (23 percent), support the development of future-oriented branches (20 percent), support the creation of socially useful jobs and the organization of work beneficial to the public (17 percent), and create suitable conditions for the influx of foreign capital (16 percent). The completion of large-scale privatization figured last among the required measures, with 9 percent of respondents noting the necessity of completing it by means of the coupon method and 6 percent by means of standard privatization methods.
