COLD SPOT Protection of the lives and rights of citizens--whether they are Ingush or Ossetians--is the meaning and purpose of the Provisional Administration's existence. That is the reason the state of emergency was imposed in the zone of conflict. The Russian Federation law on the state of emergency envisages a special form of rule on the territory where it is in effect. Compliance with the law, by the way, would have made all arguments regarding the introduction of federal rule in Prigorodnyy Rayon completely superfluous--it had already been envisaged by the law on the state of emergency but for the president's decree of 4 November 1991. In keeping with this decree, which amended the previous one issued a day before, a Provisional Administration essentially was deprived of administrative rights on the territory of North Ossetia, that is, in the zone of conflict. Old and new laws of the North Ossetian SSR remained in effect there and new countless decrees were adopted that were at sharp odds with a stabilization of the situation; all executive authority--formally subordinated to the Provisional Administration but in essence openly ignoring it--remained in place. The Ossetian militia, OMON [Special Designation Militia Detachments], and republican guard continued to operate in Prigorodnyy Rayon villages. Given the circumstances, the Provisional Administration, in order to protect the lives of the same Ingush, had to order the troops subordinate to it not to let them back into the territory of Prigorodnyy Rayon. An absurd situation developed: Russian troops and representatives of the federal authorities, even in the rank of deputy prime minister, found themselves in the role of executors of the shameful decree of the North Ossetian parliament! Any Ossetian--be he an honest man or a marauder--has a right to visit Prigorodnyy Rayon villages without asking anybody's permission. There is now nothing to loot from the burned Ingush homes--there had been more than 3,000 of them there, so now they are stripping them of radiators and toilets and taking bricks out of the walls. An Ingush cannot approach his former home unless he puts his name on a list a week in advance; then he will be checked out somewhere, vetted; he will be put on a bus and, escorted by an APC [armored personnel vehicle] with soldiers, he will embark on a dangerous journey--there have been instances when entire busloads were taken hostage, buses pelted by stones, passengers pulled out and beaten. What kind of protection can five young frightened escorts provide against 30 hardened commandos? In these circumstances, the very existence of the Provisional Administration becomes meaningless. The first law of an administrative system: The less the expected result, the greater the number of bureaucrats that will vie for the job. For this reason the Provisional Administration staff is growing continuously: It looks as if now there is a plan to increase it by another 600 persons. Cozy Vladikavkaz, where most of the Moscow functionaries on detached assignment are quartered, should be considered a warm rather than hot spot. The Ossetian authorities assiduously keep an eye on them and reward the zealous. One would consider it a joke--who would believe in such an open bribe--had it not been for the testimony of an Ossetian newspaper: "Over seven and a half months of 1993, on the orders of the North Ossetian SSR MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs], 268 servicemen in regular military and operational-investigative groups received bonuses totaling 6.52 million rubles." The investigative groups are a special topic. Hundreds of killed and missing (there are still more than 300 persons officially listed as such in Ingushetia); unburied corpses of relatives barely covered with dirt; teenagers with wild eyes; fathers of former families dying in strangers' beds--the very smoke of the Nazran hearths has the persistent aftertaste of suffering and crime. And how many convictions have we seen? But this is not the point right now. Life goes on; it requires settling in and orderliness. The republic may have been created "on paper," but its citizens are living people and they present the Provisional Administration with conventional everyday problems, which it does not resolve. Why? For the second year Ingushetia is essentially living under a blockade. Rail cargo with humanitarian aid and acutely needed items travels as far as Beslan station (North Ossetia); neither the Provisional Administration nor the troops subordinate to it can ensure the further movement of the cargo, to Ingushetia (there are only six kilometers to the next--Ingush--station of Dalakovo). Because of this one six-kilometer segment on the territory of North Ossetia, cargo has to be routed circuitously through Astrakhan. How many soldiers does one need to escort cargo from Beslan station to Ingushetia? In the name of what then do we keep such a huge and costly army contingent here? The state has allocated billions for resettlement of refugees. This money does not go to displaced Ingush, and the authorities even explain why. First, the money is not being invested in reconstruction; second, the money is designated not for Ingush refugees but for "finding a comprehensive solution to the refugee problem" (this is the way it is worded in those certain Kislovodsk agreements). And one must admit that this is a correct answer. The Ingush cannot invest money in reconstruction because they are not permitted to get to their ruined homes, not to mention making construction materials available and the mechanism of arranging all of this. This can only be explained by the fact that the head of the Provisional Administration, no matter what his personal qualities may be, is limited in his actions and can do very little. Perhaps it is for this reason that administration heads here are rotated rather quickly. There have been seven of them in one year. And almost all, like General Filatov in his time, followed the "text" written for them by Galazov. How many hopes were pinned on Shakhray, and in fact he did everything in the beginning to make himself different from his predecessor G. Khizha. In Vladikavkaz he lived on the territory of an army military school, wore the uniform of a Russian paratroop officer, ate in the soldiers mess; in Nazran, where there was no hotel, a written-off passenger train was put on a spare truck to house the visiting officials; Shakhray occupied one economy-class compartment. Unlike Khizha, who, as is known, never crossed the border of Ingushetia, three days after his arrival, on 17 November, Shakhray spoke at the square in Nazran. He did not promise quick prosperity to anyone, but did guarantee on behalf of the Provisional Administration the return of the Ingush to the locales of their old compact habitation in Prigorodnyy Rayon. This will be difficult to accomplish, however, he warned, as long as illegitimate units on the territory of North Ossetia are not disarmed. Two weeks later, however, he spoke just as convincingly at a briefing in Vladikavkaz: "These are existing units. By the decision of the North Ossetian government, which is supported by the Provisional Administration, careful registration of armaments, fighting vehicles, and personnel of these units is being conducted." "This is not a contradiction--this is dialectics," Shakhray told journalists. Yes, obviously he did not learn dialectics from Hegel. While still in Vladikavkaz, he began to look differently at Ingush refugees as well: "We will deal with the refugee problem in a comprehensive manner--after all, this category includes Ingush, Ossetians, and Russians leaving Ingushetia and Chechnya." As if during the five-day war the people squeezed out of Prigorodnyy Rayon amidst bloodshed were not Ingush but citizens of Georgia or Uzbekistan. As to Cossacks--or, to be precise, Russians (Russians in the North Caucasus, much as in other republics, are a separate problem), they are presented as an unending stream of refugees into North Ossetia, although according to the data of North Ossetia's own migration service, 473 Russians arrived in the republic, and there is no report as to how many left. For those still there, a Potemkin village is being built near Vladikavkaz. S. Shakhray's second invention after the "comprehensive solution" was the notation in the labor service record of deported Ingush: "Let go by mutual agreement of the parties." The mocking meaning of this notation is obvious, although perhaps the author saw it as a compromise. Is it perhaps the air in Vladikavkaz that has such a powerful influence on Russian governor-generals? Among the next five teams there were no more volunteers to follow Shakhray's example and eat in the soldiers mess or sleep on a hard bench in a railcar in Nazran. By the spring, investigators from the combined group of the Russian Federation procuracy, MB [Ministry of Security], and MVD, who stayed longer than the others, had left the Ingush capital. And by the summer there was no longer any need for the hotel on wheels--the train literally left the station. And with it the last hopes of deported people that the Provisional Administration will take care of them. Already in Moscow, in interview to IZVESTIYA (10 January) Shakhray put forward a far-reaching thought: "Our state has been weakened, and in a weak state the primacy of formal law cannot be maintained." Well, then, of course... In Vladikavkaz (not in Nazran!) Shakhray confided to his listeners that he himself is a Terek Cossack from nearby parts. In the course of the election campaign he visited Cossack parts hunting for votes and promised that the south of Russia would become a special border region of the country and the Cossacks (as it was in the last century--I.D.) would have an occupation there. In return he received the rank of colonel and a Cossack outfit. Well, he had already worn paratroop fatigues; now is just the right time to put on a Cossack masquerade suit. One can only hope that Sergey Mikhaylovich will be tactful enough not to pin on a couple of St. George's crosses for settling the Ossetian-Ingush conflict. But how did it indeed happen that the "winners" grabbed so much power, thereby creating a problem that transcends even the boundaries of the Ossetian-Ingush conflict? They refuse to recognize Russian laws on the territory of their republic, refuse negotiations as a method of settling political conflicts. The unprecedented dependence of Vladikavkaz on the Federation provided the latter with the means to use power without using force, by explaining to the Ossetian leadership the ruinous consequences of lawless arbitrariness for the republic and its leadership. Or a direct appeal could be made to the deceived Ossetian people. At the time, a year ago, a different approach was chosen. Perhaps because, seen from Moscow, Dudayev looked like an even greater danger for the Russian great power. By the way, it is quite possible that Dudayev himself was ready then for a deep-reaching compromise, but the Cossack ideology proved stronger than common sense. And Nazran became a point of cold calculation on the map of Russian politics. Every political scientist and specialist on conflicts knows what to do in the hot spots of the planet. Nobody truly knows what to do in the cold spot of Russia. Attempts to pass crude indulgence of regional power-grabbers or great-power dilettantes in the capital for ethno-political research have the potential of reviving old enmities stretching back eons. There are three viewpoints of people who have a tremendous stake in the future of the zone of conflict. One belongs to President of the Ingush Republic Ruslan Aushev. He believes that it is necessary to impose to the fullest extent a state of emergency on the territory of Prigorodnyy Rayon where Ossetians and Ingush lived together. The state of emergency should be lifted in the rest of North Ossetia, including Vladikavkaz, as well as on the territory of Ingushetia. In the zone of conflict all authority should rest with the Provisional Administration. All military units controlled by Ossetian and Ingush authorities should be withdrawn from the territory of the conflict and subsequently disarmed and disbanded. Illegal possession of arms must be punished in keeping with the provisions of the law on the state of emergency in the Russian Federation. Use of arms must be stopped by force. The entire law enforcement system is recruited from among citizens who are not residents of the North Caucasus. Economic aid and financial means received for the reconstruction of the territory are placed at the disposal of the Provisional Administration, distributed by it, and invested under its supervision. Let a commandant appointed to every population center have elected deputies from the two communities. In all other respects people should live normal lives. Let them rebuild their homes, plant the fields, and harvest the crops; as time passes, they will get used to each other and, God willing, will not fall for new deceptions. Another viewpoint belongs to the Ossetian leadership and is well known: "No" to joint habitation of Ossetians and Ingush. This idea is being imposed on the Ossetian people and is supported by the majority--at least publicly. If economic and political freedom develops in Russia, this solution to the problem will not find support in either Ossetia, Ingushetia, or any other Russian region. But then perhaps we will have to accept the third viewpoint put forward in the president's edict: a phased return--first to four population centers in the state of emergency zone--of Ingush refugees. For the time being, while the state of emergency is in effect, the legal status of the territory remains unchanged. There are perhaps other ways to untie this tight knot. The only thing that is mandatory is honest intentions and a benign attitude to the interests of each party. While striving for fairness for the Ingush we cannot forget, of course, that generations of Ossetians already have been raised in Prigorodnyy Rayon, for whom it is also the only home they know. For the time being, however, the president's edict does not fully satisfy either side. Why, Issa Kostoyev asks, can the Ingush return to four villages, not three or seven? This means that in some villages there will be one kind of state of emergency, and in others--a different one. Galazov recently reassured citizens of North Ossetia: "Please do not be afraid! The president of the Russian Federation's edict is not the first edict... We will find a way to resist any force." And he found it! The paper that emerged a few days ago from the bowels of the State Committee on Nationalities and has already been signed by the prime minister instructs the agencies in Ossetia and Ingushetia to prepare recommendations for repealing Articles 3 and 6 of the Law "On Rehabilitation of Peoples Subjected to Repressions;" second, it assigns the task of protecting Ingush refugees returning to the four villages in Prigorodnyy Rayon to the Russian MVD jointly with the Prigorodnyy Rayon law enforcement organs. The way we read this is that protection of the Ingush again is placed in the hands of those who had been killing them. In the said paper is Russian Federation Prime Minister V. Chernomyrdin's List of Assignments stemming from the Nalchik agreements. How easily our state disposes of the life and fate of hundreds of thousands of people--actually, the fate of its own nation and its historic choice. What simple--sometimes most simplistic--motivation do they offer for a political step that should have been discussed before it is made. There is no doubt that Russia has the right to protect itself from disintegration. But we always choose to travel the unexplored path... right next to the highway. Are we the first and only ones in the world, or even in our own history? Had there not been within the boundaries of the Russian empire a Bukhara Emirate, a Khivan Khanate, the Polish Kingdom, and the Great Principality of Finland, with their own emirs, khans, sejms, parliaments, and even their own currency? It seems as if we are afraid that unless we show force we will have the reputation of being powerless. Actually, what Russia deserves is wary caution because of its erratic national policy. We alternately jump to defend to death our dear Tiraspol, blockade Chechnya, rouse the Cossacks and OMON against "persons of Caucasus origin," indulge nationalist leaders, or bring our great-power wrath on entire nations. We behave differently in identical situations, prompting others to suspect us of a double-play. And it does not occur to anyone that we, a great power, are simply standing there scratching our head. All the ethnic policy concepts authored by amateurs that have we seen by now. Ethnic policy cannot be made a subject of dilettante experiments if Russia wants to remain part of the family of civilized nations. Otherwise we are not in danger of a Yugoslav version. We are in danger of something much worse. No, while Russia is weak, the law should be especially strong. Otherwise power will shift into the hands of flexible jurists or sons of jurists. *** We are being made to learn, small step by small step, sip by sip. They let us try it. It tastes bitter? Well, there is not much we can do about it, they tell us. It tastes bitter to everyone. When in Tbilisi soldiers chopped down 19 persons with their spades, the entire country lamented; the Congress of USSR People's Deputies interrogated Kryuchkov and Ligachev, Yazov and Shevardnadze. Commissions flew to Tbilisi one after the other; the issue of a Leningrad newspaper with Sobchak's report in it was passed around. Then there was Baku and Vilnius; then bombed-out Ingush homes in Prigorodnyy Rayon, hundreds dead. Where are the writers and composers, cinematographers and deputies now? Where is Anatoliy Sobchak? General Aushev says bitterly that had something like this happened in the Baltics, the whole world would be in an uproar. The Caucasus for this world is the East, and in the East people are counted in the millions. The Tbilisi syndrome has finally been overcome. Now the military doctrine of the Russian Federation envisages bringing in military formations to aid MVD troops. Now the army has become a no longer hidden element of politics. And the generals--political figures of substantial weight. How long will they continue to patiently pull smoldering wood from the fire just to light someone's cigarette, and will they not decide to start their own perestroyka? Whom will we then call on for help? On the other hand, the military that stays outside politics is a remnant of Sakharov-era illusions. The military has been used many times by politicians against one another, and has increasingly often undertaken independent actions either with the consent of the political leadership or moved by its own sympathies--or rather antipathies. The Dniester region, Abkhazia, Ingushetia. Who knows what was sanctioned here by the warring branches of authority, and what by the inner convictions of some general? Pogroms against "persons of Caucasus origins," promised by national-patriots, were for the first time accomplished in an organized form in Ingushetia. I will not try to guess who gave the pogrom perpetrators absolution in advance. I only know that nobody will harm them. We are being made to become accustomed to many things, and there are many we have already grown used to. We felt it acutely in Moscow in the beginning of October, with its deceived crowds and tanks in the streets. And even more acutely during the days of our all-Russia election mutiny. It turned out that we did not know anything about our country, ourselves, our people. We were being warned of a social explosion, and we visualized smashed street kiosks and display windows of hard currency stores. But the senseless Russian mutiny occurred quietly, in election booths. We have been getting used to fascism for a long time for fear of being scared by it. And so we did not notice, or did not want to notice the first ethnic cleansing successfully carried out a year ago on the territory of Russia, the first Russian republic that made ethnic intolerance its official policy, and Russians protecting themselves from the Russian army. A year later we had all this in Moscow: Russians protecting themselves from the Russian army, and the ethnic cleansing of the capital. What used to be shameful nowadays at best elicits a shrug. But we are people of extremes. Every time we reject the old world, we smash our possessions into dust. In rejecting the Pharisean Stalinist "friendship of peoples" we should not rehabilitate Hitler's racism. The Nuremberg Tribunal's rulings remain in force.
