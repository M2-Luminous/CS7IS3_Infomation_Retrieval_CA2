The Hungarian president said the entire visit was characterized by a pleasant atmosphere, and can unequivocally be termed as useful for both Hungary and Slovakia. The two presidents received honours from the New York-based Institute for East-West Studies, in recognition of their activity for international reconciliation. "Thanks to splendid organization by the host institute, we had an opportunity both in Washington and in New York to meet with the political elite that shapes public opinion and participates in decision-making," Goncz said. "The discussions created an opportunity for me to set forth issues through which I was able to clarify the recurring misunderstandings, including the one whereby Hungary, through its minority policy, is a trouble-maker and danger factor in Central Europe," the President said. U.S. President Bill Clinton received the Hungarian and Slovak Presidents at the White House. On Thursday, Goncz and Kovac held a lecture in the morning, and attended an informal discussion at the Foreign Relations Council. The topics of the meeting were the more general Central European issues. The Hungarian president will conclude his vist to the United States and leave New York for Budapest on Thursday evening.
