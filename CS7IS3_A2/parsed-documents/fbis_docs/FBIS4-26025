After the meeting, a spokesman for the royal government admitted that nothing came out of the meeting but added that it was "not a failure." The spokesman said that during the meeting, the royal government side offered a deadline of noon on June 30 for a cease-fire to be imposed, while the DKP wished to discuss the details of establishing a monitoring committee. The DKP criticized the government side for refusing to discuss in depth the problem of monitoring a cease-fire and refusing to discuss the minimum political principle on peace and national reconciliation. The round table meeting opened on Wednesday and although neither side has decided whether to hold another, the possibility of further talks depends on King Norodom Sihanouk.
