From cashing peasants' IOU's early in the year to the unveiling of a series of State Council grain production and sales polices, from the much publicized effort to reduce peasants' burdens to the convocation of the Central Rural Work Conference to the year-end fluctuations in grain and oil prices -- all of these attracted the attention of the whole society. It is no exaggeration to say that agricultural and rural economic development ran through 1993 as "hot spots." Agriculture: High Yield, High Quality, Faster Pace Agricultural production reaped bumper harvests again with the annual grain output hitting 456.4 billion kg, breaking the all-time high by 10.2 billion kg. Total output of oil bearing crops reached 17.61 tonnes, 1.2 million tonnes more than the previous record. Though the total sown area under grains decreased slightly, average output per mu rose by eight kg. Major agriculture and sideline products continued to grow, except cotton and sugar crops, which dropped in output. Total output of meat, eggs, dairy, and aquatic products is expected to rise by more than 5.5 percent, 6.4 percent, 7 percent, and 10 percent respectively on the previous year, assuring the whole country of a rich supply of food. Most encouragingly, agricultural production has met market demands, stepped up efforts in structural adjustment, and taken new steps in the direction of high yield, high quality, and high efficiency. In response to falling prices of early crops like long grains due to a slow market and stockpiles, and rising prices for under-supplied quality grains, soybeans, and mixed cereals, localities all stepped up efforts to adjust their crop mix. Statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture show that national grain farmland shrank by 26 million mu in 1993, down 5.5 percent from the previous year. In particular, the area of early long grains, inferior in rice quality, was cut by over 12 million mu, down 9.5 percent from the previous year. Soybeans acreage and other mixed cereals increased by over 34 million mu, up 20 percent. Quality crop acreage extended to some 100 million mu, accounting for over 30 percent of all rice paddies. Quality wheat acreage grew by over 3 million mu to some 16 million mu. Meanwhile, there has been faster development in well-known, special, quality, new, and rare breeds in the breeding industry. Township and Town Enterprises: Parallel Growth and Strong Momentum in East, Middle, West Regions; Good Momentum Township and town enterprises continued to maintain a strong growth momentum and parallel growth in economic efficiency. Total income from realized operations and sales last year is expected to be 2.6 trillion yuan [figure as published], total profits and taxes of 255 billion yuan, and total output value of 2.9 trillion yuan, a 40-percent increase on the same period a year earlier for all three items. Foreign exchange earnings from exports grew by leaps and bounds. The total delivered export value was 190 billion yuan, up 60 percent from the previous year and accounting for about 45 percent of the total value of the country's exported commodities. Firms continued to expand in scale. There were some 400 township and town enterprises in 1993 whose annual output value topped 100 million or above, 300 had sales over 100 million yuan or above, and close to 100 delivered exports of 100 million yuan or above. Numbers employed rose considerably. There are about 112 million workers in township and town enterprises, 6 million more than in the previous year. Over 60 percent of the net increase in peasants' per-capita net income came from township and town enterprises, 29 billion yuan was used to support various rural projects, and 13 billion yuan was provided in agricultural development funds in a scheme to encourage the subsidization and development of prefectural agriculture by industry, respectively up 50 percent and 20 percent on the previous year. One important characteristic of last year's development in township and town enterprises was a new situation in the economically developed eastern region, where scale, standards, quality, and economic efficiency all rose. In the middle and western regions, the development pace quickened. Statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture show that in 1993, rural surplus labor absorbed by township and town enterprises in the central and western regions in 1993 accounted for 60 percent of the new jobs provided by all of the country's township and town enterprises, the total output value of township and town enterprises in the central and western regions grew by about 400 billion yuan, about 40 percent of the net growth in national output and up over 60 percent on the previous year, higher than the average national growth rate of 10 percentage points. Meanwhile, total output value, income from operations and sales, total profits and taxes, and the total number of workers in township and town enterprises in the central and western regions all saw a rise on the previous year in their share of township and town enterprises nationally. This was a remarkable achievement. Rural Reforms: More Explicit Market Orientation The main characteristic of rural reforms last year was an enhanced role for market mechanisms and a further deepening of marketization. At present, apart from a few items, such as cotton and tobacco leaves, operations and prices of all other agricultural products have been deregulated, chief among which was basically the national deregulation of grain purchase and sale prices. Reform in the grain purchase and sale price system, the main agricultural product of the national economy and the people's livelihood, had gone through years of exploration, suffered many reversals, and had come to be seen as the last bastion of the planned economy and the hardest one to conquer. The important progress of last year's deregulation of grain prices, therefore, will undoubtedly provide the peasants' efforts to tailor production to market demands with greater room for maneuver. The cooperative shares system has come a long way in rural areas. About 10 percent of township and town enterprises around the country are pursuing the cooperative shares or joint-stock system, with a considerable increase in the number of business conglomerates, there being nearly 100 of them nationally. Areas and counties experiencing a more extensive range of the share cooperation system have appeared in Guangdong, Jiangsu, and Shandong, offering much new experience. A series of new policies unveiled by the central rural conference was aimed at deepening reforms, such as extending the duration of land contracts, permitting paid transfers, and buying in shares of land contracts, and reforms in the urban residence status system are playing a role in optimal resource allocation in rural areas. There Are Still Hidden Problems: We Cannot Afford To Grow Complacent Early in 1993, many worried about agriculture. But by the end of the year, the situation was such that people were relieved, which was a hard-won achievement: Leadership over agriculture and rural work from the central to the local level was strengthened, a series of policies and measures aimed at protecting agriculture were unveiled, policies were enforced, peasants' burden reduced, and practical production problems solved. The weather helped too: There was basically fine weather throughout last year, with no major climatic disasters during key growth periods, which ensured bumper harvests. There are still hidden problems behind the favorable developments in agriculture and the rural economy in 1993, and some deep contradictions gradually emerged. In 1992, peasants' net per- capita income grew by 5.9 percent, a sign of recovery. In 1993, the increase in peasants' income, after factoring in price increases, again slowed to 2 percent from the previous year, a far cry from the 12 percent per-capita increase in income for urban residents, which widened the gap between them. Agriculture, especially grain and cotton production, suffered from low efficiency, which remained a headache for agriculture and a main cause of the peasants' slow income growth. Pressure on employment in rural areas is increasing. There is a surplus labor force of 100 million in rural areas, to which another 13 million is added each year, while there are only limited ways to channel this surplus labor force. Township and town enterprises are also absorbing this labor force at an increasingly slower rate. Methods of regulation and control available to the state are far from enough, such as insufficient inputs to agriculture, capital drain, occupation of farmland, and unperfected macroregulatory control, information, and guidance systems for the demand and supply of agricultural products. In 1994, reforms in the economic structure are entering a stage of attack on all fronts and are taking on key problems, and the reform and development of agriculture and the rural economy is facing more complicated external circumstances and unprecedented opportunities and challenges! We hope that rural areas will forever remain "hot spots!"
