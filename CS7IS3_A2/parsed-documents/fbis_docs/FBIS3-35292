Hambley said afterward: I wanted to talk to Speaker Birri about particular incidents that occurred last week and to discuss developments in south Lebanon and to express my belief that controlling the situation there is very important. Right now we are focusing on the Washington talks. But we seek to stop these attacks, which, I believe, only hinder the ongoing peace process. The U.S. ambassador was asked about his remark that only conciliation will solve the problem in south Lebanon. A reporter asked him what he meant by conciliation and with whom. He said: I believe the basic point needed to secure and maintain the ongoing process in Washington is to reach solutions that will bring peace to the entire Middle East region. This includes all the parties concerned with peace, in other words, Lebanon, Israel, Syria, and all the other parties. We must maintain the dialogue in Washington to reach the desired solutions. Hambley was asked about the positive signs that emerged after the Geneva summit and about the talks remaining stagnant. Asked whether there is a way to push the talks ahead, he replied: I think some progress has been made since the talks resumed in Washington. We are not imposing a specific time limit on negotiators. So we cannot expect instant results. The negotiating process is too complicated to make rapid progress. What counts is to finally see progress in the right direction leading to solutions that are acceptable to everyone. The ambassador was asked about his call to disarm the Resistance and about his country's failure to put pressure on Israel to implement international resolutions and withdraw from the south. He said: Our stance on Resolution 425 is very clear. We want to see the foreign troops withdraw from Lebanon, as he put it. He added: We hope the Washington talks will be a gateway to that goal so that the security and other guarantees can be provided. We hope they will guarantee peaceful relations among all the parties concerned. Hambley was asked about the repeated U.S. remark that the Americans are helping Lebanon at a time when the State Department has issued a decision extending the ban on Americans traveling to Lebanon. Asked to explain this contradiction, he said: This is a very important question. But we must distinguish between a decision banning the travel of U.S. passport holders, which is based purely on affairs relating to security [sentence incomplete as heard]. He added: We can only hope the future will show some signs that allow us to revoke that decision. It is very important to us to guarantee the safety of our sons who visit Lebanon. This is the U.S. Government's main concern. The second issue, he added, does not mean we did not launch cooperation programs with the Lebanese Government. Although cooperation is small, it is continuous and we hope it will be expanded.
