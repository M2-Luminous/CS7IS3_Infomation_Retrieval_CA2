In Munich, 2,000 demonstrators followed the call of the Alliance Against Racism. Kurdish women and children with flags and posters gathered for a demonstration in Duesseldorf that was registered as a "children's festival." Several hundred police were in action in both cities. In an interview with DIE WELT, Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has meanwhile commented on the basic issues of the conflict. [Moniac] Attacks have been carried out against Turks -- your fellow countrymen -- in Moelln, Solingen, and now also Bielefeld. Prime Minister, what do you think of that? [Ciller] After the attack of Solingen we asked the German authorities to clearly condemn such brutal acts of hostility against foreigners, and to protect Turks living in Germany against assaults and to take the guilty ones to court. It is not acceptable for foreigners to be confronted with such assaults. For more than 30 years, my fellow countrymen have lived and worked in Germany, having become part of society there. They have contributed to society in social, cultural, and economic terms. This is why they expect to be able to continue to live in peace there. [Moniac] How do you intend to refute accusations according to which Turkey is using German arms, the further supply of which has meanwhile been stopped by Bonn, against the Kurds. [Ciller] Turkey has emphasized that German military aid is being used in line with the agreements concluded with the Federal Government. Any claims of misuse are absolutely unfounded and have been intentionally concocted by certain groups to impair Turkish-German relations. We hope that the Federal Government will remove the issue from German politics, which seems to be influenced by the election campaign atmosphere these days. [Moniac] Can Turkey do without German arms? [Ciller] We are interested in continuing constructive cooperation with Germany and other NATO members in the military sphere. It is of great benefit for both sides and for NATO as a whole. Yet, one should not forget that competition in the armament market is stiff and that Turkey is not dependent on a single source as far as military goods are concerned. [Moniac] How should German arms exports be stimulated again? [Ciller] The initiative lies with the Federal Government, whose members we appreciate highly. We hope that, within the framework of long-standing Turkish-German friendship, the Federal Government will not be influenced by certain groups that want to impair our relations. [Moniac] Does the Turkish Government also have instruments to exert pressure? [Ciller] We are not intending to exert pressure. Our objective is to clarify the misunderstandings. Everything else lies within the responsibility of German authorities. It is true that we have to take public opinion in Turkey into account. Nevertheless, we are convinced that our Turkish-German friendship will drive away the clouds above our relationship. [Moniac] The first Kurds holding Turkish passports have been deported to Turkey. Can you guarantee that they will neither be tortured nor executed? [Ciller] Turkey is a democracy based on the principles of law and order with unrestricted respect for human rights. Turkey is a member of various international institutions for the prevention of torture and mistreatment. Such acts are also defined as major crimes by the Turkish Penal Code. As far as claims that deportees are threatened with capital punishment in Turkey are concerned, I would like to say the following: Under Turkish law, such sentences have to be ratified by parliament. Since 1984, the Turkish Parliament has not ratified a single case of capital punishment, which is why death sentences have not been carried out. Besides, application for asylum in another country is not a punishable act under Turkish law. Therefore, these persons will not be subject to criminal persecution in Turkey for having filed an application for asylum.
