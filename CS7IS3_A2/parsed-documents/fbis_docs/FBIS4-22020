According to a release by the Ankara-based International Affairs Agency (IAA) Yeoryiadhis was behind bomb attacks in tourist areas in Turkey last year and also the attempted murder of Turkish general Dorgan Gures in 1992. Yeoryiadhis was shot and killed outside his home last month by a passing motorcyclist, believed to be a Turkish agent. No arrests have been made. Fellow member of the Kurdistan Solidarity Committee, Lakis Pingouras yesterday denied Theofilos' involvement with the alleged crimes. "Our committee offers political support to the national movement of the Kurds, nothing more and nothing less," he said. The committee, which promotes the Kurdish issue to European bodies, is similar to bodies in other countries which count MP's among their members. "We offer nothing other than political support," he said. Pingouras said the IAA follows the local press and brands anybody concerned with the Cyprus or Kurdish problem a terrorist. A branch of the IAA has recently been set up in occupied Nicosia. According to their latest report Yeoryiadhis was a self-confessed agent of the island's Greek intelligence services. The report said the plot to kill General Gures two years ago, by putting poison in his coffee, was hatched in the free areas. Yeoryiadhis, the agency reported, had admitted on a TV chat show he was involved in the plan. It also alleged that bombs against tourist targets in Turkey were designed by the Solidarity Committee.
