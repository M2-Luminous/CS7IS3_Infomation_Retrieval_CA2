ACTION: Final rule; amendments. SUMMARY: In light of the pending restoration of the democratically&hyph;elected government of Haiti, the Treasury Department is amending the Haitian Transactions Regulations to suspend unilateral U.S. sanctions with respect to Haiti, including unblocking the property of most Haitian nationals resident in Haiti, terminating the prohibition on most financial transfers between Haiti and the United States, and terminating a ban on the entry of certain vessels into U.S. ports. The amendment further generally authorizes exports to Haiti of food and food products, and announces the availability of specific licenses for certain humanitarian, journalistic, and other transactions in conformity with United Nations sanctions.

Background On March 31, 1992, the Department of the Treasury promulgated the Haitian Transactions Regulations, 31 CFR part 580 (the ``Regulations''), in consultation with the Department of State, to implement the President's Executive Orders No. 12775 of October 4, 1991, declaring a national emergency with respect to Haiti and ordering specified measures against Haiti, and No. 12779 of October 28, 1991, ordering a trade embargo against Haiti. Since the Regulations were published, the President has issued 6 additional Executive orders: Executive Orders No. 12853 of June 30, 1993, ``Blocking Government of Haiti Property and Prohibiting Transactions With Haiti,'' No. 12872 of October 18, 1993, ``Blocking Property of Persons Obstructing Democratization in Haiti,'' No. 12914 of May 7, 1994 ``Prohibiting Certain Transactions With Respect to Haiti,'' No. 12917 of May 21, 1994 ``Prohibiting Certain Transactions With Respect to Haiti,'' No. 12920 of June 10, 1994 ``Prohibiting Certain Transactions with Respect to Haiti,'' and No. 12922 of June 21, 1994 ``Blocking Property of Certain Haitian Nationals.'' The Regulations are being amended to modify sanctions imposed under these orders, although certain prohibitions set forth in the orders themselves are not reflected in the Regulations. Section 580.211, prohibiting the entry into U.S. ports of vessels engaged in unauthorized trade with Haiti, is removed and reserved. Section 580.518 is added to the Regulations to generally authorize the exportation to Haiti of food and food products. Section 580.519 is added to generally authorize financial transfers to and from Haiti. A conforming amendment is made to §580.516(a), which authorized certain food exports to Haiti now covered by §580.518. No payments or transfers to the de facto regime in Haiti or to persons listed as Blocked Persons of Haiti in revised appendix A are permitted in connection with transactions authorized pursuant to §580.518 or §580.519. Section 580.520 is added to unblock the property of Haitian nationals resident in Haiti not listed in revised appendix A. It does not authorize new transactions with or unblock property of the Government of Haiti or persons listed as Blocked Persons of Haiti in appendix A to part 580. Section 580.521 is added to inform the public that specific licenses are available on a case&hyph;by&hyph;case basis for the exportation to Haiti of fuel and equipment for electric power generation, telecommunications materials, media and educational supplies, agricultural supplies and construction and transportation supplies for humanitarian purposes. Section 580.522 is added to announce the availability of specific licenses for certain charter flights for the use of humanitarian organizations and journalists between the United States and Haiti. Such licenses will be issued in conformity with United Nations Security Council procedures with respect to mandatory sanctions against Haiti. Section 580.523 is added to generally license temporary exportation by journalists and broadcast media of equipment to Haiti needed for reporting, broadcasting, and documentary film making there, and for similar temporary importation into the United States of equipment for Haitian journalists and broadcast media. Finally, appendix A to part 580 (``Blocked Persons of Haiti'') is amended to reflect current information on persons whose property remains blocked by provisions contained in Executive Order No. 12775, 12779, 12853, 12872, 12914, 12917, 12920, or 12922. The names of persons whose property was blocked solely on the basis of their status as Haitian nationals resident in Haiti, pursuant to section 1(a) of Executive Order No. 12922, have been removed. Because the Regulations involve a foreign affairs function, Executive Order 12866 and the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553, requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, opportunity for public participation, and delay in effective date, are inapplicable. Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required for this rule, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612, does not apply.

Payments and transfers of funds or other financial or investment assets or credits to Haiti from or through the United States, or to or through the United States from Haiti, otherwise prohibited under section 1 of Executive Order No. 12920, 59 FR 30501 (June 14, 1994), are authorized, provided that no payment or transfer may be made to, from, or through a person listed in appendix A to this part. 6.

Section 580.521 is added to read as follows: §580.521 Licensing of certain exports. Specific licenses may be issued on a case&hyph;by&hyph;case basis authorizing the exportation from the United States to Haiti of fuel and equipment for electric power generation, telecommunications materials, media and educational supplies, agricultural supplies, and construction and transportation supplies for humanitarian purposes.

Section 580.522 is added to read as follows: §580.522 Licensing of certain charter flights. Specific licenses may be issued on a case&hyph;by&hyph;case basis authorizing charter flights between the United States and Haiti for use by humanitarian relief agencies to transport needed personnel and supplies, or for use by journalists covering events in Haiti. No payment or transfer to, from, or through a person listed in appendix A to this part will be authorized in connection with licenses issued under this section. 8. Section 580.523 is added to read as follows: §580.523 Temporary exports and imports of journalists' and broadcast media equipment. (a) Journalists and broadcast media may temporarily export from the United States to Haiti equipment needed for reporting and broadcasting from Haiti and for documentary film making in Haiti, provided that such equipment is removed from Haiti as soon as the specific reporting, filming, or broadcasting is completed, and provided that such equipment is not made available for the use of persons listed in appendix A to this part. (b) Haitian journalists and broadcast media may temporarily import into the United States from Haiti equipment needed for reporting and broadcasting from outside Haiti and for documentary film making outside Haiti. 9. Appendix A to part 580 is revised to read as follows: APPENDIX A TO PART 580_BLOCKED PERSONS OF HAITI Note: Section I of appendix A lists the names of individuals whom the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control has determined are blocked individuals of Haiti, either because they are included within the definition of the `` de facto regime in Haiti'' as defined in Executive Order 12755, or because they meet criteria for blocking referred to in section 1(b) of Executive Order 12922. Section II of appendix A identifies entities of the de facto regime in Haiti whose assets are blocked. Property of these individuals and entities that is located in the United States or within the possession or control of U.S. persons, including their overseas branches, is blocked, and transactions with these individuals and entities are prohibited. The information listed below is the most complete information now available to the Office of Foreign Assets Control. The absence of any particular person from appendix A is not to be construed as evidence that the person is not a part of, or owned or controlled by, or acting or purporting to act directly or indirectly on behalf of, the de facto regime in Haiti, or is not otherwise a blocked individual or entity of Haiti pursuant to the criteria referred to in section 1(b) of Executive Order 12922.
