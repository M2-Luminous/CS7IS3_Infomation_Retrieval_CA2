He said: China is making efforts to establish a brand-new socialist market economic structure. In the progress of reform and opening up, China has significantly improved its investment environment, gradually amplified its economic laws and regulations, and expanded its investment scope. "From now on, we must continue to deepen reform, open wider to the outside world, and further improve the investment environment in order to offer favorable conditions to foreign entrepreneurs who come to China to promote economic cooperation." Li Ruihuan said: In recent years, economic and trade exchanges and cooperation in other fields between China and Norway have developed rapidly. However, in light of the supplementary nature and strength of both economies, the potential for bilateral cooperation is still great. He added: I welcome more Norwegian entrepreneurs to invest in China and to establish more foreign- funded enterprises. I hope that entrepreneurs from Norwegian economic circles will formulate long-term strategies and foster an enterprising spirit to explore more fields of cooperation with China. Schel Kultin [name as received], secretary general of the Norwegian Foreign Ministry, presided over the meeting. He said: Chairman Li Ruihuan's visit has helped Norwegian enterprises understand China's economic development, and his visit is conducive to promoting the development of reciprocal and cooperative relations between Norway and China. He expressed his hope that Chairman Li Ruihuan's visit will further promote the development of bilateral economic and trade relations based on the existing foundation. Entrepreneurs from Norway's industrial and commercial circles introduced the strong points of their enterprises and the development of cooperation with Chinese enterprises. They offered suggestions as well.
