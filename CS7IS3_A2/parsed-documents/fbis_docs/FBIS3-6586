These vicious words spat out by the chief North Korean delegate to the inter-Korean working-level contact last Saturday stunned even those South Koreans who have become inured to violent language from the North. As the full weight of North Korea's statement and other harsh remarks sank in, Seoul government officials and politicians scurried in search of countermeasures. Both the ruling and opposition parties held official meetings Monday to condemn North Korea's statement and urge Pyongyang once again to continue inter-Korean dialogue. At a meeting of Democratic Liberal Party postholders, almost everybody took up the "sea-of-fire" remark and pressed the government to map out and pursue a consistent North Korea policy. DLP Chairman Kim Chong-pil said, "The North Korean nuclear problem is indeed very serious, but it appears many South Koreans appear to be little concerned." "There are still people in the South who insist on holding behind-the-scenes talks with the North," Kim Chong-pil said. "However, we will have to wake up from such illusion and prepare to meet the situation quietly but strongly with firm resolution." Rep. Yi Se-ki, chairman of the DLP Policy Committee, noted past criticism that the Seoul government has been too optimistic about the North Korean nuclear issue and too dependent on the United States. "There has also been criticism that the government lacks a consistent North Korea policy," Yi said. The ruling party, he added, has been reviewing the government policy on North Korea and urging President Kim Yong-sam's administration to deal squarely with the latest developments. Rep. Yi Han-tong, DLP floor leader at the National Assembly, said he plans to confer with the party leadership on a move to convene the foreign affairs and national unification committee to work out measures on the parliamentary level. Rep. So Su-chong called on the military to take urgent steps in order to dispel the anxiety felt by ordinary citizens. DLP Spokesman Ha Sun-pong said in a statement that the remark about "the sea of fire, which is practically a declaration of war, debased the dignity of South Koreans." "We condemn North Korea for making such violent remarks, threatening war and inciting riots in South Korea," ha said. "The North Korean remarks are anti-Korean people and an anti-unification action." Seoul should keep open a dialogue channel with Pyongyang, but it will have to maintain a firm and resolute position in its negotiations with the North, Ha said. The main opposition Democratic Party reacted strongly to the North Korean threat, while at the same time urging the Seoul and Washington governments to continue serious efforts to engage in dialogue. The DP held a supreme council meeting Monday morning and decided to demand an emergency meeting of the foreign affairs and national unification committee to hear a government report on the issue. In a special statement, adopted at Monday's meeting, the party declared that "there should be no war under any circumstances." It expressed regret over the North Korean threat of warfare which, it said, had shocked peace-loving South Koreans as well as all other people in the world. "North Korea has to accept IAEA inspections of its nuclear facilities," the statement said. "It also is not proper for the United States to make a hasty decision on the resumption of the Team Spirit military exercise and a possible deployment of Patriot anti-missile missiles," the DP statement said. It asserted that the oppostion party opposes any confrontation or heightening of tension on the Korean peninsula. Instead, South and North Korea and the United States must continue to talk in order to break the nuclear impasse. The minor opposition United People's Party said it strongly condemns North Korea for rupturing inter-Korean dialogue and threatening to turn Seoul into a sea of fire. In a statement read by spokesman Kim Su-il, the party called on North Korea to go with the changing current in the world.
