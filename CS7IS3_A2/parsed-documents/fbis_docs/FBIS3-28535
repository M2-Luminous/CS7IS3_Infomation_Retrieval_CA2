An agreement on ownership is expected to be signed today by Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri and his Laotian counterpart Somsavat Lengsavat when they meet at the Foreign Ministry in Bangkok, the sources said. The agreement will set aside the boundary question and enable technical officials to continue negotiations on the administration and maintenance of the bridge. Director General of the Department of Energy Affairs Dr Prathet Sutabut is to lead a Thai delegation to Vientiane soon to discuss administration and maintenance of the bridge. Thai officials said any agreement reached by the delegation would be an "interim measure" to, facilitate the administration and maintenance of the bridge and to divide jurisdiction. But it will have no bearing on the boundary line between the two countries along the Mekong river. The agreement will state that both sides will continue to regard the river's deepest point beneath the bridge as the natural boundary line, the officials said. [passage omitted] Technically, under the Thai proposal, the ownership line would move closer to the Laotian side of the bridge in concurrence with the international borderline along the Mekong River. But the proposal from Vientiane would require a change to the Thai constitution. According to Thai estimates, about 1,000 vehicles will use the bridge daily when it is opened. Prathet said in a recent interview that under a tentative agreement, a BtlO toll will apply to four-wheeled vehicles and about Bt50 will be levied on coaches and trucks. At this stage, the fee will be collected only one-way. Thailand-bound and Laos-bound vehicles will pay an entry fee at the entry point and will not be charged at the exit point, Prathet said. The bridge will be opened between 8 am and 6 pm. However further discussions will be needed to conclude all the details, he said.
