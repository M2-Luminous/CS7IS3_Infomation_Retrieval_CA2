Some deputies proposed to hold plenary sittings of the ninth session of parliament in cases where issues will require urgent discussion by Ukraine's Supreme Council. Such a step was motivated by the start of the pre-election campaign, in which a significant number of deputies are participating. The agenda for the Supreme Council's work for January 1994 was proposed to deputies. The issue concerning the results of the trilateral negotiations in Moscow is not among the 70 issues designated for discussion at the session. A report from Popov's commission (concerning the "Blasko" concern [Black Sea shipping company]) has been added to the list of issues that may be discussed depending on their state of preparedness and time permitting. Supreme Council Chairman Ivan Plyushch described the examination of the law on additions to Point 7-2 of Article 115 of the Constitution to be among the most important issues. It states that the president may repeal acts of the Cabinet of Ministers and other bodies of central power if they are in violation of Ukraine's constitution. This issue is connected with events in Crimea. Rukh Chairman Vyacheslav Chornovil voiced a demand from Rukh to convene a parliamentary commission connected with attacks on Rukh's headquarters in Chernovtsy and Ternopol, an attempt on the life of Colonel Butko, a parliamentary candidate from Rukh, and the kidnapping of Mykhaylo Boychyshyn, head of Rukh's secretariat. Chornovil proposed that the issue of the anti-constitutional actions of Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk, who blatantly violated a parliamentary resolution of 18 November (regarding the ratification of START I) and the situation in Crimea, be included on the agenda and discussed immediately.
