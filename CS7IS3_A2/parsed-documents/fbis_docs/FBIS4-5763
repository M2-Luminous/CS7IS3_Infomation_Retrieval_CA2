It has determined that sole reliance on intracompany managerial resources will not allow it to compete in the turbulent information technology (IT) world. President Kojima has decided that survival will require an aggressive tie up with overseas ventures. NTT supposedly led the advanced world of technology in the areas of integrated services digital networks (ISDN) and optical fiber networks, but Kojima felt, "If NTT does not take appropriate action, it will be left on the wayside by rapidly advancing U.S. technology." It was two years ago that President Hitoshi Kojima of NTT was struck by a sense of crisis. At that time, he was energetically engaged in meetings with executives of U.S. companies that were world leaders in the development of software, such as Chairman Bill Gates of Microsoft and officials of Lotus and Novell. Each meeting he held with these individuals impressed Kojima with the speed with which the IT technology revolution including multimedia was advancing and diversifying and that it was impossible to determine which area would prevail in the IT revolution. Kojima asked himself, "Can we compete effectively with such venture firms with our present resources?" Originally, NTT was supposed to have led the world in the IT field. Even in connection with the common household, it had initiated experiments in ISDN with digital communications capabilities in 1984. In 1985, it built an infrastructure including a 3,400-km optical fiber cable relay net traveling the length of the Japanese archipelago. Based on that experience, in 1990 it launched a "Visual, Intelligent, and Personal Plan" (VI&P concept) shaping a multimedia communication age which called for connecting households with optical fiber cables by the year 2015. The plan called for services such as the remote transmission of high-vision static images and telephone connections with individuals carrying cellular telephones in any part of the country. Even the information highway concept, which is now a substitute term for IT, proposed by Vice President Gore was conceived out of fear for the NTT plan and encompassed the goal of building a communications infrastructure which could compete with Japan. However, now that 10 years have passed since the inception of ISDN experiments, the United States leads in the IT field. President Kojima admits, "The VI&P concept was a dream which was not accompanied by technology of a practical nature." It was the United States that backed up this dream with rapid technical innovations beginning with digital techniques. The University of North Carolina has commenced experiments involving the transmission of images taken by computer tomography (CT) scanners over optical fiber cables to remotely located supercomputers, analysis of angle and volume of radiological exposure for therapeutic purposes, and transmission of three-dimensional images to the concerned physician. The question is, why is Japan, which was supposed to have been first in entering into the "high-level information society," now being left behind the United States in a cloud of dust? Even now, President Kojima does not feel that Japan lags in the hardware area in terms of communications technology. In 1990, NTT led the world in developing asynchronous transmission mode (ATM) switching systems which represent the heart of next-generation communications services and leads the industry in the research and development of switching systems. It is a top-class firm in transmission technology, initiating high-speed transmission experiments on optical fiber circuits with the capacity to transmit 10 gigabytes per second or the equivalent of 10 years of newspaper text in one second. Current world networks have a maximum capacity of 2.4 gigabytes per second. The proposed system will have a capacity which is four times greater. The capability to develop such basic technology will enable completion of conversion to digital switching systems and 100 percent digitalization of communication systems by fiscal year 1997. In 1997, conversion of U.S. communication systems to digital switching systems will have reached a level of only 80 percent. The United States is serviced by nearly 2,000 telephone companies, including financially strong firms such as the AT&T long-distance carrier and the baby Bells which were created as a result of the break up of the former AT&T and a number of small and medium firms. Not all of the firms have the financial resources to purchase the newest technology. Even in terms of ISDN services, which were initiated in Japan in 1988, U.S. firms have not been able to successfully interconnect and are unable to provide nationwide services. On the other hand, however, in the United States, it is possible to use computer networks for instantaneous access to President Clinton's speeches or other government information. Vice President Gore can use personal computer networks to hold a dialogue with citizens and obtain a copy of the record of such conversations from the network. Businesses make active use of such networks. There's also the story about the listing of Chairman Bill Gate's electronic mail number in a magazine and the subsequent inability to cope with the daily volume of 5,000 communications per day. The lesson learned from the past 10 years concludes with the statement, "No IT revolution can be realized without the necessary software." Although Japan is advanced in hardware, IT is actually being used in the United States. What caused this disparity? President Kojima lists the following four reasons: First, he mentions the low rate of personal computer installations, especially the small number of computers linked to networks. Second, he mentions the lack of progress in digitalizing the information data base beginning with visual assets. Third, he mentions lack of progress in cable television (CATV) installations, accompanied by the low rate of household coaxial-optical fiber cable installations. And, finally, he mentions the lack of progress in the use of software to make effective use of networking systems. The lesson learned from the last 10 years leads to the simple conclusion that, "We cannot even start an IT revolution based on hardware initiatives. We cannot start an IT revolution even if we develop ATM switching systems of the highest technology, build networks of the highest technology and are told to use such systems. It is essential that such hardware be serviced by a network so that they can be used by any terminal." Even if we were to lay optical fiber cables, we cannot initiate the IT age. Terminal devises must play a primary role. It is said that "Telescript," developed by General Magic Inc. will become a world-class standard for multimedia and can be installed on and used on computer terminals. However, it has not been developed completely from a technical standpoint. One member of NTT's Technical Department states, "We are still at the stage where we must first study General Magic's technology. During the former NTT days, it was verboten to affiliate with third-party technology without becoming completely conversant with the system." However, we have reached an age where we must make crucial decisions without reaching a knowledgeable level. President Kojima comments, "A research center is filled with a variety of ideas and concepts. However, when it comes to reaching a practical stage, they say wait two or three years. But such an approach does not allow us to keep up with the pace of technological innovation." We must attain developmental speeds reached by U.S. venture firms. The same applies to the Multimedia Promotion Section, under the direct control of President Kojima, which is reviewing the developmental concepts centered on ATM systems. In the past, the communications world was not so concerned about competing in terms of speed. Standards applicable to the industry are normally developed in meetings held by worldwide communications operators at the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) in Geneva which result in the submission of a package recommending international standards in four-year cycles. However, the procedure changed with the arrival of ATM systems. The portion of the actual standards involving intimate work by the computer industry were developed by an industry group composed of leading firms such as Sun Microsystems, International Business Machines, and Hewlett-Packard and later endorsed by the ITU. Communications formed intimate relations with the computer world. Advances in technology accelerated and standards decisions were made on the basis of market competition. The strong survived and de facto standards became the "world standards." NTT could no longer resist this trend. NTT took its first step by investing in General Magic Inc. In January of this year, NTT announced "NTT's Basic Plan Directed at the Multimedia Age," and made clear its strategy to aggressively tie up with terminal and information producers. Concurrently, it established in February a Multimedia Promotion Section under the direct control of the president for the purpose of selecting firms with which to affiliate and to formulate specific strategy. The IT revolution will change the very status of the communications industry. President Kojima states, "We are in an age where anyone can operate an electrical communications business as long as he has a router." In the markets for routers which are switching systems to interconnect networks, U.S. venture firms such as Cisco Systems command a controlling share with information network systems which function with great agility. The small-scale switching system purchased by the Academic Information Center under its fiscal year 1993 supplemental budget was made by Four Systems Inc. of the United States. Just as downsizing has taken place in the computer arena, downsizing is about to begin in the communications world. President Kojima admits, "We have already discarded concepts centering on ATM systems." He has thus parted ways with preference for huge networks centered around ATM switching systems which can handle images, sound and data in one unit. We are no longer in an age where size guarantees competitive capabilities. AT&T Vice President Kakes Roger [as transliterated] comments, "An important factor of the multimedia age is the adaptation of technology held by venture firms." Even AT&T, which leads the world in technical development and operates the Bell Laboratories which discovered the transistor and gave birth to the basic technology for today's semiconductor, has actively affiliated itself with and invested in 3DO Inc., which developed the "REAL" multimedia player which is to be sold domestically by Matsushita Electric Industrial, and EO Inc., a maker of portable computer terminals. Venture firms rich in creative talents will play a principal role in the IT revolution. Competing with the pace maintained by such firms will preclude sole reliance on in-house technology. Even President Kojima states, "We should bet on the winning horse." Unless one is willing to do so, he will not be able to survive in this rapidly changing world. ISDN ISDN represents a digital network which uses a single telephone circuit to transmit items such as facsimiles and computer data. The system was developed to eliminate the previous inconvenience of having to use separate circuits for each service and to sign separate contracts. However, as terminals became sophisticated and as long as the necessary equipment was purchased, it became possible to use telephone circuits by themselves to transmit facsimiles and computer data and the significance of integration diminished for the user. However, there is the advantage with ISDN that information can be transmitted at a higher speed than with a telephone circuit. "INS" is the trade name for NTT's ISDN service. ATM Switching Systems This is a switching system called broad-band integrated services digital network (B-ISDN) referred to as the next-generation digital communications infrastructure. ISDN which NTT launched in 1988 can process data in higher volumes than analogue circuits, but cannot transmit animated images for television. B-ISDN can transmit high-definition television images without affecting quality. ATM switching systems enable the efficient volume transmission of data in this manner and are manufactured and marketed in places like the United States by Fujitsu, NEC, Hitachi, and Oki Electric Industry. Routers Switching equipment of telephone companies such as NTT have the capability to select circuits to reach the number being called and to select alternate circuits if the originally selected circuit malfunctions. A router serves as a switching system for computer networks. As an example, they are used when there is a need to interconnect, via relay lines, a local area network (LAN) installed in Tokyo headquarters with a LAN installed in a research center located in Yokohama. Routers accomplish the task of selecting circuits for the accurate transmission of data, just like the case with telephones, when transmitting data from one LAN to another LAN.

The impact of the information highway is not limited to making personal lives more pleasurable. It will have a dramatic effect on improving industrial productivity. Inclusive of that benefit, the market potential for the information highway is immeasurable. It would be myopic to attempt an estimate of the market size for each area, such as that for video on demand or home shopping. When automotive highways were built and people and industries moved to the suburbs, the United States witnessed the abandonment of inner cities. The next developmental cycle will witness the repetition of the same process on a larger scale. On the one hand, small and midsized venture firms and poorly situated firms will benefit greatly, but large firms that fail to change will not be able to keep pace with the new competitive world created by the information highway. Failure to change will cause many problems. Firms which fail to build competitive capabilities suitable for the information highway age will probably be forced to effect considerable personnel cuts and modify business operations. When advances are made in the installation of the information highway, businesses will be able to cope adequately by retaining only those core technologies and operating resources essential to its operations and by using outside resources for its peripheral needs. Since the exchange of information will be simplified significantly, the number of previous in-house functions to be satisfied on a contract basis can be increased. In fact, if a future image of the company can be clearly defined and attributes superior to other firms can be acquired, it would be preferable to assume a slimmed-down structure. I would like to advise Japanese businessmen that when they face major changes of this magnitude, they must not fear for their losses. Japan possesses core technology in the information communications field, a world-class domestic appliance industry, a respectable entertainment industry--albeit not as powerful as that of the United States--and people with a high educational level. If one were to identify Japan's lagging areas, he would probably point to the low level of CATV installations and the need for further deregulation. Deregulation in the United States gave birth to increased competition and the adverse impact of rising unemployment, but produced major economic benefits overall. Japan should be able to play a useful role in the information age, if it will proceed with deregulation without fear for change. It is a complete error to assume the interpretation that the information highway concept in the United States is being advanced under the principal leadership of government. The information highway will not be built in the same manner as the Apollo program or the aircraft industry. Government merely played the role of the rooster that signaled the arrival of daybreak, and it would be more accurate to say that the realities of the new age had already manifested themselves. The government-prepared idea of the information highway is very crude, no more than a rough guideline, and has very little reference value. There are some who associate the information highway with nationalism, but Japanese businesses need not be concerned. There is no doubt that U.S. firms consider the information highway as providing a large market opportunity and that it will play an important role in strengthening U.S. industry's competitiveness. However, in those areas of the system which relate intimately to individuals' personal lives, it is hard to visualize a situation where U.S. citizens will opt against low-priced, good-quality Japanese-made terminals. The IT revolution will provide Japanese firms with major business opportunities and if the IT revolution takes hold in Japan, businesses will benefit on a worldwide basis. The reason is that the information highway in itself will serve, in reality, to tear down national boundaries of the business world.
