AL-AHRAM says the military escalation was accompanied by a political one as Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's rejected any Arab or non-Arab mediation or entry of Arab troops to disengage the warring sons of Yemen in the north and south. Salih, the paper notes, justified this by saying these events are a Yemeni internal affair. The paper expresses the fear that secret foreign intervention may take place by providing the two sides, or one of them, with enough weapons to prolong the armed struggle, especially since some quarters do not wish well to Yemen or the Arabs in general. The paper recalls the tragedy Lebanon suffered for 16 continuous years. AL-JUMHURIYAH says no one imagined that the unity between the two parts of Yemen would collapse so soon and turn into a war between the two sides. The door is now open to all opponents of Yemeni unity to show their opposition by taking sides and providing either side with money and weapons, the paper says. AL-JUMHURIYAH expresses astonishment that the Yemeni people should be divided by bloody wars as they face terrible problems, such as the country's inability to meet its people's basic needs for food and shelter. Indeed, the paper adds, many schools and educational facilities were built by grants from Egypt, some Gulf states, and other fraternal countries.
