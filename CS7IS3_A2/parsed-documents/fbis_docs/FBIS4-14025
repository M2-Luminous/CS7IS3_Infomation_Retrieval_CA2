FBIS4-14025 "drnes080_c_94010" FBIS-NES-94-080 Daily Report 13 Apr 1994 ARAB AFRICA Egypt U.S. Aircraft Deal With Israel Criticized U.S. Aircraft Deal With Israel Criticized NC2204113594 Cairo AL-JUMHURIYAH in Arabic 13 Apr 94 p 14 NC2204113594 Cairo AL-JUMHURIYAH Arabic BFN ["Dividing Lines" column by Samir Rajab] [Text] It does not befit the United States to sell 25 F-15A military aircraft to Israel in the current tense atmosphere and when acts of violence are taking place daily. With this decision, Washington wants to tell the whole world: "Let Israel strike at the Palestinians as it pleases, let it slow down and stall over implementing the Gaza-Jericho Agreement, and let it set the toughest conditions for withdrawal from the Syrian Golan; that is, if it ever really considered withdrawal." These are not our words. This is, verbatim, what the Pentagon said to justify the aircraft deal: The Pentagon's statement said that the deal will contribute to furthering the foreign policy and national security of a "friendly" country that will remain an important force for political stability and economic progress in the Middle East. First, the claim that Israel is a factor of stability contradicts the truth, because since they "planted it," Israel has been the root of upheaval, conflict, and war. Even after signs of peace began to loom on the horizon, Israel did not give up its shameless actions and behavior. Proof of this is the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and subsequent shameless acts. At the same time, I maintain that the United States has a right to market its industrial products and help its partners survive. Frankly speaking, however, the timing is inappropriate. The need is not so urgent that Israel should be provided with the most modern offensive aircraft on the pretext of strengthening its air force so that it can reach particular positions in Iraq, which fired missiles at Israeli cities during the Gulf war. This, of course, is a flimsy excuse for the simple reason that the United States is the first to know Iraq's current military and economic capabilities, which do not enable it to stage even a limited maneuver, let alone launch a raid on Israel. Anyway, America continues to reiterate that it is a "partner" in the peace negotiations. A partner is supposed to be concerned about attaining the goal. But I believe that the announcement today about a deal for the sale of $2.4-billion-worth of aircraft to one of the parties in the partnership, a party noted for its intransigence, arbitrariness, and conceit, will not make the achievement of the "goal" of peace, which we have long and eagerly awaited, easy.
