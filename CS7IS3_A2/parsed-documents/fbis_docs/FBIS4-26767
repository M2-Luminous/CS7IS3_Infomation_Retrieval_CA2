The water levels of the Xi Jiang and the Bei Jiang have risen rapidly, areas in the Zhujiang Delta are threatened by the biggest floods since the founding of the republic, Changsha has been besieged by floods, and areas outside Nanchang have been submerged. [passage omitted] Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, and Premier Li Peng have many times telephoned the leaders of the flood-stricken provinces and regions and the State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters to ask about the floods, the damage they have done, the fight against floods, and relief efforts. They have also expressed their cordial regards to the cadres, masses, officers and men of the People's Liberation Army [PLA] and the armed police forces, and public security personnel engaged in the fight; and instructed party and government departments in the flood-stricken areas to make sure that people's lives and property are safe, that proper arrangements are made for their living necessities, and that the masses are organized to combat the disaster. On 15 June, General Secretary Jiang Zemin came to Guangdong to inspect the flood situation. He has time and again inquired about the flood situation there and the arrangements made for the flood victims and efforts to combat the floods. When informed that Guangxi, Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujian, and Zhejiang were all stricken by floods, he immediately gave important instructions, urging all principal leaders to organize and lead the masses in the stricken areas to fight the floods. He also exhorted everybody to demonstrate the socialist system's superiority and carry forward the fine tradition that "whenever people in one area have problems, people in all other areas will come to their support." He said party members, government personnel, soldiers, and people should work with concerted efforts to battle the floods. On 20 June, the flood situation in southern China became more critical. In the morning of that day, Premier Li Peng chaired a special meeting in Zhongnanhai to further plan the fight against south China's floods. When the meeting began, he first conveyed Jiang Zemin's important instructions on fighting the floods. One day earlier, on the afternoon of 19 June, Premier Li Peng had called the State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters to inquire about the flood situation. He stressed at the meeting that current flood control should give priority to ensuring the security of the Bei Jiang embankment and the Zhujiang Delta, rescuing those people who have been marooned by floodwater, and making sure that people in stricken areas have enough food and other necessities, are not stricken by epidemics, and have the assistance they need for reconstruction. The meeting decided to send central working groups, headed by Zou Jiahua, Wen Jiabao, and Chen Junsheng and other leading comrades, to Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, and Jiangxi to combat the floods and provide relief services along with local party members, government cadres, soldiers, and people. Speaking on behalf of the party Central Committee and the State Council, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, who was on an inspection tour in Liaoning, telephoned Hunan on the morning of 20 June to express his regards for the five million soldiers and people fighting the floods there. [passage describing the busy work in the State Meteorological Center and the State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters omitted] At the meeting held on the morning of 20 June, Premier Li Peng urged roadway departments to make sure that supplies for battling the floods are promptly delivered. On the morning of 22 June, the first document signed by Guo Lin, vice minister of railways, was an emergency circular drafted the night before instructing all railway bureaus to ship relief supplies to flood-stricken areas ahead of shipments of other goods. The circular instructed that "urgent missions must be carried out as soon as they are handed down." Since 21 June, persons in charge of railways have been working around the clock to take charge of the delivery of supplies needed to combat flooding and drought. As soon as it received Fujian's telegrams requesting assistance on 23 June, the Ministry of Railways immediately dispatched eight trains loaded with relief supplies to the flood-stricken areas. Relevant departments of the State Council, including the ministries of water resources, agriculture, and public health, have already done a great deal of work to combat the floods and provide relief services. [passage omitted] In accordance with instructions issued by the CPC Central Committee and the Central Military Commission, the PLA General Staff Headquarters, the General Political Department, and the General Logistics Departments issued a joint circular on 20 June urging all local units to take an active part in the fight against floods and rush to the most dangerous flood-stricken areas.
