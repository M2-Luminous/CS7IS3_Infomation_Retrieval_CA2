This was stated by Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who is here in Tokyo, in an interview to an ITAR-TASS correspondent. "The adoption of a joint declaration by the G-7 countries and Russia marks in effect the transformation of the Group of Seven into a "political eight," he said. The deputy minister said that even before the previous meeting of the G-7 leaders in Tokyo last summer, Moscow proposed that Russia participate fully in the political part of the discussions at the meeting and that a common "declaration of the eight leaders" be adopted on its results. However, because there was not enough time to prepare a new formula for Russian participation in the G-7 conference, it was decided to turn down this plan. "This time, however, prior to the Naples meeting, Russia submitted this proposal in good time, and it has has been supported on the whole by the G-7 countries; we hope that the Naples conference will be a step forward compared with the previous meetings of President Boris Yeltsin and the G-7 leaders and will demonstrate the readiness of the G-7 and Russia to cooperate in resolving international political problems as a Group of Eight," Sergey Lavrov said. He stressed: "We believe that Russia, as one of the world's leading powers, without whose participation it is difficult to resolve many international problems, should be more actively drawn into the activity of the G-7 than it is at present." The deputy head of the Russian Foreign Ministry pointed out that it was a question of closer cooperation between Russia and the G-7 exclusively in the sphere of politics. In the sphere of economics, Russia, which is now implementing economic reforms, is hardly ready to become a full participant in the work of the Group of Seven. "But in the political sphere, closer cooperation between us is quite possible," Sergey Lavrov said. "The political declaration adopted at the meeting of the G-7 leaders in Tokyo, for example, does not contain a single question that would not be of direct interest to Russia and in whose tackling our country in one way or another would not be involved."
