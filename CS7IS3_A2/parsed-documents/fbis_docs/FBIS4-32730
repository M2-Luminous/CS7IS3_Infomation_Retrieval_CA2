Speaking upon his return to Bratislava Kukan said that his talks with Egyptian President Muhammad Husni Mubarak, Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad and League of Arab States Secretary General were not just polite meetings. He said that Slovakia maintained a good reputation in the Middle East and called for the renewal of the broken ties existing at the time of the Czechoslovak Federation. "Arab countries are interested in developing relations with Slovakia and they are just waiting for the political signal. It is now up to economic circles how they utilize this political capital," Kukan said. Minister of the Economy Peter Magvasi will sign an economic agreement in Egypt next week, said Kukan. He said that Slovakia was not trailing behind the Czech Republic although it still did not have a Slovak-Arab Chamber of Commerce similar to the Czech-Arab one. Kukan said that with its largest trade partner, Syria, Slovakia could continue cooperation in the military area, the power industry, engineering and agriculture. Kukan pointed to a chance which is appearing for Slovak companies to cooperate with Egyptian and Jordanian partners in building infrastructure in Palestine. Slovakia's trade turnover with Syria is about $48 million, with Egypt about $20 million, and with Jordan $7 million. Asked by CTK Kukan elaborated that a contract on supplying 250 Slovak-made tanks to Syria was close to implementation and he did not know about any other under preparation. However, he said that Slovakia was ready to participate in military cooperation, including the modernization of tanks, also with Egypt. On the unblocking of Syria's debt towards the former Czechoslovakia which is worth billions of dollars Kukan said action had first to be coordinated with the Czech Republic. "However, the Syrian side is very reserved in this issue," he said. Kukan stressed that Slovakia's efforts to improve cooperation with Arab states, from which it has no diplomatic relations only with Bahrain and Saudi Arabia, does not mean a change in the balanced approach towards individual countries of this region and in Slovakia's interest in cooperation with Israel.
