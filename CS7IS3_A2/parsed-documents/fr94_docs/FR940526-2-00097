Derived from CES research, the number represented an average for the nation. 2.1.2.4␣Analysis of the 1988 Consumer Expenditure Survey From the 1988 CES, Runzheimer used the statistical report entitled ``Table 2. Income before Taxes,'' which listed average expenditures for families earning similar incomes, organized into eight income ranges. Runzheimer analyzed these data to develop typical spending patterns for the three income profiles identified in 2.1.2.2. (The table below displays the results of the analysis.) Seven income categories encompassed these three income profiles: $10,000 to $14,999 $15,000 to $19,999 $20,000 to $29,999 $30,000 to $39,999 $40,000 to $49,999 $50,000 and over All respondents combined The 1988 CES grouped expenses into small, logical families of items. For example, the report divided money spent by families on beef into four groups: ground beef, roast, steak and other beef. The steak and roast groupings were further separated into smaller clusters of items (e.g., sirloin and round steak, chuck and round roast). Drawing on this survey of expenditure data, Runzheimer sorted the item groupings into the four main cost components specified in the OPM regulations: Consumption Goods & Services, Transportation, Housing, and Miscellaneous Expenses. Runzheimer observed that families in the lower income ranges spent more of their money, as a percentage of total expenses, on goods and services and housing than families in higher income ranges. Also, families spent approximately the same percentage of their total expenses on transportation, regardless of income. Consequently, the Miscellaneous Expense component_which includes such things as medical-care expenses, contributions, gifts to non-family members, pension funds, long-term savings and investments, and life insurance premiums_increased as a percentage of total expenses as income increased. To develop accurate and defensible weighting patterns for the three income levels, Runzheimer performed linear regression analysis on the selected 1988 CES data. Listed below are the results of Runzheimer's analysis for the income ranges listed on the preceding page: Component Expenses Expressed as a Percentage of Total Expenses 1Income Level 1991 1Income Level 1988 (Est.) 1Goods & Services (percent) 1Housing (percent) 1Transportation (percent) 1Misc. (percent) 1Total (percent) $18,000 $16,700 39.59 24.35 20.76 15.30 100.00 28,400 26,300 39.15 23.48 20.33 17.04 100.00 45,200 41,900 38.74 22.66 19.94 18.66 100.00 Runzheimer further sorted Goods & Services into ten categories and used linear regression techniques to provide ratios of renters to homeowners at each income level. Statistics on these component groupings appear later in this report. 2.2␣General Formulae and Applications An ```index'' is a mathematical way to compare one price (or set of data) with another. For example, if a price index for a can of green beans is 110, that means that a can of green beans costs 10% more in the pricing area (i.e., allowance area) than in the reference area (i.e., the Washington, D.C., area). Runzheimer computed indexes for hundreds of items. To combine these indexes, Runzheimer applied weights from the CES that reflected the relative amount consumers normally spend on the items. For example, the price of a can of green beans has a lower weight than the price of a pound of apples because, according to the CES, people generally spend less on canned green beans than on apples. Runzheimer employed an indexing methodology known as Laspeyres to derive total cost indexes for each of three income levels and for each costed location. As applied to living-cost research, the Laspeyres index reflects the expenditure patterns of the people in the reference area (i.e., the Washington, D.C., area) to weight the prices. Because detailed CES data by income level are not published for the Washington, D.C., area, Runzheimer used nationwide CES data to compute weights. Consequently, Runzheimer did not technically apply the Laspeyres index methodology in its pure form. Nevertheless, Runzheimer firmly believes that this nuance does not invalidate the price comparisons presented in this report. As described in the example above and in greater detail in sections 3.2 and 6.2, Runzheimer applied the Laspeyres methodology to compute price indexes for the Goods & Services and the Miscellaneous Expenses components, respectively. For the Transportation and the Housing components, Runzheimer used a combination of a cost-build-up approach and the Laspeyres methodology to compute component indexes. In conformance with section 591.205(c), title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, Runzheimer followed a five-step process to derive the overall total indexes for each allowance area. First, Runzheimer used the CES data and the income ranges described in section 2.1.2.4 above to derive the amount of money consumers typically spend on each component at each income level. These amounts appear in the table below and in Appendix 14. Typical Consumer Expenditures by Income Level and Component 1Income level 1Goods & services 1Own/rent 1Transportation 1Misc. 1Total Lower $7,126 $4,383 $3,737 $2,754 $18,000 Middle 11,119 6,668 5,774 4,839 28,400 Upper 17,510 10,242 9,013 8,434 45,200 Note: Values may not total because of rounding. Second, for each allowance area, Runzheimer multiplied the values above by the component indexes for the allowance area. Because the Housing component consisted of two indexes (one for owners and another for renters), we produced two sets of total relative costs_one for owners and another for renters. Third, for each allowance area and income level, Runzheimer combined the total relative costs for owners and renters using the proportion of owners and renters as identified in the CES to weight the costs. (See section 4.2.1) This produced an overall, average, relative living cost at each income level in each allowance area. Fourth, for each allowance area, the overall, average relative costs by income level were combined using federal employment weights based on the employment at each income level in the allowance area. Applying the same allowance-area employment weights, Runzheimer computed an overall, average cost for the reference area. The last step was to divide the overall, average relative cost for the allowance area by the overall, average cost for the reference area to produce the final index. (See Appendix 14 for the calculations for each index.)
