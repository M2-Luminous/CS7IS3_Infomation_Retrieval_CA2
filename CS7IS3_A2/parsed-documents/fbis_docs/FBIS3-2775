"The action constituted interference in China's internal affairs in disregard of the Chinese law," Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said in a clear reference to the meeting between Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights John Shattuck and celebrated dissident Wei Jingsheng in Beijing on February 27. China was "deeply disappointed" by the incident, Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin quoted Qian as telling Christopher during talks here which Shattuck himself attended.
