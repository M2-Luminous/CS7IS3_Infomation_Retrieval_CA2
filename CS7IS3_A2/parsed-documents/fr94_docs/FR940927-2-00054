FR940927-2-00054 FR940927-2-00039 Employment and Training Administration [TA&hyph;W&hyph;29,841] Season-All Industries Indiana, Pennsylvania; Affirmative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration On August 10, 1994, Local # 611 of the International Union of Electrical Workers (IUE) requested administrative reconsideration of the Department of Labor's Notice of Negative Determination Regarding Eligibility to Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance for workers at the subject firm. The Department's Negative Determination was issued on July 12, 1994 and published in the Federal Register on July 26, 1994 (59 FR 37996). The union claims that Season-All's customers are now importing from Canada. Conclusion After careful review of the application, I conclude that the claim is of sufficient weight to justify reconsideration of the Department of Labor's prior decision. The application is, therefore, granted. Signed at Washington, DC, this 16th day of September 1994. Victor J. Trunzo, Program Manager, Policy and Reemployment Services, Office of Trade Adjustment Assistance. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;23862 Filed 9&hyph;26&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4510&hyph;30&hyph;M
