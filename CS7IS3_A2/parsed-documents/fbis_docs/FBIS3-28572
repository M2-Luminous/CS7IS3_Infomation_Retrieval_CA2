Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN today notes the United States recently deployed new-type F-16 fighter-bombers on a new combat mission at U.S. military bases in Japan and is now scheming to bring Patriot missiles and other sophisticated military hardware into South Korea. The analyst says: The hardline conservatives are crying that "the United States cannot avoid a showdown with North Korea." This is a grave military provocation against the DPRK and shows that the U.S. policy of overpowering the DPRK with strength remains unchanged. The U.S. moves to beef up its forces in Japan are part of the "strategy of forward deployment" aimed at hurling its huge forces into the Korean peninsula without difficulties in "the event of contingency". On the other hand, the United States is planning to stage the "Team Spirit" joint military exercises against the DPRK under another name or in another place, if necessary, breaking its promise to refrain from using nuclear weapons and any other armed force and threatening the DPRK with them. It is also intensifying ideological offensive in a bid to disintegrate the DPRK from within. The U.S. plan to set up "Radio Free Asia" is part of such moves. The United States employs smiling diplomacy at the negotiating table, as if it were interested in peace, and tries hard to isolate and stifle its dialogue partner behind the scene. This is really the height of duplicity and impudence. The United States must know well of the opposite side.
