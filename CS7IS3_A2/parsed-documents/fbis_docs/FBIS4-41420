The draft of the agreement was proposed by Romero Piriz-Ballon, special envoy of the UN secretary general in Tajikistan during the second round of the Tajik talks in the Iranian capital. The ITAR-TASS correspondent has learned this from well-informed sources. One of the leaders of the Tajik Islamic opposition, Haji Akbar Turajonzoda --who is in Tehran at present but is not directly involved in the talks -- explained the views of the government opposition in an interview with ABRAR newspaper. The opposition believes, he said, that the cease-fire must be temporary and limited and must last just for the duration of the talks, that is, until 27 June. Dushanbe does want a prolonged cease-fire, because this would be in the interests of the government. The fact is that, during the summer season the units of the opposition forces want to bring their forces into action. Taking this into account the cease-fire would cause great damage to a number of the opposition's demands: The liberation of the arrested opposition activists, the removal of the ban on activities of the political parties, and the closure of criminal proceedings instituted against their representatives. In addition, the cease-fire must be abided by not only on the Tajik-afghan border but also on the whole of the territory of the republic. The government and Russian troops must renounce warfare methods with the opposition under the pretext of its desire to combat crime. It is also necessary that these troops should not leave their bases. Despite all the obstacles, the opposition leader stressed, we want the talks to be successful. Because that is in the interests of the Tajik people.
