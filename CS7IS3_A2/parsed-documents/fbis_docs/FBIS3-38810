Answering a question on whether he will make official visits to the Nordic countries before visiting Russia, Ahtisaari replies that he wants to visit neighboring countries as soon as possible, but naturally this also depends on the hosts. Asked whether there is a chance for Paavo Vayrynen of the Center to become foreign minister again, Ahtisaari rules out this option. He says that he wants to follow closely the progress of the talks on European Union membership. The first round of elections eliminated the traditional political elite, Ahtisaari says. The election expressed people's desire for a more humane economic policy. The message from women is that much remains to be done about equality. He will try to find solutions, with the government, to a number of problems. Although he has not yet had time to hand in his Social Democratic Party membership card, Ahtisaari says his relationship with the party will be the same as with the other parties. Answering a Norwegian journalist, Ahtisaari says he hopes Sweden and Norway will enter the European Union at the same time as Finland; it is important that all are in it together. As regards steps to combat unemployment, Athisaari says he will not divulge what he intends to discuss with Prime Minister Aho. On the issue of Sarajevo, Ahtisaari notes that it is essential to identify the "murderers" responsible for the recent shelling of Sarajevo. His message to the various parties in the conflict is to seriously seek peace; no party is free of blame, all of them have committed atrocities. Finland should concentrate on peacekeeping, not peace enforcement. Returning to the European Union issue, Ahtisaari says that since the government decided to consult the people in a referendum, the result of that referendum should also be binding. The first round of the election eliminated politicians with the longest experience, Ahtisaari said. Elsabeth Rehn worked in parliament and served as minister for four years; he himself had largely worked abroad. The people now expect a more open political climate. The broadcast concludes at 1245 GMT, when Ahtisaari was due to start answering questions by foreign reporters.
