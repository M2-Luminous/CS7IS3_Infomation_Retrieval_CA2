ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Coast Guard is issuing regulations to require that all manned, oceangoing U.S. vessels 12.2 meters (approximately 40 feet) or more in length engaged in commerce and all manned fixed or floating platforms subject to the jurisdiction of the United States keep records of garbage discharges and disposals. Regulations specifying the vessels and platforms required to maintain these records are mandated by statute. The use of shipboard garbage discharge and disposal records will promote compliance, facilitate enforcement, and reduce the amount of plastics discharged into the marine environment.

Regulatory History On May 20, 1993, the Coast Guard published a notice of proposed rulemaking entitled ``Recordkeeping of Refuse Discharges From Ships'' in the Federal Register (58 FR 29482). The Coast Guard received 23 letters commenting on the proposal. A public hearing was not requested and one was not held. These statutory provisions had been addressed previously in a Coast Guard notice of proposed rulemaking (54 FR 37084; September 6, 1989) but the regulatory section, as proposed, failed to receive OMB approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act and was deleted from the interim rule published on May 2, 1990 (55 FR 18578).
