Taking part in the demonstration were representatives of some 20 political parties and organizations including the New Communist Party of Great Britain, the Britannic Communist Party, the Revolutionary Communist Party of Great Britain (Marxist-Leninist), the Revolutionary Communist Group of Great Britain, the British Anti-Imperialist Youth Organization and the British Organization of Solidarity with the Third World. They staged a protest in front of the U.S. Embassy for hours, strongly urging Washington to stop at once threat to the DPRK and the "Team Spirit" and all other actions of military provocation. The protesters contended that the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula must be settled through DPRK-U.S. talks. Speeches were made by some representatives during the demonstration. Hugh Stephens, representative of the Britain-Korea Friendship Committee, in his speech called for the formation of a nonpermanent organization to defend the DPRK, noting that the prevailing situation was demanding a more organized movement to defend socialist Korea from the imperialists' moves to provoke another war.
