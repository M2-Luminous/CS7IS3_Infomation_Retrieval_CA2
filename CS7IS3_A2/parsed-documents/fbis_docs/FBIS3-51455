At what constituted the first base-level assembly of the province's workers movement, the 80 workers of this center came out in favor of continuing to provide free public health and education services, among others. They all agreed, however, that there had to be an end to inflated personnel rolls, and that direct production labor had to be increased. They explained that excess personnel should accept offers of new jobs that offer a minimal salary guarantee. The assembly also came out in favor of changing the currency as a way to streamline finances, and of confiscating the property of so-called "profiteers" [macetas].
