Pronina: "What Saburov Is Saying and Meshkov Is Writing"] [Text] Rumors to the effect that the price of bread has doubled in Crimea is unfortunately not an April Fool's Day joke. Vice Premier Yevgeniy Saburov was forced to start his practical activities with that highly unpopular step--elimination of subsidies for most popular bakery products. He is categorically opposed to artificial restraints on prices for bread at any cost, which is what was practiced here, since he believes that this threatens the bread industry with complete stoppage and society with a social explosion. "I am for sensible prices which make it possible to heal the sick economy," Ye. Saburov stressed at his first press conference. "We should not drive the disease inward. People must overcome their fear of reforms, unpopular measures and harsh but necessary steps." In order to soften the April-first blow, in accordance with a decision of the government, individual payments for purchase of bread have been increased, primarily for families with many children and for low-income citizens, by 26,000 karbovantsy a month. According to data available for March there were 350,000 such people in Crimea. That figure will probably go up in April. As readers of PRAVDA UKRAINY probably know, more than 100 industrial enterprises in the republic found themselves being threatened with closure and the dismissal of workers on a mass scale. The council of the union of entrepreneurs advised the Supreme Council of Crimea of that and demanded immediate convocation of an extraordinary session to adopt its own law on taxation and prevent such a compulsory measure which will bring concealed unemployment into the open forcing the budget of the republic into unavoidable bankruptcy. As commonly known 110,000 persons, every seventh Crimean engaged in production, supported a lockout. This blow as well will apparently have to be sustained by the government of Yevgeniy Saburov until a new Supreme Council is elected since the current one, completing its last few days, in accordance with the declaration of its chairman, has no intention of accepting the terms of the ultimatum. In reply to the question as to what mechanism the government has, after all, for resolving the economic problems, Yevgeniy Saburov stated that an entire package of presidential decrees on tax policy, currency regulation, banking, and foreign economic ties is purportedly being readied, which will make it possible to halt the drop in production. According to the vice premier all of them are coordinated in general terms with the leadership of Ukraine and are not contrary to its interests. By the way, the hope that the prime minister would bring a team of reformers with him did not materialize. Very few of those willing to exchange Moscow for Simferopol could be found. Saburov will therefore have to rely mainly on local cadres. The content of a message sent by President of Crimea Yuriy Meshkov to the President of Ukraine Leonid Kravchuk pertaining to the shutdown of one of the lines supplying the peninsula with electric power and a cutback in the supply via two other lines, became known in journalistic circles. The Ministry of Energy of Ukraine, it states, is demanding payment of the debt for delivery of electric power which amounts to 300 billion karbovantsy (eight million U.S. dollars) a third of which is the debt of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. This circumstance should be taken into primary account in resolving the question concerning delivery of electric energy. The message also notes that in connection with this sanatoriums and resorts as well as establishments of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine are being crippled, and the broadcast of UT-1 and UT-2 television programs will become impossible. "Further developments in this complex situation depend on your practical actions," the president of Crimea underscores in his letter to the president of Ukraine.
