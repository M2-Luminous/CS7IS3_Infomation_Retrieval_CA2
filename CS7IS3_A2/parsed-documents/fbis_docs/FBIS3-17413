He noted in his interview to INTERFAX that Yuriy Luzhkov has never made such statements about his intention to become the president of Russia. Sergey Tsoy underlined that the main task of the mayor is to work in order to improve the life of Muscovites and not to receive any political advantages from his post. He believes that rumors that have been spreading around that the capital's head of administration allegedly has some political ambitions are not only politically irrelevant but also immoral.
