[passage omitted] Upon arrival in Damascus, President Salih made a statement to the SYRIAN ARAB NEWS AGENCY, in which he said: I am glad to visit sisterly Syria to meet with my brother President Hafiz al-Asad and to discuss with him all issues that concern our two fraternal countries and our Arab nation at the present stage. For us, the visit will be an opportunity to acquaint brother President Hafiz al-Asad with developments and the situation in our country and efforts to overcome the political crisis and implement the accord document, signed in Amman, in order to maintain unity and build the modern Yemeni state. We in the Republic of Yemen cannot do without the role of the brothers in Syria, led by brother President Hafiz al-Asad. They have always been with us. They have always embodied the sincerity of the pan-Arab position toward their brothers in Yemen and have been eager to maintain Yemeni unity, which is a pan-Arab gain before being a Yemeni gain. Preserving this unity is an Arab responsibility, because it is an important factor for consolidating security, stability, and peace in the region. It is also an advanced step toward realizing the pan-Arab unionist objective that strengthens Arab power and meets Arab aspirations for progress. Undoubtedly, our talks will deal with developments in the Arab arena and issues that concern our Arab nation, foremost of which are developments in the Palestine question and the Arab-Israeli peace negotiations. We reiterate our country's position that supports the efforts, led by steadfast Syria, to realize a just and comprehensive peace in the region based on the restoration of Arab rights, foremost of which is the Palestinian Arab people's right to return to their land and set up their independent state on their national soil, and Israel's withdrawal from occupied Arab territory in the Golan and south Lebanon.
