"No one's words can wipe away the grief, the pain, the questions" of the victims' families, Clinton said in a memorial service. "It is our duty... [ellipses as received] to find the answers which they rightfully seek." Secretary of Defense William Perry and Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff John Shalikashvili also attended the service, praising the victims' contributions "to the Kurdish people of northern Iraq, to each of us here." The 26 victims, 15 of them U.S. citizens, perished April 14 when two U.S. F-15C fighter planes accidentally shot down two UH-60 Black Hawk Helicopters over northern Iraq. The toll also included three Turkish officers, one French officer, two British officers and five Kurdish passengers aboard the two helicopters. Perry appointed an investigative board to look into the incident soon after. No final results were released but reports said the "identification friend or foe" system of the two helicopters might be turned off. But one official described the findings as preliminary, saying the crashes' impact might have jarred the switches from "on" to "off," the WASHINGTON TIMES reported last Thursday [21 April]. THE TIMES said if the helicopters had been flying through the no- fly zone with the identification system shut off, it would explain why AWACS [airborne warning and control system] surveillance aircraft got no response from the helicopters when it electronically queried them shortly before the F-15C jets fired missiles on them.
