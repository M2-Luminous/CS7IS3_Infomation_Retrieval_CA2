Saying that he had the great honor of meeting with the great President Kim Il-song, Reverend Graham said he rejoiced over the meeting. Noting that he is currently reading the great leader's memoirs zealously, he said: After having learned the fact that Christian followers actively supported the great President Kim Il-song's revolutionary activities through his memoirs, I was as delighted as the followers were. He added that Rev. Son Pyong-no had helped President Kim Il-song a great deal and noted that the reverend's family enjoyed being with President Kim Il-song. The great leader is a strong and wise leader. He continued to say that he is well acquainted with the dear leader and stated that all DPRK people highly respect him. Recalling the fact that this is his second visit, he said: New streets are laid in Pyongyang. Pyongyang is beautiful, clean, and brilliant. A smile is on everybody's face and I can clearly read the DPRK people's state of mind. I can never forget my Pyongyang visit. Touching on the fact that the DPRK people experienced agony and sorrow for almost half a century due to the country's division, Rev. Graham said: I can feel their agony and sorrow deeply. However, I cannot fully understand those feelings since I am not a party concerned. As I said two years ago during my Pyongyang visit, the United States and the former Soviet Union are responsible for the Korean division. The two countries pursued their interests in Korea, a weak power. Even nowadays, there are many cases of big powers demanding sacrifices from weak powers. I hope my current visit will contribute to reunify Korea and promote DPRK-U.S. relations. I visited your country out of responsibility that I will do my utmost for peace and reconciliation. I would like to pray for the great President Kim Il-song and thank the leaders [yongdoja] of the DPRK. Kang Yong-sop, chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Christian Federation; and Chong Chae-chol, chairman of the Central Committee of the Korea Catholics Association; religious followers and residents of Pyongyang were present.
