Even if human rights violations are painful, the dialogue must be continued, Parliament President Heinz Fischer stated after his meeting with Chinese Parliament President Qiao Shi. After a four-day visit to Germany and Switzerland, which was accompanied by protests, he arrived in Austria with a delegation of parliament deputies. Asked about the human rights situation and Tibet, Qiao Shi referred to China's history and the great significance of the preservation of political stability. Replying to Fischer's request to consider banning the death penalty, Qiao Shi stated that China is not yet ready for a renunciation of this type of punishment. Marijana Grandits, foreign-policy spokeswoman for the Greens, described Qiao as "one of the most sinister figures of China's political landscape." If Austria does not oppose vehemently the systematic human rights violations, this means continuing the tradition of ignorant and opportunist policies. Exiled Tibetans demonstrated in front of the Chancellor's Office in Ballhausplatz.
