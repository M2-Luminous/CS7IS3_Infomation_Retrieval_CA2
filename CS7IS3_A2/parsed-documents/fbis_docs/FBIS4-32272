The object of such grand reflections is the planned highway link that will guide an estimated 80,000 vehicles over the border after its expected completion in the year 2002. The connection is a key component in the Czech government's plans to integrate the Czech transportation and communication systems into European networks. In the eyes of Purchart, a deputy at the Ministry of the Environment, the road will complete a vital continental connection between Berlin and Rome. Unfortunately, there is still no decision on exactly where the Czech dalnice will meet the German Autobahn. The planned road is giving Czech officials a permanent headache due to the nature of the area it will cross. It must avoid the urban conurbation of Teplice and skirt the nature preserves of the Ore Mountains while not disrupting the activities of northern Bohemia's heavy industries. Purchart has not had an easy job. "People still think of the environment as just trees, whereas it is really an integrated overview of numerous elements," he said. In fact, the environment was not viewed in legal terms at all until a new law was introduced in March 1992 to limit the damaging effects of construction on surrounding areas. This forced engineers working on the road link to rethink their plans, which they had been developing on purely technical grounds, and led to the commissioning of a report from the Environment Ministry. Purchart and his department have narrowed the possible routes to a 10-kilometer (6.2-mile) strip north of Teplice, between the Czech village of Krupka and the German village of Furstenau. They now have to decide between a tunnel crossing and an above-ground highway. Purchart favors two tunnel variants, between one-half and five kilometers long, but admits that these are almost twice as expensive as surface roadway. "The surface route would have to be longer, though, so costs could level out," said Purchart. The Germans are not so plagued by doubts. Last week, the Saxon regional government approved a DM 1.8 billion ($1.05 billion) budget along with a route that will lead from Dresden via the border communities of Liebenau and Breitenau to the area designated by the Czech-Saxon working group. "The German side presented less geographical problems, rising slowly to the hilly border region," said Purchart. "The Czech side is steeper and more populated, and therefore more problematic." Milan Machart at the Ministry of Transportation said it will be at least two years before the site for the international link is finalized. His department's ultimate plan is for the major Czech cities to be connected by high-speed roads to Germany, Austria, Poland and Slovakia, providing cheaper services for international north-south and east-west traffic. In addition, road-building and service industries are expected to alleviate the unemployment problems in certain border areas. The highway expansion program is estimated to cost 100 billion Kc ($3.3 billion) in its entirety, a sum to be raised by bank loans and an annual road-users' fee of 400 Kc, to be introduced in January 1995. Given the extent of the planned development, Purchart said he prefers that the Environment Ministry maintain active cooperation with construction engineers rather than vetoing plans as they develop.
