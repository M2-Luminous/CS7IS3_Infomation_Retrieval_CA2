At a two-day meeting in Bonn also attended by Bundestag deputies and members of the Federal Government, the workers' representatives also appealed for measures that would safeguard the German aerospace industry in the long term. Speaking with journalists on Friday, group works council chairman Alois Schwarz called for a program funded to the tune of 2 or 3 billion German marks [DM] as a "start to medium- to long-term planning." The management of Daimler group-owned DASA had announced, last fall, that at least 16,000 jobs would be lost and six factories closed. This, claims a group works council statement, would jeopardize the very being of the DASA group. The incomparably high innovation and investment outlay in this sector could not be met by the industry alone; targeted funding by the Federal Government was needed. The state had to maintain control over production for military purposes; the laws of the market economy should not be the only guiding principle of business; parliament and the government should create the premises that would at least maintain the German aerospace industry at its current level. From the political point of view, the technical expertise DASA represented was just as worth preserving as the coal, steel, and shipbuilding industries or agriculture. The group works council summarized its long-term demands under seven heads: 1. Financing of a research and development technology program, for example for new materials for use in aircraft, helicopters, and spacecraft. Schwarz criticized the fact that, although a new fiber- reinforced composite had led to the development of a new automobile steering wheel column, the automobile industry had not adopted the new material; 2. Support for passenger aircraft construction; 3. Definition of projects and programs for unmanned defense systems; and 4. Interceptors and transport aircraft. The Luftwaffe should state its requirements for helicopters and other transport aircraft. Oskar Pauli (Dornier, Friedrichshafen), seconded by the CDU/CSU [Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union] deputy Bundestag floor leader, Kurt Faltlhauser (CDU), called for the decision on the F-90 to be brought forward and taken before the end of 1994: If the decision were not taken for another two years, DM75 million would be required just to preserve capacity; 5. Close coordination of the Bundeswehr's maintenance and logistics work with the industry; 6. Improvement of German companies' capacity for international collaboration within the EU; and 7. A diversification and conversion (swords to plowshares) funding program; the funds available under EU programs should be used and not be allowed to lapse. Schwarz criticized the fact that, although up to 10 conversion products had already been available from MBB [Messerschmidt- Boelkow-Blohm] in Ottobrunn and Garching in the eighties, the management had dropped these lines when MBB had been taken over by Daimler-Benz in 1988, pending the formation of the new group. The result had been a stagnation in the conversion effort. The products developed at that time were no longer salable, said Schwarz, criticizing the company management's poor judgment: "There is a glut on the market." Schwarz said that only entirely new products, in civil aviation, for instance, held out prospects of success, but this would require massive financial aid both from the group's parent company, Daimler, and from the state. Pauli expressed satisfaction at the response of the politicians attending the conference; in addition to Faltlhauser, these included the Federal Government aerospace coordinator, Reinhard Goehner (CDU), and SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] floor leader Hans-Ulrich Klose. "What we have seen today is a great coalition in favor of research and technology," said Pauli, summing up the views expressed by the politicians. A step forward had been taken. It would have to be followed up firmly over the following weeks and months. Pauli criticized the planned DM1.25-billion cut in the defense budget and the DM250-million cut in the research budget. When savings had to be made, the aerospace industry was always first in line.
