FR940811-1-00010 FR940811-1-00006 III. Analysis of Puerto Rico's SIP Submission For a more detailed discussion of Puerto Rico's submittal and EPA's proposed action on the submittal, the reader should refer to the Technical Support Document developed for this proposed action and found at the previously mentioned addresses. A. Administrative Requirements The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico held a public hearing on October 15, 1993 to accept public comments on the implementation plan for the Municipality of Guaynabo PM 10 nonattainment area. Following the public hearing the plan was adopted by Puerto Rico and signed by the Secretary of State on March 2, 1994. On November 14, 1993, the plan was submitted to EPA as a revision to the SIP. The submittal was supplemented with administrative documents on March 18, 1994 and March 30, 1994. The SIP revision submitted on November 14, 1993 and supplemented on March 18, 1994 and March 30, 1994 was reviewed by EPA to determine completeness in accordance with the completeness criteria set out at 40 CFR 51, and found to be complete. Previously, the Governor of Puerto Rico was notified on December 16, 1991 by the EPA Regional Administrator that Puerto Rico had not submitted the PM 10 SIP requirements due on November 15, 1991. This action formally started both an 18-month Sanction clock and a 24-month Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) clock. In a January 15, 1993 letter, the Governor was notified that another 18-month Sanction clock and 24-month FIP clock, for the failure to submit a permit program for the NSR requirements by June 30, 1992, had begun. Since the November 14, 1993 submittal was found to be complete, the findings made on December 16, 1991 and January 15, 1993 of non-submittal have been corrected and no sanctions will be imposed. In this action, EPA is proposing to approve the SIP revision submitted to EPA on November 14, 1993 and supplemented on March 18, 1994 and March 30, 1994. B. Emissions Inventory Section 172(c)(3) of the Act requires that nonattainment plan provisions include a comprehensive, accurate, and current inventory of actual emissions from all sources of relevant pollutants in the nonattainment area. The emissions inventory should also include a comprehensive, accurate, and current inventory of allowable emissions in the area. Because the submission of such inventories are necessary to an area's attainment demonstration, the emissions inventories must be received with the submission (see 57 FR 13539). Puerto Rico submitted an emissions inventory for base year 1990. The base year inventory identified area sources as the primary cause of PM 10 nonattainment contributing approximately 79 percent of the total emissions during the time the violations were recorded. Additional contributing sources included point sources (19 percent), microinventory sources including fugitive dust sources (one percent), and marine vessels (one percent). EPA is proposing to approve the emissions inventory because it generally appears to be accurate and comprehensive, and provides a sufficient basis for determining the adequacy of the attainment demonstration for this area consistent with the requirements of sections 172(c)(3) and 110(a)(2)(K) of the Act. 2 2 EPA issued guidance on PM 10 emissions inventories prior to the enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments in the form of the 1987 PM 10 SIP Development Guideline. The guidance provided in this document appears to be consistent with the Act. C. RACM (Including RACT) As previously noted, moderate PM 10 nonattainment areas must submit provisions to assure that RACM (including RACT) are implemented no later than December 10, 1993 [see sections 172(c)(1) and 189(a)(1)(C)]. The ``General Preamble'' contains a detailed discussion of EPA's interpretation of the RACM (including RACT) requirement (see 57 FR 13539&hyph;13545 and 13560&hyph;13561). Puerto Rico submitted provisions to assure the implementation of RACM (including RACT) by December 10, 1993. The SIP contains enforceable commitments by the Puerto Rico Environmental Quality Board (PREQB) to achieve various RACM requirements in the regulations as well as through Memoranda of Understanding (MOU). The PREQB has signed MOU's with various entities to include details of how the various RACM requirements will be implemented. Further discussion on the MOU's is included in the enforceability section `G'. The three RACM's contained in the SIP address measures to control emissions from urban fugitive dust sources such as re-entrained road dust from paved roads, unpaved roads and parking lots, and windblown dust from construction sites and other areas; 1. The SIP determined that an efficiency of 25 percent was reasonable in controlling emissions of fugitive dust from paved roads. 2. The SIP determined that a control effectiveness of 70 percent was reasonable in controlling emissions of fugitive dust from unpaved roads, based on the use of chemical stabilization. Also, a control effectiveness of 90 percent is used for unpaved roads and parking lots located at industrial facilities in the Municipality of Guaynabo. 3. Due to uncertainties in quantifying the emission reduction benefit for construction sites and other areas where land is subject to wind erosion, no credit was taken in the attainment demonstration for emission reductions. However, controlling these sources using Puerto Rico's SIP measures will further assure attainment of the NAAQS in the Municipality of Guaynabo. In addition to the control measures for fugitive dust sources, five point source categories were identified as contributing to the PM 10 nonattainment problem in the Municipality of Guaynabo. RACT for these source categories are: 1. Electric Utilities (greater than 25 megawatts of generating capacity) are limited to the use of 1.5 percent sulfur in No. 6 fuel oil; 2. Petroleum Refineries are limited to the use of 1.0 percent sulfur in No. 6 fuel oil; 3. Grain Handling facilities must install control equipment that is 99.5 percent efficient; prohibit clam unloading of barges; require all material handling operations including truck loading/unloading, and ship unloading to take place in fully enclosed rooms and vented to a control device; and implement a street cleaning program for all yard activities associated with vehicular activities; 4. Asphalt Blowing facilities must install control equipment that controls 90 percent of the emissions; and 5. Quarries/Rock Crushing operations must utilize water to suppress dust thus achieving a 70 percent reduction in emissions. The RACT regulations will apply to sources in these source categories which are located in or have an impact on the Municipality of Guaynabo. The following table includes the estimated PM 10 emissions before and after controls for the source categories previously mentioned.
