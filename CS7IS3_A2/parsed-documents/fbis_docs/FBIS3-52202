Lately the United States has been pressuring international agencies to persuade North Korea to allow inspection of its facilities and has even threatened to nuke North Korea if they ever built and used one. Butrus-Ghali was on a mission to intercede between the U.S. and North Korea. North Korea has not accepted the International Atomic Energy Agency's request to inspect its facilities and considers its nuclear activitis to be peaceful and regards U.S. attempts as bullying moves of intimidation. What is unfortunate is that the secretary general of the United Nations is putting himself at the disposal of one of its members, namely the United States. This is an important and opportune occasion (the birth of Jesus Christ); the secretary general should have considered other places. For instance, the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina cries for intervention of an international body. Butrus-Ghali could have visited Serbia to put pressure on Serbs to end the genocide and massacre of innocent people. The question of nuclear weapons should worry any conscientious individual. Weapons of such destructive powers are no toys for any military. Only the United States has used this weapon (in World War II). The Islamic Republic of Iran has maintained that its nuclear activities are peaceful and representatives of international agencies have repeatedly confirmed this. Governments with nuclear capability claim to be stable and promise to take measures to control its military use. The former Soviet Union was such a stable government. When President Reagan was shot, the confusion in the White House as to "Who is in control!" testified to another stable government. Conscientious individuals in the world have been rallying to ban nuclear weapons. Iran also believes that since nuclear weapons are dangerous and destructive, and that they could get out of control and create a world disaster, no country should have them.
