During the training a strategic purpose guided missile cruiser [raketnyy podvodnyy kreyser strategicheskogo naznacheniya] of the Northern Fleet launched, on the command of the commander in chief, a ballistic missile from the waters of the Barents Sea to Kamchatka area. It is reported that the missile head arrived at the predetermined destination. The launching was carried out in an ordinary manner. Similar exercises also took place at the state missile testing ground at Plesetsk. For the first time in the entire history of the strategic purpose missile troops, journalists observed the launching of the Topol SS-25 intercontinental ballistic missile, which will become the basis of Russia's strategic nuclear forces before the year 2005. It is the purpose of the exercises to develop a system of monitoring and tracking and to check the reliability of the military equipment. The 45-tonne missile was launched towards a training target situated on the Kamchatka peninsula. Its nuclear warhead weighing practically a tonne is capable of striking the target with an accuracy of a few meters. The missile also works well for peaceful purposes. In the autumn of this year the refitted Topol will put a radio-technical satellite into near-Earth orbit. When the missile has served its military term, the missile will launch a satellite a second time. In the future this will allow Russia to resolve two tasks simultaneously: in accordance with the START-II treaty, to cut down nuclear armaments and to create a launch vehicle for space satellites without enormous expense. One only needs to add that today's exercises were absolutely peaceful ones. The unarmed warhead, which struck the target precisely, did not harm anyone.
