In October 1986, the authors found this disease in Nanjing and carried out a series of studies in 1986-1992. The results were as follows: Tsutsugamushi disease was epidemic in Nanjing and north of Jiangsu (including: Dongtai, Haian, Rudong, Jinhu, Hanjiang, Jiangdu); which was found to be autumn-winter type, with main reservoir hosts being Apodemus agrarius, Rattus confucianus, R. norvegicus and Crocidura lasiura; and transmitting vector L. (L.) scutellare. The pathogen of tsutsugamushi disease of the autumn-winter type -- Rickettsia tsutsugamushi belonged to low-virulent strain, and could not easily be detected. After the inoculated mice were treated with diluted cyclophosphamide solution, 14 strains of R. tsutsugamushi were isolated from rats, mites and patients, and serological typing of their sera showed that they belonged to the Gilliam type. Natural foci in Jiangsu could be divided into two types -- flat land and hilly land.
