Could one not have come to an agreement without pointing a gun at the president's head? [Miller] First, we should ask a question regarding the president's real goals. Is he ready to "live together," or will he fight the coalition with every possible means at his disposal? And we should keep in mind that he has quite a few such means: He is empowered to veto laws and to cause a decisionmaking paralysis, and he can join all those who think that "the worse it is, the better it is." So we could be facing deadlocks for months to come, which will be disastrous for Poland, but perhaps they will enable the president to gain the most right-wing and the most populist electorate that would constitute the basis for his support in the coming elections. If those are the president's goals, this war is unavoidable. We will then be dealing with such diverging interests that it will be hard to find any compromise. But if, on the other hand, the president is of the view that such "living together" is possible, one should avoid making decisions that would make both sides' positions rigid, and one should look for compromise solutions. [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] Which scenario is more likely? [Miller] Sometimes I have a feeling that the first scenario is more likely, and at other times I have a feeling that the second one is. At this particular time, I would be willing to admit that Lech Walesa is willing to cooperate. But I cannot be sure because the president is not consistent with regard to his views and feelings. He changes them rapidly, and then he sends conflicting messages to the public at large. [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] Suppose the Belweder grants certain concessions--would you be in favor of withdrawing the draft of amendments to the Small Constitution? [Miller] If the president were willing to come to a compromise solution and to live together, then, yes, I would be in favor of that. But that issue is of no major importance after today's [20 April] meeting between Walesa and the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] because we gave up on the idea of amending the Small Constitution. [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] What kind of proof of a compromise position would you expect from President Walesa? [Miller] First of all, a resolution of the issue of deputy prime minister for economic affairs. After all, there is a vacancy at one of the most important state posts, and that is not a normal situation. I view the president's reservations regarding our candidate as not very convincing. [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] So are you saying President Walesa should accept Rosati? [Miller] That is exactly what should be the topic of conversation. And either the president comes up with more serious reservations regarding Rosati's candidacy, if he can think of any, or he simply decides that Rosati is a good candidate and approves of him. [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] All that looks like a dispute concerning prestige. [Miller] If we want to achieve any personnel success in the future, we cannot lightheartedly abandon anyone we recommended because no one else will agree to be a candidate afterwards. [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] But everybody knows that, if there is anyone stubborn in Poland, it is Lech Walesa. Because he said that Rosati will not join the government, then, even if he agrees now, he will try to have it his way next time. [Miller] Lech Walesa often changes his mind. [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] Are such joint stands by the entire coalition against the president a cementing factor for the coalition? [Miller] Definitely. After all, they prove the falsity of all those speculations that Prime Minister Pawlak is allegedly staging a theatrical performance of some sort with the president, with an amazed public watching it. Right now, more and more people can see that is just not true and that we are dealing with a genuine difference of views. Anyway, I think the prime minister must have recalled the fates of all of the president's loves, beginning with the first triumphant picture with Jozwiak and Malinowski [not further specified] and ending with recent events. Being an intelligent man, the prime minister can draw his own conclusions. [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] So that means it used to be different before. [Miller] I think that both Pawlak and the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] could have a feeling that the SLD is yearning for a different type of coalition arrangement. Some statements--like, for instance, that the SLD feels closer to the Democratic Union--could have aroused such a suspicion. And it is possible that the prime minister was looking for some kind of an alternative just in case it turns out that he has to build a coalition with somebody else. That is exactly what could have been the reason for the kind attitude taken toward the Belweder, which could be seen in particular at the beginning of the government's term. [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] Did you have a feeling during the crisis over Kawalec and then Borowski that the prime minister cooperates with the Belweder against the SLD? [Miller] The rush with which all that happened, especially on the part of the president, may lead to such a conclusion. But I really do not think this was a message on Pawlak's part that he was acting against the SLD's interests, but, instead, it was a message that he intends to be the prime minister and the Cabinet's chief. At any rate, I will be blunt about this: The previous finance minister acted inconsiderately. [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] It can be concluded from what you are saying that both sides are to blame for the flaws in cooperation between the coalition partners. [Miller] It all began with the prime minister. After all, the first scandal we went through, even before the formal establishment of the government, had to do with presenting the president with a different government composition than what had been agreed upon with us. But one can say that both sides provided a lot of reasons for the decrease in mutual confidence. [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] But, if a compromise with the Belweder turns out to be impossible, are you not afraid that the PSL will take the Belweder's side in the end? [Miller] The coalition gains strength with each passing day. [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] Does Pawlak have to be afraid that, being only with the SLD and with no support from the Belweder, he will eventually be dominated by the SLD? [Miller] No. Pawlak is this government's prime minister. Besides, I have a feeling that the PSL will win the self-governmental elections and that that will strengthen Pawlak's position. [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] Do you agree with the views expressed by some right-wing politicians that the president's moves are purely destructive and disastrous to the country? [Miller] That would be an overstatement. Walesa has acted very responsibly at a few historical times. But I have a feeling that the closer we get to the elections, the more the president wants to approach Poland mainly from the standpoint of the elections. [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] But a preelection fever is also visible in the SLD. We have been getting messages concerning friction between Kwasniewski and Oleksy. We hear that a competition is beginning about who is to be the candidate. [Miller] There are such differences, and they will be there in the future. You, gentlemen, are familiar with the SLD's leadership so you know that it comprises ambitious people who have their own views that they do not give up easily. There was a time when Kwasniewski and I were perceived to be opponents. I can see that a need is emerging for another antagonism-based duo. The election campaign will be conducive to a rise in temperature also within the SLD. [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] In an article of yours published in TRYBUNA, you wrote that "there is a need for a coalition agreement in the presidential elections." Is that supposed to mean that the PSL and the SLD should come up with a joint candidate? [Miller] If one could do that, it would be the best solution. But if we do not accomplish that, then what we should agree upon, at the least, is that we, for instance, will not interfere with each other in the first round of the elections, and that we support a joint candidate in the second round. [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] But it could happen that candidates for both the PSL and the SLD will enter the second round. [Miller] In that case, that would be much harder to accomplish. [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] Is it conceivable to you that Pawlak should be the SLD's candidate in the elections? [Miller] I refuse to answer the question. Or maybe not. During the previous presidential elections, I submitted Aleksander Kwasniewski's candidacy for president of the Polish Republic at a session of the Chief Council of Social Democracy of the Polish Republic. I will gladly do the same thing again. [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] Is the cooperation between the coalition partners up to now--within Pawlak's government--good grounds to believe that an agreement like that is possible? [Miller] I think it is. We still have a few months ahead of us during which more events may unfold that will strengthen the coalition. Right now, I sometimes have a feeling that our electorates are closer to each other than the leaders, while the process of rapprochement between the electorates will continue. That pressure will also be of some importance.
