The U.S. announcement on withdrawal of all restrictions on imports of hand loom exports from India is a major gain for India. India on the other hand has agreed to dilute tariff barriers to entry of high-valued U.S. textile exports which will go a long way to meeting the American sensibilities about the textile trade. For even now, the textiles industry is a major source of employment generation in that country. In view of the importance of textiles for employment of U.S. labor, the United States had for the last decade been insisting on more gradual phasing out of the controversial Multi-Fiber Agreement -- MFA -- which tended to depress imports of textile items into the world's largest economy. The MFA had imposed some arbitrary quotas on textiles exports from the manufacturing countries which India had always maintained was the subtraction from the rule-based trading regime. MFA is now proposed to be phased out in 10 years. Although the details of India's opening up of the textiles market to the United States has yet to be worked out, in a sense this should be of considerable importance. Currently Indian tariff on textile imports is around 85 percent and there are some quantitative restrictions besides. Under the commitment given now, India will be obliged to bring down the tariff rates and remove some of the quantitative restrictions. The areas of restrictions will to a large extent determine the possible volume of imports from the United States. The withdrawal of U.S. restrictions on Indian hand loom imports should certainly mean a major step up in activities in some segments of Indian hand loom industry. The textiles industry as a whole employs about 15 millions in India. The synthetic textile industry is capital intensive and, therefore, the employment generation in this sector is limited. On the other hand, rough and ready estimates indicate that the hand loom sector employs no less than 8 to 10 million workers and any increase in exports could bring about a significant improvement in their economic situation. Indeed, the cotton sector alone is expected to be the biggest beneficiary of any increase in exports since it is this item that accounts for nearly of the hand loom sector's exports. However, the bilateral concession to India on textiles is a just a windfall profit and demonstrates the negotiation skills of a team which had gone to Marrakesh for signing the agreement on completion of the Uruguay round. There are some major differences with the United States over the general stand Washington has taken on multilateral issues relating to the new order. The United States had been in the vanguard of those developed countries which had demanded linking of social policy issues with trade policy. In effect, these countries are demanding that the labor standards, particularly the wage levels in the developing countries, should be taken into account in deciding the framework for conducting international trade. If these developed countries succeed, this would virtually take away the comparative advantage of the developing countries in the form of lower wages. The United States is advancing all this concern for labor in the name of raising standards of living in all countries. Its effect could be quite the contrary. The activist policies followed by the United States to shut out imports selectively from different countries, which it dislikes on some grounds or other, had been noticed even by many of the developed countries. In fact, the ministerial declaration on the accession to the Dunkel final act is carrying an exhortation to the effect that no signatory should take unilateral action which could jeopardize the flow of trade among the nations. This has obviously been introduced to discourage countries like the United States from using trade restrictive measures under its various omnibus legislations like Super 301 or Special 301 between now and the formation of the World Trade Organization.
