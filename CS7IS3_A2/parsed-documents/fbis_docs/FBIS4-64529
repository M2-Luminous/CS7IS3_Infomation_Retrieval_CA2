French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher agreed on the move during a telephone conversation Tuesday morning, he said, giving no details of where or when such a meeting might take place. He said an urgent meeting is needed in particular because of the increased threat of conflict outside the six UN-designated safe areas in Bosnia-Hercegovina. "The prevention of new slippages...necessitates the deployment on the ground of new protection forces outside the security zones established by the UN Security Council." He said a switch from "respecting Security Council resolutions to Atlantic Alliance decisions" was required, in an apparent reference to the possibility of using force. Concern has been focussed in recent days on the Brcko corridor in northeastern Bosnia, where Serbs are trying to widen their supply route between Serbia and northwest Bosnia. Duque said there was "a worrying concentration of troops from both sides" in the region, adding that talks were continuing on a possible increase in peacekeeping forces, in particular around Brcko. Military analysts predict that Brcko, in a five-kilometre (three-mile) bottleneck in supply-lines from Serbia to Serb areas in northwestern Bosnia, will be the next target of Serb offensive.
