The methods were jointly stipulated by the State Administration for the Inspection of Import and Export Commodities and the Ministry of Finance. In recent years, foreign investment in China has risen rapidly. By the end of 1993, China had approved 170,000 foreign-funded enterprises, involving 210 billion U.S. dollars in contracted foreign funds, 60 billion U.S. dollars of which were finally put to use. Eighty percent of the investment was in the form of machines and equipment and margins existed between their value and evaluation. In 1993, the State Administration for the Inspection of Import and Export Commodities re-evaluated 2,121 cases of foreign investment assets, claimed by owners to be worth more than 965 million U.S. dollars, and found that they were worth slightly over 800 million U.S. dollars. The appraisals to be adopted will cover variety, quality, quantity, value and losses. Appraisals of variety, quality and quantity will cover the assets' names, types, quality, quantity, size, trademark, rate of obsolescence, date of production, nation of origin and manufacturer. Value appraisal will cover the contemporary evaluation of foreign investment assets and loss appraisal will cover the reasons and degrees of losses caused by natural disasters and accidents, cost of clearing up losses and remaining value of the assets. The State Administration for the Inspection of Import and Export Commodities will take charge of the nationwide appraisal of foreign investment assets and its local bureaus will take care of the local appraisal work. To deal with the examination of foreign investment assets, an accounting office must hold a value appraisal certificate of the State Administration for the Inspection of Import and Export Commodities or other relevant organizations, the "methods" said.
