Comments made by Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri and National Security Council Chief Gen Charan Kunlawanit were preposterous, not to mention the less than candor remarks by Prime Minister Chuan Likphai. Chuan, who can make a difference in Thai-Cambodian relations, instead has chosen to sit on the fence with increasing antipathy. In essence, the Thai leaders were saying all the same thing -- providing arms now for the Phnom Penh government would jeopardize the peace process in Cambodia. Thailand, they argued, would be affected by the ongoing fighting along the Thai-Cambodian border and the situation would worsen if more weapons are given to Phnom Penh. And these arms could be put up for sale along the Thai border. Finally, what Cambodia needs, they said, is humanitarian aid for its people. What the Thais have not said are more interesting as in it are found expressions in the country's overall policy towards Cambodia. It is all boiled down to one thing -- Thailand has not yet done enough to dispel suspicious among the Cambodian and international community over the country's alleged existing links with the Khmer Rouge. Therefore, the question of foreign aid in the form of arms to Cambodia has been brought into the picture to pressure Thailand to do more. France, Australia and the United States, the three major countries which used to strongly support Thailand's policy toward Cambodia, have now all turned against Thailand. They are also fed- up with Thailand's halfhearted attitude towards the Phnom Penh government, which is the only legitimate group recognized worldwide. Worse still, ASEAN is also turning its face away from Thailand. During the ASEAN senior officials' meeting in Phatthaya last month, Bangkok failed to garner support from the regional grouping in issuing a statement on the situation in Cambodia which stated that the crux of the current problem there was the infightings between the government and Khmer Rouge forces. Even Thailand's friends in ASEAN did not buy that kind of argument. If the Cambodian controversy drags on into the future, Thailand's role in the ASEAN Regional Forum will be marred. Bangkok can never speak for the region's security and emerging strategic order as it would be considered a pariah if the Khmer Rouge issue persists. Cambodia alone cannot change Thai behavior and for that reason more powerful countries have joined Phnom Penh's efforts. Clearly, the Western countries want to pressure Thailand to help with the peace process, Cambodia's rehabilitation and reconstruction, which have been beset with huge problems resulting from over two-decades of incessant civil war. Without Thailand's cooperation, they realize, Cambodia's future stability will forever be in jeopardy. And the Thais know it fully well and are aware of their power and potential in Cambodia. As a bigger and richer country, Thailand has to be generous towards its neighbor. Bangkok cannot just adopt a tit-for-tat policy. But all blame must not fall on Thailand. Cambodia too has to share some of it. From a historical perspective, Thai-Cambodian quarrels and conflicts, have more often than not stemmed from leadership idiosyncrasies among leaders in both countries. On the Cambodian side, there is the mercurial King Norodom Sihanouk, who has spent literally all his life wading off Thailand, to ensure his country's neutrality and independence. He has outlasted and outmaneuvered many Thai leaders. In fact, King Sihanouk is the only world leader who knows Thailand (besides singing Thai songs) so well, including ways to draw Thai blood. And now, he is passing this art of survival through his clan, who are running the country. As far as Thailand is concerned, Thai leaders just hate Cambodia. Behind the Thai smile lies a long sharp dragger. In the early Bangkok period, if the same conditions had prevailed as today, Thai troops would have stormed Cambodia several times over -- not to mention those lunatic Thai leaders in the 50's and 60's and what they might have done. However, the present Thai leaders are not much better than their predecessors. They have shown ignorance and arrogance, the deep- rooted trait that does not support Thailand's growing clout in the regional economic and political arenas. They continue to view Cambodia through the same old prism, which had already caused numerous misunderstandings and tensions between the two countries for the past centuries. How Thailand is dealing with -- Cambodia today is not dissimilar with the policy practiced in the 1950's-60's. Phnom Penh's outrageous reactions were equally predictable. Obviously, both sides have not learnt from their common history. Unfortunately, even though there is a Cambodian ambassador-designate, Roland Eng, in Bangkok, he has yet to reconfirm and officially take up his job. Relations could improve if their diplomats on both sides met. Without proper consultation through diplomatic channels, the two countries could repeat the bitter past when they suspended bilateral relations twice under Sihanouk's reign. Finally, the Khmer Rouge issue happens to be Thailand's current albatross in the long annals of Thai-Cambodian relations. The Thai leaders know that even without the Khmer Rouge problem, other hidden issues will quickly rear their ugly heads. In the end, there would always be the trouble-ridden Thai-Cambodian border with poor demarcations to quarrel about. Absurd as it may sound, some of the Thai leaders still prefer to associate with the predictable and disciplined Khmer Rouge and are willing to sink with them, thinking that sooner or later they can get away with it as the world will have only Cambodia to be concerned about. This is sheer folly that will bode ill for Thai-Cambodia ties.
