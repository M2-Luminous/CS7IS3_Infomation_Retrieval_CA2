De La Paz] [Text] Shell Phils. [Philippines] Exploration (SPEX), operator of the Camago-Malampaya fields in offshore northwest Palawan, yesterday successfully completed its short production tests or drill stem tests (DST). SPEX's second DST on the gas zone of the well recorded a final flow rate of 24.8 million cubic feet of gas per day and 1,252 barrels per day of condensate. Dre Boon, SPEX vice-president, earlier told BUSINESS WORLD Shell needs a flow rate of about 20 million cubic feet of gas per day for the well to be considered of commercial value. The bottom portion of the well, which contains the oil, also yielded good flow rates. Shell is satisfied with the stabilized flow rate recorded in the oil zone at about 5,627 barrels of oil per day, more than what was expected, Mr. Boon said. SPEX will drill its second appraisal well, Malampaya-4, by mid-June to confirm the extent of the reserves of the Malampaya structure. Mr. Boon said the Malampaya 4 well will be halfway between the Malampaya 1 and 2 wells in the north and Malampaya 3 in the south. The theory behind this drilling strategy is if Malampaya 4 shows the same characteristics as the other wells and shows positive oil and gas flow rates, then it is possible that Malampaya is one big structure. As such, the extent of the oil and gas reserves can be estimated. However, while these developments confirm the presence of substantial oil and gas deposits in the area, harnessing these deposits for commercial quantity may not be easy due to the costs involved, as these are in very deep waters. Shell is still negotiating with National Power Corp., its main market, to commit 3,000 megawatts to run on natural gas by 1998. However, because of the costs involved not only in production but also in transporting the gas from the well-head to Luzon shores, the power firm and Shell have not inked any gas supply contract. One contention against the use of natural gas by 1998 is the additional cost of retrofitting the thermal plants. Moreover, natural gas-fed plants must also be competitively priced in order to compete for a slot in the power development program (PDP). The PDP will be using various fuel resources such as coal and geothermal to come up with an efficient generation mix between 1998 and 2005.
