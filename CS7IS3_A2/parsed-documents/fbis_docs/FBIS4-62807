[passage omitted] According to M. Fedorov, the total value of the first tranche of bonds is $266 million. Moreover, another $250 million will be paid out in the form of interest on all five bond issues. Under the terms of the placing of these securities, the period for presentation of the bonds for repayment is set at 10 years -- in other words, until 2005. So those who are unable to obtain their money immediately after 16 May will be able to do so in the next few days -- there is plenty of time. Naturally, bond-holders will be trying to redeem the bonds and gain their interest in the first few days. Here a question arises -- will they not be hampered by all kinds of technical shortcomings? But, M. Fedorov assured us, the Vneshekonombank has already received from the government all the foreign exchange required and has transferred it to its 23 authorized banks, with branches throughout the country. There should be no problem in redeeming the foreign currency bonds. Nonetheless, it should be borne in mind that the first tranche of bonds are held by only a few lucky people. They were mainly placed with commercial banks, joint ventures, and charitable foundations. State enterprises -- or what had until recently been state enterprises -- as a rule received the fourth and fifth tranches of foreign currency bonds. And they may simply not survive until redemption -- in other words, they could go bankrupt. Admittedly, an aftermarket in state foreign currency bonds is already taking shape. And those enterprises which need the money immediately -- for restructuring, say, or to pay their debts -- can sell their securities. But, naturally, for far less than they are worth. Thus, according to specialist assessments, the second tranche of the securities currently stand at 62 percent of par in the aftermarket, the third tranche is trading at 42 percent, the fourth tranche at 31 percent, and, finally, the fifth tranche is trading at 26 percent of its par value. Of course, many enterprises see this as robbery -- and not by those purchasing the bonds, but by the state. Nonetheless, to be fair, it should be said that the blame for this hardly lies with the current Russian Government. It is paying up for other people's debts, even though it has assumed them itself. Moreover, the fact that under the current complex conditions the government has clearly honored its obligations under the first tranche of the foreign currency bonds even as regards the payment of interest will undoubtedly strengthen confidence in other state securities and have a positive affect on the financial situation as a whole. Incidentally, many specialists were forecasting on the eve of the scheduled payments that the bond redemptions could destabilize the foreign exchange market and lead to an uneven fall in the ruble. But, as is not hard to calculate, all of the first tranche together with the interest on all the other tranches comes to around $500 million. This is not such a big sum -- it is comparable to the size of just a week's trading on the Moscow Interbank Foreign Exchange Market.
