Speaking at a recent meeting on exchanging experiences in village and township industry among Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and four other cities, Jiang Yiren, vice mayor of Shanghai in charge of village and township industry, said: Shanghai's industrial development "will be bolstered by two factors: the development of Pudong and village and township industry." According to statistics, increased output value turned out by Shanghai's 15,000 village and township enterprises has exceeded 50 percent of the municipality's annual increased output value of industry since 1988, reaching 53 percent in 1993, while the increase of their export trade exceeded 40 percent of the municipality's increased export trade volume last year. According to well-informed economists, Shanghai's village and township industry, as the "huge reservoir" for major urban industrial readjustment, should gradually eliminate the condition of "chimneys in every village," set up small industrial zones, raise investment returns, and coordinate development with major industries in a systematic manner. Shanghai's village and township industry will be highlighted by an "export-oriented" feature in the second half of the 1990's. By inducing foreign capital and technology and expanding foreign trade, the municipality will gradually combine its advantage in suburban labor with imported technology and capital and foreign trade in forming a "joint force" and striving to make village and township industrial export trade constitute at least 30 percent of the municipality's total export volume within two or three years.
