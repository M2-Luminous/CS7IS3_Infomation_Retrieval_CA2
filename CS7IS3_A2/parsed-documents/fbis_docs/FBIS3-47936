"Arrangements are now being made in that direction," vice finance minister Jiro Saito told reporters. Bentsen will make a stopover in Tokyo on his way back from visits to other Asian nations. Saito said no official decision on the meeting has been made, nor has a possible time been set. The meeting, if realized, would probably be to "exchange views frankly," he said.
