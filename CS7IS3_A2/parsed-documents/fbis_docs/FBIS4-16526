In doing so, Kiev is violating all the existing Russian-Ukrainian agreements on the fleet, the fleet's press centre told ITAR-TASS on Friday. Today, a group of eight military personnel from the Ukrainian Navy, having gained the support of the Ukrainian presidential representative in Izmail, arrived at a brigade of river cutters. The Ukrainians were led by head of the western maritime defence region of the Ukrainian naval forces, Captain Dmitriy Ukrainets, according to the press centre. The Ukrainians met with the command of the river unit and handed them the directive issued by the Ukrainian Defence Ministry on 10 April, which says the Black Sea Fleet unit is being disbanded, and the third naval defence brigade of the Ukrainian Navy is to be created on its base. The unit was given a new commander, Captain Yaroslav Fyodorshin. The Ukrainian personnel appealed to the brigade's command to avoid the use of armed force. They promised to increase the pay of seamen who swear allegiance to Ukraine. The Ukrainians announced that those who wanted to serve in the Russian Navy would be allowed to go to Russia. The personnel of the river cutter unit were especially warned to preserve the brigade's military equipment and property, which the Ukrainian Navy representatives claim belongs to Ukraine. Meanwhile, in Moscow, Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev told journalists on Friday that Russia has been providing all the money for the Black Sea Fleet since September 1993, which means that "the fleet is Russian even as concerns financing". There can be no talk about leasing parts of the fleet to Ukraine, the minister declared. Especially since, under current conditions, Ukraine's security in the Black Sea is being maintained at Russian expense. The Russian and Ukrainian delegations to the CIS summit meeting in Moscow are currently working on specific solutions to that problem.
