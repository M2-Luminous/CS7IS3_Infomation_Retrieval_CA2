Its central purpose is to become a political power. With the Asian economy growing by leaps and bounds, Japan must return to Asia if it is to secure its place in the world, jockeying for a favorable spot as it wages economic war with the United States and Europe. In pursuit of its back-to-Asia strategy, Japan follows these policies: Cooperate as well as compete with the United States; resolve the issues inherited from history; use economic and technological means to achieve leadership in Asia; and make use of international organizations and international conferences. Japan's "detaching itself from America to return to Asia" strategy has caught the attention of nations around the world, particularly its neighbors in Asia. Both inside Japan and overseas, some of the hottest topics in political, economic, and academic circles as well as the media these days are the notion of Japan "detaching itself from the United States to return to Asia," the idea that "Japanese diplomacy is redoubling its attention to Asia," and the sense that Japan is "shifting its development strategy back to Asia." These issues are being explored from a variety of perspectives, political, economic, diplomatic, and security. This article examines the current status, background, and future trends of Japan's back-to-Asia strategy, its principal point of departure being Japan's foreign economic strategy. 1. Japan On the Way Back To Asia After World War II, it was Japan's strategy to dissociate itself from Asia and link up with the United States, toeing Washington's line diplomatically and relying on it economically. Since the mid-1980's, as its economic prowess grew rapidly, Japan is no longer content to remain America's junior partner and has been trying to achieve political parity with the latter, drawing support from Asia. Thus it began its strategy of "detaching itself from the United States and returning to Asia" even as it insisted on remaining a member of the Western alliance. Adopting a three-in-one approach combining trade and investment with economic aid, with direct investment playing the dominant role, Japan has vigorously pursued the "wild goose" model, building a solid foundation in the making the itself the leader of the regional economy of East Asia. A. Japan-Asian Trade Increasing Every Year On the exports front, Japan's exports to Asia rose 14 percent between 1991 and 1992, while exports to America increased just 7 percent. In 1992, Japan's exports to Asia accounted for 38.8 percent of the nation's total exports, while exports to the United States made up only 28.8 percent. On the imports side, Japan's imports from Asia rose 6 percent, while those from the United States slipped 3 percent. In 1992, Japan's imports from Asia accounted for 45 percent of Japan's total imports, while imports from the United States amounted to just 22.4 percent. (HUSHENG MONTHLY, July 1991; GUOSHI TUHUI, 1993 edition) Asia has become Japan's largest trading partner, overtaking the United States. The above data aside, the following points need to be made about the increasing Japan-Asia trade: 1) Japan has resumed its trade ties with Asia. Before the war (1934-1936), Japan mainly looked to Asia as the source of raw materials it imported and the destination of the manufactured goods it exported. At its peak, Japan-Asian trade accounted for 60 percent of Japan's total trade. After the war, Japan-United States trade blossomed while Japan-Asian trade dropped below 30 percent in the late 1970's. In recent years, however, Japan-Asian trade has gradually rebounded to almost 40 percent, exceeding the size of Japan-United States trade. (HUSHENG MONTHLY, July 1993) 2) The pattern of commodity exchange has shifted from vertical to horizontal, however. In the pre-war years, Japan's imports from Asia consisted of raw materials, grain, and assorted mineral products, agricultural products, and handcrafted articles. To date, most imports from Asia's four "mini-dragons" are manufactured goods, with machinery and electronic parts and components accounting for one-quarter. More machinery is imported from member nations of ASEAN than raw materials. 3) Asia has become an increasingly important export market for Japanese goods. Ten years ago, only Taiwan barely made it onto the list of Japan's top-ten export market by placing tenth. To date, seven Asian nations and regions, namely mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore, Thailand, and Malaysia have earned themselves a spot on the top-ten list. B. Direct Japanese Investment in Asia Rising Without Interruption In the early 1980's, direct Japanese investment in Asia was more or less on a par with American investment in Asia. In 1992 Japanese investment in Asia totalled $60 billion, up from $19.5 billion in 1985. During the same period, direct American investment in Asia rose just 22 percent. In the 5 years between 1987 and 1990, direct Japanese investment in the four "mini-dragons" and ASEAN amounted to $26.8 billion, 360 percent more than American investment, catapulting Japan into the top investor spot ahead of other economic powers. (ZHUJUN MONTHLY, February 1992) Japanese investment in Asia has been an economic boon to Japan. According to statistics from the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI], the Asian subsidiaries of Japanese corporations earned 487 billion Japanese yen in profits in the fiscal year between April 1991 and March 1992. In contrast, their counterparts in Europe only earned Y6.6 billion in profits and those in North America suffered losses totalling Y208 billion. (THE ECONOMIST 24 April 1993) C. Government Development Aid Focusing On Asia Government development aid is an essential component of Japan's foreign policy as well as a major tool of its foreign strategy. The "Outline of Government Development Aid," adopted by the Japanese cabinet on 30 June 1992, states explicitly, "The Asian region has intimate historical, geographical, political, and economic ties with Japan... Japan should continue to make Asia the focus of its assistance program." (WAIJIAO YUEKAN MONTHLY, March 1993) In 1991 the Japanese government dispensed $11 billion in development aid, which placed it ahead of the United States ($9.4 billion) as the world's top aid giver. Over 60 percent of Japan's development aid goes to Asia, with the five nations of Indonesia, China, Thailand, the Philippines, and Bangladesh alone accounting for almost half of all Japanese aid. ("Economic Cooperation: Current Status and Problems," 1992 edition) In addition, Japan is also playing an increasingly prominent role in debt payments, trade settlement, and foreign exchange reserves in Asia. 4) Creating "East Asia Economic Sphere" In the late 1980's, Japan's economic position in Asia consolidated, the cabinet introduced the idea of an "East Asian economic sphere" to include 10 nations and regions, namely the four "mini-dragons," ASEAN, and Japan itself. For starters, Japan began shifting those of its industries that had become uncompetitive to the four "mini-dragons" in a big way. Later Japan and the four "mini-dragons" started exporting capital to ASEAN, setting in motion a chain-like adjustment of the region's industrial structure. The upshot is an international division of labor in which Japan specializes in the production of high-tech products; the four "mini-dragons," conventional technical goods and durable consumer goods; and ASEAN, labor-intensive products. In the process, both the four "mini-dragons" and ASEAN have become more dependent on Japan. Building on its success with the "East Asian economic sphere," Japan pushed hard for and devoted itself to putting together a "Sea of Japan economic sphere." What the "Sea of Japan economic sphere" mainly entails is Japan-led economic cooperation, with Russia contributing resources, Japan and South Korea contributing funds and technology, and China and North Korea contributing manpower. Japan envisions the "Sea of Japan economic sphere" as a bridge linking Northeast Asia with Southeast Asia, thus steering the entire East Asia into its development orbit. 5) Conducting a Vigorous Asian Diplomacy As it became a stronger and stronger economic power in Asia, Japan applied itself to achieving a political standing commensurate with its economic might. Its Asian foreign policy, hitherto dominated by economic diplomacy, now became increasingly "politicized." Japan has taken a string of major steps in the political, military, and diplomatic arenas in Asia in recent years. Among them are these three: 1) Participated actively in resolving the Cambodian issue. No sooner did the Japanese Diet pass the "UN Peacekeeping Activities and Cooperation Law" in April 1992 than Japan sent self-defense troops to take part in the UN peacekeeping effort in Cambodia. Moreover, Japan hosted two conferences aimed at solving the Cambodian issue. Japan's enthusiasm on behalf on the Cambodian problem was driven by its desire to gain a louder voice in Asian affairs. 2) The Japanese emperor visited China. Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko visited China between 23 and 28 October 1992, becoming the first Japanese monarch ever to visit China in the ancient history of Chinese-Japanese relations. That the Japanese emperor put off visiting the United States and instead made China the destination of his first trip overseas after ascending the throne was much discussed in the international media. A "Shishi She" commentary noted, "The basic government position is that a stable Sino-Japanese relationship is the cornerstone of stability in the Pacific.... That consideration underpins Japan's active Asian diplomacy, using Sino-Japanese relations as its axis." (29 October 1992) 3) Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa visited ASEAN. In January 1993 Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa visited Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Brunei, all ASEAN members. While in Bangkok, he delivered a speech entitled "The New Asian Pacific Era and Cooperation between Japan and ASEAN" enunciating what has been delivered the "Miyazawa Doctrine." In his speech he laid down Japan's four basic policies in Asia: First, actively participate in the creation of a "security dialogue mechanism" in the Asian Pacific area; second, help open up the Asian Pacific area economically; third, exert itself on behalf of democracy, human rights, and environmentalism; and fourth, engage in cooperation with the three nations in Indochina. His speech painted in broad strokes the basic features of Japanese policy in Asia. 2. The Focuses of Japan's Return to Asia Japan's strategic decision to return to Asia was prompted by more than considerations that have to do with geography, history, and its relations with the various Asian nations. There are other major concerns: 1) Achieving its goal of becoming a political power. In a speech in his native Qunma Prefecture in July 1982, Prime Minister Zenko Suzuki said, "Japan must seek a louder voice in world politics, raising its stature not only as an economic power but also as a political power." ("Diplomacy Green Paper," 1983 edition) That was the first time a Japanese prime minister unequivocally articulated the goal of making Japan a "political power." Successive administrations led by the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] after Suzuki adopted this slogan as an official policy. More recently, Xiaoze Yilang [1420 3419 0001 6745], an official of the New Life Party, put forward a "conventional nation" theory in his book A Plan for Transforming Japan While he did not use terms like "political power," he came up with a number of new suggestions such as amending the constitution, changing the nature and strategy of the self-defense forces, participating in UN peace-keeping activities, pushing for a permanent seat on the Security Council, and building a new world order side by side with the United States and Europe. Xiaoze Yilang's "conventional nation" theory, it may be said, goes one step beyond the "political power" theory advanced by the LDP. We can thus see that no matter which party or faction is in power, Japan will not deviate from its strategic objective of achieving the status of "political power." They all seek to make Japan part of a tri-polar world, exercising world leadership along with the United States and Europe. To achieve the above strategic objectives, Japan attaches the utmost importance to finding its own base and establishing its own economic sphere. Where, then, is Japan's base? What about its economic sphere? These questions were answered by Gangqi Jiuyan [1481 1505 0036 1750], a former Japanese ambassador to Thailand, who said Japan must return to Asia and create a "super Asian sphere." In his 1992 article entitled "The New Strategy of Striving to Create a Super Sphere in Asia," he wrote that "it is in Asia that Japan will find its diplomatic future, a stage where it can maneuver.... In any case, except for Asia, one cannot find another arena at the moment which offers a bright future for Japanese diplomacy; there is no other oasis." ("Dumai" monthly, August 1992) Gangqi Jiuyan's words provide a graphic explanation of the motives behind Japan's return to Asia and the actions it has taken toward that purpose. 2) Explosive Economic Growth in Asia According to World Bank reports, East Asian economies grew 8.5 percent in the 1980's, up from 6.6 percent in the 1970's. Since 1990, amid the backdrop of global recession, Asia continued to lead the world in economic growth. The International Monetary Fund estimates that economic growth in the ten major Asian nations and regions other than Japan may have reached 8.75 percent in 1993 and will average 7.1 percent in 1994, far higher than the growth rate of the Western economies. Even more spectacular is the expansion of the Chinese economy in recent years, growing 7 percent in 1991, 12.8 percent in 1992, and 14 percent in the first half of 1993. One United States magazine has calculated that the Asian economy now accounts for 25 percent of the global economy, up from 4 percent 30 years ago, and may well make up one-third by the year 2000. (FORTUNE MAGAZINE, November 1993) All eyes are on the booming Asian economy. To some developed nations, Asia is the most dynamic, most promising place in the world. Both the United States and Germany are scrambling to shift their attention to Asia, pinning their hopes for ending the economic recession at home on the Asian market. As for Japan, a resource-poor nation with a small domestic market which is mired in a deep recession, Asia resembles a huge magnet. It is thought that only by returning to Asia and relying on Asia can it secure a firm foothold in the world. 3) Disintegration of the Soviet Union; Escalating Japan-United States Conflicts During World War II, the United States and the Soviet Union were allies which fought Japan side by side. Later, during the Cold War, the United States allied itself with Japan against the Soviet Union. With the end of the Cold War, the relations among these three countries are still evolving, but already ther are signs pointing to new changes. On a political level, the United States and Russia, former adversaries, have now become partners. In 1992, President Bush of the United States and Russian President Boris Yeltsin signed the "Camp David Declaration" and "Washington Charter," proclaiming a friendly partnership between the two nations. After taking office, President Clinton has been even more energetic in improving diplomatic relations with Russia, supporting the Yeltsin regime politically and offering Russia economic aid. Due to the improvement in United States-Russian relations, the practical function of the United States-Japanese alliance has diminished significantly. Economically speaking, the United States and Japan, erstwhile allies, have now become rivals. After he took office, Clinton has shifted priority from the military to the economy, making economic strength the key to national security. Revitalizing the U.S. economy and eliminating the huge deficit in its trade with Japan have become urgent and major issues in United States-Japanese relations. Not only does Clinton relentlessly push for a more expansive yen, but he has also demanded that Japan open up its market, even specifying the market share that U.S. goods should have in Japan as a means of trimming Japan's trade surplus. As United States and Russia nudge closer to each other and Japan-United States trade friction escalates, Japan has no choice but to return to Asia to find its destiny there. 4) Regionalization and Rise of Economic Blocs The trends in the world economy today are regionalization and the formation of economic blocs. The EC unified its market on 1 January 1993. A number of countries in north Europe are lobbying hard to join the EC. In late 1992, the three countries in North America--the United States, Canada, and Mexico--signed the North American Free Trade Act [NAFTA] and the United States has also talked about extending the free trade zone in North America to Latin America. Although both EC and NAFTA have publicly declared they would comply with the principle of free trade and keep their markets open, the fact of the matter is that they have acted in a way that is clearly discriminatory and exclusionary. Moved by protectionism and regionalism, Japan increased its investment in and stepped up trade with countries in North America and West Europe, intensifying its penetration of those markets. On the other hand, it has been hard at work trying to consolidate its political and economic position in Asia. Japan considers East Asia its "courtyard" in the same way that the United States views Latin America as its "backyard." Japan works assiduously to bring about its East Asian economic sphere in order to position itself favorably in its economic war with the United States and Europe. 3. Japan's Return to Asia: Future Prospects Japan is set on returning to Asia, but not too rapidly. The road back to Asia is fraught with many an obstacle, both domestic and international, and Japan must overcome them by moving cautiously and diplomatically. Reviewing the words and deeds of both the Japanese Government and people in private life, we see that these are the major strategies Japan pursues to engineer its return to Asia: 1) Cooperate and Compete With the United States In devising its Asian policy, the United States goes tit for tat with Japan, not ceding any ground at all. During the Bush Administration, Secretary of State Baker countered Japan's "wild goose" model, a strategy aimed at dominating the Asian economy, with his "fan-shaped" model. Under the latter model, Asia was perceived as an open fan; America would be the axis and the United States-Japan alliance would be the backbone, supplemented by America's alliances with South Korea, Australia, and ASEAN and embracing the entire Asian Pacific region. The purpose was to ensure America's economic interests and dominance in the region. After he assumed office, Clinton has shifted the U.S. strategic focus from the Atlantic to the Pacific as a means of revitalizing the U.S. economy. Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord has said, "No other region is more important to the United States to date than East Asia and the Pacific region." (United States Information Agency, 9 June 1993) In July 1993, Clinton called for a "new Pacific community" during his visit to Japan and South Korea and proposed upgrading the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation [APEC] ministerial conference scheduled to be held in Seattle under the auspices of the United States to an informal conference attended by heads of government. It was the goal of the United States to link APEC with NAFTA, thus preserving and expanding America's political and economic interests in the Asian Pacific region. There are three schools of thought in Japan's academic circles regarding how best to counter U.S. Asian strategy. One group advocates globalism. It would like Japan to continue to uphold the postwar multilateral free and equal trade system, do its best to bring the Uruguay round of talks under GATT to fruition, and eschew exclusivity in Asian Pacific economic cooperation. The second school of thought prefers a confrontational approach: build up an independent free trade zone in Asia (or just East Asia) as a counterweight to EC and NAFTA. Most people want to make some sort of a compromise between these two positions. They believe that while the conflicts between Japan and the United States in Asia have intensified, Japan cannot afford direct confrontation with the latter because it still cannot do without it. Economically, the United States is indispensable, absorbing one-third of Japan's exports. Militarily, Japan still depends on America's security shield. Politically, Japan needs backing from the United States if it is to become a political power. Therefore they advocate a middle course: cooperate as well as compete with Washington. Specifically, the so-called "middle course" means maintaining the free trade system, adhering to GATT, making concessions to regionalism to some extent, expanding its economic muscle in Asia, and holding fast to its alliance with the United States. For Japan, this amounts to tightrope diplomacy, which no doubt is most challenging. In the absence of any better course, however, Japan has no choice but to go ahead with this balancing act gingerly. 2) Resolve Problems Inherited From History It has been 48 years since the end of World War II. However, the war's instigator, Japan, has not been forgiven by the people of the various Asian nations. To remove the mistrust of its neighbors in Asia and create an image of peace and friendship, Japan's new prime minister, Morihito Hosokawa, broke with the ambiguous attitude of his predecessors and forthrightly admitted as soon as he took office that the "previous war was a war of aggression. We believe the war was a mistake." (Japan GONGTONG SHE 10 August 1993) "We again express our profound self-reflection and apologies for the intolerable suffering and pain our past aggression and colonial rule had caused many people." He also declared, "We should take our proper role as a member of the Asian Pacific community seriously and do our best to contribute to the peace and prosperity of this region." (SHISHI SHE 23 August 1993) The constructive attitude of the new administration toward solving the problems left over from history no doubt was meant to set the stage for Japan's return to Asia. While Hosokawa's remarks and apologies were widely welcome by Japan's neighbors, the response was cautious. In his government report on 23 August, Hosokawa retreated from the term "war of aggression" uttered days earlier during his press conference, now downgrading it to "aggressive conduct." In addition, members of his coalition government worshipped at the Yasukuni shrine. All this made many Asian nations skeptical whether Japan can really face up to the historical problems honestly. 3) Use Economics and Technology To Dominate Asia History may be a barrier on Japan's road back to Asia, but economics and technology give Japan an overwhelming edge. Japan can participate in and dominate the Asian economy through trade, direct investment, development aid, technology transfer, personnel exchange, and other economic and technological activities. Professor Rujianglung of Meiji University in Japan sums up this approach as "winning without victory." In other words, the leadership in the Asian Pacific area that Japan is pursuing is a kind of imperceptible victory. He also refers to it as "different hegemony," a new-concept hegemony distinct from conventional hegemony which is backed by economic, technological, and financial forces. (WENYI ChUNQIU MONTHLY July 1990) The "winning without victory" approach, which can achieve goals that military power failed to achieve in the past, no doubt will serve Japan well as it seeks to return to Asia, However, if Japan relies solely on its technical and economic superiority and fails to handle its relations with the various Asian nations correctly and truly bring about joint development on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, this superiority will not last long. 4) Rely on International Organizations and International Conferences First and foremost, Japan looks to the United Nations. Right now Japan is working hard to gain a permanent seat on the Security Council, a crucial step on Japan's road toward becoming a political power. Japan has put forward a series of proposals about reforming the United Nations to its General Assembly during the current session and has repeatedly indicated its readiness to participate in UN peace-keeping efforts. All these moves are intended to prepare public opinion for Japan's return to Asia. Next, Japan relies on the G-7 summit, the meeting of the heads of government of seven Western powers, of which Japan is the only Asian member. At the G-7 meeting in Tokyo in 1993, Japan served as Asia's spokesman. When President Suharto of Indonesia visited Japan, the host nation agreed to forward his opinions to the G-7 meeting. Then there is the APEC ministerial conference. To prepare for the informal meeting of APEC leaders in Seattle, Japan held consultations with South Korea and ASEAN to coordinate their views. It was also slated to present the report "Ideas for Economic Cooperation in the Asian Pacific Region for The Year 2000" at the conference. Among the ten topics covered by the report were the promotion of trade and investment within the region, the strengthening of its industrial base, and environmental issues. The thrust of the report was the furthering of liberalization in regional trade and investment. Clearly, Japan's goal is to use APEC to counter the protectionism of NAFTA and consolidate Japan's economic position in Asia. Furthermore, Japan has gained a stronger voice at the annual enlarged meeting of ASEAN foreign ministers. We should note that most of the international organizations mentioned above operate under American leadership and Japan's influence is limited. Whether or not Japan will achieve all its objectives depends on how things turn out. A historical issue that has confronted Japan ever since Meiji Modernization is this: Should Japan exist as part of Asia or part of the United States and Europe? Or should it compromise between the two? If we look back at over a century of diplomatic history, we see that by and large Japan has allied itself with Europe and the Western camp. In 1885, Fuze Yuji, a bourgeois thinker, put forward his "out of Asia" theory in SHISHI XINBAO. By that he meant Japan should join the camp of the European powers and the United States and invade Asia (primarily China). The Japanese Government embraced his theory and launched one war of aggression after another, culminating in the country's utter defeat and surrender in the Pacific War. After the war, Japan allied itself with America and toed the Washington line in opposition to China. Only after Nixon visited China in 1972 did Japan normalize diplomatic relations with China. After a century, Japan's foreign strategy finally shifted from "leaving Asia to join Europe" to "detaching itself from the United States to rejoin Asia." This is the third time Japan changed national direction after the Meiji Restoration and its defeat in the war. This strategic shift naturally has attracted profound concern in nations around the world, particularly its neighbors in Asia. These nations hope that Japan will learn a lesson from history and totally put aside its contempt for Asia. They hope that Japan will not become a military power or intervene in the domestic affairs of another country and that it will use its formidable economic power and advanced science and technology to cooperate with the nations of Asia on an equal basis, building a prosperous Asia together. Will Japan, on its way back to Asia, do what other Asian nations hope that it will do? That remains to be seen.
