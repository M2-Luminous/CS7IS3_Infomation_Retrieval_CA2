Addressing the meeting, State Councillor Song Jian called for increasing society's awareness of the environment, stepping up propaganda and education, and fostering environmental ethics. He urged every woman to enthusiastically take part in the great cause of developing the economy and protecting the environment and to create a better tomorrow with concerted efforts. The meeting was jointly sponsored by the State Environmental Protection Bureau and the All-China Women's Federation with a view to enhancing, among the broad ranks of women, the understanding of environmental problems, increasing their environmental awareness and enlisting their participation in the environmental cause and in advancing China's environmental undertakings. Song Jian said: Women play an irreplaceable role in the modernization drive. Mothers exercise the most direct influence on the youngsters and children -- the future of society. We must build such a consensus in society; that is, polluting the environment is a behavior that runs counter to social ethics and the standards of the law and infringes upon the fundamental interests of the broad masses of the people and future generations. Participation of tens upon millions of women in the cause of economic development and environmental protection will have a major impact on the family, society, and, in particular, the youngsters and children. Cheng Siyuan, National People's Congress Standing Committee vice chairman, and Qian Zhengying, National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference vice chairman, were present at the meeting and spoke.
