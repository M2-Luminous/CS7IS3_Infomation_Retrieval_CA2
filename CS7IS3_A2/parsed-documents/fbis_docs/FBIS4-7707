"It is not our assessment that it is about to fall," Ritchie told reporters here. Regarding "the more dramatic reports" of Serb incursions into the enclave, he said: "I'm afraid we have nothing to confirm on that." Bosnian Serb chief of staff Manojlo Milovanovic confirmed earlier that his forces had breached Bosnian Army defence lines at Gorazde, succeeding in landing on the western bank of the Drina river which flows a few kilometres (miles) to the east and south of the town. An UNPROFOR spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, warned of a "very serious" situation in the enclave.
