The Department needs to maintain records regarding certain individuals who have received title IV student financial assistance for the following purposes: (1) To verify their identity; (2) to determine program eligibility and benefits; (3) to permit servicing and collecting of the loan or grant; (4) to locate a delinquent or defaulted debtor or to locate a recipient owing an overpayment on a grant; (5) to counsel the individual in repayment efforts; (6) to investigate possible fraud; (7) to verify an individual's, or institution or other entity's compliance with program regulations; and (8) to initiate legal action against an individual, institution, or other entity involved in program fraud or abuse. This system of records contains numerous technical revisions to the current notice, including one which adds a purpose clause to the notice to comply with the Office of the Federal Register guidelines. The purpose clause notifies individuals of the intended use of the information collected in the system. Direct access is restricted to authorized contract and agency personnel in the performance of their official duties. Due to the restructuring of the system notice, it is being published in its entirety. Dated: April 6, 1994. David Longanecker, Assistant Secretary for Postsecondary Education.
