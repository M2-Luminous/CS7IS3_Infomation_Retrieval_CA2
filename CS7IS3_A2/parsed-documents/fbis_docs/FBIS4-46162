Wijetunga for his references to the terrorist problem that Sri Lanka faces in the north will be well advised to study the U.S. State Department's latest annual terrorism report which has in clear unambiguous language described the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) to be what they are -- a terrorist organisation which stops at nothing. While it is gratifying that countries like the United States of America are exposing the Tigers in official publications, identifying their front organisations and presenting authoritative information on the LTTE's far-flung networks, we cannot escape the reality that the LTTE is still able to continue maintaining offices in many western countries and pour their propaganda into receptive ears. The question we must ask ourselves is whether our diplomatic and security apparatus is strong enough to seize opportunities such as the publication of the State Department's terrorism report and ensure that the Tigers are driven out of some of their lairs in Europe and North America. It is essential that Colombo lobbies the various concerned governments to ensure that the LTTE finds themselves less comfortable in some of the cities where they have entrenched themselves. Much of what appears in the U.S. report is not new. It has been fairly well known that the Tigers use both overt and illegal methods for their weapons procuring and fund raising; that they are into drug trafficking in Europe; that they have also set up a finely orchestrated propaganda machine to suggest that the Tamils in Sri Lanka are a besieged people. The fact is that those Tamils who are besieged are those living in areas under LTTE control. That is why tens of thousands of people living in the Jaffna peninsula want to get out of there if they possibly can. While many governments are well aware that the Tigers extort contributions from Tamils working in their countries, very little has been done to stop such activity. The LTTE, no doubt, is able to ensure that there are no complaints. It will be a brave man or woman who would dare blow the whistle on the Tigers anywhere. But with some effort Colombo will be able to persuade the concerned governments to at least ensure that asylum applications of people known to be engaging in illegal activities are not sympathetically considered. This is why it is essential that our foreign missions are properly staffed with trained and effective diplomats. [passage omitted] It is essential that all our missions work hard at making life as uncomfortable as possible for Tigers abroad by turning the heat on wherever possible. They must, among other things, develop contacts with the security agencies of the host countries and keep tabs on arms buying and other activities of the LTTE. We do not know how much our missions abroad are assisting the security effort at home. We hope that a useful input from Colombo was available to the authors of the U.S. terrorism report and that this publication will be used to maximum advantage in all countries in which Colombo maintains diplomatic representation. The war against the LTTE cannot be fought only on the battle field. It has to be fought on many fronts and with different kinds of ammunition. Washington's latest report has provided several opportunities which must be seized. It is significant that the American government has branded the Tigers to be behind many killings, including those of Rajiv Gandhi, Ranasinghe Premadasa and Lalith Athulathmudali that the LTTE has denied. This must be noted by our own people in the context of various uninformed allegations that we hear in Sri Lanka itself.
