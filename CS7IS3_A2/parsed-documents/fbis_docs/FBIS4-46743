To the South!: Russia's Involvement in the Partnership for Peace Could Critically Destabilize the Situation on its Southern Flanks"] [Text] It would be utterly unproductive in an examination of the Partnership for Peace program and the prospects of Russia's participation in it to address it alone--the texts of the Invitation, the Framework Agreement, and Organization and Procedures. Much should be derived from a consideration of the contexts of this program also--geopolitical, military-strategic, economic, and others. In addition, it is impermissible to ignore also the fact that the states of the post-Soviet South--of the Transcaucasus and Central Asia--would be drawn into the orbit of NATO's influence also. And the situation in this "soft underbelly" of Russia will largely determine the future of both the global South and of Russia itself. Russia--Missing Link in the Global Military-Political Alliance of the North The consistent and successful realization of NATO's Partnership for Peace would impart a finished nature to the North-South global opposition. The membership of the Atlantic structures of Russia and also all the other components of the former great Eurasian state--the Soviet Union--would signify the emergence of a global military-political bloc of states of the North (the northern hemisphere). The North's line of contact with the South, this global zone of instability, does not run along the Equator, of course. For the United States, Canada, and Mexico it is the narrow isthmus of Panama. North America is protected from Asia and Africa with their vast South by two oceans. For West Europe this boundary is the Mediterranean. There are some remnants of the South in the former Yugoslavia still, it is true, but they could soon be wiped out. In other words, this part of the North is protected against the destabilizing factors of the South by natural barriers. This North is doing and will continue to do everything possible to bar to states of the South as far as possible, if not in full, access to weapons of mass destruction, primarily nuclear, and to their delivery systems capable of delivering these weapons to the North. The examples of the pressure on Iraq, Iran, Libya, Syria, India, Pakistan, and North Korea are typical in this respect. The North even looks askance at Israel. But with Russia things are considerably more complicated. Russia is in direct, immediate contact with the South. So immediate that it is not always clear where Russia ends and where this notorious South begins. According to one version ("each for himself"), Russia borders the post-Soviet South--the Transcaucasus and Central Asia, that is, zones of extremely high conflict potential. It is sufficient to recall the Abkhaz-Georgian, Karabakh, and Tajik conflicts and a mass of others--of a lesser scale or occurring in latent fashion. In the other version ("Russia as an integral part of the CIS with vital interests in the Transcaucasus and Central Asia") Russia--both directly and indirectly--is in contact with another conflict-potential zone, which is to no less an extent rich in factors of instability: the Arab-Israeli conflict, the Kurdish problem (Turkey, Iran, Iraq, Syria), the Afghan problem (the civil war in Afghanistan and this state's practical disintegration), the Pakistani-Indian contradictions (the problem of Jammu and Kashmir), Uighur separatism (China's Xinjiang-Uighur Autonomous District), and so forth. Russia--Pacifier of the South? Let us assume that Russia has subscribed to the Partnership and/or has actively begun to participate in NATO actions in some other form. All questions would then confront it in entirely particular fashion, if Russia is in contact with the South, being part of the global military-political alliance of the northern hemisphere (the North). Historical circumstances themselves would impose on Russia the role of gendarme covering the global North on one of its "burning" flanks and locking onto itself many most acute problems of North-South relations on a world scale. Why would Russia involuntarily find itself in this role? I see at least three reasons here. First, peacemaking operations or, in NATO terminology, "peacekeeping operations" are envisaged by both the plans of NATO and the NACC (North Atlantic Cooperation Council) and the content of the Partnership for Peace program itself (clause 3-D of the Framework Agreement). The actual force capable of undertaking broad-based peacemaking operations on the territory of the CIS and in the entire post-Soviet space is the Russian Army. Evidence of this is the correlation of the participants and the degree of their assertiveness in the CIS Collective Peacemaking Force in Tajikistan. Second, "peacekeeping operations" are at this moment the priority direction in NATO activity, virtually. We would recall Somalia, Bosnia, and even Egypt (the participation of NATO consultants in the organization of the struggle against Islamic fundamentalists in this country). A special zone of NATO interests in this respect, incidentally, is the Caucasus region (see, in particular, clause 03 of the section "Questions of Policy and Security." Supplement to "Curriculum of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council for Dialogue, Partnership, and Cooperation in 1994"). The same applies also to post-Soviet Central Asia, the "projection" of stability onto which is, according to a statement of Manfred Woerner, general secretary of NATO, a principal function of the North Atlantic alliance. A number of NATO "peacekeeping operations" have shown the direction in which the tactics of such operations are evolving, these contemplating the active enlistment in direct combat operations of the peacekeeping subunits and covering units. Third, Russia would very much like to take part in peacemaking operations on the territory of the CIS. One has the impression that certain influential Russian politicians and military figures, not without peasant cunning, see such activity as a convenient form of the restoration of Russian influence in "zones of Russia's vital interests." If they are lucky, what is more, with these operations being funded and a mandate for them being granted by any party--the United Nations, the CSCE, the CIS... and NATO? Fourth, the talk about the danger of "Islamic fundamentalism" (P. Grachev and A. Kozyrev and B. Yeltsin have already spoken about it in the appropriate manner) puts us on our guard. A number of influential Russian politicians and military personnel are prepared, it would seem, to turn Russia into a kind of barrier against so-called "Islamic fundamentalism," moving up to the forward lines of contact with it. How To Destroy Russia Were this conjecture to be realized, Russia's future would seem utterly bleak. On its "southern" flank Russia (like the CIS as a whole) is exceptionally vulnerable. A border, which is designed to perform a protective function, with the new independent states of the post-Soviet South (in the regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia) is lacking; in a number of sectors the external border of the CIS here is eroded and penetrable (to a varying extent) in both directions (the Iranian-Azerbaijani, Afghanistan-Uzbekistan, Afghanistan-Tajik, and other sectors). Russia could find itself--voluntarily or involuntarily, for reasons, at times, not even susceptible to predictions based on the logic of common sense--pulled into a number of conflicts. Primarily the Tajik, Abkhaz, South Ossetian, or Karabakh, which are now "habitual." It is difficult for Russia even now in its attempts to extinguish these centers of military danger situated in direct proximity to its borders. But the difficulties could grow many times over were Russia to operate under the aegis of NATO or within the framework of NATO programs. We can imagine the frustration of the leadership of Georgia and Azerbaijan, which, endeavoring to protect themselves against Russian peacemaking, had hastened to sign the "framework agreement" (in March and May of this year respectively) and which, as a result, could get those same Russian troops as peacemakers. Whatever the case, Russia would not, in any event, manage to preserve a normal relationship with all the parties to the conflicts on the territory of the post-Soviet South, and the resistance to it of some parties would be assured. A particular danger of the situation for Russia is the fact that there is no clear-cut border between the non-Russian South within the framework of the CIS and the purely Russian South. It is sufficient to recall here the North Caucasus (that is, Russian!) operational formations--from subunits of the Confederation of Peoples of the Caucasus through the Cossacks--that participated (are participating) actively in the Transcaucasus conflicts: Karabakh, South Ossetian, Abkhaz. It is hard to foresee the details and the routes by which the conflagration of the conflicts being "pacified" could spread. But some directions are easily defined: the zones of the spread of Islam and of the settlement of Turkic peoples on the territory of Russia. What the response of the states of the traditional South to the globalization of NATO and the conversion of the border of the CIS or a part thereof into the NATO border would be is a special and very difficult question. For Iraq, Iran, and Syria border Turkey--a NATO member. Desert Storm (1991), on the other hand, demonstrated together with many other things, it is true, a readiness for cooperation even on the part of sworn enemies (I would recall the coordinated crossing to Iranian territory of Iraqi aircraft to preserve them from American strikes). But Russia, were it to find itself NATO's southern flank, would have to assume assignments pertaining to elimination of the nuclear missile programs in such countries as Iran, Iraq, India, Pakistan, and Syria for the realization of one further NATO goal--blocking these countries' missile programs for protection against missile attacks against the forward and expeditionary units of NATO and its allies. Opposition to so-called "Islamic fundamentalism" as a strategic goal, Russia's conversion into an outpost of this struggle--all this would necessarily evoke and exacerbate hostility between Russia and, at a minimum, Iran (it is usually seen as the source of "Islamic fundamentalism") and, possibly, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and more distant Near and Middle East neighbors also. Nor can Russia's involvement as a "peacemaker" in conflicts that the world community imposes on itself and that blaze or merely flare up in direct proximity to Russia's borders be ruled out. The Kurdish problem is already making itself felt quite nearby--on the Turkish-Armenian border. Iranian-Arab contradictions are not completely settled. There is no certainty that it will be possible to settle the Arab-Israeli conflict conclusively and to general satisfaction. Afghanistan, for many of whose inhabitants war has become a way of life, demands pacification. The Pakistani-Indian disputes over Jammu and Kashmir are not subsiding. Chinese Xinjiang is beginning to boil over. The list could easily be continued. Thus in the event of Russia's aggressive participation in NATO activity, it would face the threat of involvement in a whole series of conflicts in the South. Some of them would detonate in Russia itself. The time would come for "peacemaking operations" in Russia. The very existence of the Russian state could be in jeopardy. The "last push" to the South beneath the NATO pennant could be for Russia the last in its history altogether.
