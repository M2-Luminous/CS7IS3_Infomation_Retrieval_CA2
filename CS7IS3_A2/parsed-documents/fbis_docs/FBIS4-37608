In a letter to the parliament Thursday [16 June] that was read by adviser to the sovereign Ahmed Bensouda, King Hassan II underlined the key role played by education in economic, social and cultural development. He noted that despite the progress made, further efforts must be exerted to take up the challenges thrown at the sector. `Various shortcomings at all stages and at all levels are still characterizing our educational system', the sovereign said adding these shortcomings are the major reason behind the unemployment of scores of university degree holders. This situation, he explained, is due to the unbalance between the supply and demand in various socio-economic sectors on the one hand and to a deficient orientation and insufficient information of students on the other. `Our educational system must be conceived in the frame of a comprehensive, coherent and future-oriented policy that must be very flexible and receptive to would-be adjustments', the sovereign pointed out calling for elaborating a policy able to meet both the current and future needs related to the economic, social and cultural changes Morocco is going through. The education problem is complicated and must be addressed by all. It is a collective responsibility committing the state, parents, teachers and economic operators, King Hassan II said urging the parliament to devote a large part of the current parliamentary term to debates on the education problem and to try to draw the bases of a national policy in this vital field. `A general consultation must be engaged, without any exclusive nor exclusion, and far from any demagogic or partisan consideration', King Hassan II stated. The sovereign said further he is confident that the mps will give evidence of patriotism, imagination, audacity and realism in elaborating this policy which must, the sovereign underlined, `preserve our identity and authenticity, define... the frame to train the Moroccan so that he be useful and efficient, at home and abroad, for himself and for the whole society'. Our education must assert and consolidate the Moroccan personality and must be inspired from and based on the precepts of Islam, a religion of overture and tolerance, King Hassan II said adding `in this troubled period, it is imperative to educate and to train the Moroccan on the basis of the respect of his faith and to instil in him the spirit of Islam which accepts the other and rejects any domination will'. Our education must also be targeted to take up the challenge of the 21st century, i.e. mastering the growingly complicated technological and industrial evolutions as it must enable the Moroccan to actively and efficiently participate in the economic and cultural development of the society. It is high time we drew lessons from our various policies to adjust our needs and ambitions to the available means...we must take into account the increasing budget burdens that might in the short run force the public finance to make choices detrimental to economic development and social dignity, the sovereign said before concluding `the Moroccan people is expecting you to present a frame of a national dimension, putting an end to the era of hesitation and fulfilling its legitimate ambitions'.
