These are the policies of revival, unification, adherence to normal economic laws, and removal of tension between Russia and the Ukraine, he said. These policies are in the best interests of our citizens, citizens of the Republic of Crimea, including their right to mix freely with Russian citizens, the right to dual citizenship and the right to a normal life, of which we have been deprived. The results of the voting provide hope that change will come. This is a vote of confidence for the Russia bloc, a belief that our objectives will be realized. As has already been reported, Meshkov guaranteed in his election program that the moratorium on a referendum on Crimea's status would be lifted. He promised to return the republic to the ruble zone, to grant Crimeans the right to dual citizenship, and to guarantee peace and national accord in Crimea.
