"It is an appropriate speed after the country's GDP has increased by 13 per cent for two consecutive years," he said. "It would be an outstanding achievement if we can keep the GDP growing at eight or nine per cent for a few more years." Delivering a government work report at the National People's Congress today, Premier Li stressed China will make its best to maintain a vigorous and steady growth rate. Local authorities should set reasonable growth rates for their respective economies in accordance with their own conditions and not vie with each other or concentrate exclusively on raising output value. On principles for economic work this year, Li Peng said, China will carry out reform in depth and width, open wider, strengthen macroeconomic controls, vigorously readjust its economic structure, promote technological progress, open more markets, improve economic performance, curb inflation, and maintain a steady, rapid and sound development of its national economy. He called for strengthening agriculture as the economic base, developing the rural economy in an all-round way, encouraging further development of rural enterprises, and increasing peasants' income. The central government, Li Peng said, will adopt the following measures to support agricultural development and protect peasant's interests: to raise the purchasing prices of grain and cotton; increase investment in agriculture by both the central and local governments; stabilize grain prices; assist 500 counties that are large producers of commercial grain, 150 counties that are large producers of quality cotton, and a number of demonstration areas that are engaged in developing a highly efficient type of farming that provides greater and better yields; and continue to support the development of township and village enterprises, especially in central and western regions. Li Peng said it is an objective requirement and inevitable trend of economic development for surplus labor to shift from farming to non-agricultural occupations and to move from one place to another in a rational manner. "We should provide guidance for such shifts, strengthen their management and organize them in a systematic way." To ensure a sustained development of the national economy, Li said, it is important to improve transportation and manufacturing industries with priority given to large and medium-sized state enterprises. The State Council has decided that, starting from this year, state enterprises will be exempt from payment of energy and transportation development funds and from payment of budget regulatory funds, and that special funds will be allocated for the reorganization of bankrupt enterprises and the resettlement of their workers and administrative staff, he said. He noted that an important condition for maintaining economic stability and continued development is that investment must be controlled at a rational scale. Since enough construction projects are under way and considerable investment is planned for this year, no further expansion will be permitted. "With regard even to basic industries and infrastructural projects, we should not undertake more than we can afford," he said. All local authorities and departments should make rational arrangements for the use of financial and material resources. Projects to be supported should be selected on the basis of overall national interest. First should come projects already under construction in transportation, telecommunications, energy and important raw materials sectors, and key projects for harnessing big rivers and lakes. No approval will be given this year to the establishment of any new development areas. Henceforth no capital construction projects will be launched unless they meet certain conditions. On open policy implementation, Premier Li Peng said attention should be paid to improving the performance of existing open areas -- special economic zones, Shanghai's Pudong, open coastal cities and regions, and economic and technological development zones. "At the same time, we should open wider major cities along borders, along the Chang Jiang River and in the interior, and improve our work in these places," he said. "To maintain and expand foreign investment influx, we should further better the environment for such investment and improve related laws and regulations. We should protect the legitimate rights and interests of enterprises with exclusive foreign investment and use the government's industrial policies to channel such investment into basic industries and infrastructure," he said. Li said China will continue to raise the people's living standards and improve housing conditions on the basis of economic [passage missing] He said it is necessary to keep to the policy of encouraging some areas and individuals to prosper first through honest work and encouraging them to help others do so, in order to gradually achieve common prosperity. "At the same time, we should exercise necessary regulations over extremely sharp income disparities by way of rational wealth distribution and taxation policies," he said.
