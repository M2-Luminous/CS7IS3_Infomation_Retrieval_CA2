"The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] is very important when the session is held, but it disappears once the session is over!" "The CPPCC should give more "belated advice!" "The Government Report should be discussed by the CPPCC first!" "We always visit upper houses of other countries when we make overseas trips, the upper houses have voting rights but we do not. To take part in political consultation, it is necessary to have voting rights!" Compared with past terms of the CPPCC, the Eighth CPPCC is really different in many aspects. Former CPPCC chairman Li Xiannian assumed office when he was 79. His membership of the CPC Central Committee was forfeited before he took the CPPCC chairmanship, and the CPPCC work was equivalent to a transition to retirement. However, incumbent chairman Li Ruihuan is only 60 and he is also a member of the Political Bureau Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee, which holds real power. For him, the CPPCC chairmanship is not, in any sense, a transition to retirement. Li Ruihuan still has a promising political future, but he does not really lay hold of any part of the party, government, or military systems, so he is very eager to rely on the base of the CPPCC to bring his political influence into play. Last year when he took over the CPPCC chairmanship, Li Ruihuan made a speech which was full of fighting will at the closing ceremony of the First Plenary Session of the Eighth CPPCC and vigorously stated that it was necessary to give play to the CPPCC's functions. His remarks were greeted with warm applause by members who were present. At that time, many people predicted that Li Ruihuan would reform the CPPCC. After a year's time, the CPPCC cannot break away from its constraints in the political structure and is still an organization for "political participation and consultation" without real power, but it is striving for more real power step by step. In the past, special committees under the CPPCC were only some united front organizations without real functions. However, over the past year, Li Ruihuan reinforced the staffs and enhanced the functions of the 15 CPPCC special committees and devoted efforts to studying policy proposals. Policy proposals put forward by the CPPCC are not legally binding on government departments, but when the CPPCC special committees started showing their strength, government departments did feel the pressure. This year, what CPPCC members have taken delight in talking about is that a report submitted by the CPPCC Economic Committee last June was accepted by government departments and it formed a part of macroscopic regulation. Li Luye, spokesman of the current session, also pointed out that over the past year, there was a growing trend that study reports submitted by the CPPCC were accepted by government decision-making departments. Under all these conditions, many CPPCC members have shown a strong intention to strive for legal status similar to that of upper houses in foreign countries. If the CPPCC can make a breakthrough on this, it will certainly be a great revolution in the CPC's constitutional system. As far as the reform of the constitutional system is concerned, a considerable number of factors are involved, and it cannot be achieved overnight, but CPPCC Chairman Li Ruihuan is undoubtedly a key factor in determining the result of the reform. If he merely treats the CPPCC as a stepping-stone, it will not be easy to achieve success in the CPPCC's structural reform. Yesterday, at the CPPCC group discussion, CPPCC member Zhao Jing said that he hoped Li Ruihuan would work not only at the CPC Central Committee office but also regularly at the CPPCC office. Li Ruihuan must devote more efforts to the CPPCC if the "vase" is really to be removed.
