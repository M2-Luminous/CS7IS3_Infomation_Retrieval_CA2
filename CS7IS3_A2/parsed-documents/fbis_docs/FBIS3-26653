The standing committee of the provincial party committee has attached great importance to this conference and in particular has heard and studied reports presented to it. At the conference, Comrade Keming delivered a work report in which he reviewed and summed up Jiangsu's work in discipline inspection and supervision in 1993 and laid down arrangements for the work to fight corruption and promote honest practices for 1994, with which I agree completely. Now, I would like to state some opinions based on discussions by the standing committee of the provincial party committee. I. Conscientiously Review Experience in Discipline Inspection and Supervision in 1993 and Correctly Analyze the Current Situation of the Anticorruption Struggle. Jiangsu maintained sustained, rapid, and healthy economic growth last year; the general situation was good. Jiangsu also intensified discipline inspection and supervision and has in particular done a great deal of work to achieve periodic results in promoting the anticorruption struggle. This has produced a positive influence on reform, development, and stability and made new contributions to the overall work of the province. On behalf of the provincial party committee and government, I hereby extend my heartfelt gratitude and appreciation to the broad masses of discipline inspection and supervisory workers throughout the province and my warm congratulations to advanced discipline inspection and supervisory organs and outstanding discipline inspection and supervisory cadres commended by the provincial party committee and government. Since the beginning of 1993, party committees and governments at various levels throughout the province have followed the arrangements of the CPC Central Committee and the provincial party committee to earnestly intensify discipline inspection and supervision and promote improvements in party work style and building clean government while proceeding with economic construction, reform, and opening up. Particularly since late August, they have firmly implemented the CPC Central Committee and State Council decision concerning the anticorruption struggle in the near future and the guidelines of the Second Plenary Session of the Commission for Discipline Inspection under the CPC Central Committee. They have made timely mobilization and arrangements to earnestly strengthen their guidance. Meanwhile, discipline inspection and supervisory organs as well as political and legal departments at various levels have conscientiously exercised their duties and actively launched efforts to ensure sound and orderly progress in the anticorruption struggle. According to the requirements of the CPC Central Committee and the provincial party committee, leading party and government cadres at and above the county (department) level have conscientiously initiated self-inspection and self- correction and have generally enhanced the consciousness of observing clean standards and self-discipline. Overcoming obstruction and resistance, discipline inspection, supervisory, and judicial organs have concentrated their efforts in emphatically investigating and handling a number of major cases as well as punishing a group of corrupt people. In the meantime, all businesses and enterprises run by party and government organs were screened throughout the province; all unwarranted charges were screened and rectified; all overseas tours at the public expense were also screened and rectified at the request of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council. Proceeding from actual situations, many localities and departments took effective measures to settle problems that the people strongly resented. Through unified anticorruption struggle, party and government cadres at various levels have become more aware of the importance of the anticorruption struggle and have enhanced their consciousness of the principle of promoting material civilization and socialist ethics at the same time; thus the trend of spreading negative and corrupt phenomena were effectively checked, party work style and general practice in society were improved, and remarkable achievements were made, at this phase, in the three tasks of the anticorruption struggle in the near term. However, we should soberly realize that the achievements scored in the anticorruption struggle are only preliminary and are far from sufficient compared with the people's expectations and the demands of the CPC Central Committee and the provincial party committee. Progress and achievements in work among various areas and departments are not balanced. Some areas and departments failed to strictly enforce discipline and were slack in dealing with corruption cases. We still need to consolidate our achievements in the anticorruption struggle. Under this circumstance, if we are a little slack in our ideology and work, corruption will repeatedly recur. As the situation develops and reform deepens, we will encounter many new situations and problems which we will need to study and solve. Anticorruption and promoting a clean administration are very heavy and formidable tasks. We must not overestimate our achievements; still less should we be satisfied with the accomplishments of the former stage of the anticorruption struggle. We must remain sober-minded and further deepen the anticorruption struggle. II. Further Define the Guiding Ideology for Discipline Inspection and Supervision Work To Give It Full Play To comprehensively carry out the party's basic line and the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress, seize opportunity, deepen reform, open up wider to the outside world, quicken the pace of building a socialist market economic structure, and strive for greater victories in the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics are great historical tasks faced by the whole party. According to the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the actual situation in our province, the Seventh (Enlarged) Plenary Session of the Eighth Provincial CPC Committee further defined the goal and ways of thinking for future reform, opening up, and economic development in Jiangsu. According to the tasks set by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, our province must attain two major goals by the end of this century: First, within five years, we should establish a basic framework for the socialist market economic structure; second, on the basis of our doubling our gross provincial product [GPP] ahead of schedule in 1993 for the second time, we should double our GPP again by the end of this century. In this way we will lift Jiangsu's economy to a new level, and the people in our province will be able to lead a fairly comfortable life sooner. The new situation and tasks set new, higher demands for discipline inspection and supervision work. Party committees, governments, discipline inspection, and supervision organs at all levels must further define the guiding ideology for discipline inspection and supervision to unswervingly serve reform and opening up, economic construction, and social stability. It is necessary to actively explore new thinking and new approaches to strengthen work related to discipline inspection and supervision under the new situation of economic development and socialist market economy; put forward new demands on modes of thinking and the code of ethics of party members and cadres; and continue to promote building party style and clean government in a bid to create a better social and political environment. It is only under an environment characterized by political and social stability and with a fine work style that we will be able to steadily promote reform; achieve sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development, and enable our people to live and work in peace and contentment. As workers involved in discipline inspection and supervision, we have an important duty to create such an environment. We should view problems from a lofty, overall perspective to secure a better understanding of the importance of discipline inspection and supervision and thus a more definite guiding thought. To meet overall demands this year, personnel involved in discipline inspection and supervision should intensify supervision and inspection related to implementation of party line, principles, policies, major party and government policy decisions, and important state laws to uphold the authority of the party Central Committee and to ensure smooth enforcement of government decrees. This year will be a crucial year for the establishment of a socialist market economic system, and momentum to be gathered and measures to be taken in reform will be unprecedented. Work related to discipline inspection and supervision should unfold according to guidelines set by both the Third Plenum of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the Seventh (Enlarged) Plenum of the Eighth Provincial CPC Committee. We should tighten party and government discipline; firmly reject noncompliance with decrees and prohibitions, selfish departmentalism, decentralism, and local protectionism; check the unhealthy tendency of going against the party's democratic centralism; and strictly investigate and punish various erroneous actions interfering with and impeding the implementation and enforcement of party line, principles, policies, and major reform measures, so as to guarantee successful reform and healthy economic development. Building party style and clean government and the struggle against corruption should be carried out in such a way that the provincial party committee's major missions for this year will be accomplished and a successful reform and construction guaranteed. Party committees and governments at all levels should strengthen leadership over work related to discipline inspection and supervision by taking the job as an important part of our overall mission. We should put forward demands and arrange work assignments regularly and support discipline inspection and supervision organs in carrying out their duties, particularly in investigating and punishing major cases, conducting special operations, and rectifying unhealthy practices. In addition, we should pay attention to personnel training in discipline inspection and supervision organs and help them solve practical problems, including improvement of working and living conditions. III Continue Fighting Corruption; Further Improve Party Style Regarding concrete tasks to be carried out in Jiangsu this year in fighting corruption and building party style and clean government, on which Comrade Keming has already made wide-ranging arrangements, I would like to emphasize three points. 1. It is necessary to enhance understanding on anticorruption through proper study. Practice in many localities and units on fighting corruption and promoting clean government has proved that firmness in attacking corruption lies in understanding, particularly among the leading cadres. When understanding is enhanced, firm action will follow. In the meantime, we should organize leading cadres and cadres involved in discipline inspection and supervision at various levels to continue their conscientious study of Volume 3 of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping" and use his expositions on correcting party style, promoting clean government, and fighting corruption to further unify thinking and enhance understanding. These are prerequisites to deepening the anticorruption drive. It should be well understood that the principle of "being firm in attending to both material progress and cultural and ideological progress" serves as an important part of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics. The deeper reform and opening up goes, the faster the pace of establishing a socialist market economic system, the more the economy is advancing, the more we need to fight corruption and strengthen party style and clean government. We should sum up struggles against corruption launched earlier and through such review further enhance the understanding of leading cadres at various levels on the great importance of fighting corruption. Party schools at various levels should make honest government and the anticorruption struggle a basic subject to be taught on a long-term basis. In this respect, discipline inspection and supervision organs may compile teaching materials in cooperation with other relevant departments. Through rotational cadre training programs and regular education we should be able to continuously strengthen the resistance of party members and cadres to various negative influences, prompting them to voluntarily wage struggle against corrupt phenomena. 2. To meet the requirements of the Central Committee and the provincial party committee, we should properly implement the three tasks set for fighting corruption. As far as the anticorruption campaign and promoting party style and clean government are concerned, the party Central Committee and the State Council have clear provisions -- from guiding thoughts, policies, and principles to missions -- with emphasis on doing three tasks well in the near future. In this regard, proper arrangements were made by the work meeting and the Seventh (Enlarged) Plenary Session of the Eighth Provincial CPC Committee held last year. Party committees at all levels should further strengthen leadership. Party and government leaders should assume personal responsibility to accomplish missions set by the Central Committee and the provincial party committee; consolidate and broaden periodic results; and persist in pushing ahead building party style and clean government and in fighting corruption. First, we must make sure that party and government leaders at various levels are honest and self-disciplined. Leading cadres at various levels, particularly party and government leaders at the county (department) level and above, should strictly implement relevant stipulations of the Central Committee and the provincial party committee by setting a good leadership example in practicing honesty and self-discipline. Honesty and self-discipline among leading cadres is a self-motivated action based on firm party spirit. In the course of developing a socialist market economy, leading cadres at various levels should firmly bear in mind the party's objectives, namely performing their official duties honestly and working hard for the benefit of the people. We must see to it that, at any time and under any circumstances, we must be able to clearly differentiate and separate right from wrong and public from private, perpetuate the purity and progressiveness of the Communists, and regulate our conduct with strict party discipline and state policies and laws. Second, we should step up investigations of major cases and punishment of corrupt elements by adhering to the well-defined guidelines set by the central authorities that emphasize concentration, firmness, and seriousness. Party and government leaders at various levels should resolutely support discipline inspection, supervision, and procuratorial and judicial departments in handling cases according to law and discipline, lending them a helping hand in resisting interference and obstruction. In the meantime, good knowledge of the limits of policy is essential, and all investigations should base on facts and laws to ensure fairness. Investigation results of major cases bearing on public interests should be selectively publicized to motivate the people and educate the cadres and the masses. Third, we should continue to tackle some special problems in our efforts to correct unhealthy practices. Tackling special problems is important work in the anticorruption struggle, so we must carry it out step by step and in a planned way. At the present time we should focus on achieving success in tackling special problems. We should pay attention to improving the party's workstyle and promoting honesty in performing official duties and to consolidating our achieved results. While tackling the above-mentioned problems, we should also make efforts to investigate problems which have evoked strong repercussions among the masses and propose plans to solve those problems in the spirit of seeking truth from facts in light of the actual situation in various localities and departments. If we can persist in tackling those problems, we will certainly be able to achieve continuous and new successes. 3. We should attach importance to improving the party's work style and being honest in performing official duties during the festival period. The Spring Festival will arrive soon. Whether we spend a happy, clean, and honest festival will be a practical measure of the results of our anticorruption struggle during the earlier period. It will also be a practical matter of whether we can win the people's confidence. Various localities and departments must firmly implement the guidelines of the "circular on strictly forbidding the use of public funds for feasting, buying gifts or indulging in extravagance during the New Year and Spring Festival period in 1994" issued by the general offices of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council and the opinions of the general offices of the provincial party committee and the provincial government on implementing the circular's guidelines. We should simplify meetings. Meetings which can be canceled must be resolutely canceled, and meetings which are necessary should be conducted in a frugal manner. We should strictly control various celebration and commendation activities and vigorously advocate civilized, thrifty, and simple customs. Various localities must firmly cease doing all things clearly forbidden in the Central Committee circular. We should pay particular attention to stopping the practice of using public funds to eat and drink without restraint, buy gifts, to wantonly distribute procurement and gift coupons. Leading cadres at various levels, especially leading groups at the provincial level, should take the lead in setting good examples and be responsible for improving units under their jurisdiction. They should do a good job in improving the party's work style and ensuring honesty in their respective localities and departments. Party organizations and discipline inspection and supervision organizations at all levels should strengthen inspection and supervision and promptly stop and correct phenomena that violate regulations. They should criticize and educate units that violate regulations and deal strictly with cases of serious violation of regulations. We should consolidate the results of the anticorruption struggle by doing a good job in improving the party's workstyle and promoting honesty during the festival period. It is hoped that in the new year the broad masses of cadres belonging to discipline inspection and supervision organizations and judicial departments at various levels in the province will stive to improve themselves, further heighten their spirit, work in a solid manner, improve the party's work style, promote honesty in performing official duties, unfold the anticorruption struggle, and make new contributions to ensuring the successful accomplishment of the goals of reform and development in this province!
