It was believed to have only two or three cards but actually, it has shown us many different cards one after another. The international community was thrown into confusion every time North Korea used a new card. Although North Korea is running out of cards, those left, such as "withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT)" and "declaration of nuclear arms possession," threaten security in the international community. To prevent the DPRK from resorting to these dangerous cards, the only way left for us is not to uselessly apply pressure on it but to try to persistently persuade it. North Korea's primary object was to draw out compromises from the United States by using "the nuclear card." Since the nuclear cards are used to draw attention from the international community while mystifying the actual condition of nuclear arms development, the DPRK will eventually fall into self-contradiction if it uses them too many times. Such a contradiction became apparent over the issue of experimental reactor fuel rod inspection. It is still uncertain whether North Korea, whose mask was about to be torn off, will insist on wearing it to the end, or it will finally reveal its face by compromising at the last moment. The point at issue is how long can the patience of the international community last in dealing with this nation. UN Security Council member nations started consultations on 3 June and Japan-U.S.-ROK consultations have also begun in Washington. The United States has so far maintained a comparatively cautious stance with regards to negotiating with North Korea. The United States has been maintaining the stance that it will not fuss about the past and be satisfied if it can apply the breaks to the DPRK's future nuclear development. However, the story is different if thorough inspections cannot be carried out on fuel rods taken from the experimental reactor. Making a complete change, the United States now thinks that strong measures, such as economic sanctions, should be taken against North Korea. The United States' only goal is to prevent proliferation of nuclear weapons, because even if the situation on the Korean peninsula or in northeastern Asia becomes confused, it would not become a direct threat to security in the United States. However, the situation will be different for neighboring nations of North Korea. They will be directly affected. For example, refugees may flow into these countries. The United States and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have played a major role in the negotiations held so far with North Korea. But depending on future development regarding the North Korean issue, opinions and efforts of Japan, China, and the ROK, which are North Korea's neighbors, aimed at settling the issue will become more important than before. What draws public attention at this point is China's position on persuading North Korea. China, which insists that the issue should be settled through discussions, must exert its influential power now. Meanwhile, Japan should not give up, even if "North Korea hangs up whenever Japan calls them," but try through various channels to hold direct talks with the DPRK. As for the inspection of fuel rods, the IAEA has concluded that it is now impossible to conduct the inspection. However, there is still room for discussions to find a way to break the current deadlock. Nothing could be better if economic sanctions are avoided. The United Nations, if it has no choice but to impose sanctions because of North Korea's stubborn attitude, should do its best to obtain consensus from its member nations, including China and Russia. Moreover, sanctions should be imposed in stages and we must be careful that the international community will not drive North Korea into a tight corner.
