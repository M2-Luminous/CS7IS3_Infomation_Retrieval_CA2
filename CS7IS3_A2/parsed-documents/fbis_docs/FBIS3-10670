FBIS3-10670 "drlat047__a94001" FBIS-LAT-94-047-A Document Type:Daily Report 10 March 1994 ANNEX Argentina Arms Sales to Former Yugoslavia Denied PY0903221194 Buenos Aires LA NACION in Spanish 9 Mar 94 p 8--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY PY0903221194 Buenos Aires LA NACION Language: Spanish Article Type:BFN [Text] Answering a LA NACION inquiry on 8 March, Argentine Deputy Foreign Minister Fernando Petrella stated that the Foreign Ministry has taken no action leading to the sale of cannons and ammunition to the former Yugoslavia. Petrella emphasized this statement by reminding the journalist that the United Nations has expressly banned the sale of arms to the currently conflict-torn former Yugoslavia. According to the DYN news agency, the United Nations "thwarted a deal through which Argentina would sell arms to Liberia, although the shipment's final destination was to be one of the countries of the former Yugoslavia." The DYN report added: "According to information on hand, the Foreign Ministry cleared the initial request and granted the appropriate approval for the deal. The Defense Ministry is no doubt involved as well." According to DYN: "Official sources acknowledged only that Liberia was the intended destination of the arms and that the United Nations objected to the sale; however, the request for information that Radical Civic Union legislators submitted to Congress made it obvious that the deal had aroused strong suspicions." Argentine Defense Minister Oscar Camilion told DYN it is impossible to sell arms to the former Yugoslavia because there is a UN embargo on such deals.
