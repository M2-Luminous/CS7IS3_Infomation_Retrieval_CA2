In his interview with PESTI HIRLAP prior to the seventh national conference of the MDF scheduled for the coming weekend, Lajos Fur spoke about his ideas, his party's internal situation, and the advance of the left which, in his view, is the most dangerous political force. [Mester] You are regarded as the only serious candidate for the position of MDF chairman. Sandor Lezsak stepped down but he continues to accept gladly the position of executive chairman, a position that has been necessary so far because the party chairman was also the prime minister. Now, Peter Boross is the MDF's candidate for the position of prime minister. If things turn out the way you envisage, what kind of division of labor will you develop with Sandor Lezsak? [Fur] There is no need for the previous division of labor to change. It is the task of the executive chairman to deal with organizational and administration matters, and this can continue in the future because, even if not a prime minister, I am still a minister and I have a lot of government tasks to see to. It is the task of the MDF chairman to represent the party outside. As part of this effort, I will continue to visit various places in Hungary if the upcoming national conference assigns this task to me, just like now, for the benefit of keeping contact with the members. [Mester] It seems that, after Istvan Csurka and his followers, a new internal opposition is emerging in the party. Based on his declarations, Ivan Szabo and the national liberals seem to be part of this opposition. [Fur] I do not think that they are emerging as an internal opposition. National liberalism has its own justification and place within the MDF, along with the other two main trends, of course, on condition that it refrains from trying to become the exclusive trend, but nothing like this is happening. [Mester] One of the liberals, Ferenc Kulin, is the first MDF leader in a top position who used to be member of the Hungarian Socialist Workers Party [MSZMP]. [Fur] This has no special importance whatsoever. [Mester] At a meeting of the MDF organization in Zuglo [Budapest district], you spoke about the leftist danger threatening Hungary. It seems that you regard the left as the most dangerous election rival, and you are afraid of possible restoration of old ways. The left has repeatedly criticized you for such statements. [Fur] I continue to declare that the danger can be clearly shown by scientific means. The extremist dictatorship of the past four decades has not disappeared without any trace; it has penetrated the society and it is present as an extremely organized force that can be mobilized any time. It is also present in the people's thinking and mentality: Although everyone knew that the communists were lying when they spoke about equality, people who are now living under difficult conditions and struggling with various problems are weeping for the return of the period of "equality." The danger of restoration is real: History proves that it is possible to make a dictatorship out of democracy, by democratic means; take the example of Germany between 1929 and 1933 or Hungary between 1945 and 1948. [Mester] The election campaign has clearly started, and the MDF does not have an appointed campaign manager to this very day. I know that the general answer to this is that the executive chairman and his staff are directing the election campaign. You have not yet finished your election program either, although almost every party has already come up with some program. It is true that Sandor Lezsak said earlier that the MDF was focusing on the work to be done, and not on the campaign; in other words, the MDF is engaged in the electoral campaign by working. However, not long ago, the MDF group in the National Assembly suggested the earliest date for Parliament to end its activity.... Are you late with the work? [Fur] Not at all. The division of labor of the executive body is adequate; its members have specific tasks and they have been working on them for a long time. The national conference will formulate and approve the election program; the preparations have been made and the draft is ready. At the same time, the campaign of individual candidates has been going on all over the country for weeks and months. As for the proposal of the parliamentary group, the date of end of March or the beginning of April is realistic, especially if we consider the candidates of the Dunantul region, with 60-80 small villages in their electoral district. Sandor Lezsak's previous statement is still valid: Tough work is awaiting us in Parliament until the beginning of the election campaign. There is a lot of work to be done.
