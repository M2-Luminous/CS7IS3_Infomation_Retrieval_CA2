FR941107-1-00026 FR941107-1-00007 B. Disclosure of Disciplinary Actions by Self-Regulatory Organizations Under the proposals, a requirement would be added to describe disciplinary sanctions imposed by any securities or commodities industry self-regulatory organization (``SRO'') that oversees the business conduct and sales practices of its members. 95 The Commission requests comment as to whether there are any classes of SRO disciplinary proceedings that should be excluded, such as summary proceedings by an SRO wherein the designated person is fined not more than $2500 for minor or technical violations of the SRO's rules and procedures. 96 95 Proposed Item 401(f)(1)(iv). Section 3(a)(26) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(26)] defines self-regulatory organization as any national securities exchange registered under Section 6 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. 78f] ( e.g. , the New York Stock Exchange), any securities association registered under Section 15A of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. 78o&hyph;3] ( e.g. , the National Association of Securities Dealers (``NASD'')), and any clearing agency registered under Section 17A of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. 78q&hyph;1] ( e.g. , the National Securities Clearing Corporation). The Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (``MSRB'') also falls within the statutory definition of a self-regulatory organization, but the MSRB refers all disciplinary actions to the NASD. Regulations under the Commodity Exchange Act [7 U.S.C. 1 et seq .] define self-regulatory organization as contract markets registered under Section 5 of the Commodity Exchange Act [7 U.S.C. 7] ( e.g. , the Chicago Board of Trade) and futures associations registered under Section 17 [7 U.S.C. 21] of that Act ( e.g. , the National Futures Association). 17 CFR 1.3(ee). Clearing organizations, as defined in 17 CFR 1.3(d) ( e.g. , the Commodity Clearing Corporation), also are included in the definition of self-regulatory organization found in 17 CFR 1.59(a)(1). 96 Such proceedings would include action taken pursuant to an SRO minor rule violation plan or similar plan. See Rule 19d&hyph;1(c)(2) [17 CFR 240.19d&hyph;1(c)(2)]. C. Disclosure of Comparable Foreign Legal Proceedings While current provisions relating to disclosure of a designated person's involvement in criminal and civil actions do not distinguish between foreign legal actions and those taken within the United States, the proposed amendments explicitly would require disclosure of foreign criminal convictions and civil proceedings before foreign courts. Moreover, provisions would be added requiring disclosure of actions by foreign administrative authorities. Thus, disclosure would be required of any foreign legal proceeding that is comparable to a domestic legal proceeding requiring disclosure. These proposals reflect the ever-increasing international character of financial transactions and the important role played by foreign authorities in assuring safe and efficient financial markets world-wide. 97 Comment is requested as to whether there are any other types of legal proceedings before foreign authorities that should be specifically required, as well as whether any foreign legal proceedings should be excluded from the disclosure requirements. 97 The International Securities Enforcement Cooperation Act of 1990 (``ISECA'') [Sections 201&hyph;207 of the Securities Acts Amendments of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101&hyph;550, 104 Stat. 2713 (1990)] granted the Commission the authority to sanction regulated entities and associated persons if they have been convicted of certain crimes by a foreign court of competent jurisdiction within 10 years of filing an application with the Commission, or have been found by a foreign financial regulatory authority to have violated laws and regulations that are substantially equivalent to federal securities and commodities laws. See Sections 203 and 205 of ISECA, amending Section 15(b) (4) and (6) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. 78o(b) (4) and (6)], Section 9(b)(4) of the Investment Company Act [15 U.S.C. 80a&hyph;9(b)(4)], and Section 203(e)(7) of the Investment Advisers Act [15 U.S.C. 80b&hyph;3(e)(7)]. D. Other Legal Proceedings 1. Arbitration Proceedings While not specifically included in the amendments proposed today, the Commission requests comment on whether disclosure should be required concerning the results of arbitration proceedings arising out of allegations of violations of securities or commodities laws and regulations, or breaches of the laws and regulations relating to other commercial transactions. Given the widespread use of arbitration clauses, as well as statutes and court rules that require or permit claims to be submitted to arbitration rather than to courts, investors may consider information regarding a designated person's involvement in arbitration proceedings material to their investment decisions. The Commission invites comment on whether disclosure should be required concerning arbitration awards where the action would have been disclosed had the claim been pursued before a court, administrative body or SRO. In addition, commenters should address whether there are other types of alternative dispute resolution that should trigger disclosure. Comment also is requested as to whether there are any arbitration proceedings that should be exempt from disclosure in light of the nature of the issues involved or the insignificant dollar amount of the award. Finally, comment is solicited as to whether there should be dollar amount thresholds that govern disclosure and whether such thresholds should be cumulative figures based on multiple arbitration awards.
