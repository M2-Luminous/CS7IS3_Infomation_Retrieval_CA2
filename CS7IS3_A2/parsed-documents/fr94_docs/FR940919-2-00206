FR940919-2-00206 FR940919-2-00084 (a) The Commission will provide bidders a limited opportunity to cure defects in FCC Form 175 specified herein except for failure to sign the application and to make certifications. These are defects which may not be cured. See also Section 1.2105. (b) In the Narrowband PCS, applicants will be permitted to amend their Form 175 applications to make minor amendments to correct minor errors or defects such as typographical errors. Applicants will also be permitted to amend FCC Form 175 to make ownership changes or changes in the identification of parties to bidding consortia, provided such changes do not result in a change in control of the applicant and do not involve another applicant (or parties in interest to an applicant) who has applied for any of the same licenses as the applicant. Amendments which change control of the applicant will be considered major amendments. An FCC Form 175 which is amended by a major amendment will be considered to be newly filed and cannot be resubmitted after applicable filing deadlines. See also Section 1.2105. 10. Section 24.429 is amended by deleting paragraph (b) and redesignating paragraphs (c) and (d) as (b) and (c), respectively, to read as follows: Sec. 24.429␣Ownership Changes and Agreements To Amend or To Dismiss Applications or Pleadings (a) Applicability. Subject to the provisions of Sec. 1.2105 (Bidding Application and Certification Procedures; Prohibition of Collusion), this section applies to applicants and all other parties interested in pending applications who wish to resolve contested matters among themselves with a formal or an informal agreement or understanding. This section applies only when the agreement or understanding will result in: (1) A major change in the ownership of an applicant to which Sec. 24.423(c) and 24.423(g) would apply or which would cause the applicant to lose its status as a designated entity under Section 24.309, or (2) The individual or mutual withdrawal, amendment or dismissal of any pending application, amendment, petitioner or other pleading. (b) If the amendment would cause the applicant to lose its status as a designated entity under Section 24.309, the applicant must notify the Commission of this change in status and must comply with the obligations imposed by Sections 24.308, including increasing its down payment to the level required as a non-designated entity. (c) The provisions of Section 22.927 will apply in the event of the individual or mutual withdrawal, amendment or dismissal of any pending application, amendment, petitioner or other pleading. 11. Section 24.430 is revised to read as follows: Sec. 24.430␣Opposition to Applications (a) Petitions to deny (including petitions for other forms of relief) and responsive pleadings for Commission consideration must comply with Section 1.2108 and must: (1) Identify the application or applications (including applicant's name, station location, Commission file numbers and radio service involved) with which it is concerned; (2) Be filed in accordance with the pleading limitations, filing periods, and other applicable provisions of Secs. 1.41 through 1.52 except where otherwise provided in Section 1.2108; (3) Contain specific allegations of fact which, except for facts of which official notice may be taken, shall be supported by affidavit of a person or persons with personal knowledge thereof, and which shall be sufficient to demonstrate that the petitioner (or respondent) is a party in interest and that a grant of, or other Commission action regarding, the application would be prima facie inconsistent with the public interest; (4) Be filed within thirty (30) days after the date of public notice announcing the acceptance for filing of any such application or major amendment thereto (unless the Commission otherwise extends the filing deadline); and (5) Contain a certificate of service showing that it has been mailed to the applicant no later than the date of filing thereof with the Commission. (b) A petition to deny a major amendment to a previously filed application may only raise matters directly related to the amendment which could not have been raised in connection with the underlying, previously filed application. This does not apply to petitioners who gain standing because of the major amendment. (c) parties who file frivolous petitions to deny may be subject to sanctions including monetary forfeitures, license revocation, if they are FCC licensees, and may be prohibited from participating in future auctions.
