An official press release issued in Islamabad today says there has been no violation of the cease-fire from the Pakistani side. The reports played up in the Indian press are obviously part of the propaganda war being currently waged by New Delhi to divert world attention from the atrocities and human rights violations by Indian forces in occupied Kashmir.
