One of these meetings will be early this week, possibly on Monday, an IAEA official said Sunday on condition of anonymity. In Friday's meeting, North Korea said it would open just five of its nuclear facilities to IAEA inspectors. This was a reversal of the agreement reached in principle late last year with the United States on full inspections of all seven declared sites. It is also a far cry from the IAEA demand for inclusion in the full-scope inspections of what are seen by the IAEA as two key facilities, a radiochemical laboratory (virtually a nuclear fuel reprocessing facility) and a 5-megawatt reactor, the official said. The difference will be discussed in future meetings, in which inspection of the two key facilities will be a key issue along with the timing of the inspections and strength of the inspection team.
