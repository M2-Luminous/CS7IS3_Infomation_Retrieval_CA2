EU foreign ministers failed to approve the budget reform that would base contributions in direct proportion to gross domestic product levels and in inverse proportion to VAT [value-added tax] rates. Italy said its reform of the calculation by which GDP [gross domestic product] is calculated put it at a disadvantage in relation to other EU countries that have not yet carried out that change in the way production levels are estimated. According to Italian representatives, that discrepancy could cost Italy 1 trillion lire yearly in EU budget contributions. Italian sources also cited the outstanding dispute between Italy and the EU on milk quotas, arguing these could cost Italy between 2.5 and 5 trillion lire if quotas remain at present levels. Italy believes the EU has not moved quickly enough on agricultural reform where the Mediterranean products are concerned, and that further negotiations are needed on agro-monetary realignment.
