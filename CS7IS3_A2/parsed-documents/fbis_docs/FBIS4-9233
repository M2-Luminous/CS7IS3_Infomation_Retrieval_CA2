The other moderators were: Jean-Paul Carteron, president of the Crans Montana Forum Foundation, Yasir 'Arafat, president of the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization, Shim'on Peres, Israeli minister of foreign affairs, and Fathi Surur, president of the People's Assembly of Egypt. Opening the session, President Ion Iliescu expressed his satisfaction at the privilege to be the moderator of the discussions of the two politicians who have assumed the difficult task to break the deadlock and start negotiations that should give shape to peace in the Middle East. Stressing in this respect the courage and realistic-mindedness of 'Arafat and Peres, President Iliescu highlighted also the contribution of Egypt, an important promoter of the peace negotiations in the Middle East. He considers that new ways are about to be found for the overcoming of the conflict situation, suggesting to the international community to back the efforts of the two, who are currently under powerful pressure. President Iliescu recalled Minister Peres' saying that one would find money more easily for weapons than for building peace, and stressed it was the duty of the international community to back these two politicians in their constructive effort. Also, he hoped the Bucharest meeting would help the attainment of the desideratum of peace for which 'Arafat and Peres worked.
