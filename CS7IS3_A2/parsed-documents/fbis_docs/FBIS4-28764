In a statement submitted to the International Court of Justice [ICJ], Japan dropped the phrase: "the use of nuclear arms is not necessarily a violation of positive international law." However, Hata noted the government has not revised its stance toward the issue. On the other hand, Hata stressed Japan's policy of opposing any attempt to use nuclear weapons as a political tool. He said: "Japan must further promote the three non-nuclear principles. I have absolutely no intention of adopting policies to tolerate the use of nuclear arms." These remarks were made in reply to questions by Upper House Dietman, Shinei Kiyan (of the Niin Club). When Councillor Koichiro Ueda (the Japan Communist Party) asked if the government has any intention to designate the 15 August war memorial day as a national holiday, Hata responded positively, saying: "The day may be a holiday, or a special day to pray for peace. It is a good day for everyone to think about the past."
