In a lengthy interview he granted to JORNAL DE ANGOLA, the FAA chief of general staff reaffirmed the need for the Angolan people to be ready for war. Gen. Joao de Matos noted that even if consensus is achieved in Lusaka, an extremely violent war is likely to erupt between the time an accord is signed and its implementation. According to him, all that may happen in the country during that period will be viewed as incidents, even though war would describe the situation more accurately. The FAA chief of general staff warned that no peace accord will last for long as there is a military balance between the government and UNITA. Gen. Joao de Matos noted that, for peace to last, there has to be an imbalance in favor of the government. He recognized, however, that there is no military solution to the Angolan war, adding that he believes war in Angola also depends on developments in South Africa. The FAA chief of general staff also expressed the belief that, contrary to what Jonas Savimbi claims, UNITA does not have the capacity to withstand another 10 years of war. Gen. Joao de Matos believes that what Jonas Savimbi says is one thing, and what really happens is quite another.
