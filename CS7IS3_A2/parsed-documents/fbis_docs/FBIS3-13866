Jad-al-Haq confines himself to religious issues to stress the merciful nature of Islam. He cites several sayings by the Prophet Muhammad on this topic. FOREIGN INVASIONS LINKED TO MUSLIMS' WEAKNESS AND DIVISION Also on page seven, the newspaper features a 900-word article by Islamic writer Dr. Muhammad 'Amarah. He maintains there is an "organic link" between foreign threats and invasions and the Muslims' weakness and backwardness. He says all foreign invasions of Muslim lands took place when the Muslims were weak and divided. To substantiate his views, he cites the Crusades 1096-1291, the Tatar invasion of Baghdad in 1258, and the French campaign in Egypt under Napoleon Bonaparte between 1769 and 1805. NO SEPARATION OF THE SEXES IN ISLAM On pages eight and nine, Shaykh Ahmad Abu-al-'Ala' answers readers' questions on several religious issues. In answer to a question by a female student on Islam's ruling regarding coeducational schools and colleges, he says that "Islam does not call for the complete separation of the two sexes" but has asked the people to be modest in their dressing so as not to encourage adultery. He adds that Islam allows men and women to meet in mosques. Therefore, if this is allowed in places of worship, it is also allowed in colleges and schools provided that it does not lead to fornication. FREEDOM OF OPINION IN ISLAM On page nine, the newspaper carries an 800-word article by Hamid Isma'il entitled "Freedom of Opinion in Islam." He says "Islam has guaranteed freedom of thought and expression." However, he notes that Islam has recommended that this freedom be exercised in its "correct framework," which "builds and does not destroy," "does not insult religious and moral values," and "does not undermine national unity or expose society to dangers." The writer says Islam calls for freedom of opinion in social, political, and economic issues on which views may differ. However, as regards religious issues that are clearly defined in written texts, there is no room for different opinions. For instance, when Islam says alcohol is banned or a thief's hand must be chopped off, there is no room for a divergent opinion. ISLAM IN SINGAPORE On page 20, the newspaper carries a 600-word report on Islam in Singapore. The report notes that Muslims constitute 15.5 percent of Singapore's 3 million inhabitants. It adds that over 500 people convert to Islam annually. MUSLIMS IN CAMBODIA On page 20, the newspaper carries a 150-word report on the plight of Muslims in Cambodia. The report says the Khmer Rouge killed 65,000 Muslims in Cambodia during its reign. The Khmer Rouge persecuted non-Communists, especially Muslims whose numbers, because of emigration, have shrunk from 800,000 to 200,000. VEILED STUDENTS IN FRANCE PREVENTED FROM ENTERING SCHOOLS Citing the Islamic AL-ISLAH magazine, which is published in France, the newspaper in a 150-word report on page 21 says that over 200 female French-Muslim students are prevented from entering their classes because they wear veils. The report also noted that France's Muslims are facing a problem because the French interior minister has prevented nonresident Muslim preachers from participating in the religious enlightenment of the Muslims. BANNING OF SATELLITE DISHES IN SAUDI ARABIA On page 21, the newspaper notes in a 100-word report that the Saudi Government has decided to ban the importation of satellite dishes or their local manufacture. It notes that the Saudi Information Ministry will be in charge of receiving satellite television programs and will transmit them to viewers through a cable system in "a way conforming with religious and social values."
