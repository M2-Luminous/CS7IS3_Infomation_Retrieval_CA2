Experts regard the area's economic take-off as a key to achieving China's goal to rank among the world's moderately developed countries by the mid-21st century. The Chang Jiang flows 6,300 km from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau to Shanghai, where it joins the sea. It runs through the seven provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei and Sichuan, which account for 40 percent of the nation's production capability and 30 percent of consumer purchasing power. Inspired by the construction of the Pudong New Area in Shanghai, the central government set forth an ambitious plan to develop the Chang Jiang River Delta in June 1992. Shanghai, the country's biggest city, which is located at the mouth of the Yangtze, has become the area's economic showcase, in the process of regaining its status as the largest trade and financial center in the Pacific-Asia region. By 1993, the city's ten newly-established and biggest exchanges registered over 1,000 billion yuan in total transaction volume. Its indices and quotations have become instructive for both domestic and world trade. Shanghai's development seems to display the Chinese leadership's firm determination to deepen the country's 15-year reform drive and open the country wider to the outside world. If this city, which had fully implemented the central planning system since 1950, is successful in its shift to a market economy, there is no reason for other cities not to follow suit. Another key national project, the ongoing Three Gorges water-conservancy project, which started on the upper reaches of the Chang Jiang in 1993, has attracted many investors from home and abroad to tap its water resources, which equal the total in the Commonwealth of Independent States and are 40 percent more than the total in the U.S. Now, an industrial modernization campaign is sweeping through the delta, which has a strong industrial foundation and advanced scientific and technological level. The steel corridor, embracing the Baoshan Steel Works Group and iron and steel companies in Chongqing, Maanshan and Wuhan, has expanded sharply. Car production centers in Shanghai and Wuhan are now under construction. The provinces of Jiangxi and Anhui have set a target to double their nonferrous metals output. And the hi-tech industry, featuring bioengineering, microelectronics and new materials, will facilitate the area's development as a whole. The major projects in the region, including those in construction and on the drawing board, are expected to pool a total of 1,000 billion yuan. With China's policy-makers turning their focus to the area, it has also seen a huge influx of foreign investment. In 1993, the area approved over 10,000 foreign-funded enterprises, with nearly 10 billion U.S. dollars in promised foreign investment. So far, more than 100 big-name conglomerates among the world's top 500 have entered the region, especially streaming into cities like Shanghai, Wuhan and Chongqing. Large companies from Belgium and Germany, which took the lead in exploring this market, have recouped their investments, prompting many others to follow suit. Experts predicted a bright future for the area under the fine economic climate nationwide, especially for the forming market economy, which is on the fast-track of development.
