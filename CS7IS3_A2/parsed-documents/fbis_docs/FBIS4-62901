That is the outcome of an emergency session of the cabinet which went on through the night. The main reason for the resignation issue being put on the agenda is contradictions within the government and differences between the prime minister and certain Cabinet members. The government crisis, which was smoldering like a fire under the ashes, flared up yesterday when it became known that the board of the ruling Fatherland [Isamaa] party decided to recommend the government's resignation. This decision was opposed by the parliamentary party and other members of the ruling coalition -- the National Independence Party and the Liberal Democrats. The Cabinet will be continuing with different members. So far it is reliably known that Defense Minister Indrek Kannik has resigned -- at the prompting of the head of government -- as well as Justice Minister Kaido Kama, who decided to leave his post of his own volition. According to Kama, no fewer than five other ministers will be leaving the Cabinet. Social Affairs Minister Marju Lauristin believes this figure to be a little high.
