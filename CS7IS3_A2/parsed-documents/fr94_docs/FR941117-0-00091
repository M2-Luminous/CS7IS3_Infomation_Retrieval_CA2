FR941117-0-00091 FR941117-0-00011 (d) Basic Exchange Telephone Radio Systems in the Rural Radiotelephone Service may transmit emissions of the following type: 20K0D7W. (e) The frequency deviation must not exceed 12 kHz for frequency modulated emissions with a bandwidth of 40 kHz, and 5 kHz for frequency modulated emissions with a bandwidth of 16 kHz. ยง22.359 Emission masks. Unless otherwise indicated in the rules governing a specific radio service, all transmitters intended for use in the Public Mobile Services must be designed to comply with the emission masks outlined in this section. If an emission outside of the authorized bandwidth causes harmful interference, the FCC may, at its discretion, require greater attenuation than specified in this section. (a) Analog modulation. For transmitters other than those employing digital modulation techniques, the mean or peak envelope power of adjacent channel emissions must be attenuated below the output mean or peak envelope power of the total emission (P, in Watts) in accordance with the following schedule: (1) On any frequency removed from the center frequency of the assigned channel by more than 50 percent up to and including 100 percent of the authorized bandwidth: at least 25 dB: (2) On any frequency removed from the center frequency of the assigned channel by more than 100 percent up to and including 250 percent of the authorized bandwidth: at least 35 dB: (3) On any frequency removed from the center frequency of the assigned channel by more than 250 percent of the authorized bandwidth: at least 43 + 10 log P dB, or 80 dB, whichever is the lesser attenuation. (b) Digital modulation. For transmitters not equipped with an audio low pass filter and for transmitters employing digital modulation techniques, the mean or peak envelope power of sideband emissions must be attenuated below the mean or peak envelope power of the total emission (P, in Watts) in accordance with the following schedule: (1) For transmitters that operate in the frequency ranges 35 to 44 MHz, 72 to 73 MHz, 75.4 to 76.0 MHz and 152 to 159 MHz, (i) On any frequency removed from the center frequency of the assigned channel by a displacement frequency f d (in kHz) of more than 5 kHz but not more than 10 kHz: at least 83 log (f d 5) dB; (ii) On any frequency removed from the center frequency of the assigned channel by a displacement frequency f d (in kHz) of more than 10 kHz but not more than 250 percent of the authorized bandwidth: at least 29 log f d 2 11) dB or 50 dB, whichever is the lesser attenuation; (iii) On any frequency removed from the center frequency of the assigned channel by more than 250 percent of the authorized bandwidth: at least 43 + 10 log P dB, or 80 dB, whichever is the lesser attenuation. (2) For transmitters that operate in the frequency ranges 450 to 512 MHz and 929 to 932 MHz, (i) On any frequency removed from the center frequency of the assigned channel by a displacement frequency f d (in kHz) of more than 5 kHz but not more than 10 kHz: at least 83 log (f d 5) dB; (ii) On any frequency removed from the center frequency of the assigned channel by a displacement frequency f d (in kHz) of more than 10 kHz but not more than 250 percent of the authorized bandwidth: at least 116 log (f d 6.1) dB, or 50 + 10 log P dB, or 70 dB, whichever is the lesser attenuation; (iii) On any frequency removed from the center frequency of the assigned channel by more than 250 percent of the authorized bandwidth: at least 43 + 10 log P dB, or 80 dB, whichever is the lesser attenuation. (c) Measurement procedure. Either peak or average power may be used, provided that the same technique is used for both the adjacent channel or sideband emissions and the total emission. The resolution bandwidth of the measuring instrument must be set to 300 Hz for measurements on any frequency removed from the center frequency of the assigned channel by no more than 250 percent of the authorized bandwidth and 30 kHz for measurements on any frequency removed from the center frequency of the assigned channel by more than 250 percent of the authorized bandwidth. ยง22.361 Standby facilities. Licensees of stations in the Public Mobile Services may install standby transmitters for the purpose of continuing service in the event of failure or during required maintenance of regular transmitters without obtaining separate authorization, provided that operation of the standby transmitters would not increase the service areas or interference potential of the stations, and that such standby transmitters use the same antenna as the regular transmitters they temporarily replace.
