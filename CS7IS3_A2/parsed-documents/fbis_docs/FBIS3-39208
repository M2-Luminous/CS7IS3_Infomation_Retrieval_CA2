In a statement today, Cetin stressed that the decision is important from the viewpoint of the alliance's credibility and relations between North America and Europe. He said: We sincerely hope this decision will at least prevent further massacres and facilitate a solution in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Cetin recalled that Turkey prepared a similar plan in August 1992, and presented it to the five permanent UN Security Council members. He continued: From that moment on, Turkey has defended it views on the issue at every forum. When we look back, we see that it would have been preferable to reach a similar decision then, thus preventing the death of thousands of people. Diplomacy that is not supported by a convincing determination cannot succeed. This principle has once again been confirmed in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Now what remains to be done is to implement the decision without any changes and speed up efforts toward a solution. Turkey will continue to fulfill its duties on the issue.
