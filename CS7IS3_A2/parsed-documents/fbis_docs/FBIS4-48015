Ghanaian UN troops and more than 3,000 refugees were using Amahoro stadium as a shelter, a UN statement said. The stadium has been turned into a temporary shelter for people who have tried to escape the brutal ethnic massacres hitting the tiny east African country, according to the UN statement obtained here Monday. It said he was the 11th soldier in the UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda killed in Rwanda since the country slid back into civil war last month after President Juvenal Habyarimana was killed in a suspicious airplane crash.
