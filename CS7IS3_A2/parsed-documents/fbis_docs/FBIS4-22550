Landyk, vice premier of Ukraine: "The Market Is Where the Goods Are"] [Text] Valentyn Landyk, 45, a native of Donetsk Oblast, graduate of the Kramatorsk Industrial Institute. He then served in the army in the Leningrad Military District. Later he worked at the Artemovo Pobeda Truda Machine-Building Plant (mining machinery). He also advanced from line to shop foreman and became secretary of the party committee. In 1985 he was invited to Donetsk to "revive" the food industry machine-building plant there. He accomplished that, then he revived the Donbass Refrigeration Plant and became the general director of Elektrobytmash Association of the USSR Ministry of the Defense Industry. He created the Nord joint-stock company. Since June 1993 he has been vice premier of the government of Ukraine. On the Work of the Government In October I presented my plan for resolution of the crisis to the Cabinet in which the principal emphasis was made on regional self-administration, i.e. on the transfer of full authority to oblasts. The proposals were approved by the president. It was agreed to differentiate four oblasts (as kind of "special self-administered regions") on an experimental basis--the Donetsk, Zaporozhye, Lugansk, and Dnepropetrovsk oblasts. Even though it took a lot of work, it was possible to compile a list of enterprises--priority consumers of energy in the most important branches, for the purpose of regulating the consumption and conservation of energy resources. Today there are 70 such enterprises in Ukraine. The structural reorganization of the economy is actually starting with them. For instance, we have already reviewed the traditional approach to the requirements for aluminum. Formerly aluminum ingots from Russia were rolled involving great expenditures on transportation and energy, whereas in the future we will produce finished aluminum sheets and foil on our own using Italian technology. For decades we were creating a powerful chemical industry and still received half-a-billion rubles annually for the purchase of pesticides. Today the chemists have been assigned the task of creating the independent output of these products. We are not straining in an attempt to bring the economy up to the level of the former Union. The essence lies in something else--a movement away from the scale and the framework of the former Union economy. Whatever can be and should be produced with lower expenditures in Ukraine, must be produced. Products that are not among the priorities or which do not lend themselves to independent production must be purchased--in Russia, in Kazakhstan, in Uzbekistan, in the West, that is it. Work in priority directions in the economy is supported, and this is highly important, by the law on investments, an inalienable part of which is a list of subjects deserving primary governmental attention. That law will work regardless of whether the current Council of Ministers and I, as the vice premier, continue functioning. We initiated a systemic approach to issues of economic reform. On relations with Russia. I have never been one of those favoring a break in ties with Russia. Even before entering the Cabinet I always said (and the press loved to quote this) that I never shrugged off Russia and do not advise anyone else to do that either. I am prepared to repeat that once again for those who do not understand it: to us Russia is a market for Ukrainian goods (and, probably the other way around as well). A failure to comprehend this on both sides leads to mutual losses. In Moscow they undoubtedly are feeling that on the food market. By the way, we also intend to defend ourselves against intervention in our food supply by means of customs tariffs: a bottle of American Smirnov vodka used to cost 40,000 coupons and will now cost 600,000 coupons. I personally had occasion to participate directly in the elaboration of the treaty on cooperation among independent states in a package which included 35 other agreements. In the end we shall join a customs union and a payments union. I can say right now with full confidence that Ukraine will sign on 16 April not as an associate member, but as a CIS member. The mood of the president himself convinces me of that as well. On Privatization For the president that is of the utmost importance. President Kravchuk, by the way, intends to evaluate our work according to the level of privatization. In 1995 it is planned to privatize 20,000 out of 24,000 small enterprises along with 8,000 out of 40,000 medium and large enterprises. The course of the administration toward liberalization and privatization will be unalterable. I am personally closely familiar with work on privatization because I have worked through all the stages of issuing stock myself. At Donetsk, as their long-time director, I guided large enterprises for the production of Nord refrigerators through those stages. At the plant with a work force of around 19,000 there is no state property, only collective property. I own five percent of Nord. It is true, I do not feel that yet, but my children, I hope, will benefit from this. Every week we hold conferences with directors on privatization. Just as in Russia, of course, we are advised by the World Monetary Fund, the International Financial Corporation, the EBRR [European Bank for Reconstruction and Development], as well as by other Western institutions. However, I would not draw any parallels with the Russian Goskomimushchestvo [State Committee for the Administration of State Property]. On a Purposeful Policy A drop in gasoline prices in Ukraine came as a surprise for many. To the administration, however, that constituted proof of the correctness of the course designed to restrain spontaneous elements of the market. The stock exchange was eliminated, and a fixed karbovanets exchange rate was introduced while the "freedoms" of brokers and middlemen were restricted. We placed them under very rigid control. If you want to import--do it through the committee on petroleum and gas and sell with its permission. A highly important role was played by avoidance of a monetary emission during the December - February period, which, according to the sellers of gasoline, was to have been followed by a price explosion. In anticipation of that event fuel owners painstakingly created a shortage of it. But... In that situation it was specifically the market which nevertheless compelled them to lower prices. If one is to be quite frank, there is no real market in Ukraine and Russia. That is there is no goods market, but there is a money market. The commodity market is yet to be created. It is also necessary to alter the psychology of the producer and the seller. The drive and, what is most important, the wish to receive not a five or ten percent profit, but profit three and even five times higher, are amazing. It gets to the point where the goods and finished products are allowed to rot, while at the same time the government is solicited for subsidies and foreign currency. In such cases I recommend: move, go abroad, if you cannot do so, trade in Ukraine, but... lower the prices. I believe that in the very near future this will happen with prices for meat which is available here in adequate quantities. On Stabilization We stabilized the situation somewhat in the Ukrainian economy. Not a single emission ruble has been released from December until today and accounts with Russia for petroleum and gas are finally being settled. Up to that time there were discussions, tears, and begging--there were no payments. Today the payments are coming. A new decree is being prepared concerning currency regulation for the purpose of eventually shifting to a single exchange rate. The order of mandatory sale of foreign currency proceeds of enterprises will be changed. Strictly speaking we did not "close down" the stock market. Today it simply operates with the Committee for Clearing Operations (or the tender committee), which sells currency only for whatever is needed in Ukraine, on the basis of special purpose programs. There are not problems either with the Ministry of Finance or the National Bank. My viewpoint is as follows: the chief bookkeeper must not command the plant. In other words the bank must be subordinated to the president. There was some talk about our hryvnya. Technically we are prepared to print it. I cannot name a date yet, but I will say, that it will be a week from Thursday.
