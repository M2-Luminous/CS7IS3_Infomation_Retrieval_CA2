FBIS4-4940 "dreas066_d_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-066 Daily Report 6 Apr 1994 South Korea No `Consensus' in Ministers' Meeting on DPRK No `Consensus' in Ministers' Meeting on DPRK SK0604071994 Seoul CHUNGANG ILBO in Korean 6 Apr 94 p 2 SK0604071994 Seoul CHUNGANG ILBO Korean BFN [Report by Kim Ik-hyon and Kang Yong-chin] [Text] Security-related ministers held a six-hour long emergency meeting at the prime minister's residence in Samchong-tong, Seoul on 5 April to discuss countermeasures on the North Korean nuclear issue following the U.S. request that the ROK concede on the issue of exchanging North-South special envoys, a precondition for the third round of North Korean-U.S. talks, in an effort to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue. Failing to reach any consensus, however, the government is having trouble coming up with a clear position on this issue. A righ-ranking government official disclosed that Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang, Yi Yong-tok, deputy prime minister and unification board minister, Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, Kim Tok, National Security Planning Agency Director, and Yi Chong-uk, senior presidential secretary for foreign and national security affairs, gathered at the prime minister's official residence and extensively discussed measures regarding nuclear negotiations with North Korea from 1600 [0700 GMT] to 2200 [1300 GMT] that day, but failed to reach any conclusion. Following Foreign Minister Han's briefing on his trip to the United States, discussion centered around the U.S. suggestions for concession on the issue of exchanging North-South special envoys, and resumption of the Team Spirit military exercise. According to a source, two very different views conflicted with one another at the meeting: While some argued that conceding on the issue of exchanging North-South special envoys so that North Korea- U.S. talks can proceed and, North Korea can be lead to receive nuclear inspections was a realistic way to resolving the nuclear issue, others insisted on not giving up on North-South dialogue. It was learned that those in favor of conceding, noted the atmosphere in the international community and the United States of placing more importance on the realization of North Korea-U.S. talks as they feel that the UN action resulted from the International Atomic Energy agency's [IAEA] inspections and not the lack of progress in North-South dialogue. Those opposed to any concession argued that conceding would appear as though our side were being dragged along by North Korea's tactics to delay talks and warned of public criticism of the government for repeated concessions to North Korea. In a recent letter in the name of Kang Sok-chu, vice foreign minister and senior delegate of the North Korean side to North Korea-U.S. talks, to Robert Gallucci, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State and U.S. side's senior delegate, the North Korean side said that "if the United States does not link the holding of a third round of North Korea-U.S. talks with the exchange of North-South special envoys, which was put forward as a precondition for the talks, North Korea will accept additional inspections by the IAEA." Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher pointed out that "acceptance [of North Korean demand] is the only realistic method to breaking the current situation," and asked the ROK side to consider it. Citing domestic sentiments, however, Foreign Minister Han reportedly expressed an opposing view. Discussing how the situation must appear to the public with the confusion within the government pertaining to the negotiation strategy on the North Korean nuclear issue, another source revealed that the security-related ministers agreed on the need to fine tune the government's position, and decided to adjust flexibly to developments in the situation while adhering to existing policies. Participants at the meeting also voiced concern over the possibility of Vice Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong's recent remarks on the possibility of considering a plan to withdraw the demand to exchange North-South special envoys, upsetting government policy.
