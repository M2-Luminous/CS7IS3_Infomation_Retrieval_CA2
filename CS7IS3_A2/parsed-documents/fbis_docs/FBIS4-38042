Informed sources said this Syrian offer was welcomed and appreciated by Hamas. The offer was made during meetings by Hamas leaders last week with a number of Syrian leaders, including Vice President 'Abd-al-Halim Khaddam, Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar', and Sami 'Atari, member of the Ba'th Party National Command. The sources said the Hamas delegation -- which comprised Dr. Musa Abu-Marzuq, head of the Hamas Political Bureau; Ibrahim Ghawshah, Muhammad Nazzal, and Abu-Muhammad Mustafa -- preferred to wait before it makes a decision until it studies the offer in the light of the future political developments, particularly the development in the Jordanian-Israeli negotiations.
