FR940620-0-00093 FR940620-0-00029 Comment. A majority of commenters opposed an elevator exception based on the presumed physical capabilities of employees or other occupants of the facility. Most of these commenters argued that such an exception would limit the employment opportunities of persons with disabilities. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), which enforces title I of the ADA, stated that: Title I of the ADA stresses a case-by-case determination of whether an individual with a disability can perform the essential functions of the job. Myths, fears, and stereotypes about disability are irrelevant to this determination. Consistent with this premise, blanket exclusions of individuals based on disability will be closely scrutinized under Title I of the ADA and in most cases, will probably be struck down as discriminatory *␣*␣* As a practical matter, a case-by-case determination of whether an individual with a disability can perform the essential functions of a job with reasonable accommodation will be moot if the employer can show that providing the reasonable accommodation will impose an undue hardship. While it will always depend on the particulars of the case, where certain levels of accessibility are not built in at the design stage of new construction, an employer is more likely to be able to prove an undue hardship defense based upon the need to make significant structural changes to the relevant work area. Some commenters also noted that exemptions based on physical qualifications of facility occupants or employees can be confusing or difficult to interpret. Several commenters argued against such an exception because the occupancy of a facility may change or because access may be needed by other persons, such as supervisory personnel. Response. Exceptions based on essential job requirements may not only be inconsistent with the ADA, as noted by the EEOC, but are also inconsistent with existing ADAAG provisions applicable to public accommodations and commercial facilities in the private sector. While full accessibility is not required in employee work areas, ADAAG 4.1.3 does require in section 4.1.1(3) access so that persons with disabilities can ``approach, enter, and exit'' such areas. Neither this provision nor existing ADAAG exceptions exempt accessibility based on the physical capabilities of employees or occupants. Exceptions based on structural factors or limitations are more consistent with ADAAG and the ADA. Thus, the NPRM asked whether design solutions exist for providing access to certain multi-story facilities where installation of an elevator may be infeasible or impractical. Examples include drawbridge and boat traffic towers, lock and dam control stations, and air traffic control towers, which require a clear 360 degree view that cannot be obstructed by an elevator shaft. Comment. Most commenters identified lifts, including vertical and incline lifts, as feasible alternatives to elevators, particularly with respect to air traffic control towers. The response concerning drawbridge and boat traffic towers and lock and dam control stations was less conclusive, although a slight majority recommended that such facilities not be exempt. Several other comments noted that limited use or limited access elevators may provide a solution since they require less space than do passenger elevators meeting the requirements of ADAAG 4.10 (Elevators). Other comments considered available solutions as cost prohibitive or impractical and recommended further study. Response. Existing exceptions in ADAAG 4.1.3(5) allow the use of platform lifts complying with ADAAG 4.11 (Platform Lifts) in lieu of an elevator in limited circumstances, such as ``incidental spaces and rooms which are not open to the general public and which house no more than five persons'' or ``where existing site constraints or other constraints make use of a ramp or elevator infeasible.'' (See Exception 4(c) and (d)). While platform lifts may be an effective solution in addressing changes in level of a certain distance, their use in providing access between floors may not always be feasible. For example, platform lifts complying with ADAAG 4.11 (Platform Lifts) must meet the ASME A17.1 Safety Code for Elevators and Escalators, Section XX, 1990, which prohibits vertical wheelchair lifts from traveling more than twelve feet or from penetrating floors (Rule 2000.7a). The existing exception for facilities subject to title III of the ADA that are less than three stories or that have less than 3000 square feet per story is contained in ADAAG 4.1.3(5) Exception 1. As noted in the NPRM, the applicability of this exception to places of public accommodation and commercial facilities was clarified. In addition, as part of this rulemaking, this provision has been lettered (a). An exception has been added in Exception 1, paragraph (b) for facilities subject to title II of the ADA. This exemption is narrower in scope than the existing exception for title III facilities in paragraph (a) and applies only to facilities that are less than three stories and not open to the general public where the floor above the accessible ground floor houses no more than five persons and is less than 500 square feet. Examples include drawbridge towers, boat traffic towers, lock and dam control stations, and train dispatching towers. The maximum occupancy of five persons is derived from ADAAG 4.1.3(5) Exception 4(c) which allows the use of a platform lift instead of an elevator in providing access to incidental occupiable spaces. Since a platform lift may not always be a feasible alternative to an elevator in providing access between floors, Exception 1(b) does not contain a requirement for platform lifts in exempting elevator access. The 500 square foot maximum is based on a floor area allowance of 100 square feet per occupant, which is consistent with model building code requirements for business and industrial occupancies used in determining the occupant load for purposes of egress. In addition, an exemption is provided for air traffic control towers in Exception 5. Under this exception, elevator access is not required to serve the cab of air traffic control towers since an elevator serving the cab would obstruct the necessary 360 degree clear view. This exception also applies to the floor immediately below the cab since the machinery above the elevator may obstruct the 360 degree clear view required in the cab. However, with respect to the floor immediately below the cab, this exception applies only where maintenance of the 360 degree clear view is not feasible. For example, a hydraulic elevator, which may be used in air traffic control towers up to a certain height, will enable an elevator car to serve the floor immediately below the cab without obstructing the 360 degree clear view in the cab. Thus, the exemption from elevator access to the floor immediately below the cab applies only to those air traffic control towers that cannot accommodate a hydraulic elevator. While relieved of the requirement for elevator access to the cab and possibly the floor immediately below the cab, air traffic control towers must be designed to be adaptable under this exception so that an accessible vertical means of access, such as a platform lift complying with ADAAG 11 (Platform Lifts), can be installed after construction as an adaptable feature when needed by a person with a disability to serve the cab and, where necessary, the floor immediately below the cab. 4.1.3(5)␣Exception 4 (Platform Lifts) This exception permits the use of platform lifts or wheelchair lifts complying with 4.11 and applicable State or local codes in new construction specific conditions. As further discussed in ADAAG 11 (Judicial, Legislative and Regulatory Facilities) and ADAAG 13 (Accessible Residential Housing), this exception has been revised to allow platform lifts or wheelchair lifts to provide access to raised judges' benches, clerks' stations, speakers' rostrums, and raised daises, jury boxes and witness stands and to connect levels within an individual dwelling unit.
