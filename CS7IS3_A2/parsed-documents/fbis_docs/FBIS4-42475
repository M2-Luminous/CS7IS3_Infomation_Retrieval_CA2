Flanked by Philippe Vasseur, the general secretary of the Republican Party [PR] and a deputy for the Pas-de-Calais region; Dominique Baudis; and Jacques Blanc, president of the regional council of Languedoc-Roussillon (PR), the minister's speech focused on three main subjects: the challenge of unemployment, the challenge of European Union [EU] enlargement, and the challenge of Yugoslavia. Alain Juppe devoted the main part of his speech to this last subject, in which he takes a particular interest, especially after the attacks he endured recently by the still-born "Europe Begins in Sarajevo" list. [passage omitted] Alain Juppe clearly stated his position on the lifting of the arms embargo on the Muslims, a measure requested by the "intellectuals' list" and by [Socialist Party Secretary General] Michel Rocard. He admitted that "once the international community had accepted the birth of new independent states, maintaining this embargo perhaps was a mistake, or rather a case of injustice." Nevertheless, he argued, "today the situation is radically different.... In view of the operational constraints imposed on our forces, the idea of lifting the arms embargo is simplistic.... I believe it would be disastrous." The minister hammered the point home: "If certain countries were to disregard the embargo, Russia would take the side of the Serbs. The war would spread immediately and the Bosnians would be condemned to military defeat even more certainly than before." Alain Juppe concluded by saying: "Lifting the embargo is certainly a mobilizing slogan, but it would make things worse. This is why I am proposing the exact opposite step: Instead of increasing the number of heavy weapons in Bosnia, we must reduce their number; instead of giving weapons to those who do not have as many, we must take away weapons from those who have too many." He added: "Do those people in France and elsewhere who are encouraging the fighting to continue realize that they are likely to cause misfortune to people whose cause they think they are defending?"
