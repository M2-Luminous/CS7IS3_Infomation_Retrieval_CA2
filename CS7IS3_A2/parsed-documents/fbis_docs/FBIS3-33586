The Bolivian Foreign Ministry has not confirmed this rumor. Anyway, Linares cannot be appointed as attache until his pending trial is resolved in Bolivia. The facts were made public thanks to Senator Andres Solis Rada. Ten years ago, in 1984, a lawsuit was filed against a long list of individuals accused of being involved in the kidnapping of the then-president of the Republic, Hernan Siles Suazo. The name of Col. German Linares is on the list and he is allegedly one of the main individuals responsible for that criminal action and the coup attempt. However, the trial was paralyzed a long time like many other lawsuits that sleep in the courtrooms of our country. Solis Rada, alarmed at the possibility that Linares might be appointed to a diplomatic post, remembered the case and asked District Attorney Javier Dipps to reactivate the trial. Therefore, this not only means that Col. Linares cannot be a diplomat, but he cannot even leave the country. [passage omitted]
