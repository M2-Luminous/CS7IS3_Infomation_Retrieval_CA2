Chinese businesses in need of capital are being listed on the New York Stock Exchange, while the Foreign Department of the Tokyo Stock Exchange witnesses a continuing withdrawal of European and U.S. listings. Fiscal year 1994 issues of yen-denominated foreign bonds (Samurai) bonds are expected to drop in half. The Tokyo Stock Exchange is now suffering from the combined impact of belated action on deregulation and lack of adequate fundamental rules on investor risks. The Japanese stock market now stands at a crucial point, where it may continue as one wing of principal world markets or decay into the status of a regional market. President Minoru Nagaoka of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, whose term of office will expire in one month on 25 May, spoke quietly as he said, "I should have foreseen changes in the Asian continent earlier. That is my one point of disappointment." Asian businesses are now in the midst of privatizing and undergoing a boom in initial public offerings. Twenty-two Chinese businesses are expected to list on foreign markets and four firms, including Huanai International Electrical Power Development Company, will list on the New York Stock Exchange by the end of this year. China Securities Surveillance and Control Commission President Liu Hongru declares, "European and U.S. stock markets will play an important role in the growth of the Chinese economy." He even suggests a substantial affiliation with European and U.S. securities surveillance authorities and securities exchanges to include the exchange of information. He does not mention "Japan" or "Tokyo" in his statements. As far as the Tokyo Stock Exchange is concerned, two teams composed of two persons each were dispatched in March 1994 for about 20 days, but this represented only an initial approach to Asian markets. The exchange has just recently begun to consider relaxation in listing standards such as net asset requirements for admission of small capital Asian firms, a measure already implemented in Europe and the United States. A source with Nikko Securities' International Planning Department laments, "We would like to handle Asian firms but the system for such accommodation is yet to be established." Eastman Kodak's Japan specialist whose firm applied for delisting from the Foreign Division of the Tokyo Stock Exchange in March of this year says, "We came to the conclusion that listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange was too costly relative to benefits gained, amidst the worldwide restructuring of the firm." Eastman Kodak's annual cost for maintaining its listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange was 13 million yen. This was below the average cost of listing with the Foreign Department of 20 million yen per year because it was translating its annual report in summary format. Even then, with only 1,483 Japanese shareholders, continued listing could not be justified. The Securities Transactions Law requires that foreign firms whose stocks are publicly traded in Japan must submit securities reports and annual reports in Japanese. Since charges include translation costs, fees to maintain listings are about eight times those charged at other foreign exchanges. Financings, such as secondary offerings, require the submission of a prospectus in Japanese. The complexity of the system is shunned and secondary offerings after initial listing have been limited to five cases and a total value of 82.9 billion yen. In the 1990's, only one case was handled. When four firms including Kodak delist at the end of June, the total number of foreign firms listed with the Tokyo Stock Exchange's Foreign Department will be 98, less than 100. Withdrawals from Japan are not limited to firms listed with the Foreign Department. In March, Republic of Turkey bonds were downgraded to a BB rating by Moody's, bringing them into violation of Japanese bond listing standards of "BBB or higher." In fiscal year 1993, Turkey issued 215 billion yen of Samurai bonds in six phases, but faces a high probability that it will not be able to issue bonds in fiscal year 1994. The Greek central bank issued 10 billion yen in bonds in two phases, but its ratings are currently under review and they now face difficulty in issuing additional Samurai bonds. The Samurai bond market has been ridiculed as a "junk market" because of the prevalence of BBB-rated bonds, but even then disappointment is being expressed concerning the departure of preferred clients of that market place. The flip side of this situation according to sources at a major securities firm is that "the Samurai market will wither" if the likes of Turkey cease to issue such bonds. Already, issuers of AAA-rated bonds have shunned the poor marketability of bonds in the Samurai market and are shifting to an emphasis on global and Eurobonds in raising new capital. There is a strong probability that Samurai bond issues in fiscal year 1994 will fall to about 600 billion yen, one-half of last year's level. Underwriters at Credit Suisse First Boston brag, "Businesses of any kind or size can raise capital in U.S. capital markets." Initially, super-long-term 50-year bonds or special-feature bonds are issued for private placement with such parties as institutions. Next, companies issue publicly subscribed bonds or issue stock for listing on the NASDAQ where listings are accepted even from firms that are not profitable. And, finally they list on the New York Stock Exchange. Such an approach is feasible in U.S. markets where a high degree of flexibility is allowed, compared to issuing bonds and listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Such a system is backed up by thorough disclosure rules. The prospectus of Shanghai Petrochemical Industries, which issued American Depository Receipts in July 1993, under "Factors To Be Considered in Investing," listed 11 items such as "price of crude oil," "insurance coverage for accidents" and "GATT restrictions." Since 1992, the London Stock Exchange began to exercise flexibility in applying standards concerning total market valuation at time of listing. The aim was to accelerate the listing of stocks of companies which specialize in biotechnology research which is considered "Britain's last unlisted industry." A special committee was established in the stock exchange which was composed of institutional investors and industry representatives. According to sources at the Listing Department of the London Stock Exchange, the biotechnology-related businesses are "a very important sector for Britain," and if they cannot raise capital domestically, there is the risk that the industry will relocate to other countries. It appears that such concerns led to the actions being taken. In its survey report titled, "Market 2000," concerning the structure and regulation of the U.S. stock markets, issued in January 1994, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) wrote, "If the SEC is to maintain strict standards, it must make market participants understand that the standards will bring appeal and benefits to the markets." On 20 April, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji during meetings with a delegation from the Keizai Doyukai [Japan Association of Corporate Executives] said, "Eventually, we would like to list state-owned company stocks on Japanese stock exchanges." Although the foundation under Japanese stock exchanges is said to be disintegrating, strongly rooted hope still exists in relation to Japan. I would venture to say that there is a need for Japan to create "appeal and benefits" for its stock markets, before hopeful words of the foregoing nature disappear completely.
