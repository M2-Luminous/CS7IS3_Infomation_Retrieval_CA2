Under consideration in Geneva will be the Russian proposal on demilitarization of the area around Sarajevo and its transfer under UN authority for a transitional period, a senior diplomat has told Interfax. He believes under present conditions the Russian initiative has a good chance of being approved by the conflicting Bosnian factions. In addition to the representatives of the warring sides, taking part in the talks will be co-chairmen of the international conference on settlement in the former Yugoslavia Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, as well as special envoys of the Russian and U.S. presidents, Vitaliy Churkin and Charles Redman. The diplomat said that the Russian initiative opens the way for a peaceful settlement of the Bosnian crisis. "We believe that the proposal on air strikes to support UN forces in the former Yugoslavia is the worst of all possible options," he said. The implementation of the Russian initiative would solve the problem, said the diplomat. He said that most European countries believe that there are enough UN Security Council resolutions to allow NATO air strikes in Bosnia-Herzegovina if the Secretary-General asks for them. Russia does not share such an approach because it believes the decision on air strikes should be taken by the UN Security Council, he said. The diplomat said that the NATO countries would advance a sort of ultimatum to the conflicting sides. Judging by everything, he said, they will be demanded to stop shelling of Sarajevo, withdraw within seven days all heavy weaponry from the adjacent region, and hand it over under UN control. If the demands are not met, NATO planes will be ready to make air strikes on the violating party, he said.
