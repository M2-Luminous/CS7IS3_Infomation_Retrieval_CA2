As has already been reported, the Federation Council (the upper house of the Russian parliament) voted in favor of increasing the defense expenditures to 55 trillion rubles Thursday. "Either we openly admit that the expenditure will be that high, or we will end the year with a debt of 18 trillion rubles," Piskunov said in an interview with Interfax. Piskunov believes that the Defense Ministry should develop a program for the optimization of its expenses, structure and personnel in the near future.
