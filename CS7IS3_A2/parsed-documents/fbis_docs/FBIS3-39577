"With this, the Bundesbank continues its course of gradually lowering the interest rate level in Germany," he said in Bonn. The Bundesbank decision and the government's consistent austerity and consolidation policy strengthen the conditions for an inflation-free upward economic trend. The interest rate reduction is also a call upon the wage round partners to create favorable conditions for an economic recovery by concluding agreements that provide stability, Waigel said. The German Banking Association spoke of a "decision appropriate in the current situation." With this, the Bundesbank continues a successful policy of reducing interest rates step by step, without creating any confusion in the capital market or the international financial markets. Like the Bundesbank, the Banking Association also expects a steadying of prices in the course of 1994. The Banking Association once again called on the wage round partners and the financial policymakers of the federal and laender governments to meet their responsibilities concerning stability.
