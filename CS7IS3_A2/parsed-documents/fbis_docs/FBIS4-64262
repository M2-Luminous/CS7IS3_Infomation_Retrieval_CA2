At a CSU meeting in preparation for the European elections, Waigel said today in Wuerzburg that Germany has fallen from position two to position seven in the EU prosperity league after unification. The call for an austere budget policy in Europe and increased returns for Germany is therefore justifiable. Waigel once again called for an international Bundeswehr commitment within the United Nations. Germany has to be prepared to assume responsibility "in Europe and throughout the world. We cannot hide any longer," Waigel stressed.
