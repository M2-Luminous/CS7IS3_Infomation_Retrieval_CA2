Talking about life reforms, he raved that the spirit of respecting human life should be put into practice and that many people must not be made lawbreakers because of unrealistic legal systems. The rascal raved that the people should actually feel the success of life reforms within a year at the most. This is another brazen-faced mockery of the people, which can be raved by traitor Kim Yong-sam, that is, the political impostor well versed in fraud, trickery, cheating, and machination. To renovate the spirit of respect for human life in South Korea, the colonial fascist rule should, above all, be put to an end. Fascist vicious laws, including the National Security Law, which systematically infringes upon the people's freedom and rights; and suppressive organizations, such as the police, prosecution, and the Agency for National Security Planning [NSP], and the Defense Security Command should be abrogated and dissolved. Then new laws and organizations centered on the people should come into being. Otherwise, the spirit of respecting human life cannot be displayed. In fact, even today, that is, the era of respecting human life, human dignity, and freedom have been fully trampled underfoot in South Korea. It is in South Korea where youths, students, and patriotic figures who struggled for independence, democracy, and reunification, have been secretly assassinated and dumped into rivers and seas. It is also in the rotten South Korea where husbands kill wives and vice versa, sons and daughters kill parents and secretly bury them, and traffickers in human flesh for a little money prevail. The worst human right infringement activity has been committed by the Kim Yong-sam ring babbling about respecting human rights. Under the pretext of a civilian regime, the Kim Yong-sam puppet ring is suppressing the people more mercilessly than at the time of the military dictatorial regimes. By mobilizing the police, the puppet ring trampled underfoot the workers who staged sit-ins calling for the right for subsistence last year. It mercilessly suppressed youths, students, and citizens calling for revealing the truth behind the Kwangju incident and punishing those responsible for the Kwangju incident, by mobilizing approximately 100,000 policemen. The number of people who were injured by the police is more than three times those injured at the time of the Sixth Republic. This shows that the Kim Yong-sam puppet ring is mercilessly suppressing the people. Traitor Kim Yong-sam raved that many fellow countrymen must not be made lawbreakers because of an unrealistic legal system. This is also a brazen-faced maneuver. Many kinds of vicious laws, which can be applicable under any circumstances, exist in South Korea. The National Security Law is the most vicious law of all laws. It goes without saying that the National Security Law is an unrealistic one in view of the background of the enacted law and its reactionary characteristics. For this reason, the South Korean people have strongly demanded that the National Security Law--the vicious fascist law against democracy and reunification--be rescinded. However, the Kim Yong-sam ring has aggravated North-South relations and arrested and persecuted many people by brandishing this law. This nonetheless, he had the face of raving that many fellow countrymen must not be made lawbreakers because of an unrealistic legal system. How brazen-faced the rascal is! Traitor Kim Yong-sam babbled about the spirit of respecting human life from the beginning of the new year. The reason he spat out such words is clear. As everyone knows, since traitor Kim Yong-sam seized power under the pretext of a civilian-regime president, he has babbled about the improvement of human rights and the development of democracy. Even though one year has passed since he seized power, nothing has changed in South Korea. Vicious fascist laws, including the National Security Law, which is a legal and systematic device for infringing upon human rights, have existed as they are or have been turned for the worse. The NSP, the hotbed of human right infringement, has remained intact. In addition, the rulers' infringements of human rights are more prevalent than those of the time of the Fifth and Sixth Republics. Thus, people cannot breathe to their heart's content. The so-called civilian regime's color was clearly brought to light. The people, who have been deceived by the rascals' ballad of reform, are trying to rise up to struggle against the rulers. Taken by surprise, traitor Kim Yong-sam is trying once again to deceive the people and maintain power by means of the ballad on human rights. It is unreasonable to babble about the respect of human life in South Korea--a land barren of democracy and a living hell-- where human rights have been fully trampled underfoot. The Kim Yong-sam puppet ring should abrogate and dissolve the vicious fascist laws, including the National Security Law, and the other suppression organizations, including the NSP; should stop suppressing the people; and should immediately release all patriotic figures who have been illegally arrested.
