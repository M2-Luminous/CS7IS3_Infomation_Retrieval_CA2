FR941110-0-00206 FR941110-0-00016 Comment: The majority of commenters who responded to this section asked that we take out paragraph (a)(1)(iii), which requires that States repay Federal funds paid to a nursing facility when alternative remedies are used. One organization stated that they believe HCFA is basing the regulation on a specific statutory requirement but they believe that this issue should be discussed before implementation of its provision in the enforcement rules. They said that they believe that a stronger public policy rests on the use of the alternative remedies and that a facility's failure to comply should not create a financial threat to the State. Response: First, we must point out that the repayment provision in redesignated ยง488.450(a)(1)(iii) is based on the Act and pertains to facilities, in the case of Medicare SNFs, as well as to the State, for NFs, that are not in substantial compliance. Second, we recognize that the statutory requirement for State agreement to repay FFP for NFs if facilities do not achieve substantial compliance can be a barrier for a State survey agency choosing to impose an alternative remedy in lieu of termination. We understand the commenters' concern that many States will not agree to repay because a NF's achievement of substantial compliance is not wholly within the State's control. We have been studying the repayment issue and hope to develop a legislative proposal to remedy the inherent barriers in the Act. Absent a legislative change, we cannot eliminate the requirement that States agree to repay Federal funds in accordance with section 1919(h)(3)(D) of the Act. Neither do we have the authority to delay the implementation of this provision without legislative intervention. However, the Act does not prevent States from obtaining a repayment agreement from a facility. The State could obtain the facility's repayment agreement either before or after it enters into a repayment agreement with the Secretary. Nor does the Act require that repayment of Federal funds be made if a facility is not in compliance with Federal requirements. If the facility does not take corrective action in accordance with its approved plan and timetable and is not in substantial compliance at the end of the correction period, the facility (for Medicare) or the State (for Medicaid) would be responsible for repaying Federal payments for the correction period and HCFA would stop any further payment to the facility (for Medicare) or the State (for Medicaid) for nursing home services. If the facility followed its approved plan and timetable, but was not able to achieve substantial compliance at the end of the correction period, the facility or State would not be responsible for repayment of Federal funds, but HCFA would stop further payment to the facility or State for nursing home services. If a facility does not take action in accordance with its approved plan or correction and timetable, but is able to achieve substantial compliance, the facility or State would not be responsible for repaying Federal funds for the correction period, and the facility could continue in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Section 1919(h)(3)(D) of the Act provide that the State agrees to repay ``if corrective action is not taken in accordance with the approved plan and timetable'' that was approved by the Secretary. Furthermore, we have explained above that alternative remedies can be imposed in addition to termination, and in such cases they would not be subject to the requirements of section 1919(h)(3)(D) of the Act.
