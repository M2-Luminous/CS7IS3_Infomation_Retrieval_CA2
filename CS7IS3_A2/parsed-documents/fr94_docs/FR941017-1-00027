FR941017-1-00027 FR941017-1-00002 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;145&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives; Airbus Model A310 and A300&hyph;600 Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Airbus Model A310 and A300&hyph;600 series airplanes. This proposal would require that certain flight control computers be modified so that the autopilot will disengage whenever the airplane is in the ``go-around'' mode. This proposal is prompted by an accident in which the flight crew may have attempted a go-around while the airplane was in an out-of-trim condition. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent severely reduced controllability of the airplane due to an out-of-trim condition between the trimmable horizontal stabilizer and the elevator. DATES: Comments must be received by November 28, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;145&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.
