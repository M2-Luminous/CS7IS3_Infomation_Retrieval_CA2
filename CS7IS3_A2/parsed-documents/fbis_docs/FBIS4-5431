Instead, it hopes participants will discuss how to establish mutual trust at the meeting. Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan made the above remarks during his meeting with Thai senior foreign ministry officials in Bangkok yesterday. Foreign Ministers of the six ASEAN countries, their seven dialogue partners, and observer nations -- Vietnam, Laos, and Papua New Guinea -- as well as China and Russia will attend the ARF meeting to discuss regional political and security cooperation issues. Six countries including China, Taiwan, Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei, and Malaysia claim sovereignty over the Spratly islands. Tang Jianxuan and his delegation arrived in Bangkok late Monday night for a week-long visit to three ASEAN countries -- Thailand, Malaysia, and Brunei -- to discuss bilateral relations and issues of common concern. An informed diplomatic source said during Tang Jiaxuan's visit to Malaysia from 5 to 7 April and to Brunei from 7 to 9 April, that he will exchange views on the Spratly issue with Malaysian and Bruneian officials. During his meeting with Tang Jiaxuan yesterday, Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsinri assured the Chinese side that Thailand will uphold the "one-China" policy. He said Thailand will not invite Taiwan to attend the upcoming ARF meeting in Bangkok. So, China should not worry about a report that Taiwan would join the ARF meeting. China had protested when Taiwan President Li Teng-hui made a "holiday diplomacy" visit to Thailand during the Chinese New Year. The informed source also told our correspondent that a delegation of the Chinese National People's Congress Foreign Affairs Committee led by its chairman, Zhu Liang, will visit Thailand from 15 to 21 April as guests of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. The delegation postponed its visit to Thailand as a result of Li Teng-hui's visit. Zhu Liang, age 70, is a native of Chaoyang, Guangdong Province. He led a delegation to visit Thailand in March 1989 when he was director of the International Liaison Department of the CPC Central Committee. His former name was Zhou Zhiyi. He has relatives in Thailand. Prasong told Tang Jiaxuan that China is an important consultative partner of ASEAN. ASEAN and China will discuss ways to strengthen bilateral trade and scientific cooperation during the 27th Annual ASEAN Foreign Ministerial Meeting in Bangkok in July. During the meeting, Tang Jiaxuan welcomed Thailand's decision to invite Burma to attend the upcoming annual ASEAN ministerial meeting as a guest of the host country. Prasong will lead a delegation to visit Burma in mid-April. Tang Jiaxuan told Thai officials that Cambodian King Prince Norodom Sihanouk has recovered and was full of vigor after a period of recuperation in Beijing. Regarding problems in Cambodia, China hopes that all Cambodian factions will follow Prince Norodom Sihanouk's instruction and achieve national reconciliation. Regarding the Korean peninsula situation, Tang Jiaxuan said China wanted to see a nuclear free zone in the Korean peninsula. He also said that China did not want to see any economic sanctions against North Korea. China hopes that all parties concerned will settle the Korean issue through dialogue. Tang Jiaxuan said that he knew nothing about a report from Seoul that China will send a delegation to Pyongyang to discuss the Korean nuclear issue. Discussing bilateral issues, the Thai and Chinese officials expressed their satisfaction over their cooperation in all fields and the exchanges of visits in the past 19 years after the establishment of diplomatic relations. The two sides agreed to further strengthen bilateral cooperation in trade, tourism, and science and technology. The Thai side hoped that Chinese President Jiang Zemin will pay an official visit to Thailand this year. The Buddhist relics preserved in Chinese ancient capital Xian, will be shipped to Bangkok to be exhibited on the occasion of the birthday of His Majesty King Phumiphon on 5 December this year. The Thai side hoped that this exhibition can be extended till the auspicious 50th anniversary of the present reign of His Majesty the King.
