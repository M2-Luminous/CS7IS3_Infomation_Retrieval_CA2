FR940627-0-00100 FR940627-0-00017 Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Act requires the Secretary to make findings on certain pending petitions within 12 months of their receipt. Section 2(b)(1) of the 1982 amendments further requires that all petitions pending on October 13, 1982, be treated as having been newly submitted on that date. On October 13, 1983, the Service found that the petitioned listing of these species was warranted but precluded by other pending listing actions, in accordance with section 4(b)(3)(B)(iii) of the Act; notification of this finding was published on January 20, 1984 (49 FR 2485). Such a finding requires the petition to be recycled, pursuant to section 4(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Act. The finding was reviewed in October of 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, and 1991. Publication of the proposed rule constituted the final 1-year finding for these species. On December 14, 1992, the Service published in the Federal Register (57 FR 39066) a proposal to list the three plant taxa from the Waianae Mountains, island of Oahu, as endangered. This proposal was based primarily on information supplied by the Hawaii Heritage Program and observations by botanists and naturalists. The Service now determines the three species primarily from the Waianae Mountains to be endangered with the publication of this final rule. Summary of Comments and Recommendations In the December 14, 1992, proposed rule and associated notifications, all interested parties were requested to submit factual reports or information that might contribute to the development of a final listing decision. The public comment period ended on January 28, 1993. Appropriate State agencies, county governments, Federal agencies, scientific organizations, and other interested parties were contacted and requested to comment. A newspaper notice inviting public comment was published in the ``Honolulu Advertiser'' on December 26, 1993. Two letters of comment were received_one from a conservation organization and the other from a concerned citizen_supporting the listing of these taxa from the Waianae Mountains, island of Oahu, but raising no specific issues. Summary of Factors Affecting the Species Section 4 of the Act and regulations (50 CFR Part 424) promulgated to implement the Act set forth the procedures for adding species to the Federal lists. A species may be determined to be an endangered or threatened species due to one or more of the five factors described in section 4(a)(1). These factors and their application to Cyanea grimesiana ssp. obatae St. John (haha), Diellia unisora W.H. Wagner (no common name (NCN)), and Gouania vitifolia A. Gray (NCN) are as follows (Table 1):
