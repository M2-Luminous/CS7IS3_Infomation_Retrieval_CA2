Earlier Kovacs was chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee in the first freely elected Hungarian Parliament. In the interview, Kovacs said, ``The number one objective of foreign policy is to ensure the security of the country. The second is to help solve economic problems of the country. This is particularly important in the case of today's Hungary. A third foreign policy objective is the image of Hungary in the outside world. ``As for the immediate priorities of the country's foreign policy, the first is continuing the efforts to bring Hungary closer to European integration. This is a matter of strategy. Number two is achieving a balanced relationship with Hungary's neighbours. This I would call a matter of urgency. The third objective is to support Hungarians living outside Hungary in their efforts to obtain guarantees of their minority rights and seeing that these rights are implemented. The new government considers this to be a moral obligation. ``What is going to change in the relationship of these three foreign policy priorities? In my opinion, the three priorities are of equal importance, and there is a close interrelationship between them. It is unimaginable, and unwise, to subordinate any of these to the other. I think it was a serious mistake during the past four years that relations with the neighbours were of secondary importance as compared to the minority question. This policy was counter-productive. Relations with our neighbours have deteriorated, so one of the important objectives of Hungarian foreign policy was lost in the approach which was taken to supporting Hungarians outside the borders of this country. If there is no dialogue, then there is no forum in which to raise the issues of minority problems. ``The deterioration of Hungary's relations with her neighbours has also damaged Hungary's image in the Western world. Thus, Hungary suffered a reduced amount of international support for solving the minority problem. Hungarian foreign policy had no other means to do something for the minorities than to broadcast very critical television programmes, to send messages to our neighbours. There is no evidence that such programmes had any favourable effect on these countries' policies towards the minorities. I must repeat, in summing up my argument, that the three priorities will be observed simultaneously. ``The approach to foreign policy thinking will also change. A foreign policy can only be based on the existing realities and the actual room for manouver, on the interests of Hungary, and on the coordination of the interests of Hungary and her partners. In this way of thinking, there is no place for a feeling of special mission or historical merits and grievances, ideological or political sympathies. ``Another thing that will change is the methodology of foreign policy. There can be no pressuring on the other side by threatening to reduce the level of relations. We also have to eliminate tendencies to isolate any of the neighbours from Europe. A condescending attitude must be out of the question. ``When taking the initiative, Hungary must not refrain from making gestures to build confidence. It is equally important to thoroughly prepare high-level meetings and survey the implementation of the agreements signed at those meetings. Such high-level visits should not be used as occasions to give history lessons. ``Can we expect a six-party consensus in the parliamentary control of the activities of the Foreign Ministry? ``The six-party consensus has been working over the past four years in the basic questions of foreign policy. All the six parties agreed on the three priorities of this policy. ``There was no consensus, however, in the practical implementation of policies. There were several steps and many official statements on behalf of the government which hindered rather than helped the realization of these objectives. "The other problem with consensus during the past four years was that before an important step in foreign policy, the government had failed to consult with the opposition. It happened quite often that opposition politicans learned about policy decisions from the press. I think a consensus must work differently. It is the responsibility of every government to involve the opposition in policy-making. It is not the job of the opposition to force it, but it is the job of the government to allow this to happen." As this interview is to be published in the last issue of the DAILY NEWS, I want to ask your opinion, does this country need an English language public service newspaper summing up political and economic developments from a Hungarian perspective or should market conditions prevail? ``It is my firm belief that for Hungary it is indispensable to have an English language public service newspaper. Hungary has an open society with many millions of foreign visitors, and tens of thousands of foreign residents working here. From diplomats to businessmen and experts, the foreign community needs a reliable source of information concerning the political and business processes in this country, including both the official Hungarian standpoint and the opinions of the individual political parties in Hungary, about public life, culture and all aspects of this country. There are, of course, three foreign-owned weekly newspapers in Budapest but they have a different function. They are not public service newspapers. ``I think such an English language paper must be fitted into the national information system. This is a totally unresolved task. The activities of the recently founded National Information Bureau had catastrophic results in the past few months. This bureau was set up last year and it was unclear from the outset what its job should be. In practical terms, the Information Bureau seriously impaired Hungary's image abroad. Such an institution should not get involved in arguments with the foreign press. It is not the job of such an institution to side with the government in internal policy debates and there were several other things which should not have been done by the Information Bureau. "The Information Bureau should give a trustworthy, objective picture of what is going on in Hungary. There were personal reasons behind this failure. In my opinion, the Foreign Ministry must coordinate information about Hungary. It will be one of my first jobs to survey the situation and to work out proposals for changes. I think the Foreign Ministry has a special mission in supplying information about the country. An English language public service newspaper is thus imndispensable for Hungary," Laszlo Kovacs, the Socialist Party nominee for foreign minister, told the DAILY NEWS.
