This request, a copy of which AFP received, also asked the head of state to appoint international experts to look into the management of public finances over the past three years and to bar government members from leaving the country for as long as this inquiry will last. Yesterday, in a communique the government accused President Trovoada and the opposition parties of "causing political instability in the country" by trying "to convince the people that the government had misused the national budget." "The government is responsible for managing budget resources and it is answerable in this regard to the National Assembly alone," the communique added. Up until now, the government had never openly involved itself in this fray, leaving it to the majority party, the Democratic Convergence Party [PCD]. This deterioration in relations between the two poles of power has continued despite a series of meetings held early this week between President Trovoada and the leaders of the various political parties, from both the majority and the opposition. The labor unions have in turn entered the fray by calling for a three-day general strike starting early July, to protest "the economic degradation of the country, the misuse of the social security budget, and the refusal of the government to negotiate with workers' representatives." The government has asked workers not to heed this strike call, which was launched by the country's largest labor federation, the National Sao Tome and Principe Workers Organization. The PCD won the first multiparty legislative elections in 1991, defeating the former single party -- the Movement for the Liberation of Sao Tome and Principe-Social Democratic Party -- which now constitutes the main opposition party. The following year, Trovoada, contesting as an independent candidate, won the presidential election. The mandate of the present National Assembly will expire at the beginning of 1995.
