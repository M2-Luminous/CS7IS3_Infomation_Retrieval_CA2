The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song taught: Comrade Kim Chong-il is glorifying our party's chuche idea as a great guidance idea of the independent age [chaju sidaeui widaehan chido sasang] by carrying out ideological and theoretical activities with extraordinary ability and energy. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, the great successor and leader [yongdoja] of the chuche revolutionary cause, has completely systemized the respected and beloved leader Comrade Kim Il-song's revolutionary idea based on the chuche ideological and theoretical method and generally elucidated anew its historical position, nature, and content, thus deepening and developing it into a unique revolutionary guidance idea of our times, the independent age. The importance of the ideological and theoretical achievements by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, who has deepened and developed the great chuche idea, is that he generally systemized the chuche idea and completed aspects worthy of the revolutionary guidance idea of the independent age and fulfilled its lofty duty. The dear comrade leader first explained the philosophical view of the world scientifically in a human-oriented way, so that he made the chuche idea a complete revolutionary doctrine that elucidates the way to pioneer man's destiny. An essential characteristic of the chuche idea lies in the fact that it is based on the new, human-oriented philosophical view of the world. From the chuche viewpoint that the primary aim of the view of the world is to elucidate the way to pioneer man's destiny, the dear comrade leader stipulated that the explanation of man's position in the world and man's role in the world changes and development is the primary question the philosophical view of the world should solve. He also scientifically explained that independence, creativity, and consciousness belong to man's basic character. Based on this, he elucidated the new, human-oriented philosophical principle that man reacts to the environment independently, creatively, and consciously on purpose; occupies the master's position in the material world; and plays a decisive role in developing the material world. As the dear comrade leader completely explained the human-oriented philosophical principle, the chuche [words indistinct], it has been clearly revealed that man's position and role has become higher and greater in the world because of man's independent and creative activities and that the world becomes more man-centered and comes to serve man all the more. The dear comrade leader also embodied the chuche philosophical principle in the area of social history, so that he elucidated anew the popular mass-centered principle of social history and prepared theoretical grounds that have great significance in developing overall social sciences. While appreciating positive aspects and significance of the past materialistic opinion on history, the dear comrade leader explained its limit in history and gave a scientific explanation on the general principle of social development. The dear comrade leader declared it as a basic principle of social development that man's position and role in nature and society has become higher and greater according to the development of man's independent ideas, consciousness, and creative ability. As the dear comrade leader discovered the basic principle of social development, it has become clear that advanced capitalist countries cannot reform the old social system in a revolutionary way -- although they have high production capability -- because they are behind in remolding man, who is in charge of reforming society. It has also become clear that socialism has been frustrated in some countries mainly because they did not promote remolding man in a revolutionary way in conformity with the new socialist system so that people could not fulfill their responsibility and role as masters of socialist society. Our party's strategic policy on occupying both material and ideological fortresses of socialism, communism, and on giving priority to occupying the ideological fortress has invincible vitality, and so does the general line of socialist construction on vigorously carrying out the three revolutions -- ideological, technological, and cultural -- while enhancing the function and role of the people's power. This is because they are embodying the chuche principle of social development. For the first time in history, the dear comrade leader has elucidated that mankind, a social being, has a sociopolitical life -- different from the quality of physical life -- and that individuals will only obtain the valuable sociopolitical life if they are members of the collective, the main body of sociopolitical life. This occupies an important position in his achievements that have deepened and developed the chuche idea. In this way, the dear comrade leader -- who has expounded an original ideology and theory on the sociopolitical life and opened a new epoch for establishing the chuche-oriented view of life -- has elucidated the truth that for the social collective to become a sociopolitical organism, it must be organically merged with a center, a central organization. He has also newly and scientifically explained the basic doctrine that will merge this organism into the position and role that the leader [suryong], the party, and the masses would occupy within the sociopolitical organism. As a result, he has put the chuche-oriented revolutionary view of the leader [suryong], the view of organization, the view of the mass, and the view of morality on a profound ideological and theoretical foundation. He has made an historic contribution to creating the chuche-oriented view of life, which pursues a rewarding and happy life in glorifying the sociopolitical life by participating in the revolutionary struggles befitting the master under the leadership of the party and the leader [suryong]. What is important in the immortal ideological and theoretical achievements gained by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, who has deepened and developed the great chuche idea, is that he has newly developed and enriched the chuche revolutionary theory and the leadership method based on the philosophical doctrine of the chuche idea in conformity with the demands of the current times. Based on his scientific explanation of the basic characteristics of modern imperialism, the dear comrade leader has newly established theories, strategies, and tactics capable of victoriously leading the socialist and communist cause. Also, he has elucidated that imperialists, who fought each other in the past, have entered a new stage of further strengthening exploitation and suppression of the world's people, thus conspiring with each other today. In this way, the dear comrade leader has fully analyzed the reactionary or antipeople characteristics of modern imperialism -- which is different from that of the past. Based on this, he has expounded a new strategy to win victory in the independent cause, the socialist, and the communist cause. By internationally conspiring with each other, the imperialist powers have strengthened exploitation and suppression of the people. As a result, the world has been further divided into two poles in which the rich get ever richer and the poor get ever poorer. Also, the social and class foundation capable of burying capitalism has been further expanded and strengthened. We can successfully effect an upturn of converting capitalism into socialism only if we strengthen revolutionary and independent chuche under such circumstances, thus alerting the masses of their independent and ideological consciousness and politically uniting them with each other. In explaining the current changed class structures in a capitalist society, the dear comrade leader has developed a ideological and theoretical guideline for making the working popular masses conscious of and organized into the socialist ideology -- the revolutionary ideology of the working class -- by overcoming all descriptions of right and left deviations. As a result, he has elucidated a way to develop the revolutionary struggle for socialism onto a new higher stage. The dear comrade leader originally expounded a new party-building theory that the working class party should be strengthened and its leadership role should be raised in order to revolutionize and win over the broad working popular masses in conformity with the class composition of a society that changes as it develops. He has fully expounded principles and plans to strengthen the party, while defining the enhancement of the party's leadership role as a lifeline for guaranteeing the victory of the revolution and construction. Based on the chuche idea centered upon mankind, the dear comrade leader has put forward, for the first time in history of the building of the working class party, a new principle that the work with man is a basis of the party's work and has presented a combination of the party's monolithic leadership and line as the basic principles of party activity. As a result, he has elucidated a way to follow correctly the party's leadership for the popular masses. As shown by historical experiences, we can win victory in the revolution and construction only when we firmly fortify the driving force of the revolution and raise its role. To firmly strengthen the driving force of the revolution and raise its role, we must, above all, strengthen the party and its leadership role. This is the solid truth. Truly, the dear comrade leader has deepened and developed the chuche idea and gained a great achievement, which will shine forever in history, in enriching its treasure house by energetically conducting ideological and theoretical activity without sleep or rest. The chuche idea, which the great leader [suryong] has sown its seed in the soil of our nation and fostered for a long time, has been greatly advanced and enriched by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. Thanks to the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's ideological and theoretical activity, the chuche idea has been developed into the authorized guide of the independent era of our time and has vigorously led the hundreds of millions of the people throughout the world to the single road of independence by griping their hearts.
