[Moravcik] It should. I will do everything I can for it to hold out. [SME] Party of the Democratic Left [SDL] deputies in the parliamentary privatization committee have called on Privatization Minister Milan Janicina to resign. Several coalition meetings have discussed this issue. Is the possible appointment of SDL Deputy Juraj Plesnik as second state secretary at the Ministry of Privatization not too big a compromise, from the viewpoint of the other coalition parties? Or is the coalition not confident enough with regard to privatization issues? [Moravcik] We have not noticed any differences with regard to the privatization concept. There are certain differences in views on the privatization of specific companies, but we have always been successful in removing those differences. I am making use of my coordinating function in the government to achieve this. I consider the establishment of the post of a second state secretary at the Ministry of Privatization to be an effective solution that is in the interest of harmonization of views. Having two state secretaries in a government department that is of such importance and must cope with such an enormous work load as the Ministry of Privatization is nothing extraordinary. [SME] Your claim of there being unanimity of views on the privatization concept could be contested. The SDL is supported by the Union of Industry, which is opposed to the privatization of state enterprises by means of coupon privatization. Former Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar had promised representatives of the Union of Industry that 10 to 12 percent of the companies' shares would be reserved for their managers, which Mr. Janicina does not accept. Besides, Mr. Plesnik said in the Privatization Committee that he could not accept Milan Janicina as minister, in view of the latter's past mistakes. Will conflicts not arise when Juraj Plesnik, as state secretary, has to subordinate himself to Minister Janicina? [Moravcik] If he accepts the position, he will have to respect the minister. When I spoke about the privatization concept, I was thinking of its form as set out in the government's policy statement. No one has called this concept in question. As for other issues--that is, whether the management ought to have 5 or 10 percent of shares--that is a matter that can be assessed and does not contradict the privatization concept. [SME] Could you clarify the course of the coalition talks about the possibility of appointing Juraj Plesnik as state secretary at the Ministry of Privatization? [Moravcik] The Coalition Council has not discussed this issue. [SME] Has it been discussed at the level of the coalition parties' chairmen? [Moravcik] The party chairmen discussed the course of privatization in light of the government statement. [SME] We asked about the assessment of personnel issues. What arguments were put forward at the level of party chairmen? Was the possibility of appointing Viliam Vaskovic, deputy chairman of your party [Democratic Union], as minister of privatization raised? [Moravcik] So far we have not reached the conclusion that there is a need for a change in the post of minister of privatization. That is what matters. [SME] But the SDL deputies took concerted action when raising objections to Milan Janicina in the Privatization Committee of the National Council of the Slovak Republic on 22 June.... [Moravcik] As far as personnel issues are concerned, there must be agreement from all coalition parties [before any appointments or dismissals are made]. [SME] In other words, there will be a compromise in that Juraj Plesnik will become state secretary and the rest of the coalition will not raise the issue of the minister of economy, of whom it is generally rumored that his screening certificate is not quite in order and who has not submitted to the public a negative screening certificate to dispel those rumors.... [Moravcik] I cannot act on the basis of general rumors. That would be against the law. The replacement of [Economy Minister] Mr. Magvasi is out of the question and has never been considered. We have no legal or other reason to establish a link between those matters. [SME] Did you, at the meeting of chairmen of coalition parties, consider Mr. Vaskovic as a possible minister of privatization? Is our information correct? [Moravcik] Because there is no consensus that any member of the government should be replaced, I cannot confirm this. [SME] Has this name been mentioned as that of a possible candidate? [Moravcik] I do not consider this relevant. [SME] The opposition makes no secret of the fact that it will once again raise the issue of Minister Janicina and will try to have him recalled from his post. Do you believe that the SDL will unequivocally confirm his remaining in his post? [Moravcik] You have to ask the SDL. I do not see any reason that this issue should be raised.
