It examined the issue of safe storage of weapons by the republican Armed Forces. As a check shows, more than 400 units of weapons were stolen or lost last year from military regiments. Among the weapons are 148 rifles and automatic machines [as received], 175 revolvers, 46 grenade cup dischargers, and five machine-guns. A certain quantity of them have been returned. But still a large number of weapons are owned by criminals. Criminal cases have been initiated on all these facts. The participants of the meeting strengthened the need for specifying a circle of people in the Armed Forces who will be held responsible for military arsenals. The session also discussed the aggravating criminal situation in Dzhambul Oblast. The level of crime solvency continues to worry us. Last year it did not exceed 52 percent. The Chu valley, with its hemp fields, has become a destabilizing factor. It has become a sort of a pilgrimage for drug addicts practically from all over the CIS. The session adopted recommendations aimed at radical improvement of the law enforcement bodies activities. It was decided to examine the issue of their realization over a period of four months.
