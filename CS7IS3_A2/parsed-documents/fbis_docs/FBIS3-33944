Hammudi, who is also a member of the Iraqi Ba'th Party's Foreign Relations Committee, described Clinton's message as one of blackmail. This is the first Iraqi official reaction to Clinton's message to Congress in which he expressed his fears that the Iraqi authorities might rebuild Iraq's mass destruction arsenal. Clinton demanded a long period of monitoring on Iraq's military establishments before any reduction of the sanctions is effected.
