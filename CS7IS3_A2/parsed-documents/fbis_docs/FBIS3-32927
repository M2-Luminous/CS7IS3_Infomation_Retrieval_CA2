The chief of the Guatemalan Armed Forces (FAG) said in a news conference that, if an investigation is conducted on events that occurred throughout the armed conflict which lasted three decades, this would increase "social polarization" and divide society. The Army cannot accept that option "because it would not seek conciliation, nor would it be fair, because no sanctions would be imposed on guerrilla fighters involved in human rights violations," Enriquez added. He recalled that countries such as El Salvador and Argentina, where civilian groups sponsored the creation of Truth Commissions, are now paying a high cost. "People are being killed in the former even though the whole truth was not learned," he said. The Mutual Support Group (GAM), made up of relatives of missing persons, said on Tuesday the most repressed groups in our society have the right to demand the creation of that commission. The GAM issued a communique stating this is a demand from 45,000 families whose loved ones were violently taken away. The communique said no Guatemalan should question the creation of a Truth Commission by arguing that no one is "free of sin" to demand an end to impunity and injustice. Relatives of Guatemalan Detainees and Missing Persons (Famdegua) rejected the National Congress' intentions of sponsoring an amnesty decree because "it would favor impunity and protect criminals and corrupt persons." Guatemalan legislators insisted on the need to establish a pardon for the perpetration of common political crimes. According to Famdegua, two amnesty bills were sponsored in June -- shortly before President Ramiro de Leon Carpio was sworn in -- to prevent the enforcement of justice against former President Jorge Serrano. The former president, who sought asylum in Panama, tried to dissolve Congress and the Supreme Court of Justice on 25 May 1993. Another decree would favor members and collaborators of subversive factions, and all those who had participated in acts of repression or persecution. In October Congress tried to modify Article 183 (Paragraph U), which authorizes the president of the Republic to "commute a death sentence for the next highest sentence, and to grant a pardon in connection with common political crimes and related crimes." According to Famdegua, it is evident that pressure is being exerted by groups which, "like the Army," are involved in human rights violations, to decree an amnesty that would also favor politicians and former officials. To establish an amnesty would be tantamount to leaving "black pages of an authoritarian, terrorist, and corrupt era" unpunished and shelved, it was added by the organization, which struggles for the return of 45,000 persons.
