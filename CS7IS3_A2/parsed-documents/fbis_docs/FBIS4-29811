FBIS4-29811 "dreas120_j_94005" FBIS-EAS-94-120 Daily Report 21 Jun 1994 Indonesia Details Reported Details Reported BK2106155794 Hong Kong AFP in English 1205 GMT 21 Jun 94 BK2106155794 Hong Kong AFP English BFN [Text] Jakarta, June 21 (AFP) -- The Indonesian Government on Tuesday banned three weekly publications, including the country's biggest-selling magazine, shortly after they had run articles sharply critical of a close associate of President Suharto. The director-general of the ministry of information, Subrata, told a press conference that the authorities were withdrawing the publishing licences of TEMPO, EDITOR and DETIK. Subrata, who is in charge of press and the graphic industries, accused them of flouting official "warnings." He said there were administrative reasons for barring EDITOR and DETIK, while in the case of TEMPO, the licence was withdrawn because of editorial content. All three publications had recently published articles attacking the research and technology minister, Bacharuddin Jusuf Habibie, a close ally of Indonesian President Suharto. The last magazine to be banned was MONITOR in 1990, for having published a popularity survey that placed the Prophet Muhammad in 11th place, a rank that outraged many Indonesian Muslims. TEMPO, the country's largest-circulation magazine, as well as the newer DETIK, a tabloid newspaper, had recently reported on a rift between Habibie on one hand and the armed forces and Finance Ministry on the other, over the purchase of 39 former East German warships. On June 2, EDITOR had published a front-page piece on plans to set up a group establishing former members of the student nationalist movement in the 1960s, which would have rivalled Habibie's Association of Muslim Intellectuals. It quoted another government member, Siswono Yudohusodo, a former student leader who is now minister of transmigration, as saying Habibie's group was guilty of "manoevering." The minister of transmigration has responsibility for internal population movement in Indonesia, from crowded to remote areas. TEMPO, a news magazine launched in the 1970s, has a circulation of 180,000, while EDITOR, also a news magazine, founded in 1987 has 30,000. DETIK was launched in 1992, using a defunct title, and has a sale of 400,000. Subrata said DETIK had diverged from the remit of its publishing licence, which restricted it to reporting on crime and social stories. Its reporting on political matters amounted to a violation of these parameters, he said. A DETIK journalist, reached by telephone, said that this was merely a technical pretext to bar the publications. In the case of EDITOR, the publisher did not exercise full editorial control over the magazine, which was also an administrative violation, he said. In the case of TEMPO, he said, without elaborating, that the ban was because of editorial content. President Suharto had already threatened, at a naval review on June 9, to take action against newspapers that targeted Habibie. He accused the media of having generated "an atmosphere of suspicion that harms stability" and declared: "We cannot let (the press) carry on like this. If they are deaf to warnings, then we will take steps against them." Indonesia's biggest daily seller, KOMPAS, reported on June 13 that Information Minister Harmoko -- another close friend of Suharto's and president of the official party, Golkar -- had drawn up "severe measures" against what was considered to be a media campaign against Habibie. The official news agency ANTARA reported Tuesday that Harmoko complained last week that "several publications ... have been failing to uphold journalistic ethics."
