The results of the 1993 survey came just two days after Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton met in Washington but failed to find a breakthrough in stalled "framework" trade talks over a U.S. demand for setting "numerical targets" to assess the openness of Japan's markets. The survey found 76.3 percent of respondents said they feel emotionally attached to the U.S., up 2.6 percentage points from a similar study two years ago. The Prime Minister's Office conducted the nationwide survey from last September through October covering 3,000 people aged 20 years or older, of which 2,134 or 71.1 percent responded. The poll has been taken annually since 1977. An official of the government office attributed the slight rise in the figure to Clinton's pursuit of "change" in his nation and his fresh image, characteristics shared by Hosokawa. The report also showed 68.6 percent see Japan-U.S. relations as favorable, up 6.1 points. On the bilateral trade dispute, those believing the recent tough U.S. trade stance against Japan is understandable grew 6.3 points to 36.8 percent. In contrast, those who believe Washington has been acting emotionally on the trade row with Tokyo amounted to 35.2 percent, down 7.2 points, according to the study. The latest report said those feeling emotionally attached to Russia dropped 4.2 points to 11.0 percent, while those who do not feel close to Russia increased 5.2 points to 84.8 percent. The survey also found that people's feelings of closeness to two major neighbors -- China and South Korea -- remained almost static. On the other hand, those citing Asia as the region to which Tokyo should most channel its economic assistance leaped 4.9 points to 54.5 percent, according to the report. The study also revealed that 43.8 percent of the respondents believe Japan, as a member of the region, should promote economic cooperation with Asia-Pacific countries. Those saying the current level of assistance to developing nations is sufficient, however, inched up 0.5 point to 45.6 percent, while those seeking more active cooperation fell 2.6 points to 32.6 percent. People seeing no need for such aid rose 0.9 point to 12.1 percent. The official of the Prime Minister's Office said the languishing economy was a major factor for the increasingly tight-fisted sentiment in Japan. The report found 45.7 percent believe Japan should internationalize itself to fulfill its duty as a major global power, compared with the 44.1 percent posted in the last survey. In response to a newly introduced question on which area Japan should internationalize itself most, 25.3 percent said the nation needs to pursue a greater political role -- through the expansion of its participation in the United Nations and disarmament efforts. Concerning Japan's role in the international community, 48.4 percent responded their country should contribute to resolving global problems such as environmental conservation. Some 28.8 percent pointed to the need for personnel contribution and participation in U.N. peacekeeping activities, while 21.0 percent said economic assistance to developing nations is most needed.
