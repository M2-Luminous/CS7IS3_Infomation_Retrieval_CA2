FR940414-2-00171 FR940414-2-00092 4. Duties of the Committee The duties of the Advisory Committee are solely advisory and shall be as follows: a. The Advisory Committee shall develop recommendations concerning the most cost-effective manner in which to return greenhouse gas emissions from personal motor vehicles to their 1990 levels by the years 2005, 2015 and 2025 (and then to stabilize or continue to reduce such emissions). In developing its recommendations, the Advisory Committee shall consider a wide range of policy alternatives, including policies affecting: (i) Demand for personal vehicle travel; (ii) vehicle and fuel technology changes (including increases in vehicle and fuel system operating efficiency); and (iii) shifts in consumer choice among vehicle and fuel technology options. Policies to be considered will focus on those that can be implemented by the federal government, but such policies will be considered in the context of what can and should be accomplished at the state, local and regional levels, and by private parties, both consumers and producers. b. In developing recommendations, the Committee shall consider the speed, reliability, sustainability and efficiency of greenhouse gas reductions; the potential impact of options on urban air pollution and on safety; the cost of alternative policies affecting this sector (including their impact on consumers, jobs, mobility and competitiveness); improvements in energy security; and the feasibility of adoption and ease of implementation. c. The Advisory Committee may recommend analyses and studies to be undertaken by agencies of the federal government to support the deliberations of the Advisory Committee. d. The Advisory Committee may carry out such additional functions as the steering committee may from time to time request. 5.
