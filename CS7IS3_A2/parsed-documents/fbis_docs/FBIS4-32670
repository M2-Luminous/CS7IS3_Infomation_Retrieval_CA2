The Bosnian Serbs now control 70 percent of the territory of the former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina while according to land registration documents they owned 64 percent of the republican territory before the war. Under the international plan, the Bosnian Serb Republic is to get 49 percent of the Bosnian territory and the Moslem-Croat Federation 51 percent. If the international community does not want peace, it will again, like on earlier occasions, offer unacceptable maps and humiliating conditions to the Serb victorious army, knowing that the Serbs will reject such a plan, Karadzic said at a ceremony in a Bileca army barracks marking the day of the Bosnian Serb army. "If the maps are in any way acceptable, we will have them for the love of our brothers in Serbia and Montenegro, but only under the condition that the sanctions be lifted, which will have to be included in the peace document," Karadzic said in the eastern Herzegovina town Bileca. In May 1992, the United Nations imposed tough economic and political sanctions on Yugoslavia because of alleged involvement in the civil war in the territory of the former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. If the international "Contact Group" for Bosnia comes with unacceptable maps, Serbia and Montenegro will not insist that we accept them, Karadzic said and added that, like in earlier occasions, they would stand firmly by the Bosnian Serbs. The general staff commander of the Bosnian Serb army, Colonel-General Ratko Mladic said the Serbs "want peace with all their hearts but not any peace and not at any cost." The Serbs want "honourable and digified peace respecting the results of our struggles over the centuries and in this latest war, our victories and our past and present rights."
