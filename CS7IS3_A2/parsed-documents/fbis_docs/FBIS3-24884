In a statement issued in Monrovia, the government said a meeting of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) was "necessary to review the implementation of the most critical phase of the peace process - the commencement of disarmament and the seating of the transitional government". The disarming process initially due to start in August was postponed and has still not begun despite the arrival of 364 UN military observers and 1,600 Tanzanian and Ugandan soldiers sent to reinforce the Nigerian-led ECOMOG [ECOWAS Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] peace force. Under an agreement signed on July 25 last year between the various Liberian factions, the ECOMOG force mandated by ECOWAS will be responsible for disarming the belligerents under UN supervision. Sierra Leone and Ghana have already called for an ECOWAS meeting to discuss Liberia. On Tuesday Sierra Leonean Foreign Minister Abass Bundu criticised the "slow pace of the disarmament process".
