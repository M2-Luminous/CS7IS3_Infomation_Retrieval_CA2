The statement followed a report, "Russia: dust heap of Western waste", which was issued by the Greenpeace organization late in 1993. The report impelled some media to similar publications. According to the report, 96 attempts have been made in the last six years to supply to Russia 34 million tons of waste. The statement notes that the cited data testifies only to intentions and is not an accomplished fact really threatening Russia's ecological security. According to the Russian Ministry of Environmental Protection, local environmental protection bodies have rejected the overwhelming majority of Western proposals following expert conclusions.
