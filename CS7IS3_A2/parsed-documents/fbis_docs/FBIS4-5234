SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama met reporters shortly after Hosokawa announced he would step down. The SDP differs from Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], another powerful party in the coalition, over major policies including defense and tax. However, asked what the SDP would do if Shinseito leader Tsutomu Hata, foreign minister, is named as new premier, Murayama said that if the coalition parties' representatives agree, "we will cooperate with the agreement." A meeting of representatives is currently under way. Asked whether the SDP would object to a prime minister from Shinseito, Murayama said the most important thing now is to form a government that can deal with the nation's domestic and foreign problems. "An agreement will not be made if each party sticks to its own opinion," he said. Murayama also said the coalition government should not change its current seven-party structure. Hajime Funada, a senior Shinseito member and former Economic Planning Agency chief, said the party would push for Hata as the next premier. Funada also said there may be some regrouping in the ruling coalition, apparently referring to rumors that former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe, a member of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party, may join the cabinet.
