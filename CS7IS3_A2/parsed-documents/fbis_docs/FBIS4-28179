FBIS4-28179 "dreas110_c_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-110 Daily Report 7 Jun 1994 North Korea `Special' Inspections Never Allowed `Special' Inspections Never Allowed OW0706141294 Tokyo KYODO in English 1356 GMT 7 Jun 94 OW0706141294 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Vienna, June 7 KYODO -- North Korea will "never" allow special international inspections of its two undeclared nuclear facilities suspected to be part of a secret nuclear arms development program, a North Korean diplomat said Tuesday [7 June]. Yun Ho-chin, North Korean delegate to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna, criticized a recent IAEA report which said Pyongyang has made it impossible to determine whether plutonium has been diverted for nuclear weapons. Yun, meeting reporters at the IAEA headquarters, said the nuclear watchdog can carry out satisfactory inspections by checking fuel rods removed from a 5-megawatt reactor in the Yongbyon nuclear complex 90 kilometers north of Pyongyang. His remarks came at a time when an IAEA Board of Governors meeting was in session and likely to demand that North Korea accept inspections of the two sites as a possible alternative means of finding out if it has been developing nuclear arms. Meanwhile, North Korea sent a letter to the IAEA on Monday, suggesting it may withdraw from the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty if the U.N. agency continues putting pressure on Pyongyang over the issue. North Korea had rejected the IAEA's demands to stop removing fuel rods from the reactor, which the nuclear watchdog said would spoil chances to determine if plutonium had been secretly taken from the rods to manufacture nuclear weapons.
