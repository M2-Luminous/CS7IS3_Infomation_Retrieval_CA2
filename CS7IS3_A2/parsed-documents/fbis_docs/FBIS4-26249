Zhuhai authorities said the demolition was to prevent further accidents. The official death toll from the collapse rose to 38 when another 14 bodies were plucked from the three-storey debris. The number of injured in Zhuhai's worst industrial accident stood at "more than 160". A government spokesman said the rescue would continue but was getting more difficult". Fire swept through the Yu Xin Textile Factory in Qianshan on Thursday and the front half of the building caved in the following day after torrential rain. Two hundred workers were inside, having been ordered back by their joint venture Hong Kong bosses to retrieve the cotton stock. After nearly four days of digging, Zhuhai authorities decided yesterday to use explosives to demolish the remaining half, fearing it could collapse. The explosion was set off at 5.20 pm, 75 hours after workers were buried. The walls cracked and the building folded in the centre and disappeared in a cloud of dust. Public Security Bureau officers and the People's Liberation Army sealed off a 500-metre area and city authorities declared a news blackout on the operation. A group of 20 Hong Kong and Macao journalists and photographers hid behind bushes about 300 metres from the scene for more than two hours, but were discovered by a soldier and expelled minutes before the explosion. Their film was confiscated. Hong Kong unionists last night criticised the authorities for ending hopes of survivors. Winnie Tam Pik-yan, executive secretary of the 130,000-strong Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions, said: "My God, how come the Government did that? How about those still trapped?" "There may be people waiting for help. Although the chance of their survival gets smaller as time goes by, no one can deny them the chance." The Government should have waited at least a week before blowing up the part of the factory still standing, she said. Zhuhai officials said the explosion was "directional" and would not affect the rubble where the missing workers were. An official said bulldozers and heavy machinery would be brought in today to remove debris. Earlier, Zhuhai Municipal Government spokesman Yang Shuisheng said "about 20" workers were missing, but the chances of anyone being alive were slim. The Government allowed relatives of the dead mainly migrant workers from rural areas -- to identify remains at the crematorium. Fourteen bodies were identified. Most of the relatives were angry that the management had sent workers back into the damaged factory. Some shouted abuse and gestured at management staff. Relatives discussed compensation with the management but no announcement was made.
