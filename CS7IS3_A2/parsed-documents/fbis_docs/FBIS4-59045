The bureau would be manned 24 hours a day to try to settle problems as they arose under autonomy, the official told AFP. The HQ overlooks Ganei Tal, a settlement in the main Jewish area of occupation which surrounds the Palestinian town of Khan Yunis. The Army shifted there from Gaza City to facilitate their mission to protect Israeli settlers. Meanwhile, Israeli military administration officials at Khan Yunis and Rafah called in local Palestinian dignitaries for a farewell ceremony on Monday. The PLO official said the new police force would soon take over the buildings. About 300 policemen were to cross into the newly-autonomous strip at the Rafah border with Egypt later Monday, Palestinian and Israeli officials said. PLO leaders on the strip earlier met senior Palestinian employees of the administration to prepare the transfer of civilian authority. Palestinian officials said the meeting at the PLO's temporary police headquarters in Gaza City covered the range of civilian affairs, from identity cards to telephones, health, education and employment. No date has been set for the Israelis to hand over to the Palestinians responsibility for running their daily lives, but the officials said it would take place gradually over the coming days.
