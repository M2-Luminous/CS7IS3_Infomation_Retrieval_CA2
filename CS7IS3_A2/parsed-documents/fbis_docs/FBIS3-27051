Present at the conference were municipal leaders, including Gao Dezhan, Zhang Lichang, Li Jianguo, Li Shenglin, Liu Jinfeng, Yang Zhihua, Song Pingshun, Zheng Zhiying, Zhang Baifeng, Zhang Dequan, and Zhang Guanwen. Gao Dezhan, secretary of the municipal party committee, fully affirmed the municipality's judicial, procuratorial, and court work in his speech. He also extended cordial regards and heartfelt thanks to the vast number of cadres and policemen, the armed police officers and men, and all comrades who have diligently been working on the municipal judicial, procuratorial, and court fronts. He pointed out: 1994 is a key year to accelerate the municipality's reform, opening up, and modernization. Therefore, grasping favorable opportunities to quicken the pace of reform, opening up, and economic development is the major tasks of this year. There must be a stable social environment in order to quicken the pace of development. It is of peculiar importance and urgency to safeguard social and political stability under the new situation. So, we must put the safeguarding of stability in an extremely important position. The more we accelerate reform, opening up, and economic development, the more we should strengthen judicial, procuratorial, and court work and try every possible means to safeguard political and social stability. The party and government leading cadres at various levels should persist in the principle of "taking a two-hand approach and being sure that both hands are tough"; accurately handle the relationship among reform, development, and stability; conscientiously analyze various unstable factors at the time of grasping favorable opportunities to speed up the pace of development; adopt effective measures to safeguard social and political stability; and ensure the smooth progress of reform, opening up, and economic construction. Gao Dezhan urged: The judicial, procuratorial, and court fronts should conscientiously do their duties and go all out to ensure the municipality's political and social stability. We should realistically expand the extent of sternly dealing blows to serious criminal activities and strictly and rapidly punish serious criminal offenders according to the law. We should persistently and ceaselessly wage the struggle for "wiping out pornography" and "eliminating six evils" and resolutely uproot various kinds of social evil phenomena. We should conscientiously study and accurately handle the contradictions among the people themselves in the new situation and enhance our foresight to do our work. We should actively engage ourselves in the anticorruption struggle and concentrate energy on investigating and handling major and appalling cases. We should strengthen the construction of the legal system and strengthen and improve judicial work, the enforcement of administrative laws, and supervision over the enforcement of laws. Persistently in the light of the principle on linking special work with the mass line, we should mobilize social forces, conscientiously fulfill our responsibilities, and exert great efforts to comprehensively improve social order. We should firmly foster the thinking of relying on the masses to safeguard social and political stability, further extensively disseminate and mobilize the masses, truly rely on the masses, do more good and concrete deeds for the people, and really enjoy the support of the people. Strictly in line with the principle that "whoever takes charge should assume responsibility," each level should attend to and guide the work of each lower level and assume responsibility for the fulfillment of the work of each lower level. Gao Dezhan stressed: The party committees and governments at various levels should pay attention to the judicial, procuratorial, and court work and realistically strengthen and improve the party's leadership over judicial, procuratorial, and court work. We should support and guide the judicial, procuratorial, and court departments to persist in the basic line of the party; eliminate their obstacles and interference; strictly enforce laws; suit the new situation of setting up the socialist market economic system; strengthen investigations and study on judicial, procuratorial, and court work; forcefully give instructions according to principles and policies; and elevate the municipality's judicial, procuratorial, and court work to a new height. It is necessary to realistically strengthen the construction of the judicial, procuratorial, and court workers contingents; fill the entire cadres and policemen's brains with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics; and upgrade their awareness of firmly implementing the basic line of the party. We should achieve training in a well- organized and well-planned manner so as to upgrade the broad masses of cadres and policemen's political integrity and professional ability. We should strictly conduct education, establish strict demands, strictly strengthen management, further strengthen the improvement of administrative honesty, and educate cadres and policemen to be the first in diligently and honestly performing official duties. The leading bodies of the judicial, procuratorial, and court departments at various levels should realistically attend to their self-construction and actually have perfect political integrity, perfect work style, and perfect work performances. Song Pingshun, standing committee member of the municipality, vice mayor of the municipality, and secretary of the committee for political science and law under the municipal party committee, arranged the municipality's judicial, procuratorial, and court work. He said: We should adopt effective measures to safeguard the municipality's political and social stability, timely alleviate various contradictions and disputes, and eliminate unstable factors. It is necessary to achieve the struggle for dealing strict blows to serious criminal offenders and to upgrade the prestige and quality of the struggle. We should strictly attack various kinds of serious criminal activities and continue to especially wage the struggle against thefts so as to continuously keep the social order stable. We should resolutely and strictly punish, according to the law, serious economic criminal activities, carefully organize and concentrate forces to prominently investigate and handle major and appalling cases, deepen the struggle against corruption, and safeguard the socialist market economic order. We should deepen the overall improvement of social order, conscientiously implement the system that leaders bear the responsibility for safeguarding social order, enable the party and government leaders at various levels to enhance the sense of responsibility for ensuring that the localities to which they belong should be safe and sound, enable the broad masses of the people to participate in the improvement of social order, actually form a pattern of making concerted efforts to improve social order, organize all social forces to make key improvements and solve prominent problems relating to social order, exert great efforts to improve the social order of rural areas, implement various measures for comprehensively improving social order, make better use of legal means to timely and legally regulate various economic and social relations, and ensure that the socialist market economy is smoothly operating on the orbit of the legal system. We should focus on opposing corruption and advocating administrative honesty to achieve the construction of the judicial, procuratorial, and court workers contingents; and provide a forceful organizational guarantee for achieving judicial, procuratorial, and court work in the new situation. Responsible comrades of the municipal security bureau, the municipal people's procuratorate, the municipal higher people's court, and the municipal judicial bureau respectively made speeches on achieving 1994 judicial, procuratorial, and court work tasks.
