Zvjezdan Pesic, 31, was one of the pilots of the downed planes. His family in Podgorica was informed about this tragic event by the information service of the Yugoslav Army. According to the newly established independent Montenegrin news agency, MONTENA, Pesic's family has been living in Podgorica since last summer. They came here as refugees from Mostar. Pilot Zvjezdan Pesic was taken to the so-called Serb Republic in the course of a recent forceful mobilization. His death has been talked about in Podgorica since last night and many presume that some of the downed Jastreb planes had taken off from Podgorica airport.
