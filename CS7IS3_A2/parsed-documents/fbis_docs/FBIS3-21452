Vinayak: "Larger Role for Private Sector in Mining"] [Text] The Centre's new mineral policy envisages a larger role for the private sector in areas hitherto reserved for the public sector. Among the minerals dereserved are: copper, zinc-lead ores, molybdenum, gypsum, tungsten and others, but coal, lignite and atomic minerals are still retained in the list for the public sector. The new policy favours induction of foreign technology and participation in mineral exploration and mining for high-value and scarce minerals. Foreign equity investment in joint ventures in mining, promoted by Indian companies, will be encouraged. While foreign investment in equity will normally be limited to 50 per cent, this limitation will not apply to captive mines of any mineral processing industry. Enhanced equity holding can also be considered on a case-to-case basis, says the official statement. In respect of joint venture mining projects for minerals and metals in which the country is deficient or does not have an exportable surplus, a stipulated share of production will have to be made available to meet the needs of the domestic market before exports from such projects are allowed. The country has vast mineral resources, but mining small deposits scattered all over the country poses problems for big public sector ventures. The private sector can tap this market with modest investments and short lead times. Mining, being labour-intensive, can open up job opportunities in backward areas. Efforts will be made to promote small scale mining in a scientific and efficient manner while safeguarding vital environmental and ecological imperatives, says the official statement. The management of mineral resources has, therefore, to be closely integrated with the overall strategy of development; and exploitation of minerals is to be guided by long-term national goals and perspectives. It is against this backdrop, the Government has felt the need to spell out the features of its new policy, the statement said. But the delay in the amendment of the Mines and Minerals (Regulation and Development) Act 1957 has created some confusion in the field. Admittedly, the country is not endowed with rich resources of high grade ores in strategic areas except bauxite and iron ore. This underlines the need for adopting scientific mining, together with beneficiation processes for economic utilisation of the available mineral resources. Mineral economists however agree that progress in this direction over the the past three decades has been rather tardy except in some sectors. Focus on future needs At the same time, the Government has to keep in view the future needs of defence and development and try to ensure indigenous availability of basic and strategic minerals to avoid disruption of supplies during emergency. The national mineral policy has also focussed on aspects like sea-bed mining, development of proper inventory, linkage between exploitation of minerals and development of mineral industry, conservation of forest resources and protection of environment. The Centre will consult the States before formulating legal measures for the regulation of mines and the development of mineral resources to ensure basic uniformity in mineral administration and development of the industry in tune with the national policy aims. The new policy aims at exploring mineral wealth in the land and in the off-shore areas; developing mineral resources taking into account the national and strategic considerations and ensuring their adequate supply and best use keeping in view the present needs and future requirements; and promoting necessary linkages for smooth and uninterrupted development of the mineral industry to meet domestic needs. In the development of the mineral industry the role of the Government, both Central and States, has been spelt out in the 1957 Act. This Act has been amended through an ordinance issued recently to accommodate the reforms envisaged by the Centre in this field. It is time the Government updates the national mineral inventory before it opens up this sector to the private sector, both domestic and foreign. The Geological Survey of India (GSI) will be the principal outfit for geological mapping and regional mineral resources assessment including in its exclusive economic zone. It will continue to be responsible to draw up action-oriented plans in association with other agencies. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Proved and Total Reserves of Five Major Ores and Minerals(in million tonnes) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Proved |Total Reserves | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Bauxite |1,487 |5,863 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Iron ore |10,384 |21,799 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Iron ore magnesite |4,506 |13,732 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Manganese ore |93 |548 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Chrome ore |62 |270 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Copper ore |216 | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Special attention will be given to the development of strategic minerals through systematic investigation of various potential sources of supply. Further, the focus will be on the survey and exploration of minerals in which the country has a poor or just adequate resource base. Ecological problems Environmental problems associated with mining activity, particularly open cast mining, land subsidence in underground mining, deforestation and atmospheric pollution call for appropriate strategy for mitigation of their adverse effects on the eco-system. The new policy says that mining operations shall not ordinarily be taken up in identified ecologically fragile and biologically rich areas. Strip mining in forest areas should be avoided in accordance with prescribed norms and established forestry practices shall form an integral part of mine development strategy. The research and development (R&D) activities will focus on the entire gamut of activities from geological survey, exploration, mining, beneficiation and extraction of minerals to development of materials. The new policy seeks to promote development of new technologies for conversion of existing mineral resources into viable economic resources. Appropriate technologies shall be developed to enable indigenous industries to utilise the available resources and as substitutes for minerals whose reserves are poor. The R&D efforts shall be directed to find new and alternative uses for minerals whose traditional demand is on the wane, says the statement. Indigenous technology has to be upgraded through R & D and adoption of technological innovations from abroad. Research in mining methods shall also receive priority attention. The liberalisation of imports and reduction of customs duty on finished metals like copper, zinc and aluminium, has hit companies like Hindustan [HCL] Copper, Hindustan Zinc [HZL] and National Aluminium. While the Government has dereserved 15 minerals, ilmenite, siliminate and mica have been kept out of this list. Bauxite also does not appear in the deleted list although India ranks fifth among bauxite rich countries in the world. According to Mr. I.G. Jhingran, Secretary to Union Ministry of Mines, liberalisation of the mining policy will help indigenous companies to foster closer ties with mineral-rich Third World countries for joint exploration and development of ore resources. Hindustan Copper could explore the possibility of joining hands with Zambia which has rich copper ore deposits for exploration and tie up imports of the richer grade ores for blending with its low grade material. It has acquired considerable expertise in mining and smelting operations. Similarly, HZL also could go global with its expertise skills to find partners abroad to develop the mineral deposits in Third World countries. HCL is now free to even enter the metal trade. For expanding its Khetri copper smelter capacity from 35,000 tonnes to one lakh tonnes a year, it could source ore imports from Zambia to make its products competitive in the market. These public sector companies are moving from an era of protection to a competitive market and they should tap all avenues to make their operations economically viable. HZL is exploring the scope for setting up a joint venture in Vietnam for developing a gold ore deposit in collaboration with BRGM [Geological and Mineral Research] of France. Mr. A.C. Wadhawan, Chairman, HZL, says some Australian companies have evinced interest in exploration activities for base metal ores, including gold, in India. The finds in Karnataka and other southern States are promising for further evaluation and assessment. These projects for transition need long gestation period. If, meanwhile, LME zinc prices continue to drop, HZL may find itself in an unenviable position as the Government is unlikely to give it any budgetary support to weather the storm. The Mineral Exploration Corporation Ltd., with special skills in exploration activities, is facing a bleak future as it may run out of business if foreign mining companies enter the field. It will have to seek foreign collaboration for survival and technology upgradation. Its capacity utilisation has dropped in 1992-93 as the public sector mining companies are starved of funds. Even the GSI is now being asked to gear up to become market-oriented and try to earn its keep, at least partly. It now remains to be seen how the mining reforms will help the development of this core industry and whether it will lure foreign investment for the industry's rapid development.
