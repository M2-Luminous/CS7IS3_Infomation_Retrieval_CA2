It was important and worthwhile to meet today with the President and his team to know and appreciate what we have known for a long time: The friendship and trust between our two countries are profound and are as good -- if not better -- than they have ever been. We could not ask for more. For this, Mr. President, please accept our gratitude. It is good to know that a great nation, blessed with values and democracy, stands with us for the greatest battle still to come -- the battle for peace. Mr. President, a few months ago I stood here with you and many others at an historic occasion. We arrived at the beginning of the end of the bloody struggle that has lasted for 100 years. It was clear from the beginning that in spite of the goodwill on all sides, it would be difficult to bridge in days or in months differences in positions, perceptions, points of view, and hatred that have devastated and grown over so many decades. But we shall overcome these difficulties and reach the day of peace. We shall remain determined in our goal. In our talks today I told you, Mr. President, that in my view we were near the finish line of the talks with the Palestinians on the first stage of the Gaza-Jericho First. Some problems and details have yet to be solved. I am sure that we shall find the right solution once the negotiations are renewed. We will not let the extremists derail the peace process. On behalf of the State of Israel, I condemn the terrible terms of the killing in Hebron. I repeated this today in our conversation. Since that time, the Government of Israel has taken tough measures that are unprecedented in Israel. We will implement them with determination. But, Mr. President, we are also victims of terror -- whether organized or spontaneous. Our women and children have lived in the shadow of terror for decades. Not a week passes that we don't have to bury our dead. And if only for this reason, we don't think it appropriate to raise new demands after every terrorist attack. Security is a two-way street. Real leadership must rise above the realities of the day, even if they are painful and bloody, in order to arrive at our strategic goal. Peace is not a tactical option but a strategic objective which takes precedence over everything else. With you, Mr. President, I call on Chairman 'Arafat of the PLO to resume talks immediately and act like me: to fight terror as if there were no negotiations and conduct the negotiation as if there was no terror. We have to complete the negotiations so that in the spring or early summer hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza and Jericho will at last be able to conduct their own affairs. We don't seek to rule them any more. Mr. President, there is no time to waste. We feel that the window of opportunity that opened after the Gulf War is narrower than we thought. Time is running out. Therefore, 1994 has to be the year of great decisions in the peace process. In this framework, we spoke of the options that can be presented to President al-Asad in order to achieve peace with Syria. I hope that President al-Asad will respond appropriately, and we shall be able to sign a peace treaty by the end of this year. President al-Asad said that Syria had made a strategic choice for peace with Israel. That was encouraging. Peace with Syria has always been our strategic choice. We recognize the importance of Syria to a comprehensive peace in the area. We are ready to negotiate peace with Syria that takes account of our mutual needs and interests. There must be give and take on both sides. We know that as we engage in serious and authoritative negotiations, the point will come where painful decisions will have to be made. The promise of peace and its genuine benefits for all Israelis justifies making such decisions vis-a-vis Syria. We will not compromise on our security, but we will stand ready to do what is required of us if the Syrians are ready to do what is required of them. At the same time, we would like to promote and advance the negotiations with Jordan, as well as with Lebanon. We are hopeful that with them, too, treaties of peace can be achieved this year. All of us know that time for the Arab boycott of Israel -- a remnant of a period of hate and rejection -- should be lifted. Mr. President, prime ministers of Israel had come in the past with impressive shopping lists. On my list today I have one item alone: the pursuit of peace. As Passover -- our feast of freedom -- is approaching, let me take the opportunity to remind all of us of the fate of the Israeli soldiers missing in action and prisoners of war. I would like to thank the President for the United States' support in this regard and express the hope that Passover will also be a time of redemption for them. Mr. President, thank you very much. [Unidentified correspondent] Prime Minister, you said that security is a two-way street. What do you plan to do to wipe out the acknowledged double standard in the treatment of the Palestinians, and also, if you are willing to make peace with Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan, now why don't you make the quantum leap and go for permanent negotiations on peace with Palestinians, instead of the step-by-step, very slow struggle of the peace process that means more strife? [Rabin] First, about the second question. You have to refer to the letter of invitation to the Madrid peace conference. This letter of invitation served as the basis agreed on by all the parties that were invited to the Madrid peace conference and the negotiations that followed this conference. What was written there? That the purpose of the negotiations with the three neighboring Arab countries beyond Egypt would be to achieve peace treaties, and with the Palestinians to move by two phases. Phase number one: Something that was never offered to the Palestinians in the past, not by Jordan when Jordan was in occupation of the West Bank, not by Egypt when Egypt was in occupation of the Gaza Strip. We offered them self-rule, to run their own affairs, to have a Palestinian council, self-governing authority, as an interim agreement. What was agreed in signing between the PLO and us? In the Declaration of Principles [DOP] that was signed on the lawn of the White House we divided the phases by agreement to Gaza-Jericho First, then to create the overall arrangement, and not later than two years after the completion of the implementation of Gaza-Jericho First to start negotiating a permanent solution. I believe that sometimes what might look the shortest way is the longest and the one that will not lead to a change in the realities. Therefore, we are committed to the letter of invitation to the Madrid peace conference; we are committed to the Declaration of Principles that were signed here between the PLO and Israel; we are committed to the Cairo agreement that was reached between the PLO and Israel, and I believe, to be committed to agreements that were reached is a basic precondition for the efforts to reach more agreements in the past. [as heard] Second, you talked about different situations. Let's face it, most of the terror attacks are aimed against Israelis. We, the Government of Israel, in accordance to the international law, are the sovereign to military government of the territories. It's our responsibility for the safety, the welfare of all the residents, Jews and Palestinians alike. This government, as a result of the terrible tragedy that took place in Hebron, has taken measures that are unprecedented in Israel vis-a-vis those who violate the law, but we are a lawful country. I can give you an example. I use my responsibility as a minister of defense: orders for administrative detention of two Israeli residents, not [from] the territories, but in accordance to our laws, they had to be approved by a president of a district court. I ordered administrative detention for three months. The president of the district court reduced it to six days. I cannot violate verdicts of the court. Whatever the government does comes under the supervision and decision of our courts. I believe that many people in Israel believe that [what] we have done almost encroaching the line of the law, but we are determined to do within the law whatever is needed to fight terrorist from whatever direction it will come. [Unidentified Israeli reporter] The two most sensitive issues, Jerusalem and settlements, are now de facto on the table. Do you agree that they should wait until the final stage, or should you tackle them right now? I am asking both of you, Mr. President and Mr. Prime minister. [passage omitted] [Rabin] My answer is basically simple. We signed here in Washington the Declaration of Principles. It is written very clearly there that issues that have to be settled once we'll negotiate a permanent solution will not be dealt with now, and it is written very clearly, as examples for this kind of issues: Jerusalem, settlements, borders, refugees, and others. Therefore, by agreement with the PLO, these issues will be dealt with when we'll negotiate a permanent solution. [passage omitted] [Unidentified U.S. correspondent] I am wondering if you could describe what your view is of the concrete measures that you mentioned earlier on in your remarks that should be taken to keep peace in Israel, and whether or not you would support the PLO idea for a police force in Hebron? [passage omitted] [Rabin] Allow me first to make it clear, in the agreement, once it will be reached and signed, there is a building [as heard] -- in the past it was 8,000 to 9,000 men -- the Palestinian police force in Gaza and Jericho. If by now agreement has been reached, by now there would have been 8,000-9,000 Palestinian policemen in Gaza and Jericho. The more negotiations are postponed, the longer it will take them to come. Second, even if there will be some Palestinian police, and there were in the past, at least 900 Palestinian police in the territories were Palestinian residents of the territories in Hebron and in Ramallah and in Nabulus. They resigned because of the intifada. As long as ours is the overall responsibility for the territories under the military government, using our Civil Administration, their presence will not relieve us from our overall responsibility. Therefore, we have to look at it in the context of what is our international and practical responsibility. We, as long as agreement will not be reached that will cover all these areas with the PLO, we will remain internationally responsible to the security of all those who reside there. If there will be or will not be part of any Palestinian police, they have to come under the control of the government there, and the government is the military government of Israel. Therefore, you can't have separate armed groups. There must be one chain of command of those who have to keep and maintain law and order. [passage omitted] [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. President, do you think that Jews should exercise their right to reside in the middle of Arab cities, and Mr. Prime Minister, could you also respond to that? [Rabin] What? [Clinton] What was the question? [Unidentified correspondent] Do you think, should Jews exercise their right to reside in the middle of Arab cities in the West Bank? Should they live in Hebron, for instance? [Rabin] I don't understand the question. [Unidentified correspondent] Well, there were ideas of evacuating Jews from the middle of Hebron, for instance. [Rabin] Again, as part of the DOP that we signed with the PLO, it is said very clearly that the settlements remain there for the interim period. I am not saying it; it is written very clearly in the DOP. Therefore, since it was agreed, I don't see at this stage as a condition for anything even to discuss this issue. [sentence as heard] [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. President, I wonder if you could tell us, and Mr. Prime Minister, the extent to which you have discussed the Jonathan Pollard case again, and how much, if at all, the Ames investigation has interfered with action on it that was presented as imminent several months ago? [passage omitted] [Unidentified correspondent] Could the prime minister answer that? [Rabin] In today's meeting, the issue was not brought up. Thank you.
