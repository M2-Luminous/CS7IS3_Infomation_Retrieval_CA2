Gaishi Hiraiwa, head of Japan's top business lobby, told reporters the government's decision to freeze hikes in public service charges until the end of the year is laudable but added further cost-cutting efforts are needed to forestall future hikes. The government said Wednesday it will suspend until the end of this year a plan to raise public service charges, including public transportation fees, highway tolls and telephone rates.
