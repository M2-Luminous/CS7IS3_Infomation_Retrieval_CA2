Copies of the resolution will be mailed to six offices concerned, including the U.S. ambassador to Japan, the commander-in-chief of the U.S. Armed Forces in Japan, and the coordinator of four branches of services of the U.S. Armed Forces on Okinawa. In the resolution, the town assembly protested the accidental dropping of rescue gears from a U.S. military helicopter, declaring: "Accidents of dropping things by U.S. military aircraft and helicopters are too many to count. Everytime such accidents occurred, we strongly requested relevant organizations of the U.S. Forces to do their utmost to prevent recurrence of such accidents. From this incident ignoring residents' safety, we have no choice but to conclude that the U.S. Forces are still entertaining the occupation troop mentality, and are not serious about enforcing strict discipline." Concerning the crash accident involving FA-18 Hornet fighters, the Chatan Assembly denounced the U.S. Forces, stating: "Each time an incident or accident involving U.S. military bases occurred, the town assembly filed complaints, strongly calling for the U.S. Forces' efforts to prevent such incidents or accidents from recurring. We regret that another accident occurred in spite of this. We cannot accept any more sacrifices and discriminations."
