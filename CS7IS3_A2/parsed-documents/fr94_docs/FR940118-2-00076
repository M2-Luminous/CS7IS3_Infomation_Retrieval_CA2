FR940118-2-00076 FR940118-2-00050 The Department of the Treasury has determined that, if a transaction between a qualified employee benefit plan and its sponsoring employer (or affiliate thereof) results in the plan either paying less or receiving more than fair market value, such excess may be considered to be a contribution by the sponsoring employer to the plan and thus must be examined under the applicable provisions of the Code, including sections 401(a)(4), 404 and 415. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Paul Kelty of the Department, telephone (202) 219&hyph;8883. (This is not a toll-free number.) Linton Industries, Inc.

This proposed exemption is conditioned upon the following requirements: (a) The terms of the New Loan are at least as favorable to the Plan as those obtainable in an arm's-length transaction with an unrelated party; (b) the New Loan will not exceed twenty-five percent of the assets of the Plan at any time during the duration of the New Loan; (c) the New Loan is secured by a first lien interest on certain equipment (the Equipment), which has been appraised by a qualified, independent appraiser to ensure that the fair market value of the Equipment is at least 200 percent of the amount of the New Loan; (d) the fair market value of the Equipment remains at least equal to 200 percent of the outstanding balance of the New Loan throughout the duration of the New Loan; (e) an independent, qualified fiduciary determines on behalf of the Plan that the New Loan is in the best interests of the Plan and protective of the Plan and its participants and beneficiaries; and (f) the independent, qualified fiduciary monitors compliance by the Employer with the terms and conditions of the New Loan and the exemption throughout the duration of the transaction, taking any action necessary to safeguard the Plan's interest, including foreclosure on the Equipment in the event of default. Summary of Facts and Representations 1. The Plan is a defined contribution plan sponsored by the Employer, who is engaged in the business of precision and general metal fabrication. As of December 31, 1992, the Plan had total assets of $1,942,187 and eighteen participants. The trustee of the Plan is Robert Linton, the sole shareholder of the Employer. Mr. Linton has the sole investment discretion with respect to the Plan assets. 2. On January 26, 1988, the Department granted Prohibited Transaction Exemption (PTE) 88&hyph;12 at 53 FR 2103. PTE 88&hyph;12 permitted the Plan to lend $240,000 to the Employer (the Original Loan). The Original Loan, made on March 1, 1988, has a ten year term and carries interest at the rate of one and one-half percentage points over the prime rate of Rainier National Bank of Seattle, Washington. It has been amortized in equal monthly installments of principal and interest. The Original Loan is secured by certain other equipment (the Other Equipment) of the Employer. The Original Loan is being monitored by Sidney J. Starr, CPA (Mr. Starr) of Kirkland, Washington, who is serving on behalf of the Plan as the independent, qualified fiduciary. As of October 1, 1993, the remaining principal balance due under the Original Loan was $136,062. 3. The Employer requests an administrative exemption from the Department to permit the Plan to lend $485,000 to the Employer under the terms and conditions described herein. The Employer represents that a portion of the New Loan proceeds will be used to repay the outstanding balance on the Original Loan. The remaining balance of the New Loan proceeds will be used to finance a portion of the $582,400 purchase price of a new 60 ’ ’ Shear Genius Punching/Shearing Cell (the Cell) manufactured by E.W. Bliss Company. The Cell will be utilized by the Employer in its manufacturing operation. 4. The New Loan will be in the principal amount of $485,000. The applicant states that at no time will the amount of the New Loan represent more than twenty-five percent of the Plan's total assets. The New Loan will be secured by a first lien interest on the Equipment, which consists of two pieces of unencumbered machinery owned by the Employer. UCC&hyph;1 Filing Statements and a Security Agreement will be filed with the Secretary of State of Washington to reflect the Plan's security interest in the Equipment. In addition, the Employer will insure the Equipment against casualty loss and will designate the Plan as the loss payee of such insurance. 5. The New Loan will have a ten year term and will be evidenced by a promissory note (the Note). The Note will require the Employer to make equal monthly installments of principal and interest amortized over the ten year period. Interest will accrue on the New Loan at the rate of one and one-half percentage points above the prime rate of CityBank (CityBank) of Lynnwood, Washington, an unrelated entity. The interest rate will be adjusted quarterly by the Plan's independent fiduciary in accordance with the prime rate offered by CityBank. The Plan will not incur any fees, commission, or other expenses in connection with the New Loan. By letter dated July 12, 1993, the Employer received a loan commitment in the amount of $485,000 from CityBank. The terms offered by CityBank are the same as the terms of the Loan, including the quarterly adjustment of the interest rate to one and one-half percentage points above the prime rate. 6. The Equipment consists of a Finn-Power FMC Line and a Bliss 500 ton press. Based upon appraisals performed by Jim Birdsall and Theodore Egleston (the Appraisals), the total fair market value of the Equipment is $1,228,000, which is in excess of 200 percent of the amount of the New Loan.
