The sources, speaking for the leaders of the political parties, denied issuing a statement attributed to them earlier today. The sources said it is really frightening that some people can go to such lengths, fabricate statements, and falsely attribute actions to political parties that are carrying out their roles and performing their responsibilities with total freedom within our current system of democracy. Several political party leaders have exposed the facts about the "alleged statement". They said that a few lawyers, with well-known sympathies and linked to illegal groups, issued this statement and attributed it to the political parties. The leaders affirmed that the entire statement is a mere calumny that contradicts the facts.
