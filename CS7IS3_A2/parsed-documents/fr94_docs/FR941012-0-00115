FR941012-0-00115 FR941012-0-00011 Second, as OSHA explained in the preamble to the proposed rule, the saw can be at idle rather than shut off, provided that the chain brake is engaged. OSHA is allowing operators to comply by either method because it recognizes that idling the saw with the chain brake engaged is as effective as shutting off the engine in terms of preventing serious lacerations due to coming into contact with the moving chain. Third, OSHA does not think that idling the saw will add a significant amount of time to the operator's retreat. All the operator must do to idle the chain saw and safely carry it is to release pressure on the throttle and grasp the front handle. Fourth, in any event, chain saws are designed to be carried by the front handle rather than by the rear throttle. Carrying the saw by the front handle is easier and there is no risk of the bar tip contacting the operator's leg or toe. Carrying the saw by the rear throttle guard can cause the bar tip to swing downward and possibly strike the operator. Therefore, OSHA believes that the operator should grasp the front handle thereby idling the saw. That way the operator will both protect himself from a falling tree and from saw lacerations without undue difficulty. Paragraph (e)(2)(xiv) of the final rule requires that when the operator must carry the chain saw further than 50 feet that the chain brake be engaged or, if there is no chain brake, that the saw be shut off. This provision also requires that the chain brake be engaged or the saw shut off when carrying a saw for a lesser distance if conditions, such as but not limited to, the terrain, underbrush and slippery surfaces, may create a hazard for an employee. The proposed rule also contained these provisions. The 1978 ANSI logging standard required that chain saws be shut off when carried for a distance greater than from tree to tree. In addition the ANSI standard also required that when the terrain and other physical factors, such as underbrush and slippery surfaces, make the carrying of a running saw for such short distances, the saw shall be shut off for carrying. Some State logging standards also require the chain saw to be shut off or at idle when moving from tree to tree (Ex. 2&hyph;18, 2&hyph;22). For example, the State of Washington logging standard requires that after the chain-saw operator has felled the tree, the saw must be shut off or at idle while moving to another tree (Ex. 2&hyph;22). This standard also requires the chain saw to be shut off when moving to the next tree when hazardous conditions are present. Some commenters supported this provision (Ex. 5&hyph;27, 5&hyph;42, 5&hyph;66). One of these commenter said that their experience had been that a chain-saw operator could carry a chain saw any distance without being injured, provided the chain brake was engaged (Ex. 5&hyph;27). Another commenter supported the provision because carrying a running chain saw any distance promotes additional fatigue that can also contribute to accidents and errors (Ex. 5&hyph;66). The reasoning and explanation for shutting off chain saws before beginning retreat also applies to carrying chain saws for longer distances. According to the WIR survey, 13 percent of all chain-saw operators were injured when they fell on their saws (Ex. 2&hyph;1). OSHA believes this provision is necessary to reduce exposure to the hazard of a running chain-saw chain. Paragraph (f) Machines At paragraph (f) of this final rule, OSHA is promulgating requirements for stationary and mobile machines. These provisions include requirements for machine operation, protective structures, overhead guards, machine access, stability and reliability, exhaust systems and brakes. As previously defined, a machine is a piece of equipment having a self-contained powerplant that is operated off-road and used for the movement of material.
