Within the framework of this union it is necessary to elect a single parliament by way of direct elections, to create a council of defense ministers and a single defence complex, and also an interstate secretariat, which would be appointed by heads of states, Mr. Nazarbayev believes. He stated that the countries, which are in agreement to the principles of a Eurasian union, would enter its composition and mutual relations would be developed with the other countries of the former USSR on a bilateral basis. Nursultan Nazarbayev noted that he discussed this issue during talks with Russia's President Boris Yeltsin. Commenting on this proposal by the Kazakh president, Ukraine's Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko noted: "This is not a new idea for us. It has already been put forward. We have looked and listened to it closely. However, it if is now an official proposal then we should approach it more seriously, study it in detail, define our stance, and make an appraisal. If this is a Eurasian union, then issues of both a political and an economic nature arise as the main factors of future cooperation. Therefore, I am not yet ready to give a final answer. However, I can say that there should be cooperation in the geopolitical space of the former Soviet Union. And this cooperation should naturally be initiated on some kind of an appropriate basis, but without creating such structures that would serve as a supernational body or which would acquire the rights of an international subject. One could cooperate on this basis. Therefore, Nursultan Nazarbayev's proposal (I think that he will make it at the meeting of heads of CIS states on 15 April) needs to be studied in more detail."
