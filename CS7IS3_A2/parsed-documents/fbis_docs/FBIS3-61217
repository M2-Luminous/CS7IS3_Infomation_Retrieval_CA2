BANBER bills itself as the "press organ of Armenia's Christian Democratic Union." It is a compact weekly in four pages and circulation of 5,000 edited by Khachatur Dadayan. [passage omitted] The second page of the said issue features an "Appeal" which is designed to impress in the reader's mind the unique nature of the weekly for a long time. The "Appeal" is addressed to "all the Armenian political parties, ecclesiastical, political, cultural, scientific and public organizations and businessmen of the world." [passage omitted] The "Appeal" is signed by "the grand prince of the Armenian kingdom, Roland I Bagratuni-Antonian-Anetsi, heir to the Armenian throne, king of kings, prince of princes, heir to the throne of the Kingdom of Western Armenia." The most visible participation of this person to the said "Appeal" seems to have been the drawing "Roland I" at the bottom of the page. We call it a "drawing" because the grand prince probably made his first attempt to write in the Armenian script by drawing the letters of his name possibly copying them from a signature given to him--as I would have done if I had to sign my name in Japanese. [passage omitted] As for the contents of the "Appeal," it proclaims: "On 10 February 1994 we will create the emigre coalition government of the Kingdom of Western Armenia and we will appoint the leaders of provinces, kingdoms and principalities." Roland I found bases for this step during his tour of Armenia and Karabakh, when it was revealed during his "meetings with the leaders of most of the political parties and organizations and representatives of cultural, scientific and economic circles" that "the ancestors of most Armenians are the victims of the 1915 genocide or have been deported from their homes, and the Armenian question awaits a solution to this day." [passage omitted] Roland I's revelations are not limited to the fact that the Armenian question remains unresolved. He was greatly rejoiced when he "heard that Armenia won independence following the dissolution of the Soviet Union." Unfortunately that joy was not unmitigated because "the Armenian republic has not done anything so far to find a solution to the problem of the 1915 genocide through political and diplomatic means and to have western Armenia returned to the homeland." Fortunately, this descendant of the Bagratunis declares with a populism that does not befit a man who aspires to become monarch: "Considering the will of the Armenians of the entire world, we decided to participate actively in this matter." This is followed by the declaration of the formation of the emigre coalition government of the Kingdom of Armenia and details are provided. The declaration says that a constitution must be endorsed until 1995 by a "bicameral or tricameral National Assembly" whose "deputies and senators, numbering 250 to 350, will have been elected by the Armenian communities of the world." The declaration adds that "the Kingdom of Western Armenia must join the UN, NATO, the CIS and the European Union." [passage omitted] Despite its generally comical appearance, the "Appeal" outlined above has a serious and disturbing aspect. The "ideas" expressed, in their distorted western Armenian edited and typeset by an eastern Armenian, betray the presence of a ladle sticking in from outside--a ladle that does not belong to the community that was dreamt by [19th century Catholicos] Khrimian. The effect of that ladle is to disturb and to create discord. The "Appeal" is also notable for its supportive attitude toward the "Kurdish people" and an "independent Kurdish state." The former is mentioned as a group that "is subjected to massive brutality by Turkey," and the latter is given the same weight as western Armenia: "This government must resolve the issue of independence peacefully, in conjunction with the issue of creating an independent Kurdish state." Can these propositions be explained by compassion or a sense of justice toward an oppressed people? There is also a question of timing: Why does such an appeal come at a time when the Turkish press does everything possible to gain credibility for its charges of collaboration between Armenians and Kurds? The list of such questions can grow much longer, and they can only cause more concern. One of the most important of such questions, however, concerns the propriety and responsibility of the press. How can a newspaper that bills itself as the press organ of a political organization undertake such dangerous steps? [passage omitted]
