FR940622-1-00049 FR940622-1-00014 40 CFR Part 180 [PP 7F3546/P584; FRL&hyph;4869&hyph;1] RIN 2070&hyph;AC18 Bifenthrin; Pesticide Tolerances and Extension of Tolerances AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: EPA proposes to establish time-limited tolerances (with an expiration date of November 15, 1997) for residues of the synthetic pyrethroid bifenthrin in or on the raw agricultural commodities (RACs) corn (field, seed, and pop) grain, silage (forage), stover (fodder), milk, milk fat, meat, fat, and meat byproducts of cattle, goats, hogs, horses, sheep, and poultry and eggs. The proposed regulation to establish maximum permissible levels for residues of the pesticide in or on these commodities was requested in a petition submitted by FMC Corp. EPA also proposes to extend tolerances for the residues of bifenthrin in or on cottonseed.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: EPA issued a notice, published in the Federal Register of November 25, 1987 (52 FR 45237), which announced that FMC Corp., 1735 Market St., Philadelphia, PA 19103, had submitted pesticide petition (PP) 7F3546 requesting that the Administrator, pursuant to section 408(d) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), 21 U.S.C. 346a(d), amend 40 CFR part 180 by establishing tolerances for residues of the pesticide bifenthrin, (2-methyl [1,1'-biphenyl]-3-yl)methyl-3-(2-chloro-3,3,3,-trifluoro-1-propenyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate, and its 4'-hydroxy metabolite in or on the raw agricultural commodities corn (field, seed, and pop) grain at 0.05 part per million (ppm), forage at 2.0 ppm, fodder at 4.0 ppm, milk at 0.02 ppm, milk fat at 0.20 ppm, meat at 0.10 ppm, fat at 0.30 ppm, and meat byproducts of goats, hogs, horses, and sheep at 0.10 ppm. At the request of FMC Corp., EPA issued an amended notice published in the Federal Register of August 4, 1993 (58 FR 41473), proposing that tolerances be established as follows: Corn (field, seed, and pop) grain at 0.05 ppm (No detectable residues were found in grain at exaggerated rates, and the proposed tolerance is based on method sensitivity), silage (fodder) combined residue of bifenthrin plus 4'-OH bifenthrin at 2.0 ppm, stover (fodder) for the combined residue of bifenthrin plus 4'-OH bifenthrin at 5.0 ppm; milk, fat at 1.0 ppm (reflecting 0.1 ppm in whole milk); meat of cattle, goats, hogs, horses, and sheep at 0.05 ppm; fat of cattle, goats, hogs, horses, and sheep at 1.0 ppm; and meat byproducts of cattle, goats, hogs, horses, and sheep at 0.10 ppm. On September 8, 1993, FMC Corp. requested that the pesticide petition be amended by proposing that tolerances be established in/on meat, fat, and meat byproducts of poultry and eggs at 0.05 ppm and by deleting the 4'-hydroxy metabolite from the tolerance expression. This amendment was submitted in response to EPA's conclusion that although residues in poultry from existing and proposed uses are expected to be nondetectable, tolerances should be set at the limit of quantitation and that the residue to be regulated is bifenthrin per se and not the 4'hydroxy metabolite. The scientific data submitted in the petition and other relevant material have been evaluated. The toxicological data considered in support of the proposed tolerances include: 1. Metabolism studies in rats with single doses of 4 and 35 mg/kg demonstrate that about 90 percent of parent compound and its hydroxylated metabolites are excreted. With doses of 0.5 mg/kg/day, significant bioaccumulation of the parent compound can occur in tissues with high fat content, with half-lives in these tissues of about 50 days. 2. A 12-month feeding study in dogs fed dose levels of 0, 0.75, 1.5, 3.0, or 5.0 milligrams(mg)/kilogram (kg)/day with a no-observed-effect level (NOEL) of 1.5 mg/kg/day. The lowest-effect level (LEL) for this study is established at 3.0 mg/kg/day based on the occurrence of intermittent tremors in the test animals. 3. A developmental toxicity study in rats given gavage doses of 0, 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 mg/kg/day with maternal and fetal NOELs at 1.0 mg/kg/day. The maternal NOEL is based on the occurrence of tremors, and the fetal NOEL is based on an increased incidence of hydroureter without hydronephrosis at the 2.0-mg/kg/day dosage level. 4. A developmental toxicity study in rabbits given gavage doses of 0, 2.67, 4, or 8 mg/kg/day with no developmental toxicity observed under the conditions of the study. The maternal NOEL is established at 4 mg/kg/day based on the occurrence of twitching and tremors at the 8 mg/kg/day dosage level. 5. A two-generation reproduction study in rats fed diets containing 0, 30, 60, or 100 ppm with no reproductive effects or developmental toxicity observed under the conditions of the study. The maternal NOEL for the study is established at 30 ppm (equivalent to 5 mg/kg/day) based on lower body weight in females. 6. Mutagenicity tests, including gene mutation in Salmonella, chromosomal aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary and rat bone marrow cells, HGPRT locus mutation in mouse lymphoma cells, and unscheduled DNA synthesis in rat hepatocytes, were all negative. Bifenthrin was marginally active in a forward mutation test involving the thymidine kinase locus in mouse lymphoma cells. These test results indicate a low mutegenic potential for bifenthrin. 7. A 24-month feeding/carcinogenicity study with rats fed diets containing 0, 12, 50, 100, or 200 ppm with a systemic NOEL of 50 ppm (equivalent to 2.5 mg/kg/day) based on tremors, elevated body weight, and higher liver and kidney organ-to-body weight ratios. There were no carcinogenic effects observed under the conditions of the study. 8. A carcinogenicity study with mice fed diets containing 0, 50, 200, 500, or 600 ppm (equivalent to 7.5, 30, 75, or 90 mg/kg/day) for 87 weeks (males) and 92 weeks (females) with a statistically significant trend for hemangiopericytomas of the urinary bladder of male mice. In this study, male mice in the high-dose group (600 ppm) showed an increase in the number of hemangiopericytomas of the urinary bladder as compared to the control group. Although the number of hemangiopericytomas was twice as high in male mice at the high dose level compared to the control animals, the difference in rate of tumors between the control group and the high-dose group was not statistically significant by pair-wise comparison. There were also significant dose-related trends in hepatocellular carcinomas and in the combined hepatocellular adenomas and/or carcinomas in male mice. Female mice had significantly higher incidences of combined lung adenomas and carcinomas in the 50, 200, and 600 ppm groups, although there was no significant dose-related trend. Bifenthrin has been classified by the Office of Pesticide Programs' Health Effect's Division's Carcinogenicity Peer Review Committee (CPRC) as a Group C carcinogen, i.e., possible human carcinogen. The Agency has chosen to use the reference dose calculations to estimate human dietary risk from bifenthrin residues. The decision supporting classification of bifenthrin as a possible carcinogen (Group C) rather than a probable carcinogen (Group B) was primarily based on the following: 1. Evidence for carcinogenicity was only observed in mice; no compound- related increases in tumors were observed in the carcinogenicity study in rats. 2. It is unlikely that the hemangiopericytomas observed in the mouse study were malignant. 3. Mutagenicity studies do not support Group B classification for bifenthrin. 4. Feeding studies using structurally related pyrethroids, which were classified as Group C carcinogens by the CPRC, have resulted in increased incidences of lung tumors in female mice. A dietary exposure/risk assessment was performed for bifenthrin using a Reference Dose (RfD) of 0.015 mg/kg of body weight/day. The RfD is based on an NOEL of 1.5 mg/kg/day from the 1-year feeding study in dogs, which demonstrated intermittent tremors in test animals at the lowest effect level, and an uncertainty factor of 100. The current estimated dietary exposure for the overall U.S. population resulting from established tolerances is 0.000385 mg/kg bwt/day, which represents 2.6 percent of the RfD. The current action will increase exposure to 0.001935 mg/kg bwt/day or 12.9 percent of the RfD. In the subgroup population exposed to the highest risk, nonnursing infants less than 1 year old, the current action would increase exposure to 0.007404 mg/kg bwt/day or 49.4 percent of the RfD. Generally speaking, EPA has no cause for concern if total residue contribution for published and proposed tolerances is less than the RfD. EPA concludes that the chronic dietary risk of bifenthrin, as estimated by the dietary risk assessment, does not appear to be of concern. The cancer risk to humans is considered negligible, given the weight of evidence considerations, which only support the classification of bifenthrin as a possible carcinogen, and the low level of exposure to bifenthrin residues in the human diet. The metabolism of the chemical in plants and animals for this use is adequately understood. Although a processing study shows some concentration of bifenthrin residues in corn oil, EPA has determined that a section 409 food additive regulation is unnecessary because it is unlikely that the bifenthrin residues in corn oil will exceed the limit of quantification tolerance that is being established for bifenthrin in corn grain. Analysis of the field trial data indicates that bifenthrin residue levels in corn grain will be lower than the grain tolerance by a factor greater than the concentration factor. An adequate analytical method, gas-liquid chromatography, is available for enforcement purposes. The enforcement methodology has been submitted to the Food and Drug Administration for publication in the Pesticide Analytical Manual, Vol. II (PAM II). Because of the long lead time for publication of the method in PAM II, the analytical methodology is being made available in the interim to anyone interested in pesticide enforcement when requested from: Calvin Furlow, Public Response and Program Resources Branch, Field Operations Divisions (7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., Washington, DC 20460. Office location and telephone number: Rm. 1132, CM #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Hwy., Arlington, VA 22202, (703)-305-5232. On August 5, 1988, EPA issued a conditional registration and time-limited tolerance for bifenthrin for use on cottonseed with an expiration date of October 31, 1991 (see the Federal Register of August 15, 1988 (53 FR 30676)). On November 12, 1992, the conditional registration was amended and extended to November 15, 1993, and the tolerance on cottonseed extended to November 15, 1994 (see Federal Registers of October 20, 1993 (58 FR 54094) and February 22, 1994 (59 FR 9411)). On November 15, 1993, EPA amended the registration on cottonseed by extending the expiration date to November 15, 1996. The registration was amended and extended to allow time for submission and evaluation of additional environmental effects data. In order to evaluate the effects of bifenthrin on fish and aquatic organisms and its fate in the environment, additional data were required to be collected and submitted during the period of conditional registration. Such requirements included a sediment bioavailability and toxicity study and a small-plot runoff study that must be submitted to the Agency by July 1, 1996. To be consistent with the extension issued for the conditional registration, the Agency is proposing to extend the tolerance on cottonseed and other commodities, and establish a time-limited tolerance on corn (field, seed, and pop) with an expiration date of November 15, 1997, to cover residues expected to result from use during the period of conditional registration. The pesticide is considered useful for the purposes for which it is sought. Based on the information and data considered, the Agency concludes that the proposed section 408 tolerances and extension will protect the public health. Therefore, it is proposed that the tolerances be established as set forth below. Any person who has registered or submitted an application for registration of a pesticide, under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) as amended, which contains any of the ingredients listed herein may request within 30 days after publication of this document in the Federal Register that this rulemaking proposal be referred to an Advisory Committee in accordance with section 408(e) of the FFDCA. Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the proposed regulation. Comments must bear a notation indicating the document control number, [PP 0E3921/P584]. All written comments filed in response to this petition will be available in the Public Response and Program Resources Branch, at the address given above from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except legal holidays. Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to all the requirements of the Executive Order (i.e., Regulatory Impact Analysis, review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)). Under section 3(f), the order defines ``significant'' as those actions likely to lead to a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local or tribal governments or communities (also known as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore not subject to OMB review. Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the Federal Register of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).
