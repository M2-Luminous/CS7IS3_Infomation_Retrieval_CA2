But, as a party--we are conferring as a party--the European Socialist Party has internal problems, work to do, topics, and internal issues. Therefore, this evening is mainly an internal affair. Tomorrow we will talk about the real problems of Europe and our positions. We must always consider our positions. Our goal is development and support for the workers, and a Europe of the people not a Europe of the bankers. Our classical position remains. The issue is how much we are ready to do. [Unidentified correspondent] One of the significant issues of the summit will be European Commission President Jacques Delors' succession. The information that is available so far indicates that there is no unanimity. Are you optimistic about the outcome? [Papandreou] I hope there will be. I am not sure, but I hope so. Thank you very much.
