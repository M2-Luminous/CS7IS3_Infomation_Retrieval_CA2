FBIS4-13294 "drnes075_k_94001" FBIS-NES-94-075 Daily Report 15 Apr 1994 IRAQ `Source' on Contracts for Oil Exploration `Source' on Contracts for Oil Exploration JN1804162194 London AL-HAYAH in Arabic 15 Apr 94 pp 1, 4 JN1804162194 London AL-HAYAH Arabic BFN [Article by Randah Taqiy-al-Din in Paris] [Text] An informed French source has told AL-HAYAH that the two French oil companies, Elf Aquitaine and Total, can now sign a contract on oil exploration and development in the Iraqi oil fields of Nahr 'Umar, Total's area of operations, and Majnun, Elf Aquitaine's area of operations, despite the international embargo clamped on Iraq. The source added that the contract, after it is signed, will only be implemented after the post-embargo phase. He said that signing a contract that cannot be immediately implemented does not require a political decision but a decision by the two companies. The source pointed out that the only obstacle to signature now is the fact that negotiations with the Iraqi side have not yet ended, especially with regard to the terms of participation in exploration and development in the two oil fields. He explained that the visit to Paris by an Iraqi oil delegation led by Tahir Hammud, the Iraqi deputy oil minister, was confined to reviewing technical issues and that no actual negotiations were held between the two sides. He said that if the embargo on Iraq is lifted, it would take approximately two years before production begins in the Nahr 'Umar and Majnun oil fields. He described the production capacity of the two oil fields as important. It is noteworthy that several French officials were eager to reiterate that despite these negotiations and talks no oil contract would be signed with Iraq as long as the international embargo is valid. In another development, Lee Hamilton, head of the Foreign Affairs Committee in the U.S. House of Representatives, has accused President Bill Clinton's administration of violating the economic embargo imposed on Iraq by indirectly purchasing fuel from Iraqi oil refineries for use in transportation and heating purposes in Kurdish areas in northern Iraq.
