FBIS4-57896 "drlat103__a94001" FBIS-LAT-94-103-A Daily Report 25 May 1994 ANNEX Argentina Colombian President Interviewed on Escobar, Cuba-OAS, Haiti Colombian President Interviewed on Escobar, Cuba-OAS, Haiti PY2605001194 Buenos Aires CLARIN in Spanish 25 May 94 p 30 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY PY2605001194 Buenos Aires CLARIN Spanish BFN ["Summary" of "exclusive" interview with President Cesar Gaviria by ``special correspondent'' Pablo Biffi in Gaviria's office on 24 May; copyrighted by CLARIN] [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Biffi] When Colombian drug trafficker Pablo Escobar escaped from jail in 1992, it was said the United States had been preparing his abduction ... [Gaviria] No, I do not believe the United States wanted to abduct Pablo Escobar in violation of a Colombian legal order. As I have already said, Escobar escaped thanks to his huge power to corrupt. He escaped because we prevented him from pursuing his criminal activities from jail. Colombia did away with Escobar and may yet defeat drug trafficking. [Biffi] You have restored diplomatic relations with Cuba. As OAS secretary general, will you promote Cuba's reintegration into the OAS? [Gaviria] On an issue like Cuba, the OAS secretary general may not adopt an attitude different from that of other members. Nevertheless, I believe there is a perception in America that we can encourage Cuba to implement economic and political changes. This involves their opening to other social segments and holding elections the way we understand them in other countries so that Cuba may rejoin the inter-American system. [Biffi] Are these changes a nonnegotiable condition for Cuba's reintegration into the OAS? [Gaviria] It may be perceived in our continent that if Cuba takes these steps, its reintegration may be possible. Likewise, if Cuba does not take these steps, its reintegration would be somewhat difficult. [Biffi] The United States has threatened military intervention in Haiti. Would you support this type of measure? [Gaviria] I can only express my opinion as president of Colombia as I must be cautious because I will encounter this problem as OAS secretary general. Our country's policy has always been to exercise full diplomatic and economic pressure on Haiti's de facto government seeking the reinstatement of democratically elected President Jean Bertrand Aristide in his post. We have never made a decision on military intervention because we have never had to make such a decision in the OAS or in the United Nations. Therefore, we have not taken a position on this issue because we are convinced that diplomatic and economic pressures may yield results.
