The RPF officials, Titus Rutaremara and Dr. Butera Jean Bosco, refused to countersign the document because, though the document had been signed by army officers, they have signed it on behalf of the Government of Rwanda, which the RPF does not recognize. The unilateral cease-fire document by the Rwandese Government was signed by Army officers on behalf of the government, because President Mobutu had refused the government officials themselves to sign the agreement, knowing that the RPF would not accept it. After the RPF officials refused to countersign the cease-fire document, President Mobutu suggested that a new document be prepared in which the part to be signed by the Rwandese Government was to be replaced by a part that will be signed by the Army officers of the Rwandese Government forces. The RPF officials accepted these proposals of a cease-fire arrangement between the RPF and the Rwandese Government forces. The RPF has always rejected any talks with the illegitimate government in Rwanda, but the front has always invited the Rwandese Government forces for talks aimed at stopping the military hostilities between the two sides.
