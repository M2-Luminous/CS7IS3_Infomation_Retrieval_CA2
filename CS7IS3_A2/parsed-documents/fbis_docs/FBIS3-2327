Last year, public security organs cracked a total of 1.21 million criminal cases which occurred in the current year, a 12.3-percent increase over 1992, and cracked some 290,000 cases which occurred in the previous year. Their ability to crack criminal cases has obviously improved and efforts against criminal activities have been stepped up. Of the 1.617 million criminal reports received by public security organs across the country in 1993, 539,000 were very serious cases, an 18-percent increase over 1992. At present, public security problems in a few cities and counties are comparatively salient and the masses there have reacted strongly to this. The Ministry of Public Security has already urged public security organs in all localities to step up blows and to mainly straighten out order in a few areas where public security problems are salient.
