"Alternativa," "Moskva," and "Baltiya" received so-called domestic licenses. That is, the licenses which give the right to engage in freely convertible currency operations on Russian territory. And "Lantabank" has acquired an expanded license which also enables it to establish agent relations with six foreign counterparts. Unfortunately, punitive sanctions have had to be applied to violators of the procedure. As of 1 April the Central Bank main administration for Moscow suspended for a month the right of some banks to buy and sell currency using their own funds. They include the "Eastern-European Investment Bank," the "Credit-Consensus," "Progress-bank," and "Russian joint-stock commercial bank." Their sin is to have engaged in buying and selling in violation of the limit set by the Moscow administration. And now, if these institutions intend to disobey the ban through 1 May, deals involving them will be deemed invalid and the funds they obtain in such operations will go into the state revenue. Which accords with article 14 of the Russian law "on currency regulation and currency control." But clients of the guilty banks may rest assured -- the penalized banks have the right to buy and sell dollars and marks on instructions from their clients. As we can see, the Central Bank seriously intends to introduce order in the currency operations of its subordinates -- the commercial banks. But let us not forget that alongside them firms are alive and well which are merrily dealing in freely convertible currency without any banking licenses, without obeying the Central Bank of Russia, and spitting on its endeavors. They have not been assigned any of the quotas and rules which the Central Bank sets for its own "vassals." The Central Bank of Russia cannot take nonexistent permits away from them or block their accounts, to which sanction any refractory and undisciplined commercial bank is inexorably subject. As we were told by Central Bank of Russia spokesman A. Sitnin, all that can be done is to send letters to the prosecutor's office and the tax service. So far this has produced no results. And the bankers' dissatisfaction is therefore inevitable: "Why are we being punished and not them?" So that in this delicate sphere, a highly explosive one for the economy, no consolidation of statehood can yet be seen.
