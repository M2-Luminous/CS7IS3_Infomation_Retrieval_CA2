The Central Environment Council made the proposal to Wakako Hironaka, director general of the Environment Agency. She was urged to revise the current legislation on protecting the ozone layer to comply with an international agreement, strengthened in November 1992, on phasing out ozone-depleting chemicals. The agency hopes to submit the revision to the current Diet session. CFCs -- industrial gases used as refrigerator coolants, in plastic foams and in aerosols -- are blamed for depleting the ozone layer, which filters out the sun's harmful ultraviolet rays. Signatories of the Montreal Protocol agreed in November 1992 to ban the use of CFCs by the end of 1995, four years earlier than initially planned. They also agreed to begin regulating consumption of alternatives to CFCs, such as hydrochlorofluorocarbons. If the law is revised, the use of HCFCs, for instance, will also be phased out by around 2030. To prevent CFCs from being emitted into the atmosphere, the council proposed that a system be set up that encourages recycling and collecting of substances from refrigerators and other cooling devices that are presently thrown away as waste. The costs of recycling and collecting should be shared among manufacturers, distributors and consumers, the council said. An advisory body to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry recommended similar measures last month.
