In that context, the government should in particular work toward greater closeness to the people, democracy, and strengthening the Union externally to allow the swift admission of the European Free Trade Association states. Cooperation with the Central and East European states has to be moved forward, German must be recognized as an official EU language, and the European Parliament must be strengthened. All the laender endorsed a resolution underlining their joint responsibility for preparing "the important task of the German presidency of the Council." Saarland Prime Minister Oskar Lafontaine (SPD) stressed that all those questioning European integration were jeopardizing the stability of the continent and facilitating nationalism. The most important task is to combat widespread unemployment by creating new jobs. Democracy also means access to work. [passage omitted]
