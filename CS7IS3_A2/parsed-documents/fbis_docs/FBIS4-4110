Kozyrev made these remarks at a joint press conference after meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher in the U.S. mission in Geneva. According to Kozyrev, a military solution to the Bosnian conflict is an extreme solution which should not be used. He also said that the warring sides in Bosnia should search for a compromise within the framework of negotiations over territorial concession by the Bosnian Serbs. On economic sanctions against the Serbs, Kozyrev said this issue is linked to the search for a political solution, adding that lifting of the sanctions will be put on the agenda if a cease-fire is concluded. Christopher said the U.S. and Russia have the same objectives in Bosnia. On the situation in Goradze, the U.S. secretary of state said things are developing in a "good direction" and the Bosnian Serbs are withdrawing their heavy weapons some 20 kilometers away from the town. However, Christopher added that NATO planes will monitor Serb compliance with the withdrawal. Kozyrev and Christopher also discussed the Middle East, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and Russian participation in NATO's partnership for peace plan.
