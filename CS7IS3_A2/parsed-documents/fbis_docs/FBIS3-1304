He told a media briefing -- a year after the announcement that South Africa would terminate its nuclear bomb capability and destroy seven bombs, six of them completed -- that international nuclear energy inspectors from Vienna had investigated the recorded 25kg deficiency and ascribed it to normal losses resulting from the chemical processes which the material had been subjected to. The highly enriched uranium extracted from the devices and stored in South Africa could be used as medical isotopes. Worth about R300 million [rand], it was a valuable national asset. Mr de Waal said destruction of the devices was continuing and the metal parts, which had already been sawn up, would be sawn into smaller parts and melted in furnaces in the next three months. To his knowledge none of the technicians associated with the project had sold their skills abroad. Mr de Waal said South Africa never tested any of its nuclear bombs, but the head of Armscor's missiles department Deon Smith said there was no doubt they would have worked. A Japanese television researcher who attended the briefing is producing a programme drawing parallels between South Africa's nuclear disarmament programme and North Korea's nuclear programme which is seen as a threat to Japan.
