Speaking to the media shortly before the start of the second session of The Nation and the Emigrants Conference, Prieto said such recognition is necessary regardless of where the artistic event takes place and added that the country has been working toward that goal for some time. It is a task that has been carried out with some omissions due to the tension, but thanks to the country's interest, there are already some publications in existence. They are the result of ongoing rather than last-minute efforts, Prieto added. He announced that on 25 April, UNEAC will host a panel discussion with the participation of emigrants to analyze possibilities for cultural exchanges and to discuss topics of mutual interest. Prieto spoke of ending the stereotypes and schemes established over the past 30 years and moving on toward the attainment of serious cultural recognition. To conclude, Prieto described the attacks by ultraconservative groups on the conference as ridiculous and stressed the broad ideological spectrum of the numerous guests.
