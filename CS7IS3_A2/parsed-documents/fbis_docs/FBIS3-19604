Can you tell us something about Franco-German relationship? What is the situation like? [Juppe] Things are going very well indeed. I will tell you a secret. I spoke on the phone with German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel for half an hour yesterday evening. We discussed the forthcoming European meetings. There is one in Brussels tomorrow, and another over the weekend [26-27 March] in Greece. We want France and Germany to have a common position. Bilateral ties are doing well at the level of foreign ministers, prime minister and chancellor or president. So, what are the reasons which made you ask such a question? First, in a bilateral relationship, this does not mean that sometimes you can't have different opinions. This happens to couples, as we know. We are absolutely determined to preserve the link between Germany and France. It is the foundation for construction of the European Union [EU]. There are no problems, either in France or in Germany. But sometimes we have different opinions. Second, elections are being held in Germany. When there are elections, there can be an internal debate and sometimes it is about the relations between France and Germany. But I am absolutely convinced that nothing really important has changed -- both as far as the people are concerned and, more importantly, as far as real issues are concerned.
