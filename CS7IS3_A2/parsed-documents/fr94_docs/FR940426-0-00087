FR940426-0-00087 FR940426-0-00019 Reconciliation of Records Performed by All Participating Schools A school is required to reconcile cash and individual loan records monthly. To reconcile cash, a school must provide documentation to the Servicer that the total net disbursements minus cancellations, plus return of excess cash, is equal to the amount of money the school has drawn down during a one-month period. This process must be completed by the end of the next month. For example, loan records and promissory notes for all disbursements and cancellations made in July 1995 must be transmitted to the Servicer by the end of August 1995. To reconcile loan records, a school's records must match the records of the Servicer. The software that is provided to participating schools is designed to assist schools in this reconciliation process. Administrative Fees Level 1 originating schools will have greater responsibility than Level 2 originating schools in the area of funds management. Because of this greater responsibility, a Level 1 originating school will receive a higher administrative fee than a Level 2 originating school. The HEA does not allow a school that participates under alternative origination to receive administrative fees. Consortia A consortium of schools in the Direct Loan Program interacts with the Secretary in the same manner as other schools, except that the communication between the Secretary and the schools in the consortium is consolidated and channeled through a single point. Each school in a consortium must sign the Direct Loan Program participation agreement with the Secretary and is responsible for the information it supplies through the consortium. If a consortium wishes to originate loans, each school in the consortium must be eligible to originate. The consortium will be eligible to originate at the most restrictive level any school in the consortium is eligible to originate. For example, if one school in a consortium is eligible to originate at the second level and the other schools in the consortium are eligible to originate at the first level, the consortium is eligible to originate only at the second level of origination. Criteria Chart The following chart is provided to show, in a summary format, the criteria for the different levels of origination. Any differences between the language in the chart and the language in the criteria announced in this document should be resolved in favor of the latter.
