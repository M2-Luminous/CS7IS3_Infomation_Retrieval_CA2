At the beginning of the talks, the highest level cross-strait negotiations since the Koo-Wang talks in Singapore in April, both sides made clear their bottom lines: Taipei wanted Beijing to accept the reality of its sovereignty, while Beijing insisted Taiwan recognize the "one-China" principle and agree that Taiwan's ability to exercise jurisdiction was a political issue and therefore not one to be touched on during the talks. The talks deadlocked over the sovereignty problem, leading to a cancellation of discussions on the issues at hand -- the repatriation of mainland hijackers and illegal immigrants and the resolution of cross-strait fishing disputes -- during the third of five days of talks. But after an hour-and-a-half meeting between Chiao and Wang Zaoguo, the head of the State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office, the talks were given an unexpected impetus, enabling negotiators to clear away some long-standing obstacles and arrive at a "high degree of consensus" at the end of the talks, although no concrete agreements were reached. "Having the consensus is a win-win result," Chiao, the secretary-general of the Straits Exchange Foundation, said. "We already have Taiwan's sovereignty properly respected by the other side," Chiao said, citing Beijing's preliminary agreement with Taiwan over the issue of mainland hijackers. Beijing has promised that any hijackers repatriated to the mainland would have their time served in Taiwan deducted from any sentence given by a mainland court. Chiao also pointed to Beijing's approval of the enforcement power of arbitration agencies to be set up on both sides to handle fishing disputes as another example of Beijing's acquiescence to Taiwan's sovereignty. But Zhou Zhekai, secretary-general of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait and the No. 2 mainland negotiator, said that the mainland didn't give in to Taiwan on the sovereignty issue. "We didn't mention the sovereignty; we just dealt with the reality itself," he said. Chiao's counterpart, ARATS Standing Vice President and chief mainland negotiator Tang Shubei, reiterated that the sovereignty issue is a part of politics and should be avoided. "Avoidance of the jurisdiction problem means that we will not mention it in the wordings of future agreements," he added. If Tang and Zhou are correct, then Taipei might not have gotten what it wanted. On the contrary, Beijing took more from the talks. First, it received Taipei's promise to list cross-strait trade, economic, cultural and technical cooperation on the agenda of the next round of cross-strait talks scheduled for March in Beijing. Taipei originally insisted that it would not touch those issues until its request that its jurisdiction regarding the issues of hijackers, illegal immigrants and fishing disputes be recognized. Secondly, Chiao's meeting with Wang created an image that high- level contacts are more efficient in solving the complicated issues, so Beijing can now justify its longstanding call that cross-strait high-level political talks take place sooner rather than later.
