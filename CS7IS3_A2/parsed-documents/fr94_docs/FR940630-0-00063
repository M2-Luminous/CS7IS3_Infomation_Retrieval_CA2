FR940630-0-00063 FR940630-0-00021 DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION 34 CFR Parts 373, 379, 381, and 385 RIN 1820&hyph;AB11 Rehabilitation Services Administration Programs AGENCY: Department of Education. ACTION: Final regulations. SUMMARY: The Secretary announces the effective date for information collection requirements in regulations for certain Rehabilitation Services Administration programs and amends 34 CFR Parts 373, 379, 381, and 385 to display and codify the control numbers assigned by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to information collection requirements contained in the regulations. The Department must display and codify the control numbers to comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. Publication of these control numbers informs the public that OMB has approved the information collection requirements and that they have taken effect. EFFECTIVE DATE: The amendments to §§373.30, 379.43, 381.10, 385.45 published at February 18, 1994 at 59 FR 8330, and this amendment are effective June 30, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Beverlee Stafford, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue, S.W., Room 3028 Switzer Building, Washington, D.C. 20202&hyph;2531. Telephone: (202) 205&hyph;9331. Individuals who use a telecommunications device for the deaf (TDD) may call the Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) at 1&hyph;800&hyph;877&hyph;8339 between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m., Eastern time, Monday through Friday. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Final regulations for a variety of Rehabilitation Services Administration programs were published in the Federal Register on February 18, 1994 (59 FR 8330). At the time of publication of the regulations, it was noted that certain sections of the regulations contained information collection requirements requiring review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and those sections would become effective after approval by OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, as amended. OMB has approved the information collection requirements in §§373.30, 379.43, 381.10, and 385.45 of those regulations, and those sections of the regulations are now effective. Waiver of Notice of Proposed Rulemaking In accordance with section 431(b)(2)(A) of the General Education Provisions Act (20 U.S.C. 1232(b)(2)(A)) and the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), it is the practice of the Secretary to offer interested parties the opportunity to comment on proposed regulations. However, the publication of OMB control numbers is purely technical and does not establish substantive policy. Therefore, the Secretary has determined, under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), that proposed rulemaking is unnecessary and contrary to the public interest and that a delayed effective date is not required under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3). Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification The Secretary certifies that these regulations contain only technical amendments and would not have a significant impact on any entities.
