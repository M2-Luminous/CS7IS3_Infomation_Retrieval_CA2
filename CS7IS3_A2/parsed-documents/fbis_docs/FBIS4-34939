His statement will probably exasperate the Brazilian Government, which is annoyed at Menem's attempt to undermine the candidacy of Brazilian Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero as WTO chairman during the Ibero-American Summit that took place in Cartagena, Colombia. [passage omitted] Following a 30-minute meeting today with U.S. President Bill Clinton -- which was obtained after three months of negotiations -- Menem tried to explain his government's position regarding the WTO candidacy during a news conference. He did not confirm his support for the candidacy of Ricupero, whom he wrongly described as a "successful economist." The Argentine president said that when he arrived in Cartagena he did not know about Ricupero's candidacy, and that he suggested the name of Salinas "following a proposal made by the Colombian Government." "Right now," Menem said, "there are two candidates from this continent, one from Mexico and the other one from the Federative Republic of Brazil." After saying this Menem got mixed up, and said: "Supposedly the candidacy will be defined by the members of the European Commission, and the candidate could be a European." A reporter asked Menem for a better explanation. "The WTO is an organization from the European Community, it is not an international organization," the Argentine president said. "Or better yet," he corrected himself, "it is an international organization but it is an organization from the European Community." Menem traveled to Orlando, Florida, this evening, where he will watch the soccer match between the Argentine and Nigerian soccer teams. As he is known for bringing bad luck, he will apparently comply with a petition by the Argentine soccer players, and will watch the match on television "for reasons of superstition," he said.
