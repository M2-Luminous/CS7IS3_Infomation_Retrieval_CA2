FBIS4-34732 "drlat122__a94002" FBIS-LAT-94-122-A Daily Report 21 Jun 1994 ANNEX Brazil Argentine `Apologies' Over WTO Incident Accepted Argentine `Apologies' Over WTO Incident Accepted PY2206010994 Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL in Portuguese 21 Jun 94 p 14 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY PY2206010994 Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL Portuguese BFN [Article by Luiz Orlando Carneiro] [Text] Brasilia -- The Brazilian Government has accepted the Argentine Foreign Ministry's apologies, which alleged that President Carlos Menem had not been informed about the candidacy of Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero when he endorsed the candidacy of Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari for chairman of the World Trade Organization, which will replace GATT. Menem announced his support for Salinas at the Fourth Ibero-American Summit held in Cartagena, Colombia. In a letter received by Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim this past weekend, Argentine Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella states that his government is willing to review its support for the Mexican candidate. The two foreign ministries are interested in minimizing the diplomatic incident to avoid further consequences. This past weekend, President Menem sent his condolences to President Franco for the death of his nephew and private secretary Ariosto during the Cartagena summit. According to Itamaraty sources, President Itamar Franco's premature return to Brazil because of the death of his nephew, and the disclosure immediately afterward by President Menem of his support for the candidacy of Carlos Salinas de Gortari, created such a big problem in the bilateral relations between the two countries that Foreign Minister Celso Amorim allegedly discussed with President Franco the possibility of recalling Brazilian Ambassador to Buenos Aires Marcos Azambuja "for consultations." In diplomatic language, this means a temporary suspension of relations between the two countries. The Brazilian Government has decided to accept the explanation that it was all a misunderstanding after Di Tella summoned Azambuja on 17 June to tell him, among other things, the following: - President Menem was not informed (by the Argentine foreign minister) that Rubens Ricupero's candidacy for WTO chairman was of great interest to Brazil; - The Argentine delegation in Cartagena thought that President Franco had discussed the issue with the Mexican president. As the Brazilian delegation left the summit soon after the death of Ariosto Franco, without leaving any recommendation, President Menem accepted the pressure from Mexico and decided to publicly express support for Salinas. According to Itamaraty sources, the Argentine Government wants to use the opportunity of the Mercosur [Common Market of the South] summit that will probably take place on 15 July in Buenos Aires "to put a definite end" to this "misunderstanding." Meanwhile, Brazil expects Argentina to inform the governments of Colombia (which hosted the Ibero-American summit) and of Mexico that Argentina had not intended to "reject" [desapoiar] the candidacy of Ricupero as WTO chairman.
