If these principles are followed ethnic relations will improve and China's national unity and social stability will be protected, Commission Vice-Chairman Chen Hong said. Inter-ethnic relations improved markedly last year, as economic developments began to spread from the coastal areas to the interior and border regions, Chen said. But increasing contact between the different nationality cultures had led to unavoidable arguments and conflict, Commission Minister Ismail Amat told the conference. Amat urged central and local nationalities affairs departments to strengthen their conflict resolution work so as to safeguard social stability. And he encouraged his colleagues to continue the fight against hostile forces from inside and outside China that attempted to split the country by playing the ethnic issue card. Another national conference will be held in September this year to honour individuals and collectives that have made outstanding contributions to the unity and progress of Chinese nationalities, Chen said. And he encouraged local government to arrange forums to push forward the nationalities work. And they should select nominees for the national honours. Amat stressed the need to further strengthen the legislation on nationalities affairs and promote the reform and opening up in the ethnic regions.
