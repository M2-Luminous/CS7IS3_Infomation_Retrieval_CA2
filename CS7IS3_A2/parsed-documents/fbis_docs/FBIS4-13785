In our view we must not miss this opportunity, Morocco must not miss this opportunity, and the international community must not miss this opportunity. We must exert whatever effort possible to provide the opportunity for the implementation of the original peace plan, which aims at organizing a free, democratic, and impartial referendum to decide the fate of the Saharan people. In our view, an international seminar could be held with the participation of neighboring countries -- Algeria, Mauritania, the state that was occupying the Western Sahara, Spain, the United States, and France in their capacity as members of the Security Council and as super powers concerned with security and peace in the region of north-west Africa, the two international organizations responsible for the implementation of the peace plan, in addition to the two parties to the conflict -- Morocco and the Polisario [Popular Front for the Liberation of Saquia El Hamra and Rio de Oro] Front. In our view, such a seminar can actually contribute to the overcoming of difficulties that obstruct the implementation of the peace plan. Because it is not enough to refer the problem to the identity committee, which is a technical committee. The existing problems are political, and in order to help the identity committee, which we will cooperate with, we should create the right political conditions and hammer out the political difficulties that face it so that it can carry out a successful technical work.
