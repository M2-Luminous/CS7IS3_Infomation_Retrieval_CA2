In a statement issued yesterday, the Albanian Foreign Ministry accuses the Greek Government of war-like talk. It underlines that "playing another Bosnia in the southern Balkans would mean a widespread Balkan war for which Greece will be fully responsible. The policy of threatening Albania is a policy of failure." The Albanian Foreign Ministry though, does not say anything about the wave of terrorism that has been launched against the North Ipirus people. It says nothing about group arrests and interrogations. Of course it says nothing, since the U.S. State Department, which supposedly does not have any evidence of the oppression of the Greek minority in Albania, has not said anything either. It is this "lack of evidence" and many other things that encourage Tirana to continue its provocations and accuse Greece of seeking another Bosnia in the southern Balkans. Greece does not seek another Bosnia nor any war, but seeks peace in the Balkans and good relations with all its neighbors. However, the development and further improvement of good relations with Albania depends on respect for human rights and the rights of the Greek minority. With its terrorizing of the Greek minority, Berisha's regime proves that it is not a state of law. It needs to prove continuously to the international community that it is developing into a state of law, a state of democratic freedoms, with respect for human rights. Of course, the U.S. Government, which is the main supporter of Berisha's regime, knows this; it just pretends it does not. That is where the responsibility lies for Tirana's provocations, which depict Greece, a country that hosts 500,000 Albanians and supports its economy, as seeking war. If the U.S. hypocrisy stops, Tirana will immediately stop its provocations too.
