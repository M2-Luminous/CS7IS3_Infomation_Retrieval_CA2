According to information from the Office for the Protection of the Constitution in Magdeburg, Thorsten Heise, Lower Saxony chairman of the right-wing extremist Liberal Workers Party [FAP], is attempting to establish "FAP structures" in Saxony-Anhalt. The new center of the anticonstitutional party is Wernigerode in the Ostharz, said Wolfgang Heidelberg, head of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution in Saxony-Anhalt, where the FAP, which has between 400 and 600 members throughout Germany, established a regional circle of 60 members last week. However, the number of supporters appears to be even larger. Nevertheless there is no land organization in Saxony-Anhalt yet, but even in this land Heise leads FAP as a "provisional chairman." FAP bases itself on the 1920 program of the National Socialist German Workers Party [NSDAP]. Because of constant violence usually caused by FAP supporters, the police are permanently on alert, said Heidelberg. On Saturday [28 May], in Heise's home town of Northeim, there was a demonstration against FAP staged mainly by numerous groups from the autonomous sphere, but also Greens.
