"We are faced with a painful episode," Fabbri said, adding: "The fact remains that the international community and the United Nations want to make credible and coherent their willingness to guarantee global order and security, they cannot avoid the use of force with the aim of peace-making and providing humanitarian aid." This, Fabbri said, is "the only way" the UN can maintain the authority and prestige necessary to keep the growing number of crisis areas around the world under control.
