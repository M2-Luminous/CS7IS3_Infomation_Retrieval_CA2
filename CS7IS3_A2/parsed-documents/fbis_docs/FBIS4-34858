Missile attacks were launched against a landing enemy force. The combat alert did not take the Orden Antonio Maceo Naval Base by surprise. The units deployed and quickly occupied combat positions. The mock battle against some 20 enemy ships only required the use of 50 percent of our forces. The initial missile attack was launched against the landing boats. Our infantrymen acted calmly and with dedication to attain, in peace, the adroitness war demands. At a speed of over 30 knots, a missile boat launched its weapons and returned victorious from its mission. The Western Army Moncada exercise demonstrated today that the Cuban Revolutionary Navy maintains a high combat readiness and its troops are also a fist of steel against the enemy. This is why it has retained seven years in a row, the Revolutionary Armed Forces's Top Forward Unit status.
