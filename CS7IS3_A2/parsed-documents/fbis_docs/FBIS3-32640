Here is journalist Benito Cuadrado with more information. [Cuadrado -- live by phone or recorded] The CTC's secretary general pointed out that Villa Clara's union activities are exemplary, but that decreases in production such as those exhibited on the tobacco plantations in (Manicaragua) and in the fishing sector must be avoided because the nation needs those resources to increase its economic potential. The CTC national secretariat expressed interest in the sugarcane harvest strategy in Villa Clara; the cane planting, which will exceed 170 caballerias this month; and the progress of the potato campaign. The goal is to obtain over 6,000 quintals of yield. Ross Leal, who is a member of the Politburo, said that those who accomplish their respective missions must be acknowledged and encouraged because these times call for labor feats, and the people of Villa Clara always walk that path.
