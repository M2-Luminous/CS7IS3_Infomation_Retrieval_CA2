Strict control of foreign vessels is no longer being implemented by border guards of the Nakhodka independent control and entry point. Their squads are no longer being posted on the decks of foreign freighters tying up at moorings in Nakhodka and Vostochnyy ports. Lengthy round-the-clock watches in any weather monitoring foreigners in all Russian ports hardly corresponds with the democratic principles of the country's development. Besides it was quite costly, so the command of border guards in Maritime Kray decided to relinquish the old methods of monitoring arriving vessels. Their crews will now carry out their own watch on the gangway in accordance with the rules of maritime service. They will also decide for themselves who to permit or not permit on board. The border guards detachments that carried out this work will now be used to guard the state border -- their primary task.
