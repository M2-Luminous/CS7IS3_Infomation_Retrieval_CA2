Replying to [Pact for Italy member] Rocco Buttiglione, who criticized the appointment by referring to an "old faction-based logic," [Institutional Reform Minister] Leopoldo Elia said curtly: "Nobody is trying to exclude anybody else through the choices made." [PPI member] Roberto Formigoni, on the other hand, interpreted Mancino and Andreatta's election as "a very serious political signal," because "the choice fell on two members of the old DC [Christian Democratic Party] Left." On the other hand, the CCD [Christian Democratic Center] deputies' assembly took place without any apparent tensions, with Clemente Mastella being elected as the CCD's floor leader. Furthermore, the CCD decided to form an autonomous group, which will, however, join forces with Forza Italia. National Alliance [AN] also elected its floor leaders. Giuseppe Tatarella was elected to Montecitorio [Chamber of Deputies], and Giulio Maceratini to Palazzo Madama [Senate], both of them unanimously. These first appointments were criticized by [Pannella List] Reformers Deputy Elio Vito, in whose view the parties that have already proceeded to elect their floor leaders have committed "a serious political and institutional blunder. In the lower house," Vito recalled, "deputies must indicate the group they belong to within two days after the first sitting; in the upper house, the same statement must be made within four days after the first sitting." Only then, the deputy asserted, should the parliamentary groups make any appointments.
