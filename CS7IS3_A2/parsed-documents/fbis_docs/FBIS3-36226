At the time analysts perceived it as a document setting forth the main provisions of a new U.S. military doctrine and military strategy. In time, however, it became clear that this was not quite so. It turned out that the "new national program of military building," as the U.S. press called it, was certainly not a finished program but just a rough draft of one, although it had been worked out in depth. Two months after the Pentagon's report appeared, President Clinton ordered the formation of an interdepartmental group of experts with the task of preparing recommendations for a "fundamental reappraisal" of U.S. nuclear policy and strategy and the elaboration of new approaches to the building and utilization of the nuclear forces. Along with the elaborated data on a review of the general principles of military building and of the structure of the armed forces, the conclusions of this group of experts are to be approved by the President and set forth in his special "Policy Review Directive." This directive does not yet exist, although it has been given the number 34. Other parameters of U.S. military strategy, of the structure of the armed forces, and of policy in the defense sphere are also being elaborated. Defense Secretary Les Aspin declared this when he recently addressed a conference of the Reserve Officers' Association. According to him, the purport of all this work is that the United States must be the only superpower remaining in the world after the Cold War. The task of creating armed forces which, the Pentagon boss said, must be "capable of fighting and winning two large regional wars being waged simultaneously" is now advanced as the basis of Washington's military policy. This "two-win strategy" will demand greater "flexibility and maneuverability" both of regular units of the U.S. armed forces and of the reserve forces. At the same time a special role is allocated to reserve and National Guard units. They must be equipped, manned, and trained so as to be able at any moment to embark on fulfilling combat tasks equally with regular troops. This is just one element of the ongoing review of U.S. military policy and strategy. Measures are being taken to further improve other components as well. The task has been set in such a way as to complete this work, in the main, by this spring. The U.S. Administration believes that the rapid changes in the international situation, the departure from the scene of old threats and the emergence of new ones demand the constant renewal both of the theoretical arsenal and of the practice of military building. President Clinton, the defense secretary declared, "is sworn to ensure that America continues to have the best trained, best equipped, and most combat-efficient troops in the world." But this does demand extra money, which will be forthcoming. The White House has already reported that the Administration will request $263.7 billion for military purposes in the coming Fiscal 1995 -- $3 billion more than was allocated in the current year. This is the only way, Washington believes, that the United States will be able to remain the No. 1 superpower.
