Blas F. Ople, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, called on the national government yesterday to lead other members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in an intensified diplomacy to defuse the atmosphere of gathering war in the Korean peninsula. Ople said that the use of economic sanctions by the United Nations against an already isolated North Korea could force a desperate and paranoid government in Pyongyang to consider the war option which can drag the Philippines and other Asian countries in a new, unpredictable international crisis. What makes the situation volatile is the unpredictability of the Korean leadership which is composed of "mysterious, shadowy personalities and very little is known about them," he said. North Korea, the last Stalinist state in the world, has a mutual defense treaty with the People's Republic of China (PRC), the world's most populous nation. Its two top leaders are Kim Il-song and his son Kim Chong-il, "who is more erratic than his father," Ople told Senate reporters. "No one doubts that both father and son are capable of going to war against all odds," Ople observed as the clouds of war loomed over the divided Korean peninsula as a result of North Korea's refusal to allow United Nations' inspection of its nuclear facilities. President Clinton, acting on the request of the U.S. commander in South Korea representing the United Nations, has ordered the dispatch and installation of "Patriot" missiles as a counter measure against the North Korean's, heightening tension in the Asian region. "North Korea itself is an arms bazaar where routinely Middle East countries shop for missiles. Some of the scud missiles (bought from North Korea) were used in Iraq by Saddam Husayn who is 10 times more predictable than Kim," Ople said. Technically, the Korean War which began in 1950 has not ended, although the armistice at Panmunjon negotiated in 1953 has held up for nearly four decades. Any resumption of hostilities will mean activating a multinational force to face an invasion of South Korea, Ople said. He expressed hopes that the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) and Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE), along with the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), have contingency plans as there are an estimated 40,000 Filipinos in South Korea.
