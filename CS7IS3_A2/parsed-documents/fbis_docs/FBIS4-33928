More than 10,000 workers took to the streets to participate in the largest labor rally in the past decade. The movement was headed by the so-called Movement for Union Organization and Action. Workers are protesting over the national economic policy and demanding a general salary increase in the province. The column marched through the downtown area surrounded by 1,000 police agents. There were no serious incidents, but noise bombs detonated by demonstrators did destroy one shop window. Governor Eduardo Angeloz admitted "the legitimacy of the workers' claims." He said: "Their protest and claims are reasonable, but regrettably I cannot satisfy their demands because the economic situation does not allow me to do so." Some 88 labor organizations participated in the march. Even the police supported it, promising to carry out only "preventive activities for demonstrators security." The schedule called for the workers to leave their place of work at 1000 and gather on the corner of Colon and General Paz Streets in downtown Cordoba. The first groups to arrive were road workers and post office workers. They were followed by court employees and civil servants. Sanitary workers and teachers, the most numerous group, joined them shortly afterward. Representatives of the 80 unions arrived around noon. President Menem's administration and Eduardo Angeloz' government were the main topic of the protest songs. [passage omitted]
