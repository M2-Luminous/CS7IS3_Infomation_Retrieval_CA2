At present, Boiling Water Reactors (BWR) Nos. 1,2,3 5 (1.1 million kW, each) are in operation. Under construction at present are BWR No. 4 (1.1 million kW) and the advanced BWR (ABWR) Nos. 6 and 7 (each 1.356 million kW). The combined output of these 7 reactors, amounting to 8.212 million kW, is the largest in the world. Kashiwazaki-Kariba Nuclear Power Plant Positional Diagram No matter where you look, here or abroad, it would be difficult to find another power plant which is adding three more nuclear reactors. Japan's Kashiwazaki-Kariba Nuclear Power Plant, moreover, will become the world's first ABWR power plant. The energy source development plays a central role in Japan's energy policy. For a long time, the light water reactor is expected to become the ``main stream.'' At the same time, advancement of light water reactor technology is being pursued. Kashiwazaki-Kariba Nuclear Power Plant, therefore, will become a great nuclear power base satisfying those demands. At Kashiwazaki-Kariba plant, Reactor No. 3 began operating on 11 August 1993. The total output of the plant now equals to that of Fukushima Second Nuclear Power Plant, viz., 4.4 million kW. Moreover, at this point, Tokyo Electric Power's nuclear power facilities, equipped with 14 reactors, are generating 13.4198 million kW. This output represents approximately 27% of the total power generation facilities. Of the power generation facilities currently under construction, Reactor No. 4, whose construction began in February 1988, achieved an overall progress rate of 95.3% at the end of September 1993. The loading of fuels began on 7 October. Its commercial operations will begin in July 1994. Reactors Nos. 3 and 4 are attracting attention as the world's first ABWR, an advanced version of BWR featuring improved safety, reliability, operationality, and work ratio. Construction of Reactor No. 6 began in September 1991 and that of Reactor No. 7 in February 1992. Their progress rates at the end of September are 48.3% and 20.8%, respectively. For Reactor No. 6, fitting of steel plate lining of a reactor containment vessel made of reinforced concrete almost has been completed. Its pressure vessel will be installed in September 1994. For Reactor No. 7, a base mat construction, which is a basic construction on a base rock, will be completed some time in October; a pressure vessel will be installed in June 1995. Reactor No. 6 will start operating commercially in December 1996, and Reactor No. 7 in July 1997. The foremost characteristic of ABWR is that a nuclear reactor recirculation pump, designed to circulate water within the reactor, which has been installed outside the reactor pressure vessel, will be replaced by the ``pressure vessel internal pump.'' This has made it possible to reduce the number of pipes arranged within a recirculation system. Consequently, in an emergency situation, a reactor core will not be exposed; moreover, since the sizes of reactor containment vessel and reactor housing can be reduced, construction cost also can be lowered. Graphic Furthermore, many next-generation technologies are employed in constructing ABWR. For instance, use of an integral construction in the reinforced concrete reactor containment vessel and reactor housing increased their resistance to vibration. Moreover, multiple functions equipped with, in addition to hydraulic pressure drive, an electric motor drive designed to work at slow pace as well, is used in a control rod drive system. Tokyo Electric Power ordered main power generation units (nuclear reactor, turbine, and generator), constituting the two-thirds of total construction costs of Reactor Nos. 6 and 7, from the International Joint Venture (JV), a joint venture of General Electric (GE), Toshiba, and Hitachi. Of these, the amount of order received by GE is approximately one-third, or approximately 1.4 billion dollars (approximately ¥190 billion; each unit, approximately ¥95 billion). Construction of ABWR, therefore, contributes to reducing Japan's trade surplus against the United States. In Process of Transforation into Software Base Total construction cost of Reactors Nos. 1-7 reaches ¥2.6256 trillion. At the point when Reactor No. 7 will become operational, Tokyo Electric Power's nuclear power generation facilities will have had a total of 17 reactors, generating 17.38 million kW all together. The total nuclear power output will constitute 30.8% of the company's entire power generation facilities, including hydraulic and thermal power plants. This clearly indicates the importance of Kashiwazaki-Kariba as a source of power. Its secondary effects on Niigata Prefecture's economy, including its regional development plan, also are spreading. The amount of subsidy received under Three Laws concerning Power Source Development is approximately ¥76.1 billion. Of this amount, Kashiwazaki City, the site of plant construction, received approximately ¥24.2 billion and Kariba, approximately ¥21.5 billion. At the end of August, the number of those employed was 2,088 in Kashiwazaki City and 299 in Kariba. When these numbers are combined with those in other regions of the prefecture, the total is 4,209. The most noticeable change brought about by the construction of the nuclear power plants at Kashiwazaki-Kariba most likely is an increase in local population. To begin with, Kashiwazaki City, considered the cradle of the petroleum industry, is the locality whose economy is deeply rooted in energy. Even today, its production of natural gas, with the annual output of 370 million km[.sup]3[/], constitute approximately 17.3% of the national output. However, ``from 1955 to 1970, its source of revenues were depleted because we did not have the key industry. With a large number of people either leaving or seeking seasonal work elsewhere, the problem of depopulation became accurate. We realized that we had to take action.'' (Masasumi Nishikawa, Mayor of Kashiwazaki City). In fact, in 1969, at the time the city voted for the nuclear power plant construction, the size of its population was no more than 80,000. Today, thanks to the nuclear power plant, our city is one of those cities whose population has reached the 90,000 mark. In the case of Kashiwazaki City, the adoption of the policy to spend revenues generated by the Kashiwazaki-Kariba project in developing human resources and employment opportunities has paid off in the ``creation of a city with charm.'' The regional development policy played a nucleus role in this undertaking. Kashiwazaki City, which has been successful in persuading two four-year universities to relocate to the city, currently is devoting its effort in building a ``software base.'' In order to vitalize the region through use of advanced information technology, a ground for facility installation for use in training of information personnel and in bringing the software industry to the city has been prepared. What the city envisions are to create jobs for young people and to establish the information industry in the region. Guided by the ``concept of high-vision community,'' the city is moving toward the creation of a software base, integrating industrial and academic endeavors centering around imaging information technology. At that juncture, Kashiwazaki City, will emerge as an information city as well, this being done while maintaining its role as an energy supply base, which is founded on regional development. Interview with Mr. Masasumi Nishikawa, Mayor of Kashiwazaki NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: What is your opinion concerning subsidies granted under Three Laws concerning power source development? Nishikawa: In the case of Kashiwazaki City, a subsidy granted under Three Laws concerning power source development will be terminated soon. So the game is over insofar as we are concerned. My feeling about Three Laws is that there should be more flexibility. I am mentioning this for the benefit of those regions which will be involved in power development projects. However, in reality, these restrictions do not have severe crippling effects. Even if restrictions exist, delay in organizing a foundation does not leave one without a menu of work to choose from. We simplified the matter by thinking that all we had to do under the circumstance was to concentrate on the basics for the previous stage. NIKKO KOGYO SHIMBUN: What about the fixed asset tax? Nishikawa: The most important thing insofar as city finance is concerned is to secure a constant source of revenues. As you know, Three Laws grants a subsidy whenever a company undertakes the construction of a new reactor, but that is as far as it goes. Afterward, we have to deal with depreciation assets tax. However, the tax will go down as the assets depreciate. Since it is not constant, the headache associated with it is not uniquely Kashiwazaki but applicable to all other cities, towns, and villages, as well, where part of their lands are marked off for construction of nuclear power plants. We don't believe that we should spend the entire amount of subsidies received simply because it is made available to us. We are, therefore, searching for ways in which the money can be made useful to succeeding generations. Fifteen years is the term of repayment of a loan on nuclear power facilities, but the actual work continues much longer. Our association with the nuclear power plant also will continue. Since our source of revenues will dwindle over the years, while stretching the depreciable assets, we should take a step to find a new steady source of revenues--these are the things which we wish to see achieved, although we do realize that legislating a new taxation will be difficult. NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: More specifically-- Nishikawa: At present, a nuclear fuel tax is granted to the prefecture. Since this tax will be imposed on fuel loading as long as nuclear power is at work, it is a semi-permanent source of revenues. Especially in the case of Kashiwazaki-Kariba, the tax amount involved when all seven reactors become operative will be huge. In order to see that a certain percentage of the tax will be allocated to regional cities, towns, and villages, where part of lands are used for constructing nuclear power plants, we will request not only national guidelines but prefecture's actions as well. Moreover, a preferential measure has a proviso stating ``limited to future additions or new construction sites.'' This is contrary to what the country said previously. We are urging the prefecture not to forget the hard work put in by those connected with earlier nuclear power plant construction sties. NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: Can you tell me something about the disaster prevention measure from the local viewpoint? Nishikawa: We want the national government to provide guidelines which are a little more structured and centralized. We like to see the Ministry of Home Affairs, MITI, and Science and Technology Agency come together in dealing with the problem of nuclear disaster prevention. NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: Can you talk on the secondary effects of nuclear power plant on Kashiwazaki-Kariba residents? Nishikawa: At present, the plants employ 2,900 locals. These are stable jobs in terms of future as well. The total amount invested was ¥2.6 trillion. The fact that such a huge amount of money was brought into our region certainly is a big plus. For instance, in 1972, only 20% of our high-school graduates settled in Kashiwazaki. Today, this figure has risen to over 50%. This is brought about not only by Tokyo Electric Power but also by the development of various facilities which, in turn, can be attributed to power plants built in this region. In the field of educational undertaking, we have been successful to have two four-year universities relocate to this region. Moreover, in 1990, the region was designated as a high-vision community model region. Currently, our major effort goes into developing software industry in which imaging plays a central role. NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: Your picture of the future of Kashiwazaki and nuclear power? Nishikawa: Currently, we are developing three reactors. Kashiwazaki and Tokyo Electric Power are like a married couple raising children. The construction work give us a feeling of climbing a hill, which we rather enjoy. However, once our role in child rearing is finished, we believe that there will be a stringent demand--unlike any we thus far have experienced--placed on both sides. How does Tokyo Electric Power feel about being in this region ten, twenty years from now? Do they find it meaningful? I am not talking about money or material things. We want to make serious effort in thinking out this type of problem. I hope that the company will do the same. BTC Niigata Center An operator training firm for BWR Nuclear Power Plant, the BWR Operation Training Center (BTC, 651 Fuzawa Aza Chuodai, Okuma-machi, Futaba-gun, Fukushima Prefecture. President: Mr. Yuhiro Mizuno), invested a total of ¥5 billion to construct the second training base, ``BTR Niigata Center,'' (a building area: 5,600m[.sup]2[/]) in Kariba Village. Training already has begun at the center. Six companies which are using BWR consists of [Japan Nuclear Power Generation Co.], and Tohoku, Tokyo, Chubu, Hokuriku, and Chugoku Electric Power Companies. The BTC Niigata Center will deal with the need for improved operational safety and stability created by the addition of nuclear power facility sites on the Japan Sea Coast, such as Kashiwazaki-Kariba. The center's main facility consist of a 1.1 million kW class simulation model of Reactor No. 4 used in operational training, viz., Simulator No. 4, and computer-assisted instruction (CAI) units. The center can train two 4-member teams a day. The simulator is an exact model of the power plant's central control panel. Training with the simulator provides trainees with the feeling of working with the actual equipment. In addition to routine plant operations, such as start and stop, through use of hypothetical accidents, training in handling of emergency situations can be repeated as frequently as required. The center will install an ABWR operational training simulator in the summer of 1994. With this installed facility, the center looks ahead to the need which must be filled when Reactors Nos. 6 and 7 begin operating. Before the actual equipment becomes operative, therefore, the center wants to see that it has well-trained ABWR operators ready to go when the time comes.
