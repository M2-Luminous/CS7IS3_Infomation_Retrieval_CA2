E." report: "Nuclear Accidents: Franco-Russian Simulation"] [Text] At a time when shutting down the Chernobyl power station is once again in the news because of Ukrainian blackmail aimed at ensuring its closure, the French and Russians have just engaged in the simulation of a large-scale disaster of the same type as that of Chernobyl. The objective was to test, with the help of the French Nuclear Protection and Safety Institute (IPSN), the Russian organization in the sphere of protecting populations and administering contaminated areas in the case of radioactive contamination of extensive areas. The former Soviet Union's experience is unique in this sphere with the nuclear disasters of Chelyabinsk in 1958 and Chernobyl in 1986. The exercise, which required one year's preparation, was held from 21 to 25 June 1993 in the Kaluga region, a Russian territory already strongly affected by the effects of the Chernobyl explosion. The scenario and the facts are, moreover, directly inspired by the Ukrainian tragedy and the reaction of the local public authorities and the population at the time. Representatives of the administration, experts, representatives of the population and the media took part in the operation. They had to face the problems which arise not only immediately after the accident but also 16 days, then one year, and five years afterwards. A satellite link with the IPSN center in Fontenay-aux-Roses enabled French experts to participate directly in the operation. The analysis of the results of the experiment, which was carried out last week, demonstrated the split which exists among the three main protagonists, namely the experts, the administration, and the media. The first complain in particular of not always being heeded by civil servants who, often fearing panic among the population and the spread of rumors, tend to do nothing. This response is found again in their relations with the media. The French and Russians were able to broadly examine their decisionmaking processes, and their crisis management techniques, an exercise which was sufficiently productive for the two partners to decide to repeat the experiment in summer 1995 in Chelyabinsk, the other unfortunately famous site of the Soviet nuclear industry.
