Lambeck: "Success for Yeltsin"] [Text] Helmut Kohl has helped his Russian friend Boris Yeltsin achieve a great and visible success during his state visit. Moscow will certainly acknowledge the outcome of this visit with satisfaction: The Germans are no longer insisting on a ceremony in Weimar. The Russian troops will be seen off in Berlin for the whole of 31 August -- with a celebration such as the one staged to say farewell to the Western allies in Berlin yesterday. On an international level, the chancellor has committed himself to helping Moscow. Germany wants to bring about Russian membership in the European Council, although some criticism has already been voiced by that organization. Furthermore, Germany wants Russia to be included as a major economic nation. Whether the other partners will agree to the G-7 being extended to G-8 remains to be seen. Yeltsin made hardly any concessions: No decision has been made on a German consulate in Kaliningrad; no success has been achieved in the tiresome matter of returning German cultural assets. The only field where positive signals came from Yeltsin's side was NATO's Partnership for Peace program. Kohl's success during this visit is of an atmospheric nature. The cordial embraces he shared with Yeltsin indicate the closeness of relations between the key European powers, Germany and Russia. This basis can be used for working on unsolved problems.
