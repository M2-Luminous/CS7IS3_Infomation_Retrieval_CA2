A rainbow could be seen in the gray sky above Bosnia-Herzegovina in the west but disappeared shortly afterward, then it was raining... Pale, the center of the Serb-controlled areas, is only some dozens of kilometers away from Gorazde, an area bombed by NATO planes. At around 0800 there were few people on the street, and it seemed that the atmosphere was not particularly tense. Guards at the presidential palace were not on high alert. This reporter drove straight to the entrance to the presidential palace and went in to arrange an interview with their leaders, but the answer was: Our leaders are fully engaged today and have no time to spare before tomorrow at the earliest. Nor was it easy to cover the news in Gorazde. Mr. (Doholy) (duo huo li 1122 7202 6849], the Serbs' information minister, explained that the Serbian authorities had decided to black out and censor news about the situation on the battlefield in Gorazde and foreign journalists were barred from going to the area to cover the news. It was alleged that the authorities were worried that these reporters might "be in danger" in Serb-controlled areas. NATO forces have launched two air strikes against Serb positions around Gorazde since 10 April, and Serb leader Karadzic has only delivered a brief speech on Serbian radio, thus presenting a sharp contrast to the period of "intensive news" releases in February when NATO issued an ultimatum to the Serbs. (Doholy) said that there were two reasons why the Serbs were "silent": First, the Serbs did not want to say too much because following the air strikes, the U.S. press "began to hold that the Serbs were a victim of the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina;" and second, since NATO had crossed the "Rubicon" and launched the air strikes without any warning, the Serbs did not want to whip up public opinion before making any "self-defensive" moves. The Serbian Supreme Command has issued a statement "reserving the right to self-defense" following the NATO air strikes. At what time and in what form the Serbs will make the "self-defense" moves is definitely an important factor in the future development of the situation. Some Serbian officers whom this reporter met were not willing to talk too much because they were "instructed by superiors" not to answer questions in a casual way. Serbian Defense Minister Kovacevic mentioned three points in an interview with this reporter: First, if NATO bombs Serbian positions again, the Serbs will "be forced to down NATO planes." Also, the Serbs have not used antiaircraft weapons. Second, at present the Serbs are not yet preparing to attack UN forces, but if "there is such a need," the Serbs do not rule out such a possibility. Third, the Serbs have the means to attack the NATO air base in Italy. In short, he stressed that as a great risk of escalation of the war did exist, the Serbs would "employ every means to defend themselves." Although the General Command of the Bosnian Serb armed forces is near Pale, no general could be found there today. An official of the Information Ministry said that all those generals were at the frontline or at the side of Serbian leaders. Karadzic would also go to areas near the frontline. Moreover, sources said that following the air strikes, a new round of fighting had broken out in Sarajevo, and that the "Bridge of Unity and Friendship," located in a gray area controlled neither by the Serbs nor by the Muslims, was closed on 11 April. At noon, Pale started to bustle. Students finished their classes, shops were open for business, and, taking up their umbrellas, people walked on the rainy streets. When this reporter went into a clothes shop, the shopkeeper was listening to a news broadcast, which was all about the war, meetings, and talks. When asked about whether or not he worried about escalation of the war, the shopkeeper shrugged his shoulders and said: "Worry cannot make things work, I am used to it."
