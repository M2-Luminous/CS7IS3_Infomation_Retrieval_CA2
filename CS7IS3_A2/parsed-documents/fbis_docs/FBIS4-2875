Qhobela, foreign minister of the Kingdom of Lesotho, here this afternoon. During the talks, Qian and Qhobela exchanged views on bilateral relations and on the international situation. Qian congratulated the Basutoland Congress Party on its success in last year's general election and the consequent establishment of the new government of Lesotho, and wished the new government well in making new achievements in maintaining domestic peace and in the construction of the country. Qian said that the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Lesotho laid a foundation for the development of bilateral relations, adding that he was confident that the current visit to China by Qhobela would further promote bilateral relations and cooperation. Touching on the situation in the Southern African region, Qian noted that the first general election without racial discrimination is to be held in South Africa on April 27, and that a new South Africa of racial equality is to be set up. This was the result of the long-term struggles of the South African nations and peoples, said Qian, and China supports the peace process in South Africa. The Chinese vice-premier noted that China is willing to develop cooperative relations with the new South Africa in various fields, on the basis of the five principles of peaceful co-existence. Qhobela said that the restoration of diplomatic relations between Lesotho and China will inject new strength into the promotion of bilateral relations. Qhobela invited Qian to visit Lesotho again at his convenience. Qhobela and his party arrived here on April 10 as Qian's guests.
