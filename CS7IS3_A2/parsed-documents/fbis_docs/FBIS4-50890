U.S. President Bill Clinton has to decide whether to renew one more year China's MFN status by June 3 this year. In reiterating his support for the MFN status of China, President Ramos said that a healthy relationship between China and the U.S., particularly in the area of trade, is good for the peace, stability and progress of the Asia-Pacific region. He said linking politics to trade can only lead to both sides losing out, adding that grant of MFN status should also not be selective or qualified since this could be a source of more friction. He stressed that the trade and economic issues should be divorced from political concerns and that the grant of MFN status should not subject to political conditionalities.
