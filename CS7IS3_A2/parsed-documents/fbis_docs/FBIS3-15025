He read out a statement by the chamber's Council adopted yesterday. The statement says that if any of those amnestied "lacks the brains, common sense, heart, or desire to take the path of accord, the State Duma, in accordance with the spirit and letter of the decisions adopted and together with the president, will find an opportunity to take measures to prevent the situation in the country being destabilized." Ivan Rybkin underlined that the State Duma is ready to study constructive proposals for a mechanism to implement the amnesty resolutions adopted by the Chamber, as well as to study a draft of a memorandum agreed with other bodies of state power about the responsibility of government institutions and politicians to preserve civil peace and public order in Russia. The chairman of the State Duma said that the decisions on the amnesty were dictated by a strong conviction that Russia cannot be saved from a national crisis without an amnesty for all the participants of the notorious events in 1991 and 1993, just as it is impossible to achieve this without a stable civil peace. He underlined that during a debate of the amnesty question at a session of the chamber, the absolute majority of deputies jointly reached a formula for a achieving civil peace and national accord. It is based on a constructive cooperation with the president, all power structures, and political forces and is aimed at strengthening society and understanding the great responsibility for the rebirth of statehood and the creation of a new Russia.
