They exchanged views on the current phase of the peace process in Bosnia, particularly in light of the Washington agreement on creating a Muslim-Croat federation. After an hour and a half of talks with Milosevic, Redman said: "We have reached a very important phase in the process, which should result in a comprehensive solution to the Bosnian conflict, something that will contribute to the stability of the entire region." Recalling U.S. involvement in the peace process in Bosnia and the agreement on a Muslim-Croat federation, Redman said things on the ground were progressing successfully, adding in support of this claim that the disengagement of Muslim and Croat forces had already begun in central Bosnia. "Today's talks with President Milosevic were the first exchange of views," Redman said, and added: "My intention was to be sure that President Slobodan Milosevic fully acknowledged and understood what we are doing in the Muslim-Croat agreement." According to the special envoy of the U.S. President, it is time to work quickly to find a comprehensive solution to the Bosnian conflict: "We believe that all regional elements can play an important role in seeking a comprehensive solution. We believe that President Milosevic, as well as other regional leaders, will be actively involved in the second phase of the peace process." [passage omitted]
