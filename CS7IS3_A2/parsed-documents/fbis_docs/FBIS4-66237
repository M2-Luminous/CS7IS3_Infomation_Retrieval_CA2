Mainland China specialists have different views toward this new system. This magazine elaborates below how their views differ for references of our readers. [end editor note] Two Different Views A majority of those attending the meeting to discuss this issue considered that the tax assignment system came about because of needs in two areas: first, the need to remedy defects of the former fiscal system of partial tax revenue payments; and second, the need of a socialist market-based economic system to establish a large unified market system within China. Some considered the former fiscal system of partial payments to be unstable, inequitable and lacking in standard or transparency, that the system has a major defect in the regional monopoly created which seriously affects structural adjustment of state-owned enterprises and adversely affects development of a major unified market system within the country. The former system also caused decline in central government revenue receipts, and created national deficits which endanger investments in the country's key projects. In addition, implementation of the former system was far from equitable and contributed to further widening of the gap between rich and poor provinces, adversely affecting the national goal of bringing common prosperity to all areas. Some attendees in the meeting pointed out that the former system of partial payments had over decentralized power. As compared to the original centralized fiscal system of revenues and expenditures, the partial payments system decentralized fiscal authority to promote efficiency in resource allocation, but when the system was over-decentralized, it led to the provinces staking out their own turfs for administrative control, blocking effective allocation of resources and producing another kind of inefficiency. Attendees in the meeting also pointed out that one of the objectives of a socialist market-based economic system is to realize effective resource allocation within a national framework, which means that a unified market system should be established within this framework, and that the government fiscal system should not be an obstacle to effective allocation of resources; the tax assignment system is therefore designed to meet the objective requirements of a new fiscal system. Some attendees in the meeting, however, considered that the necessities for establishing the current tax assignment system are not self-evident, and cited the following reasons: 1) The result achieved in over ten years of reform is precisely decentralization of authority and sharing of benefits, but the tax assignment system requires reverting fiscal authority once again to the Central Government which would possibly be disadvantageous for regional and local developments; 2) the tax assignment system in a technical sense cannot yet be implemented because from the beginning of reform to the present, different sources and kinds of taxes have evolved and changed in the absence of a stable and standardized taxation system; therefore, given current conditions, now is not the right time to put the tax assignment system into effect and that the right time may not come for a number of years; 3) the division of responsibilities and authorities between the Center and the regions is not clearly delineated at this point, and it would be difficult to divide fiscal authority in a scientific and reasonable manner while the limits on the authority over revenue receipts and expenditures are still evolving; 4) the result of implementing the tax assignment system under current conditions may very well produce a situation of "hitting the son for losing an argument with the father," which adversely affects regional economic growth since provincial, municipal and lower level governments, faced with a fiscal crisis, may well turn to raising taxes on enterprises. Different Justifications for the Tax Assignment System In explaining the tax assignment system, a majority of attendees felt that it should be a system of fiscal responsibility differentiated by level of authority, and that it should involve not only tax assignment but also separate systems. But the law setting up the tax assignment system shows there are different views: some people felt that it should be a system of separate fiscal authorities focused on assignment of taxes; others felt that it should be a system of fiscal management differentiated by level of authority with tax assignment as the foundation; and still others simply thought that there are problems in the system itself, and calling it a system of assignment of taxes is calling for separation of authority, and if the system means that fiscal authority is differentiated by level of authority, then one should first make clear who has the authority for expenditures before deciding who should be responsible for revenue collection. And it would be more in line with reality if the reform is defined as a system of fiscal or budgeting authority differentiated by level of authority. Some of the attendees were ingenious by explaining the tax assignment system in terms of a "triangular system" with separate components of taxes, authority and mechanism; they pointed out that tax assignment is the precondition, that separation of authority is the crux and that separation in the operating mechanism is a guarantee; they emphasized therefore that the tax assignment system should be carried out on the basis of these three elements. Nature of the Separation of Fiscal Authority With respect to the nature of the tax assignment system, the attendees proceeded to discuss whether the separation of fiscal authority in the tax assignment system means separation of administrative authority or separation in more meaningful economic terms. Some attendees felt that the prerequisite of the system is that administrative authorities and enterprise responsibilities should be separated, and that lacking such a precondition, any kind of separation of fiscal authority means only some form of administrative authority. But under the tax assignment system, separation of fiscal authority should be made in more meaningful economic terms. At present, the reform of the production authority system in state-owned enterprises will determine the basic characteristics of fiscal authority separation in the tax assignment system, and only when results of the above-mentioned reform give assurance that government administrative authority and enterprise responsibility are completely separated can fiscal authority separation be truly justified in economic terms. The attendees felt that in implementing any reform of the tax assignment system, China should follow international practices as much as possible, and draw upon experiences in dealing with such an issue by other countries with modern market-based economies. International Customary Practices in Tax Assignment System Some attendees felt that in drawing on international experiences, the following aspects are most important: First, whether the country is large or small, a federated or unitary state, a developed or developing country, international experiences demonstrate that a central government must effectively control the most important sources of revenues in the national economy, and this is not only reflected in the laws and policies governing revenue collection, but also manifested in administrative management and collection of tax revenue; second, for government at every level, revenue receipts must be adequate to enable government carry out its responsibility for expenditures; third, the central government's authority for and ability to effective carry out macroeconomic coordination should be assured; fourth, any system of fiscal relationships devised by government should be conducive to development of a unified market system within the national borders and promotion of effective allocation of resources; fifth, in terms of regional fiscal independence and promoting regional enthusiasm, a central government should also have the wherewithal to effectively transfer resources to poorer regions in order to narrow the gap in revenue receipts and allocations between regions; i.e., a central government must have regular financial surpluses derived from revenue receipts which exceed expenditures; sixth, duplication of responsibility for expenditures between central and regional governments must be reduced to the minimum; seventh, a central government should use a transparent and equitable system of financial subsidies to transfer resources to regional governments and, in the process doing so, encourage and energize regional authorities to vigorously mobilize for revenue collection while carrying out its own macroeconomic coordination policy.
