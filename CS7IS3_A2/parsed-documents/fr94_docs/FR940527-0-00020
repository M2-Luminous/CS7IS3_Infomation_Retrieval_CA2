FR940527-0-00020 FR940527-0-00006 14 CFR Part 71 [Airspace Docket No. 94&hyph;AWP&hyph;14] Establishment of Class E Airspace Areas AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule; request for comments. SUMMARY: This action establishes Class E airspace areas at Edwards AFB, CA, LeMoore NAS (Reeves Field), CA, Stockton Metropolitan Airport, CA, Hilo International, General Lyman Field, HI, Kaneohe MCAS, HI, Lihue Airport, HI, San Jose International Airport, CA, El Toro MCAS, CA, Phoenix Luke AFB, AZ, Santa Barbara Municipal Airport, CA, Tuscon-Ryan Field, AZ, Crows Landing NALF, CA, and Mountain View, Moffett Field NAS, CA. Presently, these areas are designated as Class D airspace when the associated control tower is in operation. However, controlled airspace to the surface is needed when the control towers located at these areas are closed. The intended effect of this action is to provide adequate Class E airspace for instrument flight rule (IFR) operations when these control towers are closed. This action also revises the Class E4 airspace area at Point Mugu NAWS, CA, to indicate that this airspace area, as an extension to the Pt. Mugu part-time Class D airspace area, is part-time. This action also revises the Class E4 airspace areas at Hilo International, General Lyman Field, HI, and Lihue Airport, HI, to show that these airspace areas are full-time and revises the Class E3 airspace area at Santa Barbara Municipal Airport, CA to show that it is full time. DATES: Effective date: 0901 UTC, August 18, 1994. Comment date: Comments must be received on or before August 11, 1994.

The Rule This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) establishes Class E airspace areas at Edwards AFB, CA, LeMoore NAS (Reeves Field), CA, Stockton Metropolitan Airport, CA, Hilo International, General Lyman Field, HI, Kaneohe MCAS, HI, Lihue Airport, HI, San Jose International Airport, CA, El Toro MCAS, CA, Phoenix Luke AFB, AZ, Santa Barbara Municipal Airport, CA, Tuscon-Ryan Field, AZ, Crows Landing NALF, CA, and Mountain View, Moffett Field NAS, CA. Currently, this airspace is designated as Class D when the associated control tower is in operation. Nevertheless, controlled airspace to the surface is needed for IFR operations at Edwards AFB, CA, LeMoore NAS (Reeves Field), CA, Stockton Metropolitan Airport, CA, Hilo International, General Lyman Field, HI, Kaneohe MCAS, HI, Lihue Airport, HI, San Jose International Airport, CA, El Toro MCAS, CA, Phoenix Luke AFB, AZ, Santa Barbara Municipal Airport, CA, Tuscon-Ryan Field, AZ, Crows Landing NALF, CA, and Mountain View, Moffett Field NAS, CA, when the control towers are closed. The intended effect of this action is to provide adequate Class E airspace for IFR operations at these airports when these control towers are closed.
