Introduction and Overview This is the fourth annual report 1 on the differences in capital standards and accounting practices that currently exist among the three banking agencies (the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)) and the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS). 2 Section One of the report focuses on differences in the agencies' capital standards; Section Two discusses differences in accounting standards. The remainder of this introduction provides an overview of the discussion contained in these sections. 1 The first two reports prepared by the Federal Reserve Board were made pursuant to section 1215 of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA). The third report was made pursuant to section 121 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA), which superseded section 1215 of FIRREA. 2 At the federal level, the Federal Reserve System has primary supervisory responsibility for state-chartered banks that are members of the Federal Reserve System as well as all bank holding companies. The FDIC has primary responsibility for state nonmember banks and FDIC-supervised savings banks. National banks are supervised by the OCC. The OTS has primary responsibility for savings and loan associations. Capital Standards As stated in the previous reports to the Congress, the three bank regulatory agencies have, for a number of years, employed a common regulatory framework that establishes minimum capital adequacy ratios for commercial banking organizations. In 1989, all three banking agencies as well as the OTS, adopted a risk-based capital framework that was based upon the international capital accord developed by the Basle Committee on Banking Regulations and Supervisory Practices (Basle Accord) and endorsed by the central bank governors of the G-10 countries. The risk-based capital framework establishes minimum ratios of total and Tier 1 (core) capital to risk-weighted assets. The Basle Accord requires banking organizations to have total capital equal to at least 8 percent, and Tier 1 capital equal to at least 4 percent, of risk-weighted assets after a phase-in period which ended on December 31, 1992. Tier 1 capital is principally comprised of common shareholders' equity and qualifying perpetual preferred stock, less disallowed intangibles such as goodwill. The other component of total capital, Tier 2, may include certain supplementary capital items, such as general loan loss reserves and subordinated debt. The risk-based capital requirements are viewed by the three banking agencies and the OTS as minimum standards, and most institutions are expected to, and generally do, maintain capital levels well above the minimums. In addition to specifying identical ratios, the risk-based capital framework implemented by the three banking agencies includes a common definition of regulatory capital and a uniform system of risk weights and categories. While the minimum standards and risk weighting framework are common to all the banking agencies, there are some technical differences in language and interpretation among the agencies. The OTS employs a similar risk-based capital framework although it differs in some respects from that adopted by the three banking agencies. These differences, as well as other technical differences in the agencies' capital standards, are discussed in Section One of this report. In addition to the risk-based capital requirements, the agencies also have established leverage standards setting forth minimum ratios of capital to total assets. As discussed in Section One, the three banking agencies employ uniform leverage standards, while the OTS has established, pursuant to FIRREA, somewhat different standards. The staffs of the agencies meet regularly to identify and address differences and inconsistencies in their capital standards. The agencies are committed to continuing this process in an effort to achieve full uniformity in their capital standards. In this regard, Section One contains discussions of the banking agencies' efforts during the past year to achieve uniformity with respect to the risk categories of certain assets, specifically, identifiable intangible assets, loans to finance construction of 1- to 4-family residential homes that have been pre-sold, and multifamily housing loans. In addition, the agencies have worked together to revise the risk-based capital requirements as required by provisions of section 305 of FDICIA to take account of interest rate risk and risks arising from concentrations of credit and nontraditional activities. Finally, staffs of the agencies have been meeting in 1993 to discuss a uniform draft proposal that would amend their risk-based capital guidelines to provide for recognition of bilateral netting arrangements associated with rate contracts that genuinely reduce credit risk. Accounting Standards Over the years, the three banking agencies, under the auspices of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC), have developed Uniform Reports of Condition and Income (Call Reports) for all commercial banks and FDIC-supervised savings banks. The reporting standards followed by the three banking agencies are substantially consistent, aside from a few limited exceptions, with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as they are applied by commercial banks. 3 The uniform bank Call Report serves as the basis for calculating risk-based capital and leverage ratios, as well as for other regulatory purposes. Thus, material differences in regulatory accounting and reporting standards among commercial banks and FDIC-supervised savings banks do not exist. 3 In those cases where bank Call Report standards are different from GAAP, the regulatory reporting requirements are intended to be more conservative than GAAP. The OTS requires each thrift institution to file the Thrift Financial Report (TFR), which is consistent with GAAP as it is applied by thrifts. The TFR differs in some respects from the bank Call Report. One reason is that thrift GAAP is different in a few limited areas from GAAP as it is applied by banks; another, as previously mentioned, is that there are a few minor areas in which the bank Call Report departs from bank GAAP. A summary of the differences between the bank Call Report and the TFR is presented in Section Two. Over the past year, the three banking agencies and the OTS have continued to undertake projects that seek to simplify and reduce differences in reporting standards between commercial banks and thrift institutions. On June 10, 1993, the four agencies announced six initiatives to implement the President's March 10 program to improve the availability of credit to businesses and individuals. These initiatives included changes to regulatory reporting requirements, all of which are consistent with GAAP. In this respect, the agencies separately issued guidance to banks and thrifts that generally conforms regulatory reporting requirements for sales of Other Real Estate Owned (OREO) with GAAP, as set forth in FASB Statement No. 66. These changes generally eliminated a 10 percent minimum down payment requirement needed by the borrower/purchaser to record a sale of OREO for regulatory reporting purposes. In addition, as part of these initiatives, the agencies issued joint policies on restoring nonaccrual loans to performing status and improving the reporting guidance on insubstance foreclosures. Although these actions end the first phase of the President's credit availability program, the agencies are continuing efforts to reduce paperwork and regulatory burdens. These efforts include considering the remaining few differences between GAAP and regulatory accounting principles. In this regard, the agencies now have projects under way that are to refine and improve policies and addresses a few differences that currently exist among the agencies, including projects on recourse, netting, and hedging. Section One Differences In Capital Standards Among Federal Banking and Thrift Supervisory Agencies Leverage capital ratios The three banking agencies employ a leverage standard based upon the common definition of Tier 1 capital contained in their risk-based capital guidelines. These standards, established in the second half of 1990 and in early 1991, require the most highly-rated institutions to meet a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 3 percent. For all other institutions, these standards generally require an additional cushion of at least 100 to 200 basis points, i.e., a minimum leverage ratio of at least 4 to 5 percent, depending upon an organization's financial condition. As required by FIRREA, the OTS has established a 3 percent core capital ratio and a 1.5 percent tangible capital leverage requirement for thrift institutions. However, the OTS is in the process of finalizing a new leverage rule that will generally conform to the rules of the three banking agencies. The differences that will exist after the OTS has adopted its new standard pertain to the definition of core capital. While this definition generally conforms to Tier 1 bank capital, certain adjustments discussed below apply to the core capital definition used by savings associations. In addition, core capital as currently defined by the OTS includes qualifying supervisory goodwill. Such goodwill is to be phased out of thrift core capital by the end of 1994, after which time the treatment of goodwill for thrift institutions will be consistent with that of the banking agencies. Risk-based capital ratios The three banking agencies have adopted risk-based capital standards consistent with the Basle Accord. These standards, which were fully phased in at the end of 1992, require all commercial banking organizations to maintain a minimum ratio of total capital (Tier 1 plus Tier 2) to risk-weighted assets of 8 percent. Tier 1 capital comprises common stockholders' equity, qualifying perpetual preferred stock, and minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries, less goodwill. Tier 1 capital must comprise at least 50 percent of the total risk-based capital requirement. Tier 2 capital includes such components as general loan loss reserves, subordinated term debt, and certain other preferred stock and convertible debt capital instruments, subject to appropriate limitations and conditions. Risk-weighted assets are calculated by assigning risk weights of 0, 20, 50, and 100 percent to broad categories of assets and off-balance sheet items based upon their relative credit risks. The OTS has adopted a risk-based capital standard that in most respects is similar to the framework adopted by the banking agencies. Beginning with year-end 1992, the OTS standard requires a minimum risk-based capital ratio equal to 8 percent. All the banking agencies view the risk-based capital standard as a minimum supervisory benchmark. In part, this is because the risk-based capital standard focuses primarily on credit risk; it does not take full or explicit account of certain other banking risks, such as exposure to changes in interest rates. The full range of risks to which depository institutions are exposed are reviewed and evaluated carefully during on-site examinations. In view of these risks, most banking organizations are expected to operate with capital levels well above the minimum risk-based and leverage capital requirements. The Federal Reserve has for some time been working with the other U.S. banking agencies and the regulatory authorities on the Basle Supervisors' Committee to develop possible methods to measure and address certain market and price risks. In April, 1993, the Basle Supervisors' Committee issued a consultative paper that addresses, among other items, proposals to include certain risks into the framework of the Basle Accord. These risks include exposures resulting from imbalances between the maturity of debt instruments held as assets and issued as liabilities and holdings of traded debt and equity securities. One important reason for addressing these risks on an international level is to develop supervisory approaches that do not undermine the competitiveness of U.S. banking organizations. Notwithstanding this initial effort, the OTS capital standards for some time have taken into account interest rate risk and the FRB, OCC and FDIC sought public comment on a proposed framework for incorporating into their capital standards interest rate risk in August, 1992, as required under section 305 of FDICIA. In response to concerns raised and recommendations made by commenters, on September 14, 1993, the three banking agencies issued for public comment a substantially modified proposal on interest rate risk. The approach ultimately adopted by the banking agencies could differ from that already taken by the OTS. Section 305 of FDICIA also requires the banking agencies to amend their risk-based capital rules to take account of concentrations of credit risk and nontraditional activities. During 1993 the staffs of the four agencies met regularly to draft proposals for public consideration. Final proposals are expected to be issued in the first part of 1994. In addition to coordinating their efforts to implement section 305, the agencies also worked together to eliminate differences in their capital standards, as well as to revise their standards in response to legislative mandates, accounting changes, and industry concerns. In this regard, during 1993, the three banking agencies eliminated the principal difference in their capital standards when they issued final rules revising those standards with regard to the types of intangible assets that may be included in the Tier 1 capital calculation for risk-based and leverage capital purposes. Specifically, under these final rules, banking organizations may include in capital purchased mortgage servicing rights (PMSRs) and purchased credit card relationships (PCCRs), but are required to deduct from capital core deposit intangibles (CDIs) and other identifiable intangible assets. The final rule also included limits and discounts that are applicable to PMSRs and PCCRs in capital. The OTS draft final rule, which is consistent with the final rule issued by the other agencies, is currently under review. Another difference the federal banking agencies worked to eliminate during 1993 was the risk-based capital treatment of multifamily housing loans. While the three banking agencies assign multifamily housing loans (5 units or more) to the 100 percent risk category, the OTS allows certain multifamily mortgage loans to qualify for the 50 percent risk category. This would apply, for example, to loans secured by buildings with 5-36 units (as described below). This effort was undertaken pursuant to section 618 of the Resolution Trust Corporation Refinancing, Restructuring, and Improvement Act of 1991 (RTCRRIA), which requires the agencies to lower the risk weight for multifamily housing loans meeting certain criteria from 100 to 50 percent. At the time of this report, final rules have not been issued by the agencies, although it is anticipated that they will be uniform and will be issued in the very near future. Section 618 of the RTCRRIA also required the agencies to revise their risk-based capital guidelines to lower from 100 percent to 50 percent the risk category for certain construction loans for presold 1- to 4-family residential properties. During 1993, the four agencies issued similar final rules implementing this provision of section 618. The staffs of the four agencies also have been coordinating the issuance of uniform proposals to include in Tier 1 capital the net unrealized changes in value of securities available for sale for purposes of calculating the risk-based and leverage capital ratios of banking organizations. This proposal effectively would result in the adoption, for regulatory capital purposes, of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement of Financial Accountant Standards No. 115 (FASB 115), ``Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.'' It is expected that the agencies will issue proposals for public comment in the very near term. In response to industry recommendations, and in conjunction with the Basle Supervisors' Committee consultative paper issued in April, 1993, the staffs of the four agencies have been meeting to draft uniform rules which would amend their risk-based capital standards with regard to bilateral netting arrangements. Specifically, the proposals would seek public comment on whether to recognize for risk-based capital purposes bilateral netting arrangements associated with interest and foreign exchange rate contracts. Such netting arrangements would have to genuinely reduce credit risk and be enforceable in all relevant jurisdictions as evidenced by well-founded and reasoned legal opinions. It is anticipated that the agencies will issue proposals on this matter early in 1994. Differences among the risk-based capital standards of the OTS and the three banking agencies are discussed below. Certain collateralized transactions On December 23, 1992, the Federal Reserve Board issued, after an appropriate public comment period, an amendment to its risk-based and leverage capital guidelines for state member banks and bank holding companies that lowers from 20 to 0 percent the risk category for collateralized transactions meeting certain criteria. This preferential treatment is only available for claims collateralized by cash on deposit in the bank or by securities issued or guaranteed by OECD central governments or U.S. government agencies. In addition, a positive margin of collateral must be maintained on a daily basis fully taking into account any change in the banking organization's exposure to the obligor or counterparty under a claim in relation to the market value of the collateral held in support of that claim. The OCC, on August 18, 1993, issued a proposal for public comment that would also lower the risk weight for certain collateralized transactions. The FDIC and OTS are considering similar proposals. Equity investments In general, commercial banks that are members of the Federal Reserve System are not permitted to invest in equity securities, nor are they generally permitted to engage in real estate investment or development activities. To the extent that commercial banks are permitted to hold equity securities (for example, in connection with debts previously contracted), the three banking agencies generally assign such investments to the 100 percent risk category for risk-based capital purposes. Under the three banking agencies' rules, the agencies may, on a case-by-case basis, deduct equity investments from the parent bank's capital or make other adjustments, if necessary, to assess an appropriate capital charge above the minimum requirement. The banking agencies' treatment of investments in subsidiaries is discussed below. The OTS risk-based capital standards require that thrift institutions deduct certain equity investments from capital over a phase-in period, which ends on July 1, 1994, as explained more fully below in the section on subsidiaries. FSLIC/FDIC - covered assets (assets subject to guarantee arrangements by the FSLIC or FDIC) The three banking agencies generally place these assets in the 20 percent risk category, the same category to which claims on depository institutions and government-sponsored agencies are assigned. The OTS places these assets in the zero percent risk category. Limitation on subordinated debt and limited-life preferred stock Consistent with the Basle Accord, the three banking agencies limit the amount of subordinated debt and limited-life preferred stock that may be included in Tier 2 capital. This limit, in effect, states that these components together may not exceed 50 percent of Tier 1 capital. In addition, maturing capital instruments must be discounted by 20 percent in each of the last five years prior to maturity. Neither of these capital components is a permanent source of funds, and subordinate debt cannot absorb losses while the bank continues to operate as a going-concern. On the other hand, both components can provide a cushion of protection to the FDIC insurance fund. Thus, this limitation permits the inclusion of some subordinated debt in capital, while assuring that permanent stockholders' equity capital remains the predominant element in bank regulatory capital. The OTS has no limitation on the total amount of limited-life preferred stock or maturing capital instruments that may be included within Tier 2 capital. In addition, the OTS allows thrifts the option of: (1) discounting maturing capital instruments, issued on or after November 7, 1989, by 20 percent a year over the last 5 years of their term -- the approach required by the banking agencies; or (2) including the full amount of such instruments provided that the amount maturing in any of the next seven years does not exceed 20 percent of the thrift's total capital. Subsidiaries Consistent with the Basle Accord and long-standing supervisory practices, the three banking agencies generally consolidate all significant majority-owned subsidiaries of the parent organization for capital purposes. This consolidation assures that the capital requirements are related to all of the risks to which the banking organization is exposed. As with most other bank subsidiaries, banking and finance subsidiaries generally are consolidated for regulatory capital purposes. However, in cases where banking and finance subsidiaries are not consolidated, the Federal Reserve, consistent with the Basle Accord, generally deducts investments in such subsidiaries in determining the adequacy of the parent bank's capital. The Federal Reserve's risk-based capital guidelines provide a degree of flexibility in the capital treatment of unconsolidated subsidiaries (other than banking and finance subsidiaries) and investments in joint ventures and associated companies. For example, the Federal Reserve may deduct investments in such subsidiaries from an organization's capital, may apply an appropriate risk-weighted capital charge against the proportionate share of the assets of the entity, may require a line-by-line consolidation of the entity, or otherwise may require that the parent organization maintain a level of capital above the minimum standard that is sufficient to compensate for any risks associated with the investment. The guidelines also permit the deduction of investments in subsidiaries that, while consolidated for accounting purposes, are not consolidated for certain specified supervisory or regulatory purposes. For example, the Federal Reserve deducts investments in, and unsecured advances to, Section 20 securities subsidiaries from the parent bank holding company's capital. The FDIC accords similar treatment to securities subsidiaries of state nonmember banks established pursuant to Section 337.4 of the FDIC regulations. Similarly, in accordance with Section 325.5(f) of the FDIC regulations, a state nonmember bank must deduct investments in, and extensions of credit to, certain mortgage banking subsidiaries in computing the parent bank's capital. (The Federal Reserve does not have a similar requirement with regard to mortgage banking subsidiaries. The OCC does not have requirements dealing specifically with the capital treatment of either mortgage banking or securities subsidiaries. The OCC, however, does reserve the right to require a national bank, on a case-by-case basis, to deduct from capital investments in, and extensions of credit to, any nonbanking subsidiary.) The deduction of investments in subsidiaries from the parent's capital is designed to ensure that the capital supporting the subsidiary is not also used as the basis of further leveraging and risk-taking by the parent banking organization. In deducting investments in, and advances to, certain subsidiaries from the parent's capital, the Federal Reserve expects the parent banking organization to meet or exceed minimum regulatory capital standards without reliance on the capital invested in the particular subsidiary. In assessing the overall capital adequacy of banking organizations, the Federal Reserve may also consider the organization's fully consolidated capital position. Under the OTS capital guidelines, a distinction, mandated by FIRREA, is drawn between subsidiaries that are engaged in activities that are permissible for national banks and subsidiaries that are engaged in ``impermissible'' activities for national banks. Subsidiaries of thrift institutions that engage only in permissible activities are consolidated on a line-by-line basis if majority-owned and on a pro rata basis if ownership is between 5 percent and 50 percent. As a general rule, investments, including loans, in subsidiaries that engage in impermissible activities are deducted in determining the capital adequacy of the parent. However, investments, including loans, outstanding as of April 12, 1989, to subsidiaries that were engaged in impermissible activities prior to that date are grandfathered and will be phased-out of capital over a transition period that expires on July 1, 1994. During this transition period, investments in subsidiaries engaged in impermissible activities that have not been phased-out of capital are to be consolidated on a pro rata basis. Qualifying multifamily mortgage loans The three banking agencies currently place multifamily mortgage loans (five units or more) in the 100 percent risk weight category. Historically, when compared to loans secured by mortgages on 1- to 4-family residences, which generally are assigned to the 50 percent risk category, the credit risk associated with multifamily mortgage loans, unless conservatively underwritten and seasoned, is more akin to that experienced on commercial property loans, which are assigned to the 100 percent risk category. The OTS allows certain multifamily mortgage loans to qualify for the 50 percent risk category. This would apply, for example, to loans secured by buildings with 5-36 units, provided these loans have a maximum 80 percent loan-to-value ratio and an 80 percent occupancy rate. Pursuant to Section 618(b) of the RTCRRIA, the three banking agencies and the OTS were directed to amend their risk-based capital guidelines to lower the risk weight of certain multifamily housing loans, and securities backed by such loans, from 100 percent to 50 percent. The section specifies several criteria that a multifamily housing loan must satisfy in order to qualify for a 50 percent risk weight. These criteria are: (1) The loan is secured by a first lien; (2) The ratio of the principal obligation to the appraised value of the property, that is, the loan-to-value ratio, does not exceed 80 percent (75 percent if the loan is based on a floating interest rate); (3) The annual net operating income generated by the property (before debt service) is not less than 120 percent of the annual debt service on the loan (115 percent if the loan is based on a floating interest rate); (4) The amortization of principal and interest occurs over a period of not more than 30 years and the minimum maturity for repayment of principal is not less than seven years; and (5) All principal and interest payments have been made on time for a period of not less than one year. In addition, Section 618(b) also provides that multifamily housing loans accorded a 50 percent risk weight must meet any underwriting characteristics that the appropriate Federal banking agency may establish, consistent with the purposes of the minimum acceptable capital requirements to maintain the safety and soundness of financial institutions. The agencies have proposed revisions to their capital standards to meet the requirement of section 618(b). It is anticipated that final rules implementing section 618(b) will be issued by the respective agencies in the very near future. Nonresidential construction and land loans The three banking agencies assign loans for real estate development and construction purposes to the 100 percent risk category. Reserves or charge-offs are required, in accordance with examiner judgment, when weaknesses or losses develop in such loans. The banking agencies have no requirement for an automatic charge-off when the amount of a loan exceeds the fair value of the property pledged as collateral for the loan. The OTS generally assigns these loans to the 100 percent risk category. However, if the amount of the loan exceeds 80 percent of the fair value of the property, that excess portion must be deducted from capital in accordance with a phase-in arrangement, which ends on July 1, 1994. Mortgage-backed securities (MBS) The three banking agencies, in general, place privately-issued MBSs in a risk category appropriate to the underlying assets but in no case to the zero percent risk category. In the case of privately-issued MBSs where the direct underlying assets are mortgages, this treatment generally results in a risk weight of 50 percent or 100 percent. Privately-issued MBSs that have government agency or government-sponsored agency securities as their direct underlying assets are generally assigned to the 20 percent risk category. The OTS assigns privately-issued high quality mortgage-related securities to the 20 percent risk category. These are, generally, privately-issued MBSs with AA or better investment ratings. At the same time, both the banking and thrift agencies automatically assign to the 100 percent risk weight category certain MBSs, including interest-only strips, residuals, and similar instruments that can absorb more than their pro rata share of loss. The Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the other banking agencies and the OTS, issued, on January 10, 1992, more specific guidance as to the types of ``high risk'' MBSs that will qualify for a 100 percent risk weight. Assets sold with recourse In general, recourse arrangements allow the purchaser of an asset to ``put'' the asset back to the originating institution under certain circumstances, for example if the asset ceases to perform satisfactorily. This, in turn, can expose the originating institution to any loss associated with the asset. As a general rule, the three banking agencies require that sales of assets involving any recourse to be reported as financings and that the assets be retained on the balance sheet. This effectively requires a full leverage and risk-based capital charge whenever assets are sold with recourse, including limited recourse. The Federal Reserve generally applies a capital charge to any off-balance sheet recourse arrangement that is the equivalent of a guarantee, regardless of the nature of the transaction that gives rise to the recourse obligation. An exception to this general rule involves pools of 1- to 4-family residential mortgages and to certain farm mortgage loans. Certain recourse transactions involving these assets are reported in the bank Call Report as sales, thereby removing these transactions from leverage ratio calculations. These transactions, which are the equivalent of off-balance sheet guarantees, involve the type of credit risk that is addressed by bank risk-based capital requirements, although some questions in this regard have been raised because of the treatment afforded these transactions for leverage purposes. The Federal Reserve has clarified its risk-based capital guidelines to ensure that recourse sales involving residential mortgages are to be taken into account for determining compliance with risk-based capital requirements. The FDIC clarified its guidelines on this matter in 1993. In general, the OTS also requires a full capital charge against assets sold with recourse. However, in the case of limited recourse, the OTS limits the capital charge to the lesser of the amount of recourse or the actual amount of capital that would otherwise be required against that asset, that is, the normal full capital charge. Some securitized asset arrangements involve the issuance of senior and subordinated classes of securities against pools of assets. When a bank originates such a transaction by placing loans that it owns in a trust and retaining any portion of the subordinated securities, the banking agencies require that capital be maintained against the entire amount of the asset pool. When a bank acquires a subordinated security in a pool of assets that it did not originate, the banking agencies assign the investment in the subordinated piece to the 100 percent risk-weight category. The Federal Reserve carefully reviews these instruments to determine if additional reserves, asset write-downs, or capital are necessary to protect the bank. The OTS requires that capital be maintained against the entire amount of the asset pool in both of the situations described in the preceding paragraph. Additionally, the OTS applies a capital charge to the full amount of assets being serviced when the servicer is required to absorb credit losses on the assets being serviced. In 1990, the three banking agencies and the OTS, under the FFIEC, issued for public comment a fact finding paper pertaining to the wide range of issues relating to recourse arrangements. These issues include the definition of ``recourse'' and the appropriate reporting and capital treatments to be applied to recourse arrangements, as well as so-called recourse servicing arrangements and limited recourse. The objective of this effort was to develop a comprehensive and uniform approach to recourse arrangements for capital adequacy, reporting, and other regulatory purposes. The comments received were very extensive and generally illustrated the extreme complexity of the subject. In view of the project's significance and complexity, the FFIEC in December 1990 decided to narrow the scope of the initial phase of the recourse project to credit-related risks, including the appropriate treatment of credit-related recourse arrangements that involve limited recourse or that support a third party's assets. A recourse working group, composed of representatives from the member agencies of the FFIEC, presented a report and recommendations to the FFIEC in August 1992 and were directed to carry out a study of the impact of their recommendations on depository institutions, financial markets, and other affected parties. The interagency group carried out this study in early 1993. As a result of that study, the working group has revised several of their recommendations to reflect market practice. Proposals for public comment are expected to be issued shortly. Agricultural loan loss amortization In the computation of regulatory capital, those banks accepted into the agricultural loan loss amortization program pursuant to Title VIII of the Competitive Equality Banking Act of 1987 are permitted to defer and amortize losses incurred on agricultural loans between January 1, 1984 and December 31, 1991. The program also applies to losses incurred between January 1, 1983 and December 31, 1991, as a result of reappraisals and sales of agricultural Other Real Estate Owned (OREO) and agricultural personal property. These loans must be fully amortized over a period not to exceed seven years and, in any case, must be fully amortized by year-end 1998. Thrifts are not eligible to participate in the agricultural loan loss amortization program established by this statute. Treatment of junior liens on 1- to 4-family properties In some cases, a banking organization may make two loans on a single residential property, one loan secured by a first lien, the other by a second lien. In such a situation, the Federal Reserve views these two transactions as a single loan, provided there are no intervening liens. This could result in assigning the total amount of these transactions to the 100 percent risk weight category, if, in the aggregate, the two loans exceeded a prudent loan-to-value ratio and, therefore, did not qualify for the 50 percent risk weight. This approach is intended to avoid possible circumvention of the capital requirements and capture the risks associated with the combined transactions. The FDIC, OCC, and the OTS generally assign the loan secured by the first lien to the 50 percent risk-weight category and the loan secured by the second lien to the 100 percent risk-weight category. Pledged deposits and nonwithdrawable accounts The capital guidelines of OTS permit thrift institutions to include in capital certain pledged deposits and nonwithdrawable accounts that meet the criteria of the OTS. Income Capital Certificates and Mutual Capital Certificates held by the OTS may also be included in capital by thrift institutions. These instruments are not relevant to commercial banks, and, therefore, they are not addressed in the three banking agencies' capital guidelines. Mutual Funds The three banking agencies assign all of a bank's holdings in a mutual fund to the risk category appropriate to the highest risk asset that a particular mutual fund is permitted to hold under its operating rules. The purpose of this is to take into account the maximum degree of risk to which a bank may be exposed when investing in a mutual fund in view of the fact that the future composition and risk characteristics of the fund's holding cannot be known in advance. The OTS applies a capital charge appropriate to the riskiest asset that a mutual fund is actually holding at a particular time. In addition, the OTS guidelines also permit, on a case-by-case basis, investments in mutual funds to be allocated on a pro rata basis in a manner consistent with the actual composition of the mutual fund. Section Two Differences In Accounting Standards Among Federal Banking and Thrift Supervisory Agencies Under the auspices of the FFIEC, the three banking agencies have developed uniform reporting standards for commercial banks which are used in the preparation of the Call Report. The FDIC has also applied these uniform Call Report standards to savings banks under its supervision. The income statement and balance sheet accounts presented in the Call Report are used by the bank supervisory agencies for determining the capital adequacy of banks and for other regulatory, supervisory, surveillance, analytical, and general statistical purposes. Section 121 of FDICIA requires accounting principles applicable to financial reports (including the Call Report) filed by federally insured depository institutions with a federal banking agency to be uniform and consistent with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). However, under Section 121, a federal banking agency may require institutions to use accounting principles ``no less stringent than GAAP'' when the agency determines that a specific accounting standard under GAAP does not meet these new accounting objectives. The banking agencies believe that GAAP generally satisfies the three accounting objectives included in FDICIA Section 121. The three accounting objectives in FDICIA Section 121 mandate that accounting principles should: 1. Result in financial statements and reports of condition that accurately reflect the institution's capital; 2. Facilitate effective supervision of depository institutions; and 3. Facilitate prompt corrective action at least cost to the insurance funds. As indicated above, Section 121 of FDICIA requires the Federal Reserve and the other federal banking agencies to utilize accounting principles for regulatory reports that are consistent with GAAP or are no less stringent than GAAP. The reporting instructions for Call Reports that are required by the three banking agencies are substantially consistent, aside from a few limited exceptions, with GAAP as applied by commercial banks. As a matter of policy, the regulatory reporting instructions for Call Reports deviate from GAAP only in those instances where statutory requirements or overriding supervisory concerns warrant a departure from GAAP. Furthermore, in those cases where accounting principles applicable to bank Call Reports are different from GAAP, the regulatory accounting principles are intended to be more conservative than GAAP. Thus, the accounting principles that are followed for regulatory reporting purposes are consistent with the objectives and mandate of FDICIA Section 121. The agencies have been working to limit the number of differences between regulatory accounting principles and GAAP, however, in some circumstances differences will exist when there is a need to address supervisory concerns. In addition, the agencies have been working closely to coordinate any new accounting policies, to ensure consistency among the agencies and to reduce or eliminate differences with GAAP. The OTS has developed and maintains a separate reporting system for the thrift institutions under its supervision. The TFR is based on GAAP as applied by thrifts, which differs in some respects from GAAP for banks. A summary of the primary differences in accounting principles by the federal banking and thrift agencies for regulatory reporting purposes are set forth below, based on a study developed on an interagency basis: Futures and forward contracts The banking agencies, as a general rule, do not permit the deferral of gains or losses by banks on futures and forwards whether or not they are used for hedging purposes. All changes in market value of futures and forward contracts are reported in current period income. The banking agencies adopted this reporting standard as a supervisory policy prior to the adoption of FASB Statement No. 80, which allows hedge or deferral accounting, under certain circumstances. Contrary to this general rule, hedge accounting in accordance with FASB Statement No. 80 is permitted by the three banking agencies only for futures and forward contracts used in mortgage banking operations. The OTS practice is to follow FASB Statement No. 80 for futures contracts. In accordance with this statement, when hedging criteria are satisfied, the accounting for the futures contract is related to the accounting for the hedged item. Changes in the market value of the futures contract are recognized in income when the effects of related changes in the price or interest rate of the hedged item are recognized. Such reporting can result in deferred gains or losses which would be reflected on the thrift's balance sheet in accordance with GAAP. Excess servicing fees As a general rule, the three banking agencies do not follow GAAP for excess servicing fees, but require a more conservative treatment. Excess servicing results when loans are sold with servicing retained and the stated servicing fee rate is greater than the normal servicing fee rate. With the exception of sales of pools of first lien one-to-four family residential mortgages for which the banking agencies' approach is consistent with FASB Statement No. 65, excess servicing fee income in banks must be reported as realized over the life of the transferred asset, not recognized up front as required by FASB Statement No. 65. The OTS allows the present value of the future excess servicing fee to be treated as an adjustment to the sales price for purposes of recognizing gain or loss on the sale. This approach is consistent with FASB Statement No. 65. In-substance defeasance of debt The banking agencies do not permit banks to report defeasance of their debt obligations in accordance with FASB Statement No. 76. Defeasance involves a debtor irrevocably placing risk-free monetary assets in a trust solely for satisfying the debt. Under FASB Statement No. 76, the assets in the trust and the defeased debt are removed from the balance sheet and a gain or loss for the current period can be recognized. However, for Call Report purposes, banks may not remove assets or defeased liabilities from their balance sheets or recognize resulting gains or losses. The banking agencies have not adopted FASB Statement No. 76 because of uncertainty regarding the irrevocable trusts established for defeasance purposes. Furthermore, defeasance would not relieve the bank of its contractual obligation to pay depositors or other creditors. OTS practice is to follow FASB Statement No. 76. Sales of assets with recourse In accordance with FASB Statement No. 77, a transfer of receivables with recourse is recognized as a sale if: (1) The transferor surrenders control of the future economic benefits, (2) The transferor's obligation under the recourse provisions can be reasonably estimated, and (3) The transferee cannot require repurchase of the receivables except pursuant to the recourse provisions. The practice of the three banking agencies is generally to permit commercial banks to report transfers of receivables with recourse as sales only when the transferring institution (1) Retains no risk of loss from the assets transferred and (2) Has no obligation for the payment of principal or interest on the assets transferred. As a result, virtually no transfers of assets with recourse can be reported as sales. However, this rule does not apply to the transfer of first lien 1- to 4-family residential or agricultural mortgage loans under certain government-sponsored programs (including the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation). Transfers of mortgages under these programs are generally treated as sales for Call Report purposes. Furthermore, private transfers of first lien 1- to four- family residential mortgages are also reported as sales if the transferring institution retains only an insignificant risk of loss on the assets transferred. However, the seller's obligation under recourse provisions related to sales of mortgage loans under the government programs is viewed as an off-balance sheet exposure. Thus, for risk-based capital purposes, capital is generally expected to be held for recourse obligations associated with such transactions. The OTS policy is to follow FASB Statement No. 77. However, in the calculation of risk-based capital under the OTS guidelines, off-balance sheet recourse obligations generally are converted at 100 percent. This effectively negates the sale treatment recognized on a GAAP basis for risk-based capital purposes, but not for leverage capital purposes. Thus, by making this adjustment in the risk-based capital calculation, the differences between the OTS and the banking agencies for capital adequacy measurement purposes, are substantially reduced. The FFIEC has a study under way involving the topic of transfers of assets with recourse (often referred to as the ``recourse study''). As part of this study, the staff of the Federal Reserve is reviewing the reporting treatment for sales of assets with recourse and is exploring with the staffs of the other agencies the possibility of reducing or eliminating the differences between regulatory reporting requirements and GAAP in this area. A proposal addressing this issue is being finalized for issuance for public comment in the near future. Push-Down Accounting When a depository institution is acquired in a purchase transaction, but retains its separate corporate existence, the institution is required to revalue all of the assets and liabilities at fair value at the time of acquisition. When push-down accounting is applied, the same revaluation made by the parent holding company is made at the depository institution level. The three banking agencies require push-down accounting when there is at least a 95 percent change in ownership. This approach is generally consistent with interpretations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The OTS requires push-down accounting when there is at least a 90 percent change in ownership. Negative Goodwill The three banking agencies require that negative goodwill be reported as a liability, and not be netted against goodwill assets. Such a policy ensures that all goodwill assets are deducted in regulatory capital calculations, consistent with the Basle Accord. The OTS permits negative goodwill to offset goodwill assets reported in the financial statements. Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain Contracts The three banking agencies are planning to adopt FASB Interpretation No. 39 (FIN 39) solely for on-balance sheet items arising from off-balance sheet derivative instruments, when FIN 39 becomes effective in 1994. FIN 39 allows institutions to offset assets and liabilities arising from traditional balance sheet items (e.g., loans, deposits, etc.) as well as netting assets and liabilities arising from off-balance sheet derivative instruments only when four conditions are met. The Call Report's existing guidance generally prohibits netting of assets and liabilities. The OTS policy on netting of assets and liabilities is consistent with GAAP. The Board staff intends to join the other agencies in a study of the possibility of adopting FIN 39 for traditional balance sheet items in the next year. William W. Wiles, Secretary of the Board.
