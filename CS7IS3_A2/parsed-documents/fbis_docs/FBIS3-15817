On the eve of the talks "Gazprom" representatives confirmed to IZVESTIYA that over the holidays Ukraine continued unilaterally to take 40 million cubic meters of gas per day from the export pipeline. Ukrainian enterprises' overall debt to Russian gas industry workers now tops 1.5 trillion rubles [R]. The problem of Ukrainian nonpayments, which has an acute impact on the situation of the West Siberian gas fields, has periodically flared up over the last two years. Seemingly all the methods of settling the conflict by peaceful means have been tried. If the Moscow talks produce no guarantees of uninterrupted payment for Russian deliveries, then, as your IZVESTIYA correspondent was told by "Gazprom" Deputy Chairman Vladimir Remizov, the company leadership will be forced to turn to the International Court. If this does happen, it will be the first time the former Soviet republics, finding themselves unable to reach agreement among themselves, have washed their dirty linen in public. The last agreement between Ukraine and Russia on gas deliveries was signed in February. Ukraine pledged to ensure the transit of 111.5 billion cubic meters of Russian gas to West Europe. Russia is to supply Ukraine with between 50 and 70 billion cubic meters of gas. The breakdown of these agreements is jeopardizing "Gazprom's" far-reaching ambitious plans to break into the European market. No matter how much "Gazprom" may threaten to take this course, it is technically infeasible to reduce gas deliveries to Ukraine, and the chronic defaulters can effectively pump gas out of the export pipeline to West Europe with impunity. If the Ukrainian leadership's restrictions affect anyone, it is only the enterprises working on contracts with "Gazprom." Although in early March the concern announced a reduction in gas deliveries from 160 million cubic meters to 110 million, in reality this had no consequences for the violators of the convention. As a result pressure in the pipeline on the border with Slovakia fell to danger point. Moreover, Ukraine has managed to pump so much gas into underground storage facilities that it will be more than enough to get through the spring-winter period. According to V. Remizov, "Gazprom's" tough stance at the Moscow talks will also include a point about Ukraine repaying some of the debts with property in the gas supply system. The concern's leadership is interested primarily in the underground storage facilities that enable Ukraine to withstand the Russian suppliers' financial assaults with no particular problems.
