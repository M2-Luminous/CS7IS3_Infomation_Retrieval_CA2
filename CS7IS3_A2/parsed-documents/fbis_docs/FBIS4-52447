This issue was shelved for further deliberations at the last Diet session. Since the outbreak of the civil war in Yemen, the safety of Japanese residing there cannot be assured. Under the current situation, however, the Japanese Government is incapable of helping them to flee the country but has to rely on other countries. For example, they will have "to take advantage of" vacancies on military aircraft or vessels of other countries. And it is believed the government has also taken into consideration the situation when overseas Japanese have to be rescued in case of economic sanctions against the DPRK (North Korea). With regard to Japanese residing in Yemen, the government issued recommendations for evacuation on 9 May. However, since the government cannot mobilize the SDF or government aircraft for the rescue operation, a total of 70 Japanese -- as reported by the Foreign Ministry -- have sought safety in such places as Djibouti in Africa by U.S., German and Italian military aircraft or French military vessels. In this connection, Administrative Vice Foreign Minister Kunihiko Saito stressed at a news conference on 9 May that the SDF Law has to be revised at an early date.
