After nearly two years of intense negotiations, the main parameters and conditions for new cooperation between Moscow and the economic union of 12 leading European states were finally defined. The necessity of concluding such an agreement was prompted by new geopolitical realities. The breakup of the USSR, the disintegration of the socialist camp and with it of the notorious Comecon, reoriented foreign economic activity by Russian enterprises toward the EC. Their performance and the condition of our economy as a whole became increasingly dependent on access to European markets. Today the EC is Russia's largest trade and economic partner. In 1993 it accounted for more than 35 percent of its trade with distant foreign lands, including 36 percent of Russian exports and 35 percent of imports. The EC countries are the main investor in Russia's economy while the community's market is the main market for Russian strategic exports. We buy a substantial part of agricultural products, machinery, and other requisite goods in the EC. Apparently in the future the EC region, which accounts for more than two-fifths of world trade, will be playing the role of Russia's leading business partner. Experts estimate that after the Community's expansion with the Scandinavian countries and Austria, its share in trade with Russia could increase nearly 1.5 times, reaching 44 percent. One should also not forget that our former Comecon partners -- East European countries -- are standing on the EC threshold and in the longer term the Community could be joined by the Baltic states. So far only Switzerland and Albania are the sole European states to the west of the CIS external borders that are not asking to be admitted "under the roof" of the Community. In its turn Russia is the largest political and trade partner for the EC among the countries of the former USSR. It makes up approximately 85 percent of EC trade with the CIS countries and some 70 percent of all Western commitments on credit, technical and humanitarian assistance to the former Soviet republics. In recent months a large number of EC member states, interested in establishing long-term links, have hastened to Russia. This also includes investment cooperation. At the same time, the EC's and Russia's movement toward each other has until recently been substantially hampered by the absence of a corresponding legal regime while trade barriers with respect to Russian goods such as uranium and aluminum even gave some experts cause to talk about a new "iron curtain." After all, the agreement, inherited from the Soviet era, between the USSR and the EC and Euratom on trade, commercial, and economic cooperation, signed in 1989, was geared toward interaction between fundamentally different economic systems. It was rather primitive, addressing only matters of a trade regime, moreover in a spirit discriminatory to Russia. Therefore the need to conclude a new agreement that would extend to Russia rules uniform for all Community countries has grown urgent. What does the Corfu agreement mean for Russia? One of the conditions enshrined in it is the creation, after 1998, of a zone of free trade with the EC. This involves not only a free flow of goods but also freedom of incorporation, trade in services, and capital movement. It is also important that the EC has recognized Russia as a country with a transitional economy, abandoning its treatment as a country with a state trade system. This underlies the EC's abolition of former tough trade discrimination. Furthermore, for the first time in international legal practice, Russia, which is not a party to GATT, has managed to incorporate into the agreement direct references to a number of its key provisions. As a result, the EC will fully lift quotas on imports from Russia which up until recently covered more than 600 goods. As far as the political dialogue between Russia and the EC goes, the agreement stipulates the establishment of a system of consultations on the entire range of international and economic problems. To this end meetings between the president of Russia and the EC leadership will be held at least twice a year. Dialogue at ministerial level will proceed within the framework of a Cooperation Council to be set up. A Parliamentary Cooperation Committee is also to be formed with deputies of the Russian Federal Assembly and members of the Europarliament. Today the main goal set forth by Russia at the start of negotiations with the EC has been accomplished: Moscow has managed to create favorable conditions for economic interaction with the "club" of leading European countries. Russia has stepped over the threshold of Europe.
