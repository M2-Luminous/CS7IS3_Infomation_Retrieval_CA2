The early census in the F.Y.R.O.M. began on June 21 and is due to be completed by July 5, at a cost of 1.7 million dollars, financed and monitored by the European Union and the Council of Europe. The Democratic Party of Serbs in Macedonia said in a statement the Serbs had been justified to warn European experts of possible fraud in connection with the Serbs' citizenship designed to minimise their numbers. According to the previous census, taken in 1991, the F.Y.R.O.M. had a population of 1.3 million, 2.3 per cent or 50,000 of whom were Serbs. The Serbs, however, immediately challenged the results. The Association of Serbs and Montenegrins in the F.Y.R.O.M. insists that the country has a quarter of a million strong Serb community, 50,000 of whom in the northern Kumanovo commune alone. The Democratic Party of Serbs claims that various forms of pressure are being brought to bear on the Serbs during the current census, and that even the party's activists in the field are being threatened with 60 days in prison for drawing attention to the fraudulent activities of authorities and census-takers. As a special form of pressure, incidents on the border with Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) are being fabricated and then taken as a pretext for waging a massive anti-Serb media campaign.
