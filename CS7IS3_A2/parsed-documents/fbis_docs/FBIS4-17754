Ossetia, Ingushetia LD2704155694 Moscow ITAR-TASS World Service in Russian 1458 GMT 27 Apr 94 LD2704155694 Moscow ITAR-TASS World Service Russian BFN [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Lyudmila Yermakova] [Text] Moscow, 27 Apr -- The Federation Council of the Russian Federation has approved the Russian president's edict on a state of emergency in North Ossetia and Ingushetia. The chamber received the decree today and discussed it behind closed doors. Valeriy Fateyev, chairman of the commission of deputies which worked in the zone of state of emergency, told an ITAR-TASS correspondent that the decree "amended the mistake made in the similar edict of 5 April, whereby four populated areas were excluded from the emergency zone." This resulted in a sharp aggravation of the crime situation in the area and victims. The president amended the edict in relation to the zone of state of emergency at the Federation Council's proposal. The problem of the conflict, however, has not been solved, the deputy stressed, and the central authorities should change the forms of administration in that area. Fateyev and some other deputies are convinced that all executive power should rest with the federal center, that is the Russian president and a local body of power authorized by him, whereas representative bodies of power, whoever they belong to, should temporarily suspend their activity.
