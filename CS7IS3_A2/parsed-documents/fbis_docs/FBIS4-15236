The only difference between that draft and the one prepared earlier was the absence of the provision on measures to increase wages in accordance with inflation and to ensure their timely payment, to check the rise in prices on staple food stuffs, to create jobs and to help the regions where the danger of unemployment is the greatest. Head of the president's experts Aleksandr Livshyts told Interfax on Wednesday that such an amendment had been motivated by the need to scrupulously work out this provision. He said that the amendment did not mean Yeltsin denied the importance of those measures. He said, however, that the initial variant sounded rather abstract because it did not say who was responsible for implementing them. Livshyts believes that this drawback will be done away with in the final draft.
