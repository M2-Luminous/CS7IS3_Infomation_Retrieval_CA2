On an ongoing basis, the Boards of Trustees of the Funds, pursuant to their fiduciary responsibilities under the Act and otherwise, will monitor each Fund for the existence of any material conflicts between the interests of the various classes of shares. The Trustees, including a majority of the Independent Trustees, shall take such action as is reasonably necessary to eliminate any such conflict that may develop. Citibank and LFBDS will be responsible for reporting any potential or existing conflicts to the Trustees. If a conflict arises, Citibank and LFBDS, at their own cost, will take steps to remedy such conflict, up to and including establishing a new registered management investment company. 4. The Trustees of the Funds will receive quarterly and annual statements concerning distribution, service and shareholder servicing expenditures complying with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of rule 12b&hyph;1, as amended from time to time. In these statements, only expenditures properly attributable to the sale of a particular class of shares or to the provision of services to holders of such shares will be used to justify any distribution or service or shareholder servicing fee attributable to such class. Expenditures not related to the sale or service of a particular class of shares or to services provided to holders of such shares will not be presented to the Trustees to justify any fee attributable to that class. The statements, including the allocations upon which they are based, will be subject to the review and approval of the Independent Trustees of the Funds in the exercise of their fiduciary duties. 5. Dividends paid by a Fund with respect to each class of its shares, to the extent any dividends are paid, will be calculated in the same manner, at the same time, on the same day, and will be in the same amount, except that (i) Distribution, service and shareholder servicing payments associated with any Plans relating to a particular class of shares (any other costs relating to implementing the Plans for such class or any amendment to such Plan including obtaining shareholder approval of the Plans for such class or any amendment to such Plans) will be borne exclusively by that class; (ii) any incremental transfer agency fees relating to a particular class will be borne exclusively by that class; (iii) Class Expenses relating to a particular class will be borne exclusively by that class; and (iv) any other incremental expenses subsequently identified that should be properly allocated to a particular class which shall be approved by the Commission pursuant to an amended order will be borne exclusively by such class. 6. The methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends and distributions of the various classes and the proper allocation of expenses among the various classes have been reviewed by an expert (the ``Expert'') who has rendered a report to the applicants, a copy of which has been filed as Exhibit D to the application, stating that such methodology and procedures are adequate to ensure that such calculations and allocations will be made in an appropriate manner. On an ongoing basis, the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, will monitor the manner in which the calculations and allocations are being made and, based upon such review, will render at least annually a report to the Funds that the calculations and allocations are being made properly. The reports of the Expert shall be filed as part of the periodic reports filed with the Commission pursuant to sections 30(a) and 30 (b)(1) of the Act. The workpapers of the Expert with respect to such reports, following request by the Funds (which the Funds agree to make), will be available for inspection by the Commission staff upon the written request to the Fund for such workpapers by a senior member of the Division of Investment Management or of a Regional Office of the Commission, limited to the Director, an Associate Director, the Chief Accountant, the Chief Financial Analyst, an Assistant Director and any Regional Administrators or Associate and Assistant Administrators. The initial report of the Expert is a ``report on the policies and procedures placed in operation'' and the ongoing reports will be ``reports on policies and procedures placed in operation and tests of operating effectiveness'' as defined and described in SAS No. 70 of the AICPA, as it may be amended from time to time, or in similar auditing standards as may be adopted by the AICPA from time to time. 7. The applicants have adequate facilities in place to ensure implementation of the methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends and distributions of the various classes of shares and the proper allocation of expenses among such classes of shares, and this representation has been concurred with by the Expert in the initial report referred to in condition no. 6 above and will be concurred with by the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, on an ongoing basis at least annually in the ongoing reports referred to in condition no. 6 above. Applicants agree to take immediate corrective measures if the Expert, or appropriate substitute Expert, does not so concur in the ongoing reports.
