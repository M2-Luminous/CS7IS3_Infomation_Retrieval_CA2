The State Duma is following with great disquiet and concern incoming information regarding the exacerbation of the conflict between the Republic of Crimea and Ukrainian central organs. We know from our own experience of building a new Russian state how difficult the problems associated with the demarcation of powers are. But we also know how futile and destructive are attempts forcibly to resolve issues linked with peoples' desire for self-determination. The State Duma viewed with hope the announcement of the first steps toward constructive dialogue and accord taken in Kiev by a group of Ukrainian and Crimean Supreme Council deputies. We express confidence that reason will prevail over emotion in this dispute both in Kiev and in Simferopol. We hope that Ukrainian and Crimean Supreme Council deputies will not allow irresponsible politicians to jeopardize people's peace and security for their own opportunistic ends. For its part the State Duma is ready, with consideration for the delicacy of the prevailing situation, to do everything in its power to help seek constructive compromises based on the Russian-Ukrainian treaty of 19 November 1990. For two centuries the Crimea has served and, we are confident, will continue to serve the interests of the fraternal peoples of Ukraine and Russia. Once again we call for restraint, civic wisdom, and the renunciation of hasty emotional actions.
