He spent the day cross-country skiing in Salen with his wife, Bodil, and daughter Louise, 17. But via a telephone connection from the Hogfjall Hotel, he told SVENSKA DAGBLADET that SAPO [Security Police] will continue its reorientation when he takes over on 1 May. More Terrorism [Eriksson] My appointment will not affect anything. Because of the fall of the East bloc, the security police are moving away from military threat perceptions and devoting more energy to terrorism and serious crime. [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] Russian crime? [Eriksson] All serious crime. [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] The United States has recently organized a group of environmental agents who are working under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, EPA. Is this something for Sweden to copy? You were once secretary in the environmental damage fund commission. [Eriksson] In the United States they have agents for just about everything, but environmental agents in Sweden are not necessary. The government has instead decided to add an environmental ombudsman. Time To Find The government took its time finding a successor for former SAPO chief Mats Borjesson. When they finally decided, they picked a person who, in the manner of top legal professionals, disdains the public spotlight and always observes strict discretion. Few know him outside the circles of power, despite the fact that he has held top positions at the Justice Ministry since he was hired as an adviser in 1980 and despite the fact that he has been an appeals court judge in the Gota Court of Appeals since 1986. No Comments He is keeping this low profile even after his appointment. To every question concerning SAPO's activities or his qualifications for appointment, the answer was "I cannot comment on that." [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] But your background as a captain in the reserves in Skanska dragoon regiment P2 probably played a role? There you belong to the secret forces that have special tasks in the early stages of a war. [Eriksson] As you surely understand, I cannot comment on that. [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] So it is your experience at the ministry that weighed most heavily in the appointment? [Eriksson] I don't know. I have also taught at the police academy and have worked in the court system. You have already mentioned the military background. [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] How much contact have you had with SAPO up until now? [Eriksson] Some contact, but in my job at the Justice Ministry, I have not needed to know the entire picture. To begin with, I must familiarize myself with this. [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] So you will now go through the files in SAPO's archives? [Eriksson] Maybe I won't quite go about it in that manner.
