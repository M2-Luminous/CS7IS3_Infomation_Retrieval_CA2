FBIS4-55374 "dreeu093__a94019" FBIS-EEU-94-093-A Daily Report 11 May 1994 ANNEX Hungary Conditions Set for Second Election Round Conditions Set for Second Election Round AU1105141894 Budapest MTI in English 1303 GMT 11 May 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU1105141894 Budapest MTI English BFN [Text] Budapest, 11 May (MTI) -- The National Election Committee has received no applications for legal remedy concerning the elections so far, the Interior Ministry's Election Office informed MTI on Wednesday [11 May]. The election office has stated that the second round of the elections may be entered by individual candidates who received at least 15 percent of the vote in the first round. If there is no such candidate, the three with the most votes will be in the running. In this way, there will be constituencies where candidates can enter even though they may have only acquired seven percent in the May 8 round. In the first round, two individual deputies received enough votes to win straight out of the gate, and 125 party-list mandates were decided. The race for the other 259 (out of the total 386) seats is to continue in the second round. This includes 174 individual mandates, and a further 85 resulting from leftover votes. The deputy contest is thus heating up in 174 of the 176 individual constituencies. Balloting will be valid if voter turnout exceeds 25 percent by even one person. What are leftover votes? -- 27 mandates will be distributed among parties winning more than 5 percent of votes cast for 152 regional lists. National party-lists will determine 58 mandates to be allotted by complicated mathematical calculations on the basis of leftover votes for individual candidates. This means that a total of 85 parliamentary seats will be awarded on the basis of fractional votes cast for the six parties. An order was previously established by drawing lots for the six parliamentary parties on the national list in the event that two parties get the same number of leftover votes. In this case, the mandate will go to the party that ranks higher on the national list.
