The earlier meeting was attended by the chief of staff, his deputy, and the Army chief of intelligence, as well as Elyaqim Rubinstein, Ambassador Itamar Rabinovich, and Uri Lubrani, the heads of the delegation to the negotiations in Washington. Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz reports that the Israeli participants posed numerous questions to the U.S. team about the Americans' interpretation of President al-Asad's remarks in his talks with President Clinton. The Americans are convinced that Syria is indeed prepared to reach full peace and normalization with Israel. The Israelis also asked for clarifications of the substance and price of peace and about the security arrangements with Syria.
