He added that the Foreign Ministry learned about the arrest from official information from the United States. "It is quite natural that we have questions about the merits of the information. Many things are to be clarified. This is a job for corresponding special services of Russia and the United States", Karasin said. He added that "as far as we know, cooperation (between the services) is being developed in such spheres as anti-terrorist and anti-drug fight and these contacts should be used".
