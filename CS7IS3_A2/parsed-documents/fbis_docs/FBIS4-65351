Of course, Jens Reich himself does not contemplate that he could become the next federal president, and has never done so. In the end, at the third or fourth ballot in the federal assembly on Whit Sunday, Johannes Rau and Roman Herzog will settle this between themselves; in this regard the physician, scientist, and essayist has no illusions. Nevertheless, the former GDR civil rights supporter regards his candidacy as an independent, lateral entrant for the succession of Richard von Weizsaecker by no means as superfluous and unsuccessful. He perceives his candidature as a spiritual, social, and political challenge, which corresponds to that of German unification and could help accomplish it. Accordingly, the way would really be more important than the goal. But Jens Reich explicitly does not want to be "a combat or protest candidate of the `Ossis' [eastern Germans]." Yet this is absolutely how many eastern Germans understand him. Differently from the western German presidential candidates, he, so it seems to them, brings the greatest insight to the designation and explanation of their social and economic insecurities and worries, their history and their self-perception. His biography--the long hesitant perseverance in the private niche--is also something with which many eastern Germans can identify. That all of Reich's appeals to the former GDR citizens to stop complaining now and to put aside inferiority complexes are hardly being noticed is another matter. When Reich interprets eastern German conditions in the west, he encounters, as a rule, interested and sympathetic attention, especially among intellectuals. In the east he frequently earns applause from all segments of the audience, frequently standing ovations. There would be no doubt who should hold the highest state office. There people also accept with indulgence that Reich, when he lets his thoughts run while speaking, does not complete a sentence quite conclusively. Or that he quite openly admits not to understand anything about an issue. The Play Dead Reflex When Reich at the beginning of February in the National Theater of Weimar on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the Weimar National Assembly talked with opponents Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher and Roman Herzog about federal presidents and constitution, unity in Germany and Europe, and a few other things, he would bave become federal president if the applause could have decided it. Subsequently Reich returns to Berlin by train traveling second class and, impressed, talks about the witty, baroque Herzog, with whom one can brilliantly and ingeniously discuss society and the state in Germany. Toward the end of the 1980's, a Thomas Asperger occasionally published articles in OSTEUROPA-FORUM or in the cultural journal LETTRE INTERNATIONAL. Nobody knew the author. The Ministry of State Security, too, was at a loss. The writer had to be someone from East Germany, that is how well informed and sympathetically he dealt with the situation and the consciousness of the GDR people under the living conditions of real socialism. It was Jens Georg Reich, at that time professor of medicine at Humboldt University and scientist at the Center for Molecular Biology of the GDR Academy of Sciences, who concealed himself behind the pseudonym. Thomas Asperger was a school friend of Reich in Halberstadt, who was torn apart shortly after the war by a blind shell. At the beginning of 1988, Reich had found his GDR niche in the "Friday Circle," a group of scientists who got angry or amused themselves about the conditions in the country, hardly perceptible to the outside and without effects. The Catholic Reich finally entered internal emigration when in 1984 he lost his post as director of the Molecular Biology Center because he refused to join the SED or a coalition party. Today Reich admits that he and others, against their better judgment, had resigned themselves too long to a helpless, opportunistic "play dead reflex," one should have protested strongly much sooner. People in the east now and then take offense at such a self-reproach. It contradicts the private and collective guilt defense mechanism built up for self-defense. In a politically effective and visible manner the names of the physicians Eva and Jens Reich surfaced for the first time under the then-sensational and revolution-triggering appeal "The Time Is Ripe," which the beginning citizen movement New Forum was able to publish still illegally on 9 September 1989--with unexpected success: More than 200,000 people signed the appeal within weeks. This was not yet an appeal for an insurrection, but rather a request to the rulers to reform socialism democratically in a social dialogue. Jens Reich became visible publicly on 4 November 1989. It was the large demonstration of perhaps 500,000 people at the Alexander Square in Berlin, who scanned "We are the people." A slim, tall man stepped up to the microphone, in the early fifties, with thick glasses and short-cropped grey hair. In a soft, almost brittle voice, but in clear, precise language, Reich demanded from a platform on a truck "elections that deserve this name," freedom for dissenters, the observation of constitutional rights, which after all existed in the GDR according to the law. In those few days before the opening of the borders on November 9, 1989, according to Reich's assessment, there existed the chance of a real revolution, the immediate overthrow of the SED. Already at that time, however, the citizens movement was disunified and indecisive. The change possibly would not have proceeded so peacefully. As many others in the citizens movement, Jens Reich would have wished for the GDR, at the end still transformed into a democracy, a longer and more self-conscious life, so that there could have been more thorough negotiations about unification. Reich would have preferred a confederation with the long-term goal of state unity. Thus he voted with the People's Chamber caucus against the accession of the GDR to the Federal Republic already on 3 October 1990. This took place on 23 August 1990. At that time, even the unification treaty had not yet been concluded, which was and is criticized as ill-advised and hasty. Today Reich says the financial and economic consequences were foreseeable. According to him, the mental consequences, in the west as well as in the east, proved to be much more devastating. The foreign policy security arrangements by Kohl and Genscher, on the other hand, he regards as nothing short of masterful. Paradoxically, it was Federal Chancellor Kohl who provided the impetus for the so uncomfortable candidacy of the private person Jens Reich. Kohl deemed, it was perhaps at the beginning of 1993, that the next federal president, in order to promote the unity of Germany, should be an eastern German. In so doing, however, he had hardly in mind a representative of the citizens movement (especially not a leftist), but politicians like Berndt Seite or Heinz Eggert, and in the end--already under increasingly hardening political pressure from his party--the unhappy Steffen Heitmann. Even the social democrat Richard Schroeder would have been a possibility if the SPD had not staked out party policy interests with the nomination of Rau. Thereupon in June of last year the intellectuals from "Frankfurter Einmischung" [Frankfurt Intervention] made their appearance. The party-encompassing association, conservative in terms of its values, whose members include politicians of all camps, journalists, historians, and sociologists, proposed, crosswise to the spectrum of the parties, a number of well-known people. Ignatz Bubis refused, as did Hans Magnus Erzenberger. Jens Reich, by contrast, did not refuse. After 2.5 years of resignation--the experiences in and with the People's Chamber had contradicted his ideals too strongly--he returned to politics. The reaction of the federal parties ranged from indifference to intransigence. But in all of them there turned out to be secret sympathizers. Only Alliance 90/Greens were receptive to the idea, without, however, elevating Reich as official candidate. Now he is a candidate for the highest state office and in so doing can count on a great deal of sympathy, but hardly has organization at his disposal and lacks any traditional party policy linkage and experience. Of all the candidates, Reich certainly has the greatest and most far-reaching visions of citizen democracy, for which, however, he is reproached--as naive, illusionary visions. He takes in this reproach and turns it around: In his "belief in rational, emotional, democratic dialogue" and in his "faith in public discourse", he says, he likes to be naive, for everything else appears to him as "cynical or fundamentalist." Fourteen Theses for the Future His conceptions of how he would manage as federal president, Reich has depicted in a multitude of speeches, discussions, interviews, articles, and essays, and three books on this subject are on the market. Moreover, he has presented 14 programmatic theses for a "Future Project Germany": The task of the federal president "is to stimulate social developments, to keep open suppressed topics, to promote discourse, to exert a moderating and integrating effect, and in so doing to introduce his own person and opinion." Moreover, Reich regards it as appropriate and just that, after 40 years of dictatorship in the GDR and because of the agitating consequences of unity in eastern Germany, the next federal president should place his center of gravity there. Quite in the tradition of the citizens movement, he champions the idea that the Basic Law should include social constitutional goals as well as elements of direct democracy. With his thoughts about the responsible use of gen-technology and the protection of Germany as a location for science, Reich has--in the sense of the discourse advocated by him--provided impulses for public discussions. The registered association "Buergerpraesident [Citizens' President] Jens Reich" in Berlin supports the candidate with a little organization and coordination. Young socialists, young liberals, young members of the CDU/CSU, and young Greens have united. There people console themselves in the face of the foreseeable failure in the Federal Assembly with the promising consideration: Could it not be that, before the third ballot, Rau and Herzog demonstratively forego the votes of the PDS and the Republikaner respectively? Then candidate Reich perhaps could get a chance to make his move. As has been said before, the candidate himself does not believe in this.
