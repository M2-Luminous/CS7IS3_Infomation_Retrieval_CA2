Once the decision was known, Deputy Rodolfo Becerril Straffon, president of the chamber's Foreign Relations Commission, cited the importance of Salinas' trip to Havana. The trip will occur "at a time when U.S. congressmen want to intensify the blockade" against the island, the deputy explained. The media have viewed this statement as a clear allusion to U.S. Congressman Robert Torricelli, the author of the U.S. law which bears his name and which two years ago intensified the economic blockade the United States imposed against Cuba more than 30 years ago. Torricelli has just concluded a visit to Mexico where he was bitterly criticized by all Mexican political sectors because of his desire to supervise the federal elections that will take place in this country in August. Becerril said "this (visit by Salinas to Cuba) is a demonstration of Mexican solidarity with the Cuban people and the norms that guide Mexico's foreign policy." The legislator called for the elimination of customs that hurt Latin American economies. During the session, the deputy announced the deputies of the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI] have decided to donate one day's salary to Cuba, and "this money will be used to buy oil." The deputies of the opposition's Party of the Democratic Revolution have joined the PRI deputies in this decision. Three days ago in his request to obtain permission to travel from the legislative body, Salinas cited the respectful diplomatic relations Mexico and Cuba maintain as well as the profound ties of affinity between the two nations. During that session, Salinas said the ties with the island have produced an international agenda of cooperation that demonstrates the importance of existing links. Salinas also said that since 1975, all Mexican presidents in office have visited Havana, something that has contributed to an intense and fruitful political dialogue at the highest level between the two neighboring nations. The Mexican presidents who have visited Cuba are: Luis Echeverria (1970-76), Jose Lopez Portillo (1976-82), and Miguel de la Madrid (1982-86). Salinas also recalled that Cuban Chief of State Fidel Castro has been in Mexico on three occasions during the current Salinas administration (at the presidential inauguration in 1988, a summit meeting of the Group of Three in Cozumel in 1991, and the first conference of Iberian-American presidents in Guadalajara that same year). Castro's trip in December 1988 for the Salinas presidential inauguration was the Cuban leader's first trip to Mexico in 32 years. In 1956, he had left from the Mexican port of Tuxpan with 82 men to renew the Cuban people's armed struggle, which culminated with the victory of the revolution on 1 January 1959. The illustration presented at Mexico's National Congress explained that the presence of the Mexican president in Cuba will serve to further promote bilateral ties, analyze the agenda between the two countries, and explore new ways of diversifying and strengthening existing ties.
