This will be beneficial to both, said Liu at a meeting with a senior delegation from the Laotian Ministry of National Defence led by its minister Choummali Sai-gnason in the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse here this afternoon. Their friendly conversation mainly centered on the further development of Sino-Lao relations and other issues. Liu said China and Laos have enjoyed a long history of friendly contacts. At present bilateral ties have grown well and personnel exchanges between the two countries are increasing. "It is our hope that such mutually trusted friendly ties will develop for a long time, which is beneficial to both," he said. During the meeting Liu also briefed the visitors on China's reform and opening to the outside world. Liu noted China has made great achievements in its reform and opening to the outside world over the past 15 years, adding that China is now in the best period since its founding in 1949. Facts prove that a series of principles and policies that China is implementing are really effective, he said. Of course, he said, since China is a very large country, its development is unbalanced. This requires us to continuously explore, take a positive attitude, and overcome difficulties so as to promote its economic development. Choummali said the Laotian Government, Army and people will never forget the help that the Chinese Government, Army and people have offered to them. "It is our resolute conviction to further consolidate and develop ties between the two governments, armed forces and peoples. The changing world situation will strengthen our resolve to this conviction," he said. Choummali said: "We will do our best to promote bilateral friendly ties and cooperation in depth and in an all-round way." The delegation arrived here on May 6 for an official goodwill visit to China at the invitation of State Councillor and Minister of National Defence Chi Haotian. Before their arrival here they visited Chengdu of Sichuan Province. This morning, Chi hosted a welcoming ceremony on the square in front of the Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution here for Choummali and his party. Then the two ministers held talks and exchanged views on the development of the relations between the two countries and the two armed forces and international issues of common concern. This evening, Chi gave a dinner in honor of Choummali and his party.
