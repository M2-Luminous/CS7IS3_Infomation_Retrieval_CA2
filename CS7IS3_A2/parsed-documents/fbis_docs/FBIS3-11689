Meeting the request of Chamber of Deputies President Inocencio Oliveira and other leaders, the federal Senate buried the deputies' dream of increasing their salaries: 54 senators voted yes, two voted no, and four abstained from voting on the decision to maintain President Itamar Franco's veto of plans to make congressmen's salaries equal to the highest ones paid to Federal Supreme Court members. Based on the Constitution, Deputy Paulo Delgado (Workers Party) requested that the 16 March session be annulled. During this session, the congressmen voted against three other vetoes of salary increases for public employees working for state-owned companies and other official organizations and the government decision to establish ministers of state's salaries as the ceiling for all public employees' salaries. Delgado made a motion to the Chamber of Deputies Constitution and Justice Committee calling for annulment of the session and was supported by Chamber of Deputies President Oliveira. [Begin recording] [Delgado] We deem [words indistinct] ceiling the fastest possible to be able to take the issue to a plenary session and thus annul that day's voting on these vetoes. [Unidentified reporter] Therefore, there will be no immediate salary increase. [Delgado] None at all. I believe this is an extremely difficult moment in which the country is calling for austerity in all sectors of society and we must set an example. [end recording] If the Constitution and Justice Committee decides to annul the latest congressional session, a plenary session will still have to be held but at least the possibility of increasing the salaries of deputies and senators by 23.5 percent has been entirely dismissed. In a live report from Congress, reporter Alessandra Anselmo has more news: [Begin relay] Chamber of Deputies President Inocencio Oliveira, who also attended the Planalto Palace meeting seeking to solve the crisis among the three government branches, reported that regarding the vetoes of salary equalization -- which were voted against by Congress -- it has been decided that the government will send Congress another draft bill establishing the ceiling for public employees' salaries at 90 percent of the salary of a minister of state. Thus, the problem caused by the presidential veto of the high salaries paid by state-owned companies, which had been voted against by the national Congress, has been solved. [end relay]
