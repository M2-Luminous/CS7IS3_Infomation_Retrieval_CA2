Designed to coordinate the use of agricultural resources, it focuses on tapping all available land to boost farm output. Under the plan, which is to be unveiled later this year, 10 major farming regions have been targeted for the production of grain, cotton, edible oil, and meat. They are administered by the state and are located in Northeast China's Three Rivers Plain (Heilongjiang, Songhuajiang, and Usuli Rivers) and Songhua-Liao Rivers Plain, the region of Yellow River, Huaihe River and Haihe River, the northern region of East China, and the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. The state-level development zones cover 15 provinces and municipalities and account for 39.2 percent of the country's total farmland involving 36.6 percent of total population. In addition, 16 areas have been selected as provincial-level development zones, according to Zhang Qiaoling, director of the Department of Agricultural Regional Planning under the Ministry of Agriculture. Priorities include upgrading the country's vast low-yield farmland and developing unused land, Zhang said yesterday. "There is great potential for in-depth development of agricultural resources in the country through boosting the per hectare output of all available land," she said. According to Zhang, low-yield land covers 86.7 million hectares or 86 percent of the country's arable land, 78 percent of its aquatic farms, and a quarter of its woodlands. A recently concluded three-year survey by the Agricultural Ministry and other departments shows that of China's 100 million hectares of farmland, 20 million hectares have poor soil, 20 million hectares suffer from water shortages, 13.3 million hectares are barren hilly terrain and 3.3 million hectares are saline-alkali soil. Yet many of these areas can be transformed through new farming techniques that will increase output by as much as 100 percent, she said. But she added the country can only improve a small portion of its waste land, uncultivated hills, shoals, and offshore waters for agricultural use. Based on the survey results, the government's development scheme will coordinate resources to maximize agricultural output. The 10 zones set up so far each has a blueprint covering harvesting, animal husbandry, rural industry, farm machinery, forestry, water and soil conservation, groundwater, feeds, and mineral fertilizers. Zhang said that in the past, resources have been wasted or exploited because of lack of coordination. And in the past few years, more farmland has been taken over by industry and residential development, she said. Some 133,000 hectares of farmland are also lost each year to natural disasters while a total of 26.7 million hectares of grassland have become less productive or barren because of overuse, the survey said. According to Zhang, at least 123 million hectares of arable land -- at the current per hectare output -- are needed to feed and clothe China's population by the year 2000, which stands at about 1.2 billion at present. To compensate for this deficit -- China has 100 million hectares of arable land -- the government plans to boost the output of 33.3 million hectares of low and medium-yield fields by the year 2000. Over 3 million hectares of wasteland and barren land will also be reclaimed under the programme's first phase.
