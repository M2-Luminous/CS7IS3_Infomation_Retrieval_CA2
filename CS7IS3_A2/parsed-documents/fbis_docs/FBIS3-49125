The application of taxes affects all citizens, especially Albanians, because the Albanians of Presheva have many family relations with the Albanians of Macedonia, who have unjustly been divided by artificial borders. Since the first of January 1994, the border authorities of rump Yugoslavia demand 10 DM per person and 30 DM per vehicle before leaving them to pass the border.
