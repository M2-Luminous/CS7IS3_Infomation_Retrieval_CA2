A checkpoint has finally been opened for civilians to pass from one part of town to another and the work on normalizing the town infrastructure has begun. Here is a report by our Mostar correspondent Omer Vatric: [Begin Vatric recording] This day will be remembered in Mostar by the first meetings of family members and friends at the town line of separation, at which only bullets and shells were meeting for a full 11 months. On two occasions, 50 Mostar people from the eastern and 50 from the western part of the town met at the crossroads in front of the burnt-down Hit department store. They were coming in groups of 25 and had two hours to tell about their pain, fear, and hope. [passage omitted] New groups of citizens should meet tomorrow as well as the next day. The citizens of Donja Mahala, Semovac, and Sermica will remember this day because the water came back. Water authorities say that, in conformity with agreements reached with the Croatian Defense Council, these districts will get drinking water after more than nine months. Unfortunately, the entire left bank [of the Neretva] will remain without water in the coming days, and the entire eastern part of Mostar will remain without electricity. Constant talks about the implementation of the Washington agreement and implementing the agreed federation bring hope that all of Mostar will have water and electricity soon and that the building of bridges and a general normalization of life will begin.
