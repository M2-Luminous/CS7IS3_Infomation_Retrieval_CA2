From 16 to 24 December, Comrade Hu Jintao, accompanied by Pu Chaozhu, secretary of the Yunnan Provincial CPC Committee, and provincial governor He Zhiqiang, inspected enterprises in Dehong, Yuxi, and Kunming; visited the development zones and open ports in Ruili and Wanding; and called on farm households, veteran party members and cadres in ethnic minority villages and urban neighborhoods as well as ethnic minority teachers in Luxi. While in Kunming, he listened to briefings by leaders of the provincial party committee and provincial government, and spoke at a meeting with members of the first study class on Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, which was attended by leading cadres at and above the county level in Yunnan. Hu Jintao said that from what he had seen and heard over the previous few days, he was impressed with Yunnan's great change and rapid progress over the past 15 years. He said: The province is full of vitality, and enjoys high economic growth, social and political stability, greater unity of nationalities, and an improved livelihood for its people. All of these prove the correctness of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as well as the party's basic line, principles, and policies which have been formulated under the guidance of this theory. They also testify that the Yunnan Provincial CPC Committee and the provincial government have proceeded from the actual condition in the province in resolutely and earnestly implementing a series of policy decisions and plans adopted by the party Central Committee, and that party organizations in Yunnan are full of fighting spirit. He exhorted party organizations at all levels and cadres and people at large, to be guided by the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, comprehensively implement the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session, to seize the opportunity, deepen reform, and accelerate development, thereby pushing Yunnan's work in all fields to new heights. During his tour of Yunnan, Hu Jintao studied and familiarized himself, in particular, with the issue of further strengthening and improving party construction in the process of expediting the establishment of a socialist market economic structure. In this connection, he attended and spoke at a discussion in Kunming with directors of the organization departments of the provincial party committee and party committees of some autonomous prefectures and cities directly under the provincial government. He said: The organizational line must be dictated by, and must serve the political line. In conducting work related to party building, it is necessary to bear in mind the overall situation of socialist modernization and carry out work in close conjunction of the party's central task. The correct orientation and guiding ideology for party building should be to constantly strengthen and improve party construction while implementing the party's basic line and carrying out the party's basic task. In conducting work related to party building, we should continue to take Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line as our guide. According to the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the requirements set by Comrade Jiang Zemin in his recent speeches, we should focus our attention on the central task of economic construction, and work hard to adapt ourselves to the new situation of deepening reform and expediting development -- especially the establishment of a socialist market economic structure -- by further emancipating our minds, persisting in seeking truth from facts, and actively studying new circumstances and exploring new ways to solve new problems. We should conscientiously uphold the party's character as the vanguard of the working class and the fundamental goal of serving the people wholeheartedly by comprehensively improving the party ideologically, organizationally, and in its style of work; and by further strengthening the rallying power, appeal, and fighting spirit of all party organizations to promote reform, development and stability, thereby bringing into better play the party's role as the core of leadership. Discussing the main tasks of party building, Hu Jintao said: We should organize party cadres and members to study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and further arm the entire party membership with the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. We should continue to pay keen attention to improving the competence of leading bodies at all levels; make determined efforts to strengthen grass-roots party organizations; and carry out the anti-corruption drive in a thoroughgoing and sustained manner. He emphasized: Diligently studying and mastering the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics to enhance the entire party membership's theoretical understanding of Marxism is the ideological guarantee for accomplishing the party's great historic mission in the new era, as well as the most important task in party building. So far, a good beginning has been made in studying the theory of socialism with Chinese characteristics by all party members. We should continue to pay keen attention to the study by leading cadres, and should urge them to increase their awareness in study and to further integrate theory with practice. The pressing task at the moment is, by combining the study of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping with the party Central Committee's decision on establishing a socialist market economy, to further encourage emancipation of the mind by cadres, and increase their understanding of the pertinence and urgency in initiating a brand new economic structure in China, thereby firing their enthusiasm for reform and building up their confidence in improving work in all fields. Urging all party committees to constantly strengthen their leadership over party building, Hu Jintao said: The key to accomplishing the various difficult tasks in the nineties and advancing the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics lies in an effective party leadership. To further improve the party, it is of crucial importance that all party committees conduct work in an earnest and responsible manner. The principle that "the party administers party affairs" must be implemented through, first and foremost, the handling of party affairs by all party committees and their top leaders.
