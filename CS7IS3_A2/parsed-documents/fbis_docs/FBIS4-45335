It was attended by Giorgio Giacomelli, the UN deputy secretary general and executive director of the UN's fund for drug abuse. His visit to Kazakhstan could be explained by a tendency for establishing relations between Kazakhstan's drug dealers and that of the CIS and foreign countries. Last year 197 foreigners were detained for illegal drug dealing in Kazakhstan. Internal Affairs Minister Vladimir Shumov said that Kazakhstan has the material that is needed for illegal production of hashish type drugs. We are worried about the substantial increase in influx of Opium type drugs to Kazakhstan from Russia, Ukraine, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. The fact that two-thirds of drug addicts are young people in their 20's is also of great concern. This is the reason why we decided to take tougher steps in combatting it. Giacomelli noted that it is impossible to combat drug smuggling single-handed. Therefore, the United Nations puts forward its own comprehensive program aimed at stopping drug trafficking. The United Nations' goal is to join the efforts of different countries in addressing these problems. Conditions should be created that will make drug cultivation unprofitable. With this aim in mind relevant international trade legislation has to be adopted. Touching upon the subject of UN assistance to Kazakhstan, Giacomelli said that this will depend on a number of things. The United Nations intends to grant Kazakhstan $0.5 million under this program.
