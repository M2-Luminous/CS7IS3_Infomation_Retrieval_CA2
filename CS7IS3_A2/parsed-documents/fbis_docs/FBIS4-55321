This platform for the conclusion of the two-year-old civil war among the Bosnian Muslims, Serbs and Croats could include three major parts, the diplomatic circles said. The first part is an unconditional ceasefire in the entire territory of ex-Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, on which the Bosnian Serb leadership has been insisting for months and which, nevertheless, has invariably been rejected by the Bosnian Muslims. The second part is the territorial delineation of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The prevailing opinion in diplomatic circles in Belgrade is that the Geneva meeting will take as its point of departure the map, previously proposed by the European Union, envisaging virtually that Bosnian Serbs get 49 percent of the entire territory, while the Bosnian Muslims and Croats should get 51 percent. The third part of the Geneva talks could concern the U.N. sanctions against Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro), i.e. their linking with the first two parts and consequently their lifting as soon as these two parts are completed. Bearing all that in mind, a decision to be later adopted by participants in a summit on Bosnia-Herzegovina could be taken in Geneva, the circles said. A deal on the `division of tasks' should not, of course, be ruled out which means that in the process of implementing that plan the United States would be in charge of the Bosnian Muslims, Russia in charge of the Bosnian Serbs and Germany in charge of the Bosnian Croats. It is yet to be seen what the outcome of the latest meeting in Geneva will be, where in the past two years many attempts have been made to settle the Bosnian conflict. None of these attempts, however, have been successful and, as it has been announced in Moscow, Washington, London and Brussels, all participants in the Geneva meeting are now resolute to bring this issue to an end. In such circumstances, the Geneva meeting could also be the point of decision, the diplomatic circles said.
