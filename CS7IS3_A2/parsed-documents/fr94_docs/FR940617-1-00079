FR940617-1-00079 FR940617-1-00012 With regard to proof of clinical effectiveness, the agency is proposing specific criteria for final formulations of antiseptic handwashes or health-care personnel handwashes, patient preoperative skin preparations, and surgical hand scrubs that are based on the recommendations of the Panel and agency experience in evaluating the effectiveness of these types of drug products, as follows. For antiseptic handwash or health-care personnel handwash products, the agency is proposing the following criteria: (1) A 2-log 10 reduction of the indicator organism on each hand within 5 minutes after the first wash and (2) a 3-log 10 reduction in the indicator organism on each hand within 5 minutes after the tenth wash, when tested by a modification of the standard procedure for the evaluation of health-care personnel handwash formulations published by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) (Ref. 5). For patient preoperative skin preparations, the agency is proposing the following criteria: (1) A 2-log 10 reduction of the microbial flora per square centimeter of an abdominal test site, (2) a 3-log 10 reduction of the microbial flora per square centimeter of a groin test site within 10 minutes from a matched control area, and (3) the suppression of bacterial growth below baseline for 6 hours, when tested by a modification of the standard procedure for the evaluation of patient preoperative skin preparations published by the ASTM (Ref. 6). The agency believes that the revised effectiveness criteria more closely reflect the conditions of product use, i.e. , on a number of different body sites, each supporting different numbers of resident skin flora. In addition, although persistence of effect was not recommended by the Panel as a requirement for these drug products, the agency believes that persistence of antimicrobial effect would suppress the growth of residual skin flora not removed by preoperative prepping as well as transient micro-organisms inadvertently added to the operative field during the course of surgery and reduce the risk of surgical wound infection. Based on the proposed effectiveness criteria for this product class, the agency is proposing a revised definition of a patient preoperative skin preparation drug product in ยง333.403(c)(2) of this amended tentative final monograph as follows: ``A fast-acting broad-spectrum persistent antiseptic-containing preparation that significantly reduces the number of micro-organisms on intact skin.'' As discussed in section I.E., comment 10, the agency is proposing the indication ``for the preparation of the skin prior to an injection'' for OTC alcohol and isopropyl alcohol drug products. The agency is further proposing that products labeled for such use demonstrate effectiveness by testing according to the same procedure used to demonstrate the effectiveness of patient preoperative skin preparation drug products not labeled for this use. Based on this intended use of alcohol drug products, the agency is proposing a 1-log 10 reduction in the microbial flora per square centimeter of a dry skin test site within 30 seconds of product use as the effectiveness criteria for these products. For surgical hand scrub products, the agency is proposing the following criteria: (1) A 1-log 10 reduction of the microbial flora of each hand from the baseline count within 1 minute, (2) suppression of bacterial growth on each hand below baseline for 6 hours on the first day, (3) a 2-log 10 reduction of the microbial flora on each hand within 1 minute of product use by the end of the second day, and (4) a 3-log 10 reduction of the microbial flora on each hand within 1 minute of product use by the end of the fifth day, when tested by a modification of the standard procedure for the evaluation of surgical hand scrub products published by the ASTM (Ref. 7). Based on glove juice test data for surgical hand scrub use of povidone-iodine (section I.I., comment 17), alcohol (section I.E., comment 10), chloroxylenol (section I.G., comment 12), and triclosan (section I.L., comment 23), the agency concludes that formulated products containing certain ingredients, i.e. , chloroxylenol and triclosan, are substantive in their action and do not produce a high (1-log 10 ) initial reduction, but after repeated use for up to 5 days do reduce the baseline count and suppress the count in the user's glove. In a separate final rule, the agency stated that any product indicated for use as a surgical scrub should meet a standard for initial reduction. A one-log reduction was found acceptable as the minimal level of reduction suitable for a surgical scrub in a handwashing test.
