Action should now be taken against Serbian forces in the event that they attack the safe areas or block humanitarian and aid operations," he said at the key-note address of the consultative meeting of Nonaligned Movement (NAM) foreign ministers. Alatas said the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR)'s mandate to enforce and establish a unified command structure for all troops in Bosnia should be more effective. He also stressed the need to launch air strikes against Serbian forces and stop its arms supply. "The air strikes against Serbian forces and an interdiction of arms supplies to their units in Bosnia must now be put into effect," Alatas said, adding that the arms embargo on Bosnia should be lifted to rectify the acute imbalance of armaments in the field and to motivate the Serbs to come to the negotiating table. "Our current efforts on Bosnia are focused on these endeavours and on the feasibility of convening an international meeting on Bosnia." The minister also expressed concern over the crisis in countries such as Somalia and in the Middle East. He said the current situation in Somalia was complicated by the intended pullout of American, French, Italian, and Turkish troops that once made up the UN peacekeeping forces in the country. In addition, he also mentioned that Israel had not yet fulfilled the December 13 date to withdraw from designated areas as stipulated by the peace accord it signed with the PLO last September. "Further aggravating the situation is the persistence of oppressive Israeli policies and practices in the occupied territories and the inflexibility shown in its negotiations which cannot but have broader ramifications," he said. In his speech, Alatas said he hoped to see the Joint Coordinating Committee (JCC) establisted by NAM and the Group of 77 (G-77) begin its operations this year. "For this purpose, an ad-hoc working group comprising of members of NAM and G-77 will be established to formulate its term of reference," he said. The idea of forming the JCC was first mooted by heads of state at the 10th NAM summit in Jakarta two years ago. They had all stressed the need to harmonize, consolidate, and whenever necessary integrate the economic activities of both NAM and G-77. G-77 is a consultative forum for economic affairs of developing countries with Egypt as the leader. The JCC is expected to harmonize NAM's action programme for economic cooperation and the G-77's Caracas Program of Action (CPA). "When the JCC starts operating, we can expect South-South cooperation to be more focused and more efficient as it brings about the harmonization of APEC [Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation] and CPA programs," said Alatas. The two-day NAM ministerial consultative meeting was attended by foreign ministers and representatives of 22 member countries.
