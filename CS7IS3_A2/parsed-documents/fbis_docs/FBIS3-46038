The statement was made in an interview with XINHUA by the Azerbaijani foreign minister, who is attending the fourth annual meeting of the council of foreign ministers of the Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO), which opened here today. Up to now, he said, "Armenian forces have occupied 20 percent of our territories. As a result, 50,000 people became homeless, 2,000 schools and hospitals were destroyed and ruined during the war." Moreover, he warned, "Armenian forces are trying to launch a greater attack. They are even threatening us to occupy Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan. They have created a very strong army." The minister told XINHUA, "we want to settle these problems peacefully and through negotiations with the Armenian authorities." Therefore, he said, "we appealed to the world society and communities to demand that Armenians should obey U.N. Security Council resolutions and withdraw from our territories." During the first session of the ECO council of ministers this morning, the Azerbaijani foreign minister also called on international organizations to give political support to his country and help solve the disputes. In response to his call, Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati, who is playing a mediation role between the two sides, said at the meeting that it is unfortunate and the conflict in the region has caused great concern among the people in the world. He said that Iran would like to witness peaceful settlement of the dispute in the future. Hikmet Cetin, foreign minister of Turkey, also expressed his concern about the conflict, saying, "The situation in southern Caucasus and especially the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan require our immediate attention." During his interview with XINHUA, Hassan Hassanov suggested three measures to settle the problems: -- "The aggressors" should comprehend and realize that "it is aggression." -- Azerbaijan should have a strong army to drive the "Armenian aggressors" out of the occupied territories. At the same time, Azerbaijan wants to settle those problems by peaceful means and negotiations. -- The world organizations and the international community should force Armenia to obey the international rules and withdraw from its "occupied territories." When asked whether Azerbaijan asked for military support from other countries, Hassan Hassanov said, "We mainly want political support to solve this problem and never asked other countries for military support because we do not like other countries to interfere in any state conflict." In addition, he said, "we consider economic sanction should be adopted against Armenia because it uses economic support only for military purposes."
