Do you share this impression? Is the issue stuck or do you see some progress? [Peres] Look, we know how things work in Damascus. Until they give their agreement, frosty winds blow in all directions. People used to say that the difference between Syria and Lebanon is that with Lebanon it is very easy to reach an agreement but the agreement will be totally worthless, while with the Syrians it is very hard to reach an agreement but the agreement will stand. We will continue to act and strive until we convince the entire Middle East of the need for peace. In other words, we are the initiating party; we are not being dragged after anybody and we are not the offended party; we do not play sulking games. We have a very clear policy, and we must continue to act to implement it. [Gazit] Mr. Peres, a banner headline in today's press says that Israel agrees to the establishment of a Syrian early-warning station in the Galilee. Do you have any idea what this is about? [Peres] In my opinion, all these are premature speculations. I do not think we can discuss such details yet, because the problems between us and Syria are not of a technical nature but are a matter of principle. Only after we reach an agreement in principle will there be room to discuss technical issues. [Gazit] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, thank you very much.
