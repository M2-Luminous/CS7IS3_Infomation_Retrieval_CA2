FBIS4-10280 "drlat069_c_94005" FBIS-LAT-94-069 Daily Report 8 Apr 1994 MEXICO Religious Order Denies Allegation Religious Order Denies Allegation PA1004231594 Paris AFP in Spanish 2313 GMT 8 Apr 94 PA1004231594 Paris AFP Spanish BFN [Text] Mexico City, [no date as received] Apr (AFP) -- Jeronimo Hernandez Lopez, a Jesuit priest, "is not Subcommander Marcos," the military chief of the Zapatista guerrillas in the southeastern Mexican State of Chiapas, as the daily SUMMA reported on Friday. Thus was communicated to AFP by Carlos Morfin, member of the Mexican Chapter of the Jesuit Order. The Jesuits "strongly condemned" the publication as "totally false," given that the priest has been working in a Guatemalan refugee camp since 1992; this is why the authorities have his activities registered, Morfin added. SUMMA published on Thursday [day as received] on its front page a note in which it was reported that Hernandez Lopez was Subcommander Marcos. This was based on a federal government investigation considered to be a "state secret." According to the "secret" report, a computer study of photographs and videos established "a great similarity between the Jesuit priest and Subcommander Marcos, who hides his face behind a ski mask. Hernandez Lopez, 36, is registered with the Mexican Commission for Aid to Refugees, as the authorities demand of all those who work in the Guatemalan refugee camps, Morfin stressed. From 5 August 1992 to 5 April 1994, Father Hernandez Lopez was assigned to provide pastoral ministry to the Guatemalan refugees in the State of Campeche, in southern Mexico, Morfin explained in an official Jesuit Order communique, subsequently sent to AFP. Since 5 April he was transferred to Chiapas to cooperate in a project the Jesuits have in Bachajon hamlet, the communique adds. Morfin said that Lopez's new transfer "had been reported to Diego Valadez, attorney general of the republic, and Government Secretary Jorge Carpizo, as several days ago he had been interviewed and photographed by national security agents who wanted to confirm his location and place of work." The Jesuits "strongly condemned SUMMA's report," indicating "it is not very professional to generate slander and insecurity stemming from false reports, without indicating who is responsible for the mentioned investigation." It added that "it was very serious to involve the federal government in general. This publication is added to a long list of false accusations, orchestrated by some media." The Jesuit member said they fear for the priest's security after publication of the newspaper report; therefore they have talked with the nation's authorities to clear up the matter.
