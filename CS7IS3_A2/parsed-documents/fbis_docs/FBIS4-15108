FBIS4-15108 "drsov067_s_94006" FBIS-SOV-94-067 Daily Report 6 Apr 1994 Georgia No Conclusions No Conclusions LD0604182694 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1519 GMT 6 Apr 94 LD0604182694 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature no. 66 (556) compiled by Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy and edited by Vladimir Shishlin] [Text] On Wednesday the Georgian parliament continued the discussion of the documents on a settlement in Abkhazia signed in Moscow last Monday. On Tuesday the debate produced no results. According to a correspondent for Interfax, the opposition working against the Moscow agreements failed to make constructive proposals that would offer an alternative to the agreements. Boris Kakubava even tried to raise the question of confidence in the head of state Eduard Shevardnadze. However, the proposal did not win support from the majority. The chairman of the provisional committee for the state of emergency Jaba Ioseliani asked the opposition: "What do you want then? If you want war, say that openly, but it you want peace, it should be approached step by step, for instance through such documents as those signed in Moscow." Shevarndnadze's personal representative Aleksandr Kavsadze thinks that the Georgian-Abkhaz agreement signed in Moscow on the return of refugees and displaced persons is going to become a foundation for resolving the main question: the sending of a UN peace-keeping force to Abkhazia. According to him, the two sides agreed on further steps to continue settling the conflict by political means. On Friday Sochi will host the first session of the four-sided commission (Georgia, Abkhazia, Russia and the UN) for the return of refugees. The session is expected to continue in Geneva on April 12. The final decision should be made then on the sending of a peace-keeping force. On April 19 in Geneva the status of Abkhazia should be discussed by international experts and lawyers. In the opinion of the head of the Abkhazian parliament Vladislav Ardzinba, the Moscow accords open up prospects of a peace settlement. He thinks that the main thing now is the observation of the agreements by all the sides. In an interview with Interfax he said Abkhazia would observe the agreements. He is convinced that with an unstable situation in Georgia only the deployment of a peace-keeping force on the dividing line between Abkhazia and Georgia can guarantee peace. Meanwhile, the head of the Georgian security force Igor Georgadze has told a news conference in Tbilisi that there are no hostilities at the moment in Abkhazia. However, he could not say whether this can be accounted to the Moscow accords. He did not rule out the possibility that the recent acts of terrorism in Tbilisi were related to the war between criminal clans that amassed fortunes on the hostilities in Abkhazia. According to the security chief, the investigation of all the cases will be completed in the nearest future. Georgadze said security forces have proofs of links between high-ranking officials who were in charge of the military policy in Abkhazia with the looters who operated there. He said all the ties are being investigated. Answering a question from Interfax whether Georgia is conducting intelligence activities in other countries Georgadze said: "He have our hands full with our own problems in this country."
