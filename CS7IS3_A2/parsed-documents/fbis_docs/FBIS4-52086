From this issue, our radio editor has this to say: On 20 April, after considering reports by the U.S. Senate and House on the appropriation bill for activities of the State Department and other agencies in the 1994-95 fiscal year, the House of Representatives voted against the proposal of Representative [name indistinct] opposing the Senate's (?praise) of the Vietnamese Government's good cooperation in the settlement of the MIA issue and the U.S. President's lifting of the embargo against Vietnam. Before voting, Representative [name indistinct] asked the representatives of the committee not to agree with the Senate's assessment. However, some representatives rejected [name indistinct] statement, saying that the President's decision to lift the embargo was correct. Representative Peterson, Democrat from Florida, held that it is unacceptable to think of retaliation now. He said it is high time to seek solutions. Finally, with 209 votes against, [name indistinct] proposal has been rejected. Most of the representatives voted for the U.S. Senate's assessment on Vietnam's good cooperation in the MIA issue and affirmed the support to President Clinton's decision to lift the embargo on Vietnam. This was the first time that U.S. House of Representatives voted for Vietnam issue following the Senate voting asking for the President to lift the embargo on Vietnam on 27 January 1994. This event expressed the current common trend of development in the United States -- advancing toward normalization of relations with Vietnam in the interests of both the United States and Vietnam and the common trend in the world for peace, cooperation, and development. In fact, following the U.S. decision to lift the embargo on Vietnam, both sides exchanged views on the setting up of liaison offices and other issues of common concern. In an interview with the Paper TUOI TRE [Youth], Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam said: Recent talks at different levels between Vietnam and the United States produced good results. In the near future, the United States and Vietnam will set up liaison offices in Hanoi and in Washington. Moreover, American companies which have arrived in Vietnam to sign contracts prior to the lifting of the embargo now start to implement their projects. Besides, more and more American companies wish to invest in Vietnam for its economic development. The Vietnamese diplomat said he believes that both the countries will sooner or later set up diplomatic relations at ambassadorial level.
