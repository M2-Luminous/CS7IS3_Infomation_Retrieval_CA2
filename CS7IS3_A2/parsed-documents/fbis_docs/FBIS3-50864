They agreed that it was an action motivated by "a desire to create a political event." President Lacalle reiterated to the interior minister "his total support" in "getting to the bottom" of the matter within the framework of the investigations being carried out to find those responsible for the attack, which was labeled "a political issue." The Artigas Guard claimed responsibility for the attack. This is a clandestine group whose members identify themselves as the intermediate commands of the Army. This group also claimed responsibility for the attack against the studio of former President Julio Sanguinetti in mid-1992, in addition to other actions. Military sources told this daily that the Army is continuing the investigation ordered by Army Commander Daniel Garcia when the clandestine organization released the so-called Bulletin No. 2. A military source said: "No conclusion has been reached, and therefore nothing certain can be said. The Artigas Guard is being investigated, including its possible connections with the Army if it has any, because its members call themselves the intermediate commands." Military and government sources indicated that "there is no evidence" to presume they are indeed military personnel. One of the sources said: "They call themselves intermediate commands, but this has not been verified. It has also not been verified what their composition is: whether they be civilian, civilian and military, or military alone." Army Commander General Daniel Garcia told this newspaper on 7 October 1993 that "the people responsible for the attack have not yet been identified, but when this happens it will be known because there will be a very big noise. Working in silence does not mean we are not working." He added: "The day we find the members of the so-called Artigas Guard, or anyone responsible for any other irregular event, we will react vigorously within the current legal regulations." The official sources noted that the investigation of this case is being carried out by the Security and Investigation Directorate of the Police Information and Intelligence National Directorate and by the Technical Police National Directorate, in cooperation with the Defense Information Service of the Defense Ministry.
