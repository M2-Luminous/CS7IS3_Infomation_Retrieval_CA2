Status of Environmental Analysis: This application has been accepted for filing and was previously noticed as ready for environmental analysis. Comments, recommendations, terms and conditions, or prescriptions pertaining to entrainment were not solicited, however, because we had not decided on whether the data and results from the entrainment studies completed for the Rothschild Project No. 2212, Centralia Project No. 2255, and Wisconsin River Division Project No. 2590 could be extrapolated to an environmental analysis of this project. We have determined that the data and results for the three other projects can be extrapolated to this project. Therefore, we now request comments, recommendations, terms and conditions, or prescriptions pertaining to entrainment for this project. l. Description of Project: The project structures consist of earth dikes, a powerhouse, and a Taintor gate spillway. Earth dikes on each side of the concrete powerhouse/spillway structure, constructed of poorly graded sands and gravelly sands, are up to 30 feet high and have a total length of 1,190 feet. The 190.6 foot wide powerhouse/spillway structure includes three 20-foot-wide by 15-foot-high Taintor gates and four 22.5-foot-wide intake bays. Three of the intakes are equipped with twin horizontal turbines (two are connected to 800-Kw generators). The fourth intake is equipped with a vertical turbine connected to a 300-Kw generator. The applicant proposes to add an 800-Kw generator to the third twin horizontal turbine. At the normal project headwater elevation of 1,458.4 feet, the reservoir surface area is 1,420 acres and the storage volume is 18,200 acre feet. Normal head on the turbines is 23 feet. The existing project would also be subject to Federal takeover under sections 14 and 15 of the Federal Power Act. m. Purpose of Project: The purpose of the project is to generate electric power for sale to Wisconsin Public Service Corporation. n. This Notice Also Consists of the Following Standard Paragraphs: A4 and D9. o.
