This information was announced yesterday by Telebras [Brazilian Telecommunications Inc.] President Adyr da Silva during a briefing before the National Defense Committee of the Chamber of Deputies. This Brazilian project seeks to resist an onslaught by foreign companies, especially that by Motorola, which is casting its net wide in search of partners for its $4-billion megaproject called Iridium, which seeks to surround the earth with a network of telephone communications satellites. Brazil was not impressed with Iridium because of its high cost and the impossibility of having a say in its development. Therefore, it sought its own alternative. This project, which has been called Eco-8, will only cost $265 million and will consist of an uplink to eight satellites orbiting the equator at a height of 2,000 km. It will enable telephone communications from any point of the country. Explaining that this technology will permit communications even in non-cost-effective regions, Da Silva noted: "This is no dream; it is our objective." Beside telephone communications, the satellite network will make possible communications by fax, location by radio, telemetry, border control, and rural telephony, among other things. The technology to develop this project is almost entirely available on the Brazilian market and the domestic industry has the know-how to manufacture the equipment. Even the launching of the satellites can be achieved with a domestic rocket from the Alcantara Base in Maranhao State. The only problem is the range of the Brazilian rocket, since it is still unable to reach a height of 2,000 km. Da Silva said that if this is not possible by then, the satellites can be put into a lower orbit, although this will leave 25 percent of the territory without coverage. The domestic satellites manufactured by the National Institute of Space Research (INPE) will be used to test some of the systems of the Eco-8 project.
