He added that the political leadership of the PLO must not accept a compromise stand from President Clinton's administration, noting that it must not respond to his call to go to Washington. Al-Hasan said that the bloodbath that occurred in the Ibrahimi Mosque and the Juniyah massacre against Christian worshipers are both part of an Israeli plan to create chaos in the region on the road to establishing a new Israeli geopolitical situation. Al-Hasan called for escalating confrontations against the Israeli enemy until the army begins to withdraw from our territories--occupied since 1967--under UN supervision. He noted that the escalation of confrontations and the shedding of the heroic martyrs' blood will only be considered a turning point if the current negotiations are immediately halted and the Declaration of Principles signed in Oslo is terminated. There can be no negotiations except those based on a comprehensive solution and an immediate Israeli withdrawal from our beloved homeland. Al-Hasan urged the Egyptian Government to take measures, to at least immediately withdraw its Egyptian ambassador from Tel Aviv and to expel the Israeli ambassador from Cairo. He called on the Palestinian political forces to meet in order to draw the bases for a national unity aimed at escalating the struggle and confrontation against the Israeli enemy. Al-Hasan said: Fatah cadres inside and outside the occupied territories should close their ranks and return to our revolutionary and sound course. He said that these are historic days in which the failing ones will be severely punished. He added: As of today, there will be no place for political committees. Glory to the great intifadah.
