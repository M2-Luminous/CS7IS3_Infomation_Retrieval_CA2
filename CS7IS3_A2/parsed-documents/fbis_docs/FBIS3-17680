In his letter to his Azerbaijani counterpart, Mr. Papoulias said: I hope that your visit to Athens will enable the EU to have a more profound understanding of problems related to Nagorno-Karabakh, and raise the ties between our countries to a new level of development. Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov met Belgian Vice Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Mr. Willy Claes, who was the EU president for 1993, in Brussels last December and had expressed his desire to address EU members on situation in Azerbaijan. Gasan Gasanov also noted that in view of the fact there is no satisfactory information about Azerbaijan in the West and most of the time the existing information is not objective, the EU should use all its possibilities productively to obtain first-hand information. This proposal of the Azerbaijani foreign minister was examined by the relevant EU organs and approved.
