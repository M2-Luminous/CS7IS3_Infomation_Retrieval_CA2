At the top is the Ministry of Finance; at the second level, the finance departments of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government; at the third level, the finance offices of counties, municipalities, autonomous counties, and districts directly administered by municipalities; and at the fourth level, the finance departments of townships and towns. Of these four levels, the last three make up local public finance, the foundation of the national financial system. If we compare public finance at the national level with local public finance, we readily see that the latter is a pillar of national public finance. Through their operations, local financial management regulates and controls the workings of the economy at the local level and provide financial backing for both central and local governments in the discharge of their responsibilities. Now that the 14th CPC National Congress has called for the creation of a socialist market economy, local public management plays an even more important role. Thus correctly understanding the principles of local finance is enormously significant for straightening out the financial relations between the center and the localities and promoting national economic development. These are the basic characteristics of local financial management: Characteristic one: Local financial management is the main force in national financial management. Statistics show that not only do revenue and expenditure at the local level account for the lion's share of all revenue and expenditures in the nation numerically (exceeding 60 percent in most cases) but they also make up a steadily rising portion of all national revenue and expenditures. In China, total government revenue consists of three components: revenue collected by the central government, revenue collected by local governments, and national debt income. After adjusting for the factor of national debt income, we see that revenue collected by local governments has consistently exceeded 66 percent of total government revenue, often by as much as 6 percentage points. (See Table 1, Row III.) This highlights the remarkably outstanding role played by local revenue in revenue collection. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 1.

For a long time in the past, local governments collected more in revenue than what they spent, as Table 2 indicates. In Table 2, the period 1963 to 1965 is not comparable with other periods because of the dissimilar duration. In these three years, revenue exceeded expenditures 39.32 billion yuan, or 13.11 billion yuan per year on the average. For a five-year period, the combined surplus would have been 65.53 billion yuan. So we can conclude that from the First Five-Year Plan through the fourth, the broad trend was for local revenue to exceed expenditures by a steadily widening margin. However, beginning with the Fifth Five-Year Plan, the surplus in local finance started to shrink so much so that by the Seventh Five-Year Plan, it was replaced by a 26.95 billion yuan shortfall. Table 2. Local Revenue and Expenditures: A Comparison (Units: billion yuan) Period First Second 1963-1965 Third Fourth Fifth Sixth Seventh Five-Year Five-Year Five-Year Five-Year Five-Year Five-Year Five-Year Plan Plan Plan Plan Plan Plan Plan Revenue minus 39.13 44.91 39.32 75.84 159.4 152.89 118.63 -26.95 expenditures One important reason for the deterioration in the local budgetary situation is national financial reform that replaced "eating from one stove" with "eating from separate stoves." The central government has delegated to the local authorities a measure of financial power but also entrusted them with additional responsibilities. In other words, even as local authorities collected more in revenue, their spending also went up. When spending increased faster than revenue, the excess of revenue over spending began to diminish, perhaps even to the extent of turning a surplus into a deficit. As a matter of fact, the size of the surplus began shrinking in the latter part of the Fifth Five-Year, that is, after 1979, exactly the point at which China embarked on full-fledged economic management reform following the 3d Plenum of the 11th CPC Central Committee and localities began experimenting with the "eating-from-separate-stove" system. In this sense, therefore, that revenue at the local level did not outgrow expenditures as much as it used to is justifiable. However, we must see that local revenue plunged relative to expenditure after the Seventh Five-Year Plan, even falling into negative territory. After 1988, in particular, the local budget deficit really took off (see Table 3), approaching or overtaking the budget deficit at the national level in some years, a situation that is clearly unjustifiable. There are four reasons for this state of affairs. 1) The contract system between the state and enterprises has put a tight lid on local government revenue. 2) Local general financial contracting, which began in 1988, not only prevented central government revenue from rising at the same pace as local revenue, but also encouraged the local finance departments to calculate income based on institutions. When its share of the income derived from organizations, or institutional income is insufficient to meet local needs (but is high enough to affect the issue of subsidies by the finance department at the higher level), a local government may cut taxes or defer tax payment in order to keep local wealth local. 3) The practice of fixing base figures virtually encourages the localities to minimize revenue collection while maximizing expenditures to avoid a situation in the future in which they would be stuck with a high income base figure and a low spending base figure in the event of a change in system, which would work to their disadvantage. 4) The economy has not been performing too well lately and has yet to emerge completely from the doldrums. And then there is inflation, which causes a shortfall in local government revenue, on the one hand, and sharply rising outlays, on the other. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 3.

For years the national government has been running a deficit in its budget, which keeps going up relentlessly: 12.12 billion yuan in the Sixth Five-Year Plan; 46.07 billion yuan in the Seventh Five-Year Plan; 20.27 billion yuan in 1991, which fell within the Eighth Five-Year Plan; and 23.75 billion yuan in 1992. For 1993, the budget deficit is projected to top 20 billion yuan as well. It should be said that the current budgetary situation is still not ideal. After the drive in 1990 to improve the economic environment and rectify the economic order, in particular, the national economy entered a phase of growth, yet the budget deficit has stubbornly refused to budge. The objective demand is that the local authorities help the central government balance its budget. In recent years, however, local financial units have not been collecting enough revenue to cover their own expenses. Among county-level financial units, especially, operating in the red is most common. (Units running a deficit account for about half of all budgetary units at the county level.) Local financial units are not currently authorized to change tax rates, levy new taxes, or issue bonds, not to mention overdrawing from the bank. Hence the budget deficit, which effectively means tapping into special funds and overdrawing from one's account, thereby disrupting the normal functioning of the economy. Working through their local people's congresses, many localities have even legalized their deficits, to the detriment of the effort to balance the budget at the national level. We should take note of these problems. Characteristic three: Emphasis in local public finance on institutional income. We can distinguish between institutional income and noninstitutional income. Noninstitutional income refers to the income derived by finance departments at all levels as a result of their participation in social product and labor distribution by virtue of their state power. Such income is created before the budgetary appropriation and distribution process and is at the disposal of the Ministry of Finance. Institutional income refers to the income at the direct disposal of finance departments at all levels after the budgetary appropriation and distribution process. Noninstitutional income is an important prerequisite for institutional income while institutional income is in inevitable extension of noninstitutional income in the budgetary appropriation and allocation process. The reason is that without institutional income, there would be no distribution basis for the budgetary allocation of incomes and expenditures. On the other hand, what a local finance agency collects in revenue often is not the same thing as revenue that it is free to keep for its own use. Some units collect a good deal of revenue but retain only a small portion for their own use, while just the opposite happens in other units. The budgetary process requires that a unit which collects more in revenue than what it spends turn over an appropriate share of its revenue to the higher authorities, forming revenue turned over to the higher authorities for the latter's disposal. A unit that spends more than what it collects in revenue will be given a certain amount of subsidy by the higher authorities, forming a subsidy income. In this way noninstitutional income is converted into institutional income through distribution within the financial system. Against the backdrop of "eating from separate stoves," it is clear that as far as local finance agencies are concerned, only institutional incomes are real incomes. While they attach importance to noninstitutional incomes, therefore, most of them take institutional incomes even more seriously. One of the key missions of national financial management is to ensure an adequate income (essential to the discharge of duties and responsibilities by the central government) for the state coffers, that is, noninstitutional income, through the pursuit of institutional incomes by local governments. Only by clearly understanding the laws governing the amount of institutional incomes at the local level and its growth can we develop a sound distribution relationship between the finance agency at the top and its local counterparts. Since reform has been under way, China adjusted the local financial system rather extensively in 1980, 1985, 1988, and 1992. Every round of adjustment was well suited to the circumstances at the time and has enriched our experience with the financial management system of "eating from separating stoves." Nevertheless, we must also realize that establishing a sound local financial management system is a highly complex piece of systems engineering. It requires an appropriate degree of stability, yet the local financial system is open to influence by a host of internal variables (the scale and structure of economic development, the scale of government spending and the mix of expenses, and changes in the fiscal policy) and external variables (price changes, changes in other management systems). If we are just a tad careless, some localities may end up with too much financial power while others may have too little, putting national financial management in a passive position. Characteristic four: To a certain extent deficit budgeting is forced upon the localities. On the one hand, deficit budgeting is forced upon the localities by institutional shortcomings. In a basic sense, a locality cannot balance its budget if the local economy is not developed enough. But we also must see that the financial system has a major impact on revenue and expenditures. To begin with, errors in the revenue management system may turn a surplus in many a local budget into a deficit. In some areas, for instance, revenue used to exceed expenditures. Then came a system of turning over revenue to the higher level at sharply escalating rates, which slowed revenue growth relative to the increase in expenditures until the surplus finally was replaced by a deficit. At the spending end, moreover, there may be loopholes in the management system which also could turn a surplus into a budget deficit. Take, for instance, the practice of using a base number to establish a spending base level. A locality with relatively modest expenses in the base year would end up with a contact spending base number that is quite low, while another locality with substantial expenses in the base year would end up with a contract spending base number that is higher. Suppose these two localities are similar in every other aspect, but just because they differ in the contract spending base number, their spending burden in years to come would also be different. The burden on the former will be a little heavier; on the latter, a little lighter. Those which are overburdened may run a deficit. Furthermore, the fact that financial power and responsibilities are not clearly divided among the various levels has also forced some localities into the red. For one thing, there is irregular enterprise transfer. Many localities are only too keen to take care of profitable enterprises while dumping unprofitable ones on the lower level. As a result, many local governments at the lower levels had their "plums" taken away from them but found themselves saddled with new baggage. Although enterprise transfer did include some adjustment of financial power by the higher levels, in most cases adjustment only took care of the immediate, not the long run, making a budget deficit inevitable. In some cases, the "higher level comes up with the policy and the lower level writes the check." Some areas were already shouldering a heavy burden to begin with. After the higher level unveiled the policy of increasing subsidies to reward growth, they either dragged their feet (which is hard to do) or went along reluctantly, which inevitably led to deficit budgeting. Moreover, tax levying was overly influenced by the tax collection plan, instead of following the tax code fully. As presently constituted, the tax collection plan does not take into consideration all the factors in a comprehensive way, but mainly uses the revenue level a year ago or for the past several years as the bench-mark. The natural outcome is a substantial gap between the amount of planned revenue and the amount of revenue that would be collected if the tax law is followed. When the former is smaller than the latter, tax departments would cut taxes or defer tax payment in an unprincipled way, which may push a local budget into the red unnecessarily. On the other hand, the budget deficit is forced upon the locality by the lack of variety in revenue-raising methods. On the national level, the state can try to balance its budget in a host of ways. On the revenue side, it can enhance its regular income by making laws and policies and boost its irregular revenue by borrowing against the national debt, making overdrafts at banks, and borrowing from localities. Local governments, in contrast, basically must fall back on institutional income to balance their budgets; there is relatively little room for them to maneuver. As with the central government, local governments also resort to borrowing when they have no other choice. Yet thus far we have not formulated any clear and sound regulations governing how much borrowing there can be, the mix of loans, their periods of maturation, or interest rates. Accordingly we must work mighty hard to eliminate the institutional causes of the deficits in local budgets as we further our reform. We must waste no time in adopting a factor-based method for fixing spending base numbers. We must do a better job relating the tax collection plan to local economic realities. We must also regularize the debt relations between the Ministry of Finance and local finance offices and the debt relations between local finance offices and other areas by writing them into law.
