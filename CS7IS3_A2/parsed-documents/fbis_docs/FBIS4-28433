FBIS4-28433 "dreas112_c_94031" FBIS-EAS-94-112 Daily Report 7 Jun 1994 North Korea U.S Noncombatant Evacuation Exercise Denounced U.S Noncombatant Evacuation Exercise Denounced SK0806101094 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 1309 GMT 7 Jun 94 SK0806101094 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 1309 GMT 7 Jun 94 Korean BFN [Text] According to a radio report from Seoul, the U.S. imperialist aggressive forces occupying South Korea conducted the so-called noncombatant evacuation operation exercise in Pusan on 6 June. They conducted the exercise on all U.S. soldiers and their family members who live in the U.S. bases throughout South Korea. It is said, therefore, that the exercise is aimed at checking their preparedness if they can rapidly evacuate from South Korea in the time of a so-called emergency situation. Furthermore, the noncombatant evacuation operation exercise is conducted under the pretext of our nonexistent nuclear issue at a time when the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets lead the situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of war. This fact has become another example of showing that their preparation for a northward invasion has been accelerated to a practical stage [silchondangye].
