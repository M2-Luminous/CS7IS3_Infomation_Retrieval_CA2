FR940607-2-00147 FR940607-2-00090 II. Reasons for Designating Certain Data Elements as Proprietary While Congress wished to shed increased light on the affordable-housing activities of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, it is virtually impossible to be certain that the release of any particular data from the loan registries would be harmless to Freddie Mac, particularly during this interim period. Freddie Mac operates in an environment in which its operations are constantly scrutinized by analysts at Fannie Mae, on Wall Street, and in other sophisticated financial institutions. Those analysts have access to information from a variety of sources, and have increasing abilities to analyze that information in ways that one may not immediately imagine. The data elements Freddie Mac has designated contain the type of information that Freddie Mac does not customarily release to the public, and if all those data elements were to be publicly disclosed, we believe a variety of competitive and financial harms could be suffered by Freddie Mac. In some cases, this harm could occur as a result of the disclosure of a data element standing on its own; in other cases, the harm would occur because of a correlation of one data element with another. The following are examples of problems that disclosure of all the elements would pose: (1) Both competitors and customers would be able to learn a great deal about the types of loans we are targeting for purchase in particular areas of the country, thereby enabling them to counter our marketing strategy more effectively. Moreover, the data would be available in one place, permitting competitors to obtain information relatively cheaply; (2) Competitors and customers would be able to learn far more than they can learn now as to our philosophy and strategy concerning the purchase of newly originated versus seasoned loans; (3) Both customers and competitors would be able to learn more about the cycles of Freddie Mac's business during the year, e.g., times at which we tend to be more busy than others, and the likely implications of seasonality to our pricing strategy; (4) By analyzing the types of products we are purchasing, and where the purchases are occurring, customers and competitors would be able to divine a great deal of nonpublic information about our likely strategy for meeting the affordable housing goals; (5) Customers and competitors would learn far more than they currently know about how the mix of mortgage types that we purchase varies by region, thereby affecting the course of business negotiations in particular transactions in particular regions: (6) Customers and competitors would be able to change the dynamics of business negotiations regarding the disposition of real estate owned (``REO''), since they would have access to far greater information concerning our REO disposition strategies and practices. In addition, by analyzing REO statistics, a competitor could learn much about our default patterns; (7) Customers and competitors would could use seemingly non-proprietary data as a ``proxy'' for information that clearly is proprietary, or could use seemingly non-proprietary data as a link to other available information, so as to reveal other, previously inaccessible proprietary information. In each case, the disclosure of information would work to the disadvantage of Freddie Mac, and to the advantage of other parties. Also, in many cases_particuarly, but not exclusively, in the multifamily field_the public release of all the data elements listed in a fully correlated manner probably would permit reviewers of the data to identify specific properties. This raises important issues of personal privacy for homeowners, tenants, and lenders, who could soon expect to become the targets of marketing efforts not only by our competitors, but by other businesses seeking to market their products in demographic niches. In comparable circumstances, HUD has previously taken the position that it would not release individual mortgage records in response to a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, because it would be an unwarranted invasion of the borrowers' privacy interests. See Schoettle v. Kemp, 733 F. Supp. 1395 (D. Haw. 1990) (upholding denial of FOIA request based on Exemption 6, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(6)): see also Heights Community Congress v. Veterans Administration, 732 F.2d 526 (6th Cir. 1984) (court upholding VA's denial of FOIA request for property address, loan amount and identity of lender on VA-insured loans in certain city, based on FOIA Exemption 6). In light of the above concerns, Freddie Mac has evaluated each data element to determine whether or not its release would be reasonably likely to cause Freddie Mac competitive or financial harm, either standing alone or linked to other available information. In the interest of making as much data as possible available to the public, Freddie Mac also considered whether certain data elements might be made available as separate files or packages of data elements, so that they could be released without identifying the location of the underlying property. Without a link to the geographic data, there may be no reason for HUD to withhold certain data elements as proprietary information. Similarly, we considered whether certain data elements might be recoded so that HUD would not need to withhold them as proprietary information. Such alternative treatments would substantially reduce Freddie Mac's proprietary concerns with respect to those data elements, while making more information available to the public, consistent with the intent of Congress. See S. Rep. No. 464, 102d Cong., 2d Sess. 44 (1992) (``The Director is encouraged whenever possible to develop disclosure methods that take into account any proprietary concerns, while continuing public access to the information.''). The results of Freddie Mac's evaluations, including proposed alternative treatments of certain data elements, are summarized in the attachment to this request. We trust that this request and attachment will be sufficient for HUD to make its determination that the information contained in the data elements designated in the attachment to this request contain ``proprietary'' information_that is, that the designated data elements contain information that Freddie Mac does not customarily release to the public and that the release of that information could tend to cause financial or competitive injury to Freddie Mac, or could tend to impair competition between Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. Alternatively, it should be sufficient for HUD to find that it cannot determine that certain of those data elements do not contain ``proprietary'' information. In either case, the designated data elements should not be made publicly available. * * * * *
