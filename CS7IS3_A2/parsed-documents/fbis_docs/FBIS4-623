Mr. Finca said, at a special session of the council at Bisho, that his administration had put an immediate hold on all sales of state land in Ciskei. It was also investigating massive land deals over the past few months. The investigation would not exclude land sold to the former head of state Oupa Gqozo. Mr. Finca said the administration did not intend conducting a witch hunt, but all allegations of corruption would be thoroughly investigated.
