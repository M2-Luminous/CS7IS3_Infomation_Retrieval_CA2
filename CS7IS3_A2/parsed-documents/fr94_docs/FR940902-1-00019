Statement No. 115 does not apply to investments in equity securities accounted for under the equity method nor to investments in consolidated subsidiaries. At the time of acquisition, an entity must classify debt and equity securities into one of three categories: held-to-maturity, available-for-sale, or trading. At the balance sheet date, the appropriateness of the classifications must be reassessed. Investments in debt securities are classified as held-to-maturity and are measured at amortized cost in the balance sheet only if the reporting entity has the positive intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity. Debt securities are not classified as held-to-maturity if the entity has the intent to hold the security only for an indefinite period; for example if the security would become available for sale in response to changes in market interest rates and related changes in the security's prepayment risk, needs for liquidity, changes in the availability of and the yield on alternative investments, changes in funding sources and terms, and changes in foreign currency risk.
