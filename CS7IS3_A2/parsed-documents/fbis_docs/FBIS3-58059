Testifying at the Milan trial of financier Sergio Cusani in connection with kickbacks paid for the failed public-private joint venture, Enimont, Portesi said he met several times in 1991 with Northern League leader Umberto Bossi and party treasurer Alessandro Patelli on request from the company. Portesi said Bossi asked for contributions in the form of campaign advertising, while Patelli also suggested "financing for foreign companies." In the end, Portesi said he delivered the 200 million lire in cash to Patelli at a Rome cafe and that Patelli did not request the joint receipt required by laws on financing of political parties. Patelli was arrested in connection with the funds on 7 December and Bossi was placed under investigation for the same case on December 20. The Northern League, which claims to be innocent of any and all political corruption, said the entire affair was a mistake by Patelli and has offered to return the money. At his testimony, Portesi also described other contributions made by the chemical giant to politicians for the 1992 elections. Today's court session, the twentieth in the trial, was the first attended by Cusani himself, who faces charges of falsifying accounts and violation of party financing laws. The first person to be brought to trial in the vast Clean Hands scandal, Cusani spent five months in Milan's San Vittore jail and was granted house arrest on December 23. The financial expert refused to appear in court during his jail term, saying he would answer questions only as a free man. Among those due to take the witness stand today were the administrative secretaries of the Social Democrats, Liberals and Christian Democrats, former Socialist Senator Bruno Pellegrini, Socialist MP Paolo Pilliteri, Liberal MP Egidio Sterpa, and Vincenzo D'Urso, assistant to the late Socialist Party administrative secretary Vincenzo Balsamo. Among those who received unrecorded campaign contributions, according to Portesi, were former Socialist Foreign Minister Gianni Di Michelis, Milan Mayor Paolo Pillitteri, Maurizio Pagani of the Christian Democrat Party and Republican Senator Antonio Del Pennino. Portesi said he obtained two billion lire from Montedison Chairman Carlo Sama to distribute during the election campaign but that he did not spend it all and returned the left-over money to Sama.
