"I simply do not understand Mr. Meshkov," Vasyl Onopenko said in an interview with KIEVSKIYE VEDOMOSTI. "I think that he does not take into account the consequences of his actions. I will not list all Ukrainian laws or articles of the Constitution that have been violated by this decision. I will provide just one typical example: The Crimean minister learned about his dismissal from the Crimean radio. It is very sad that Yuriy Meshkov is violating the same Constitution by which he swore and to which he pledged allegiance."
