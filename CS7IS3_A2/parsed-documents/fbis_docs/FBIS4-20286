Alevras Criticizes Leadership According to an article in the 16 April Athens daily ELEVTHEROTIPIA, PASOK oldtimer and former president of the Chamber of Deputies Yiannis Alevras unleashed a series of attacks during the PASOK congress directed at what he claimed is "the total takeover of PASOK by large economic interests." Alevras is cited as saying that "socialism is not only an ideology but a lifestyle as well." Those who govern, he added, must live within the "most transparent of walls." He criticized the government for forgetting the "still existing underprivileged" Greeks and for its "continuing unstable course," accusing it of being concerned solely with the economic crisis and its diplomatic efforts on Macedonia. Alevras blamed the party leadership for organizing the congress with "unseemly haste" and for "hunting votes." The article notes the attack was a "first" for Alevras, who declared he is not a candidate for any position. An editorial in the 16 April ELEVTHEROTIPIA noted that the much-applauded Alevras "told many truths," which are subscribed to by all concerned about the crisis of confidence that prevails in Greek political life. The editorial also noted that government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos, whose reply to Alevras' statements was "rather ironical," did not show Alevras the respect he deserves. Simitas on Solution of Country's Problems The same article in the 16 April ELEVTHEROTIPIA reported Minister of Industry and Commerce Kostas Simitis as indirectly criticizing the government during the congress. Simitis declared that the country will solve its problems by achieving a competitive economy through interaction with the international environment, ending the tendency to make "subjects" out of "citizens," redistributing income and wealth by taxing large economic interests, becoming more sensitive on tax evasion matters, and no longer allowing party members to become "mere professional politicians." He added that "unity" must become the PASOK password. Liani Against `Religious Lobbies' In the same article, the prime minister's wife, Dhimitra Liani, is reported to have sent the congress a written "proposal for consideration" focusing on the "protection of Hellenism and Orthodoxy" and the attention to be paid to the plight of Pondian Greeks. She warned against the "religious lobbies that exert pressure and even achieve the goal of military intervention," as well as against the "economic interests using religion as a disguise that are changing the balance in the Balkans." Yennimatas, Vaso Papandreou Statements The same article reported that ailing Minister of National Economy Yiorgos Yennimatas' written message to the congress counseling unity and the preservation of a united front on Greece's national issues of Cyprus, Thraki, the Aegean, the Balkans, Skopje, and Ipiros met with enthusiastic applause. The article also reports that former Eurodeputy and present PASOK deputy Vaso Papandreou declared that during the government's first five months mistakes were made concerning certain policies and choices of people. Such errors must not be repeated, she said, if the Greek people are not to be disappointed in the PASOK government. Papandreou charged that internal democracy is not functioning and that transparency and meritocracy are lacking. She also denounced, as she had done in the past, the "brotherly knifings" that are increasingly occurring "under the table." While not putting into question Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou's role and contribution, the former Eurodeputy said "this does not mean that party organs must be downgraded." According to an article in the 16 April Athens daily TA NEA, Vaso Papandreou's statements provoked the anger of PASOK central committee member Kostas Paipoutlidhis, who followed her on the podium. Paipoutlidhis attacked Vaso Papandreou and others like her who "monopolize publicity" by being mentioned daily in the news. He also accused her of being absent from the PASOK struggle in 1989, "ensconced as she was in the comfortable salons of Brussels." Paipoutlidhis's reaction was greeted by "pandemonium," the article reports, and split the congress between those who applauded him and a majority who criticized him.
