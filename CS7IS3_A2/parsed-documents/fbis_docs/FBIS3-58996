The prime minister added that the al-Asad-Clinton meeting gave rise to the hope that Syria genuinely desired peace, the same kind of peace sought by Israel. In an address before the Council of Europe, Mr. Rabin rejected the possibility of introducing any changes into the Madrid format. He stressed: We seek to achieve bilateral agreements in each of the negotiating tracks in a bid to attain comprehensive peace in the region. Mr. Rabin urged the Palestinians not to permit religious and political zealots to divert them from the path of peace, promising that Israel would continue striking out at terrorism. The prime minister reminded his audience that as the Six Day War chief of staff, he swore to be the last chief of staff forced to defend Israel from unreasonable lines of defense. Mr. Rabin added that Israel would not compromise on its security, although it is prepared to take calculated risks. Toward the end of his address, the prime minister said: We yearn for 1994 to be a year of peace, and not a year of fiascoes.
