Management at the Saigon Shoe Factory in Ho Chi Minh City complained that workers had not given any notice of the 24-hour strike that began Saturday, the Nguoi Lao Dong newspaper reported. Workers said the demands made by their "tense" work were too great and their payments too low, common complaints at factories here under contract to foreign clients, particularly South Koreans. But after talks with the Ho Chi Minh City Federation of Labour, the workers returned to the factory, which has seen two earlier strikes in the past two-months. The labour ministry said last month that workers would be allowed to strike as a last resort but should give two-weeks notice of any industrial action. Reports of strikes, particularly in the south of the country, are becoming more common, with three large shutdowns just before the Lunar New Year holiday last month.
