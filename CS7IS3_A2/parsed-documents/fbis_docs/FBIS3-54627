Replying a point of order regarding a statement of the Egyptian diplomat about the presence of some of the Egyptian nationals in Pakistan in the National Assembly Sunday evening, Interior Minister Nasirullah Babar said, "the government has taken a final decision that all such people whether they belong to Egypt, Algeria or any other country would be extradited." He told the House that Pakistan would not allow anybody to use its soil for terrorist activities. The minister said that they (Arab nationals) can go anywhere they want after being expelled from Pakistan. "We will not allow Pakistan to be used as a stick. We will certainly not allow Egypt to let their nationals stay here and then label us as terrorists. We will not allow this." The attention of the govt was drawn by PKMAP's [Pukhtun Khwa Milli Awami Party] Mahmood Khan Achakzai who while speaking on a point of order, referred to an interview given by Mustafa Hanafi, Ambassador of Egypt. Achkzai informed the House that the Ambassador had disclosed that twenty Egyptians including ten murderers were residing in Pakistan. One of these, he said was, living inside Islamabad. Interior Minister added that the government was in touch with the Embassy of Egypt in this regard. He said the Egyptian diplomats were apprehensive about their (Arab Nationals) return as they would be a nuisance to the Egyptian govt. "But we have told them clearly that they had to leave Pakistan by January 31 along with all other Arabs would be allowed to go back to Afghanistan if they so desired. Maulana Faziur Rehman pleaded with the government that they should, instead, give assurances to the countries of these Arabs and NGOs [nongovernmental organizations] that Pakistan would control these people. He pleaded that they should not be returned to their respective countries for possible execution there. He added that these Arabs who were now being labelled as murderers were those that had come to Pakistan for the Afghan Jihad. In the past, this very issue had been raised by the media at the Foreign Office. They were told that there had been no such complaints from the Egyptian Embassy here. However, the caretaker government had also taken up the issue and put restrictions on all Arab Non Governmental Organisations housed in Peshawar. The caretaker government had also ordered them to leave the country. Meanwhile, as thousands of Afghans gathered at the Torkham border to enter Pakistan, the interior minister reiterated Pakistan's position on the issue. He said Pakistan would keep its border with Afghanistan closed as there were several peaceful areas inside Afghanistan where the people of Kabul could take refuge. He once again reminded the House that the jihad was over. Turning to the continued news bulletins from the BBC which spoke about the plight of the refugees, the minister replied, "Jalalabad airport is open. Flights can operate to take these refugees to the United Kingdom if they so desire."
