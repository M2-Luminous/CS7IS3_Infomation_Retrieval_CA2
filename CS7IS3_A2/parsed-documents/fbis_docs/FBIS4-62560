Border trade accounted for almost half of the total amount. Heilongjiang Province is Russia's major Chinese trading partner. It is no accident that Heilongjiang ranks top in Sino-Russian trade because, of all China's northeast provinces, Heilongjiang shares the longest common border of over 3,000 km with Russia. Some 20 trading points along the border serve passenger and commodity transport. In addition to road and rail transport, there are direct shipping and air services between Russia and Heilongjiang. One characteristic marks Heilongjiang's trade with Russia, that is, Heilongjiang, taking advantage of its geographical position, serves as a trade intermediary between Russia and more developed provinces in east and southeast China. Therefore, the structure and nature of Heilongjiang's external trade reflect an overview of Russian-Chinese trade. Barter trade remains the main form of trade between Russia and Heilongjiang. Although both sides strive to diversify trade operations and to improve account settlement systems, barter trade still accounts for nearly two-thirds of the total trade volume. Both the export trade structure of Russia and China have undergone great changes. Russia has reduced the amount of raw material sold to China and increased industrial equipment, automobiles, and aviation technology exports. At present, machinery equipment exports account for 80 percent of Russian exports to China. China has also reduced exports of shoes and garments to Russia, and increased foodstuff supply. In recent years, border trade has shown an upward movement in terms of both quantity and quality. However, this year's prospects do not look good. Border trade was down by nearly half in the first quarter of this year from the same period last year. Was it just temporary or will the trend become a pattern? Heilongjiang's Vice Governor Wang Zongzhan analyzed the situation when interviewed by station reporter Mazhinkov. [Beging Wang Zongzhan recording] We attach great importance to developing Sino-Russian border trade. Trade relationships between China and Russia have developed rapidly in recent years. The trade figures between Heilongjiang and Russia in the last three years were as follows: The trade amount in 1991 was one billion Swiss francs; in 1992, two billion Swiss francs; and 1993, nearly 3 billion Swiss francs. Trade volume dropped sharply in the first quarter. The main reason was Russia's implementation of a visa system [words indistinct]. Complex procedures and lots of requirements to get a visa as well as low efficiency in visa issuance have dampened the enthusiasm of Chinese businessmen doing business in Russia [words indistinct]. We call on the Russian Government to adopt a policy of encouragement so as to facilitate [words indistinct] because the development of [word indistinct] is in accord with the interests of the two countries, and the two peoples. The development of Sino-Russian border trade in recent years has greatly contributed to the harmony, stability, and to the growth of the two countries' economies. Both sides need to work out preferential policies to solve such problems as the method of account settlement, prices, and tariffs. [end recording]
