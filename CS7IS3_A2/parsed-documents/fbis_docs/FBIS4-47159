Although his resignation may not be accepted, these events indicate a change in his status. Landyk was in charge of the oil and gas complex, external economic relations, investments, allocation of financial resources, and coordination of privatization. All of these ventures were far from successful, but true to Ukrainian political traditions he was not held accountable and his resignation--if accepted--is entirely voluntary. Landyk's views were well known. His monetary policy was that "in transition to a market economy prices will increase several fold!" As head of a committee responsible for managing hard currency Landyk was better informed than most about our disastrous situation: Ukraine can afford to import only 30 percent of essential goods that she needs. In foreign trade he remained true to licenses, quotas, and strict control over exports, particularly the concentration of export trade in a hands of a few chosen exporters. He also favored moderate privatization. Perhaps Landyk was best characterized at a press conference by his colleague Vasyl Yevtukhov: "When I became head of the USPP [Ukrainian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs] I attempted to reconcile differences between entrepreneurs and industrialists, i.e., to integrate them. But I soon realized that they were one and the same; there was no need for an integration!" In Yukhym Zvyahilskyy's government Landyk was the prototype amphibian, both a government official and an owner of a `small candle-making concern' [in Russian] at the same time. After graduation from the Kramatorsk Industrial Institute he followed the usual career path: mechanical engineer, plant manager, secretary of the party committee, and director. As a director he was in time for the golden age of leasing and renting of state property. The Donetsk "Elektropobutmash" plant, for example, was initially leased and then transformed into the "Nord" stock company. Nord was founded in 1991 by the workers at the plant and the USSR Ministry of Defense with the latter getting "only 70 percent of the voting stock" and the workers 30 percent. Now we can understand why some people are so worried about "dissolution of economic ties with Russia" and favor "a single economic market." Such abuses in ownership of state property--which took place under the aegis of the parliamentary moratorium declared on November 11, 1990--were declared illegal by the Ukrainian parliament on February 14, 1992. As a Donetsk newspaper pointed out--Nord management ignored the legislation and at an international exhibit in Moscow this year did not even raise the Ukrainian flag as did our other enterprises. We can also understand much better the psychology of the owner of a small candle-making concern who feels that access to hard currency should be restricted to a selected few. But we have to give Landyk his due. He never pretended to be a reformer or a liberal and never used the rhetoric of the `Harvard boys', although tact and such rhetoric might have been useful in international relations in securing credits and investments. Take for example the discussion Landyk and Valeriy Shmarov had with Nichols Burns [sic], a senior directors of the American National Security Council [sic]. The deputy prime ministers made it clear that Ukraine will not undertake reforms `immediately' [in English], that there is a `Ukrainian road to capitalism', and so forth, but that the Western countries should provide money for this capitalism at once. Having spent a year as a curator of privatization and foreign economic relations, and appreciating the indefinite nature of his job, Landyk--like so many of his friends--decided to run for parliament. In the Lenin electoral district of Donetsk he defeated a communist, and the only ward he lost was one where he was portrayed as a rabid nationalist and savior of the Ukrainian state. And so, on May 20, the deputy prime minister declared his desire to be a deputy rather than a "whipping boy". But what is the real reason for this move? If Roman Shpek were to become the new prime minister there would be no reason for Landyk to leave the government. If, on the other hand, Zvyahilskyy were to remain in office then the relationship between them would be strained. The problem started with the stock holding company Ukrnaftohaz which was promoted by Landyk and opposed by Zvyahilskyy ("Over my dead body!", if rumors are to be believed). Nevertheless, the president signed the company into existence on May 14 and even though the Zvyahilskyy was seen alive thereafter, Landyk had overstepped his bounds and had to leave. Landyk may feel that he wasted eleven months of his life in the Cabinet of Ministers. But the fact remains that inflation has been controlled (never mind the means!), Ukraine's involvement with CIS has been limited to that of an associate, Ukrnaftohaz has been created, and Nord has escaped bankruptcy. Who will follow him? Most like another 'strong man" with a little candle-making business on the side. Deputy prime minister Shmarov has already started making his move, having made offers of jobs in the future cabinet to industrial directors.
