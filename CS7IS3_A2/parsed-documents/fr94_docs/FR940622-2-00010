The review periods are August 1, 1991 through July 31, 1992 and August 1, 1992 through July 31, 1993. These reviews involve Haifa Chemicals, Ltd., a manufacturer/exporter of this merchandise to the United States. We have now completed these reviews and determine the margin to be 6.82 percent ad valorem for Haifa Chemicals. EFFECTIVE DATE: June 22, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Gayle Longest or Kelly Parkhill, Office of Countervailing Compliance, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230; telephone: (202) 482&hyph;2786. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On March 8, 1994, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the Federal Register the preliminary results of its administrative reviews of the antidumping duty order on industrial phosphoric acid from Israel (59 FR 10787) covering the periods August 1, 1991 through July 31, 1992 and August 1, 1992 through July 31, 1993, the fifth and sixth review periods respectively. The review of Rotem Fertilizers (Rotem) was terminated in the preliminary results of these reviews (59 FR 10787) because Rotem was determined to be the successor to Negev Phosphates, Ltd. (Negev), a company that was revoked from the antidumping order in the final results of the changed circumstances review. The Department has now completed these administrative reviews in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act). Scope of the Review Imports covered by these reviews are shipments of industrial phosphoric acid (IPA). This product is classifiable under item number 2809.20.00 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS). The HTS item number is provided for convenience and customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive. The review periods are August 1, 1991 through July 31, 1992 and August 1, 1992 through July 31, 1993. These reviews involve Haifa Chemicals Ltd. (Haifa), an Israeli manufacturer/exporter to the United States of the subject merchandise. Haifa reported that it did not have any shipments of the subject merchandise to the United States during these review periods. We subsequently confirmed with the United States Customs Service that there were no entries of this merchandise to the United States by Haifa during these review periods. Therefore, we are using the rate found in the previous review for this company for cash deposit purposes. See Industrial Phosphoric Acid from Israel; Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review (57 FR 38471; August 25, 1992). Because Haifa did not respond to the Department's questionnaire in that review, it was assigned a rate of 6.82 percent, the highest margin assigned to any company in a previous review or in the investigation.
