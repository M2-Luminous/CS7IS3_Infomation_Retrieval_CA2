Our guest, Deputy Evans Beaubrun, himself an author of an amnesty bill that has been submitted to the lower chamber, will comment on and respond to the Senate initiative. Deputy Beaubrun, good morning! You are the author of an amnesty bill. How does your bill differ from the senators' bill; how does it resemble theirs? [Beaubrun] The two proposals differ on the point that the one from the senators is a special law, which in principle imposes certain norms on the law, as we perceive law; while mine is an amendment to the law already in effect, which provides for a solution. [Renois] Another question, Deputy Beaubrun, what are the chances the senators will accept this bill? What are the possibilities that the Chamber of Deputies will vote on it in the event the situation normalizes in the Senate? [Beaubrun] I must tell you, Clarence, that this bill is not from the Senate of the Republic. A group of deputies presented this bill, which was submitted to the Chamber of Deputies on 8 October 1993, two weeks after I submitted my first bill. I must tell you that that bill was signed by Pierre Simon Georges, Frantz Robert Monde, Walto Augustin, Beauge Yves Pericles, Joseph Benoit Laguerre, Olipcial Regis, Lonnes Joseph, Rita Frederic Moncoeur, and Lionel Bouzi. The senators simply modified the bill by withdrawing certain considerations and added two new considerations. Therefore, it is not a draft of law belonging to the Senate of the Republic. They are only exhuming a draft that was the subject of many discussions... [Renois] Do you mean that this draft, since it has already been prepared by the deputies, has a greater chance of passing because Frantz Robert Monde is the current president of the Chamber of Deputies? [Beaubrun] That is not what I mean. I mean this draft has some serious, very big problems. The law must be general, and this law concerns a group of citizens. It is far from being general. Furthermore, the law must look to the future. The law is for the future. This law does not look to the future at all. [Renois] Have you reproached the senators for not mentioning the financial aspects -- because you have asked for financial amnesty, I believe, in your draft? [Beaubrun] I am saying that this time, the senators have gone beyond the scope of this amnesty. That is one of the major problems with this draft. This draft, all things considered, presents some imbroglios. Although those senators say they are opposed to a large amnesty, those same senators say in Article 2: This amnesty extends to all offenses following the coup d'etat. When they say all offenses, stealing is also included in the offenses after the coup d'etat; the nonpayment of taxes could be considered an offense of the coup-d'etat, just to name two. It is a very extended text. Whatever offenses could be linked to the coup d'etat are covered by this amnesty. [Renois] ....are forgiven by this amnesty. Last question, Deputy Beaubrun. Regarding the steps taken by the Chamber of Deputies -- I am referring to the consultations begun with the military and other institutions, even the parliamentary plan voted by yourself, as well as the political demands that are being made today for the application of Article 149 -- is this draft still appropriate or even up to date? [Beaubrun] Personally, I still believe this draft is appropriate and up to date. The procedure, however, is faulty because the Senate has used it as a political weapon. I understand that the Senate is a political institution. The parliament has two institutions: the political institution, which is the Senate; and the working institution, which is the Chamber of Deputies. But I believe the Senate went a little too far. The Senate made it a completely political matter. Eleven senators were to vote and present this draft to the international community and to the press. Why did they not vote on this law? This procedure prevents us deputies from rationally, legally examining this text. Why did they not vote? Because this is a petition. We cannot receive a petition from the Senate. We can receive a petition from a citizen or from any segment of the city or the nation. But from the Senate, we can receive a resolution.... [Renois] What makes you say this initiative is a petition, not a resolution? [Beaubrun] It is a petition. A resolution is voted on article by article. A draft is voted on article by article. When it is a petition, it is presented with the signatures of so-and-so. For instance, I understand 11 senators signed this text, and that they are going to ask other senators to countersign. Then they will ask the deputies to sign this text. I am saying it is a political approach, not a parliamentary approach. [Renois] Deputy Beaubrun, thank you for answering our questions.
