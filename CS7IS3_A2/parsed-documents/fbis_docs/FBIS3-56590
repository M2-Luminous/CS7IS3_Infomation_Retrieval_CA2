Answering a previous request by the Latvian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to explain the Russian presidential press secretary's statement on this incident, Nesterushkin said that the statement's aim was to stress the danger of the situation. The sharp tone of the statement was related to the fact that all the circumstances of the matter and the stance of the official Latvian authorities on this issue were not yet known at the time it was made.
