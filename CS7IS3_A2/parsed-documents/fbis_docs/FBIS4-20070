Yesterday the first regional meeting of the farmers' association, the farmers' wives' association, young farmers' groups and the agricultural cooperation organization came to an end. In the course of a few weeks, the country's more prominent farmers' representatives will have met and put together their figures and arguments. The farmers' association is investing much in its support for and involvement in No to the EU, but it also wants to to be very visible locally. An additional -- and voluntary -- membership subscription of 400 kroner will go to support campaigning. The aim is that in the end it will be very few Norwegians who say "don't know" when asked what impact the EU will have on Norwegian agriculture. It is a very competent participant in the debate that is now giving the starting signal for the battle against the results the government achieved in the EU membership negotiations. With its own office in Brussels and staff who have been very close to the EU's and Norway's delegations: "We have never been more than two days behind the negotiations; sometimes, because of our large contact network, we were even ahead of the Norwegian negotiators when it came to knowledge of the EU's positions," said Leif Forsell, head of the farmers' association's economic policy section, when he yesterday briefed the "farming elite" from Ostfold, Akershus, Vestfold, and Buskerud. But he did not have much other good news from Brussels. In the conference hall of As Hotel he presented a series of calculations that pointed without exception to solid minus figures for Norwegian farmers in the EU, regardless of whether they concentrate on grain, hogs, or milk production. The important question of how many people will be covered by the concept of "northern agriculture" -- that is, areas where Norway will be able to maintain comprehensive support arrangements -- has still not been clarified. But this lack of clarity was of no use to yesterday's audience of around 30; with farms in eastern Norway they belong to the region that has the least prospect of being defined as northern. The frustration was palpable, because individual farmers think it bitterly ironic that those areas of Norway that are best suited to agriculture are also the areas that will be covered by the toughest conditions in the EU. The fact that Leif Forsell hinted that competitiveness would be less of a problem if farmers make the transition from grain/hogs/poultry/cheese/butter to cattle, for example, was cold comfort: Not even with cattle will profits be significant, and making a transition takes time. But Forsell's example calculations were crystal clear: Without any support a farm with around 100 acres of grain will lose all of its net income of 115,000 kroner -- it would actually move into minus figures. "And I am not painting an excessively black picture; these are the government's own figures," he pointed out.
