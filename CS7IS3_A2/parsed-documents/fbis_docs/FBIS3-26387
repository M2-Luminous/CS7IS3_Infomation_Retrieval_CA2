A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Wu Jianmin, made the remarks here today when asked to comment on the report that Li Denghui [Li Teng-hui] of Taiwan plans to spend "holidays" during the spring festival in Indonesia and Thailand. Under the disguise of "holidays" trips, the Taiwan authorities are trying to develop "substantive relations" with some countries, thus creating a situation of "two Chinas" in the world, Wu said. This is something the Chinese Government and people are strongly opposed to and can never accept. Should the governments of the countries having diplomatic relations with China endorse Li Denghui's trips, in whatever name and form, it will deeply hurt the feelings of the Chinese people and damage the friendly relations and cooperation between China the and countries concerned, he stressed. The spokesman noted that the Chinese Foreign Ministry has respectively expressed to the countries involved the serious concern of the Chinese Government. "It is our hope that the countries concerned will cherish the overall interest of their relations with China, and stand on guard against the political schemes of the Taiwan authorities, so as to protect the hard-won friendly relations and cooperation between them and China from any disruption and sabotage," the spokesman said.
