A smooth transition from the old tax system to the new system has been achieved during the past three months, according to Liu Zhongli Finance Minister and the Director of the State Taxation Bureau. Liu noted the massive tax reform has not triggered major price fluctuations as many people had worried. Moreover, it didn't have any unfavorable impact on the country's industrial production and market operations. During the first two months of the year, China's industrial production reported a 18.16 per cent growth compared with the same period last year. Total retail sales volume increased 23 per cent during the same period, he said. Moreover, by the end of February, the country's revenue -- excluding domestic and overseas loans -- registered a 32.1 per cent increase compared with the same period last year. Industrial and commercial tax revenue increased 32.2 per cent from the corresponding period in 1993, Liu said. In addition, he noted most enterprises reacted calmly to the changes on their tax burden under the new system. Foreign investors' worries about a heavier tax burden were also dispelled after they found their taxes didn't increase under the new tax system, Liu said. And no provinces or cities reported financial problems as a result of the new tax-sharing system which restructured tax revenues between the central and local governments. Liu said tax reform has reinforced the country's confidence. However, he also acknowledged some minor problems have cropped up in recent months. Some enterprises, especially grassroots units, remain ignorant about the functions of the new tax code. The minister attributed this to inadequate publicity and instruction about tax reforms. Also, a small number of enterprises have complained the new system adds to their tax burden. Actually, Liu said, only 25 percent of the country's enterprises have had to pay more taxes. Half of these enterprises have had just a four per cent rise in taxes. Liu said minor problems are inevitable during such a massive reform. He said the government expects to overcome these difficulties through progressive efforts. "We must persist in this reform which is of vital importance to the establishment of modern enterprise management mechanism and reforms in the financial, foreign exchange and investment systems," he pledged. Liu said this year's task is to set up the basic framework for a tax system which can suit the needs of the socialist market economy. To reach that goal, great efforts will be paid to ensure a successful issuance of this year's treasury bonds, he stressed. Meanwhile, the printing technique of value-added tax invoices will also be improved to prevent fake receipts, the minister added.
