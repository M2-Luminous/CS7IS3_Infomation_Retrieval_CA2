He was born in 1939 in a serviceman's family. He served in the Odessa and Transbaykal Military Districts and with the Southern Group of Forces. He took part in military operations in Afghanistan. He is a graduate of the General Staff Military Academy. He headed the USSR Ministry of Defense Information Directorate and the CIS Joint Armed Forces Information Service. At present he is deputy secretary of the Russian Federation Security Council. [Pelts] Valeriy Leonidovich, the Security Council's functions are so extensive that at times it is compared with the former [CPSU Central Committee] Politburo. How objective is this comparison? [Manilov] I have heard of such comparisons. But let me remind you of an old truism: All comparisons are unsatisfactory. The Security Council's powers and functions are indeed extensive, but it is fundamentally different from the aforementioned structure. It is a constitutional organ, formed and headed by the country's president. Furthermore, it does not exercise any executive-administrative functions. Its main task is to prepare presidential decisions in the sphere of ensuring security. It considers and resolves strategic problems associated with domestic, foreign, and military policy in this sphere, defines Russia's national interests and the basic guidelines for their protection, and performs a series of other tasks. [Pelts] Does the Security Council perform any coordinating and monitoring functions? [Manilov] Of course. The Security Council coordinates the activity of organs of state power in the process of implementing their own decisions and the edicts and directives of the Russian Federation president as regards ensuring security. I would like to emphasize that it coordinates in terms of objectives rather than of functions, in other words without interfering in the day-to-day activity of ministries and departments. As for monitoring, it extends to the implementation of Security Council decisions and of the president's edicts on security questions. The Security Council's secretary and apparatus have been given powers to organize inspections of the efficiency of the implementation of these decisions by ministries and departments. [Pelts] How, in your view, could one define the Security Council's position and role in our society? [Manilov] It is an organ ensuring the exercise of the Russian president's functions as regards running the state in the security sphere. Hence its position in the state hierarchy. The paramount task of the Security Council is to preserve Russia's state sovereignty, maintain sociopolitical stability in society, and defend citizens' rights and freedoms. This is in line with the vital interests of all Russians, regardless of their social status and party-political orientation. Hence the Security Council's essentially consolidating role in our society. [Pelts] Is this role manifest in some specific way in the work of the Security Council itself and of its apparatus? [Manilov] Of course, and quite graphically at that. The Security Council synthesizes the intellect, will, and experience of people, each one of whom plays a key role in his own field as regards the implementation and protection of Russia's national-state interests. Look no further than the Security Council's composition. This synthesis actually produces a statewide policy. Since Russia's interests and its well-being are the supreme criterion of the Security Council's work, there is no room for any departmental or group interests in the practical activity of its apparatus. This is our creed. Let me note with gratification that this creed is essentially shared by all with whom we work in the closest possible business contacts. [Pelts] And who are they, if it is no secret? [Manilov] They make up a very broad circle. The service of aides, the main structures of the president's staff, the committees and commissions of the Federal Assembly chambers, the government apparatus, representatives of ministries and departments and primarily of those headed by Security Council members, scientific research organizations, and public associations. [Pelts] How do you ensure the objectivity of information supplied to the president and other Council members? [Manilov] This is indeed a very important aspect. The sole correct decision can be adopted only on the basis of comprehensive analysis of the fullest and best possible information. The mechanism used here is simultaneously simple and complex. Under the law we have the right to co-opt any state structure capable of acquiring. accumulating, and analyzing information, as well as the information and analysis organs of all "power" departments, state and scientific centers, and nongovernmental organizations. Briefly, whenever necessary we can call on the entire information and analysis potential available in the country in the process of preparing proposals, recommendations, and decisions on security questions. [Pelts] Who determines the questions to be discussed at Security Council sittings? [Manilov] We use the following method. The Security Council secretary submits proposals, taking into account the opinions of Security Council members. They are considered and approved by the president. [Pelts] There is obviously a plan for the Security Council's work. [Manilov] Yes. Naturally. But life frequently introduces its own amendments. There are occasions when an apparently routine question turns into a most acute problem demanding solution at the highest level. At other times, when a scheduled question is being discussed at a Security Council sitting, it emerges that other equally important questions arise from it.... [Pelts] And how do you manage to keep this mass of problems under control? [Manilov] Primarily by setting priorities. You cannot embrace the boundless, as Kozma Prutkov said. And he was right. The important point is to single out the main ones from among the broadest spectrum of problems and concentrate efforts on their solution. A major role in this selection process is played by the system of interdepartmental commissions which are the Security Council's basic working organs. This system also includes the Scientific Council recently set up under the Security Council, which provides scientific backup for the decisions, recommendations, and forecasts being prepared. This system makes it possible to "stick to" the general avenues of ensuring security while retaining room for maneuver. The commissions are headed by senior officials appointed by the Russian Federation president. They are, as a rule, ministers or first deputy ministers. The commissions coordinate horizontally, as it were, the interests and positions of ministries and departments. [Pelts] Judging by the scale of the tasks being solved, the Security Council apparatus must be quite sizeable? [Manilov] The apparatus employs, in addition to technical personnel, just over 100 people. They are mainly highly skilled professionals capable of effectively performing tasks in the interests of ensuring Russia's security at all levels. [Pelts] Security at all levels.... How many such levels are there? [Manilov] Three in principle: the security of individuals, the security of society, and the security of the state. They are, of course, inseparable, interlinked, and interconnected. And they are all matters of priority. Nonetheless, the security of the individual is the starting point. Unfortunately, uncertainty is a typical feature of our life today. Many people are losing sight of their reference points. This is frightening. It is, therefore, vitally important to ensure that everyone knows and actually senses that society and the state are concerned about his interests and security. [Pelts] But in order to achieve this, it is probably necessary to resolve certain specific questions? [Manilov] You are right. Lev Tolstoy remarked that it is easy to love the whole world, but just try and love some specific person.... There is a multitude of specific questions, including some which, at first glance, do not appear to concern statewide interests but are tackled by the Security Council apparatus as part of its work. From this viewpoint, the questions raised at Security Council sittings are just the visible tip of the iceberg. [Pelts] The Security Council's composition has been changed on several occasions in the recent past. What is this -- a sign of a quest for a "better team?" [Manilov] I think that this formulation of the question is incorrect. Presidential edicts have effected certain changes in the Security Council's composition -- this is correct. They have been prompted by life. Gaydar, Fedorov, and Golushko have departed. Stepashin, Shoygu, and Nikolayev have joined the Security Council. In my view, the president's decisions on their appointments need no comment. These people represent the most important avenues for ensuring Russia's national security. Federal Assembly chamber leaders Shumeyko and Rybkin recently became members of the Security Council. This is in line with the letter and spirit of the Treaty on Social Accord, with the nationwide and statewide nature and scale of responsibility for the fatherland's security. [Pelts] Valeriy Leonidovich, the question "On the Concept of Russia's National Security" ranks last in the Security Council's work plan. Why is this? Is it possible to speak of ensuring security if there is no concept of it? [Manilov] The important point is to ensure rather than to talk about ensuring. And this should be done now, today, not tomorrow or the day after. Therefore, the elaboration of the concept is progressing in parallel with the creation of a security system and the mechanisms ensuring its effective operation. Certain fragments of the general concept have already been elaborated and adopted by the Security Council -- those concerning the foreign policy and defense spheres. Others are being elaborated simultaneously with the general concept. Bearing this in mind, it has been planned to consider it at a Security Council sitting toward year's end. The main point is that this work is being done within the framework of a unified scheme whose core is to guarantee the ensuring of the protection of Russia's national-state interests.
