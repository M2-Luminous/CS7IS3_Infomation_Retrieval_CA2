Yi conveyed the message while speaking at the commencement ceremony for the reserve officers' training corps held at the students' Central Military School in Seongnam, a satellite city on the outskirts of Seoul. He said, "North Korea should solve the common problems of South and North Korea by showing a more sincere attitude." The North is delaying progress in inter-Korean talks intentionally, asking for things having nothing to do with the heart of the talks at a recent working-level contact on exchanging special envoys, Yi said. "In order to win the unlimited competition in the world, all Koreans should concentrate on strengthening the nation's international competitiveness. For this, it is most important for the military to keep a water-tight national security posture."
