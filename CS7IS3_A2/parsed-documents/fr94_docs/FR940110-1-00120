FR940110-1-00120 FR940110-1-00013 The FHWA is proposing to remove these sections because they are duplicated by State laws and can only be enforced by State or local agencies. In addition, the requirements for lighting devices are addressed in part 393 of the FMCSRs. Section 392.40 All accidents. Section 392.41 Striking unattended vehicle. The FHWA is proposing to remove these two sections because they duplicate State ordinances. Section 392.61 Driving by unauthorized person. Section 392.62 Bus driver; distraction. Section 392.65 Sleeper berth; transfer to or from. Section 392.69 Sleeper berth, occupation. The FHWA is proposing to remove §§392.61 and 392.69 because the FHWA believes that these situations should be governed by company policy or a labor management agreement. Section 392.62 duplicates State and local regulations and should be removed. Section 392.65 is proposed to be removed because it is obsolete. There are very few truck tractors still in use that require entry into the sleeper berth from outside the vehicle. Part 396_Inspection, Repair, and Maintenance Part 396 places the responsibility upon the motor carrier to insure that its vehicles are properly maintained. The FHWA is proposing to remove §396.3(b)(4) because it is redundant. Section 396.3(b)(3) already requires motor carriers to maintain for vehicles controlled for 30 consecutive days or more a record of inspection, repairs and maintenance indicating their date and nature. Since the lubrication record required by §396.3(b)(4) is a maintenance record, the requirement is duplicative and should be removed. Appendix A to Subchapter B Appendix A to subchapter B includes all interpretations that were issued by the FHWA up to the publication of a collection of interpretations on November 23, 1977 (42 FR 60078). A new compilation of interpretations was recently published in the Federal Register on November 17, 1993 (58 FR 60734). Therefore, appendix A is redundant and obsolete, and the FHWA is proposing it be removed. Rulemaking Analyses and Notices All comments received before the close of business on the comment closing date indicated above will be considered and will be available for examination in the docket at the above address. Comments received after the comment closing date will be filed in the docket and will be considered to the extent practicable, but the FHWA may issue a final rule at any time after the close of the comment period. In addition to late comments, the FHWA will also continue to file relevant information in the docket as it becomes available after the comment closing date, and interested persons should continue to examine the docket for new material. Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review) and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures This proposed rule would remove obsolete and redundant regulations from the FMCSRs. The FHWA has determined that this document is not a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 or a significant regulation under the regulatory policies and procedures of the DOT. It is anticipated that the economic impact of this rulemaking will be minimal. Therefore, a full regulatory evaluation is not required. Regulatory Flexibility Act In compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612), the FHWA has evaluated the effects of this proposal on small entities. This action would lessen the regulatory burden on small and large entities subject to the FMCSRs by removing recordkeeping requirements associated with the written examination and record of violations. Based on the evaluation of this proposal, the FHWA certifies that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Executive Order 12612 (Federalism Assessment) This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that this proposed rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a full Federalism Assessment. Executive Order 12372 (Intergovernmental Review) Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program Number 20.217, Motor Carrier Safety. The regulations implementing Executive Order 12372 regarding intergovernmental consultation on Federal programs and activities apply to this program. Paperwork Reduction Act This rulemaking action does not contain a collection of information requirement for purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. National Environmental Policy Act The agency has analyzed this action for the purpose of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and has determined that this action would not have any effect on the quality of the environment. Regulation Identification Number A regulation identification number (RIN) is assigned to each regulatory action listed in the Unified Agenda of Federal Regulations. The Regulatory Information Service Center publishes the Unified Agenda in April and October of each year. The RIN contained in the heading of this document can be used to cross reference this action with the Unified Agenda.
