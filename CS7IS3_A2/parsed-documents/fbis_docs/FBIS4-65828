Both sides discussed a number of regional and international questions of common interest in an open and constructive way, with a view to fostering cooperation between their two regions. The Joint Council reviewed developments in commercial and economic cooperation between the two sides. Ministers noted the continuing importance of bilateral trade relations. They welcomed the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round and the signature of the final act in Marrakesh on 12-15 April 1994 which would provide a major boost to the improving prospects for the world economy. GCC ministers informed EU ministers of the recent actions of GCC countries to become full members of the GATT or to make applications for membership. EU ministers welcomed these developments as positive steps which would contribute to the strengthening of the international trading system. Ministers welcomed prospects of EU and GCC countries being members of the new world trade organization. The Joint Council received a report from the Joint Cooperation Committee on implementation of the cooperation agreement. The Joint Council took note of the report of the ad hoc group on the interrelated issues of energy and environment which had been set up in accordance with the Joint Council's decision to continue the EU-GCC dialogue on these issues. Ministers agreed that the report was an excellent, comprehensive study which constituted a useful basis for clarifying the relevant issues and providing guidance for future cooperation between the two parties. The Joint Council agreed that cooperation in the field of energy and the environment should be based on the principles and objectives of the EU-GCC cooperation agreement and should also be guided by the principles of GATT and moves towards a more balanced world economy and more liberalised world trade regime. Ministers recognised the interrelationships between energy and economic growth policies on the one hand, and environment policies on the other hand. They took note of forecasts in the report of continuing world economic growth and growth in world demand for energy as well as prospects for increasing EU-GCC energy interdependence. They noted the complementary aspects of the environment/energy/economic growth relationship and the need for appropriate policies to deal with these issues without arresting economic growth or harming the international flow of trade. Ministers noted the importance of stability and transparency in world energy markets and that balanced supply and demand would be in the best interests of both suppliers and consumers of energy and would also facilitate energy investment. Regarding global environment concerns, ministers recognised that the Framework Convention on Climate Change seeks to find reasonable, balanced and comprehensive approaches to the issue of climate change consistent with sustainable development. Ministers agreed to continue the dialogue on the important energy/environment interrelationship and reaffirmed their commitment to strengthen economic and trade relations in accordance with the principles and objectives of the cooperation agreement. The Joint Council approved the recommendations and proposals for cooperation on other subjects contained in the report of the Joint Cooperation Committee. Ministers welcomed the proposals for a three-year programme of cooperation agreed between the standardisation and metrology organization of the GCC countries and the European Commission and European standards organizations. They supported the proposal of the Joint Cooperation Committee to examine the possibility of increasing EU investment and joint venture creation in the GCC region and in this connection drew attention to the important contribution which would be made by the third EU-GCC industrial conference to be held in Muscat in 1995. The Joint Council expressed satisfaction with the extensive two-year programme of training GCC customs officials prepared by the official consortium of EU customs services and urged the joint cooperation committee to intensify human resources development cooperation. The Joint Council approved the decisions of the Joint Cooperation Committee to convene meetings of the Industrial Cooperation Working Group, the Energy Group and the Environment Group to draw up new proposals for cooperation in the respective sectors. Both sides reiterated their determination to speedily conclude the ongoing free trade negotiations. The ministers of the EU and the GCC countries had a full exchange of views on developments in their two regions. The ministers reviewed a series of international and regional political issues of mutual interest in an open and cordial manner. In this respect, they were guided by their continued commitment to the principles enshrined in the UN charter and the principles of international law applicable to the development of cordial relations among nations. The GCC ministers, while noting the diversity of systems of values, which should be taken fully into consideration, joined the EU ministers in reiterating their continuing commitment to the promotion of human rights. They reaffirmed their commitment to respect for the sovereignty, unity, independence and territorial integrity of all states and held these principles to be universal in character and therefore applicable equally. The ministers noted with the utmost concern the continued Iraqi defiance of UN Security Council resolutions. They reiterated their view that prompt and full Iraqi implementation of all relevant Security Council resolutions remained a prerequisite for the establishment of peace and stability in the Gulf region. In this context, the ministers condemned the Iraqi regime for its failure to implement Security Council resolutions in full and its policy of selectivity in implementing such resolutions. In particular, the ministers underlined the importance they attached to Iraq's full and unconditional compliance with Resolution 687 concerning the immediate release of all Kuwaiti and other POWs and detainees held by Iraq, Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, and Iraq's payment of full compensation for the losses and damages caused by her aggression against the State of Kuwait. The ministers reiterated their support for Security Council Resolution 833 which reaffirms the inviolability of the international borders of the State of Kuwait and endorses the final report of the special UN committee entrusted with the demarcation of the Iraqi/Kuwaiti international borders. Reaffirming their governments' continued commitment to the unity, territorial integrity and sovereignty of Iraq, the ministers expressed alarm and dismay at the continued repression and sufferings of the entire Iraqi population, for which the Iraqi regime bears sole responsibility. The ministers stressed the need for Iraq's unconditional compliance with and effective implementation of Security Council Resolutions 688, 706 and 712. The ministers emphasised the need for cooperation and peaceful coexistence among all states in the Gulf region based on respect for recognized norms and principles of international law. They acknowledged the right of countries to acquire the means to defend themselves, but expressed concern over arms acquisition policies which were not justified by the requirements of legitimate defence. They expressed their strong belief that individual countries' arms procurement should not pose a threat to regional stability. The ministers reaffirmed their strong opposition to all forms of terrorism, whatever their origin, cause and motive, as well as subversive activities in other countries. Basing themselves on the principles of non-interference in the internal affairs of other states and respect for national laws, the ministers expressed their strong belief that no state was entitled to apply its laws outside its boundaries or to assume the jurisdiction of another sovereign state. In this respect the ministers noted with concern the lack of progress in the dialogue between the United Arab Emirates and the Islamic Republic of Iran over the question of the three islands. In this context, the foreign minister of the United Arab Emirates briefed the ministers on the initiative of His Highness Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan, president of the United Arab Emirates, calling for a resolution to the question through negotiations in accordance with international law and peaceful co-existence among states. The ministers called on the Islamic Republic of Iran to respond positively to this initiative. The ministers reaffirmed their commitment to the non- proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. They reiterated their commitment to promoting the establishment of a zone free from all weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East and called upon all countries not yet parties to non proliferation treaties [NPT] to become signatories to them as soon as possible. They noted with satisfaction that the Convention on Non-Proliferation of Chemical Weapons which constitutes an essential contribution to the establishment of zones free from all weapons of mass destruction has been signed by a large number of countries both in Europe and in the Middle East and urged all countries in both regions to do so. In this context the ministers expressed their hope for a successful conclusion of the NPT at the 1995 conference. The ministers reviewed developments in the Middle East peace process. They paid tribute to the vision and courage of the Palestinian and Israeli leaders who signed the historic Declaration of Principles in Washington on 13 September 1993, which represented a breakthrough in the peace process. The ministers reiterated their governments' support for UN Security Council Resolution 904/94, which called for the establishment of a temporary international presence in the occupied territories and was adopted following the massacre at Hebron. The ministers expressed their abhorrence for and condemnation of all acts of violence against innocent civilians and their sorrow at the resulting loss of life. The ministers agreed that such tragic events highlighted the importance of the peace process under way, which should not be interrupted. The ministers appealed for the question of the safety of Palestinians to be addressed urgently in accordance with the Fourth Geneva Convention. They reiterated their view that the Israeli settlements in the occupied territories, including east Jerusalem, are illegal under international law and constitute an obstacle to peace. In the EU's view, the lifting of the Arab boycott would also contribute to furthering the cause of the peace process. The ministers welcomed the agreement on Gaza/Jericho signed in Cairo on 4 may and expressed their complete support for its full and early implementation. They urged all sides to cooperate in ensuring the successful implementation of the agreement. They highlighted the importance they attach to the achievement of early and substantial progress in the other bilateral negotiations, particularly the Syrian track, with a view to ensuring a just, comprehensive and durable peace in the Middle East. The ministers expressed the determination of the EU and the GCC to continue to play an active and constructive role in the multilateral negotiations, which complement but are not a substitute for the bilateral tracks. The ministers reiterated their view that substantial progress in the bilaterals would greatly contribute to the success of the multilaterals. Both sides reiterated the importance of all forms of assistance, including economic assistance, to the occupied territories. Both sides reaffirmed their support for the Ta'if Accord as the best basis for enabling the state of Lebanon to extend its authority over the totality of the Lebanese territories and for preserving Lebanon's independence, sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity. The ministers expressed their satisfaction with the progress achieved in the context of this accord. They remain committed to participation in Lebanon's reconstruction. EU ministers briefed GCC ministers on progress made in the development of its relations with the Maghreb; and on their efforts to secure the implementation by Libya and others of Security Council Resolutions 731, 748 and 883. The ministers were deeply concerned by the eruption of the hostilities in Yemen. They called on all the parties concerned to exercise self-restraint, cease hostilities, listen to the dictates of reason and dialogue and place the interests of the people of Yemen above all other considerations. The ministers welcomed the agreement on a constitution for a Muslim-Croat Federation and the cease fire in central Bosnia. They condemned the attack against Gorazde. They called for full respect for all safe areas and for the strengthening of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces in Yugoslavia] with a view to ensuring that the ceasefire is maintained, the safety of these areas is ensured and normal life can be restored. The ministers expressed full support for the efforts of the international community to reach an early negotiated settlement of the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina acceptable to all parties. In this context they underscored that the parameters of the EU action plan, which have been approved by all the parties in Geneva, remain a solid basis for reaching a comprehensive agreement, not only for Bosnia-Herzegovina, but in the former Yugoslavia as a whole. The GCC ministers expressed the view that the arms embargo be lifted so as to allow Bosnia-Herzegovina the right of self-defence in accordance with article 51 of the UN charter. The ministers reiterated that those responsible for brutal violations of human rights in the former Yugoslavia must be held personally accountable and urged all countries to actively cooperate with the international war crimes tribunal. The ministers underlined that their countries must stand prepared to contribute to the future process of implementing a peace settlement as well as political and economic reconstruction in the former Yugoslavia. Both sides agreed that the sixth meeting of the Joint Council will be held in the European Union in the first half of 1995.
