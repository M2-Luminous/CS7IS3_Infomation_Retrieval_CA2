We must not forget that Croatia offered its hospitality to the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] command. For us it is important to meet with your leaders, to have their understanding and their support and to make sure that we share common aims and objectives." [Correspondent] Yasuhi Akashi's statement at the end of the third working day in his capacity as new UNPROFOR envoy was assessed positively. The last meeting Akashi had today -- with Hrvoje Sarinic -- opened up new prospects for cooperation between Croatia and UNPROFOR. [Sarinic] "Mr. Akashi is a very experienced politician and UN official. He knows what he is doing and saying and he knows what he wants. He had a great deal of success in his previous assignments, especially the last one in Cambodia, which was a complete success. Apart from that, there were poor communications with the United Nations and I think that the UNPROFOR and its command were very dissatisfied with coordination so far. Mr. Akashi, who is starting his job now, will devote all his time at work and energy to this problem. I also think, as far as this is concerned, that this is a definite improvement on the existing situation." [Correspondent] The activity of UNPROFOR, i.e. of Yasuhi Akashi and also of the Croatian side, will advance a little at a time, but what comes next, i.e. what is expected, is UNPROFOR's help in reaching an agreement on the end of hostilities here. [Akashi] "We specifically discussed the problem of the UN protected areas in the southern part of this country, the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the humanitarian [word indistinct] and refugees. I am pleased to hear that our stands on all these problems do not differ from Croatia's. To all this let us add a new approach to cooperation between Croatia and the UNPROFOR. All disagreements and complaints will from now on be individually examined to avoid generalization concerning the inefficiency of the UNPROFOR in Croatia."
