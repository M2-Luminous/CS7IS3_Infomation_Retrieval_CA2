A qualified Executive Branch source told BUSQUEDA: "It is remarkable that they should speak of unemployment when the unemployment rate is historically at its lowest (...), that they should speak of a lack of investment when for the past two years the investment levels have been at their highest for the past two decades (...), that businessmen and union leaders should sign a joint declaration that contains many demands which contradict their own interests." The CIU and PIT-CNT declaration states: "The industrial sector in Uruguay is being considerably dismantled," with the resultant "loss of dozens of jobs in the past few years," to the point where "industrial participation in national production has reached the levels of the 1940's." Businessmen and union leaders questioned the government trade policy which seeks "a unilateral opening when protectionism and incentives for internal production are increasing in the rest of the world." The government spokesmen stated: "The average unemployment rate in Uruguay during 1993 is 8.4 percent, the lowest since 1981," adding: "The jobs lost in some sectors were replaced in others." As for the "lack of investment" mentioned in the declaration, the government says: "It is remarkable that the PIT-CNT -- which is associated with the CIU -- should speak of a lack of investment when on 13 December 1992 it contributed to frustrate one of the largest investments that could have been made in Uruguay." The government considers the attitude of these two organizations to be contradictory because "they speak of improving the competitiveness, while some of the solutions they propose will really reduce the purchasing power of the workers." The Executive Branch spokesmen said: "It is also remarkable that, just like on 13 December 1992, the workers oppose transformations that would help to improve the efficiency of public services, which could help to improve the competitiveness of the productive sectors."
