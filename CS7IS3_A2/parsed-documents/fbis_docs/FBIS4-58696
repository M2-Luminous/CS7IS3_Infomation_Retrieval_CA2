Various daily activities as well as commercial and production activities are taking place normally. The source said a state of emergency was declared in the country in view of the need to entrench security and stability and to safeguard citizens' security and safety in this crucial phase the country is passing through. Thus, the Ministry of Interior appeals to the brother citizens to observe the following: 1. Not to carry weapons throughout the Republic's governorates, even if their carriage is licensed, and also not to open fire regardless of justification. 2. Not to hold any meetings, gatherings, crowds, demonstrations, or similar things. 3. Not to carry out any acts aimed at looting or encroaching on public and private properties. 4. To refrain from moving inside the capitals of the governorates from 2100 to 0500. The ministry hopes all brother citizens will abide by what is mentioned above and cooperate with the security organizations to achieve the public interest and entrench the homeland's security and stability in general.
