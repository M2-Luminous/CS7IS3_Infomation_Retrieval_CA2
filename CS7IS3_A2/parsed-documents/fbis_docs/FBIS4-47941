On Wednesday Mr Konigkramer, Inkatha campaign manager, accused the IEC of colluding with the African National Congress in alleging massive voting irregularities. "It (is) typical of IEC bungling which has severely compromised the position of voters supporting the IFP," he said in a statment. But on thursday night the IEC said: "The attention of the commission has been drawn to the statement issued in Durban by Mr Arthur Konigkramer of the IFP... "Mr Konigkramer's central allegation is both false and defamatory, not only of the commissioners and staff of the IEC but also of the accountants drawn from leading firms of auditors who have assisted the IEC in the completion of the counting of the results. "In this regard, the commission reserves its position. Doubtless others who feel themselves to have been similarly impugned, will do the same. "In the interim, Mr Konigkramer is invited to submit any evidence he may have relating to his various allegations both to the commission and to the South African Police as a matter of urgency."
