Of course, reform of the individual man is the reform of society but these things go in steps. Usually not all members of a society are mature and pious. That would be an ideal society. But maybe it is not our destiny to have such a society. Even according to our religious documents there will be wicked elements during the rule of the imam of time. Even in a revolutionary society, even in a pious society, even in a society where the majority of people are pious, jihad and the propagation of virtue and prohibition of vice must continue to exist. Domestically, public supervision which is the propagation of virtue and prohibition of vice is constructive, while jihad has greater meaning in facing foreign wickedness. Every society faces threats domestically and from outside. Today has been named the day of prayer after the factors that will guard the revolution. They will strengthen the very factors that brought about the revolution. Prayers are a necessity for humans; without praying, remembering God, and paying attention to spirituality, and without analyzing one's own actions, there will be no development of human character. Brothers and sisters, pay attention to your prayers. [passage omitted] The Koran has always emphasized that we must look at both sides: the material and the spiritual. Our imams have said that those who forget either the material or the spiritual are not one of us. Extremism is condemned whichever way it may go. If we do not pray, fast, read the Koran, visit the shrines, or go on the hajj, and if we think that worshipping of the divine is limited to serving the people -- even if we spend all our life serving the people -- but fail to pay attention to spiritual matters, we will move toward destruction. But also if we think to the contrary and believe that the material life should be abandoned, then our society will be poor, we will be poor, the enemy will overcome us, we shall fall from honor, we will fall prey to the enemy, and we will be in chains. It is necessary to maintain interest in both. The jihad for the propagation of virtue and prohibition of vice is an issue of public supervision. We should be like mirrors to each other, reminding others -- according to religious laws -- of their weaknesses, and in order to show the wrong and the right path. We should look after each other. This is the essence of piety. These are the manifestations of a pious society. Those who think that it is possible to have a prosperous society without these spiritual elements are wrong. What better evidence than the situation in the advanced western countries? The condition that they face, their spirit of aggression, their selfishness, and the great and dangerous injustice that prevails in the world, are all due to the fact that spiritual matters are not taken into account. Things that you now see in Bosnia and things that are happening in the Balkans are the best evidence for the brutality of arrogant powers. Over there there is great injustice and great treachery. The latest unfortunate event is that the Croatian Government's military force which was earlier the target of aggression and had thousands of men killed fighting against the Serbs, has now crossed the borders and is attacking the innocent Bosnian Muslim people, who are being attacked by the Serbs at the same time. The world has yet not taken a correct step in this case, although the Security Council has issued a warning and given a two-week deadline for sanctions. We expected the Security Council to take a serious view of this. It would be a terrible precedent for a neighboring country officially and militarily to er another country which is facing a so-called civil war, and in order to support a group of people who are of the same race -- and to massacre an innocent people in such way. God willing, at least the neighboring countries and the effective powers of the Security Council will remain vigilant and will not tolerate this disgusting new suppression. In today's Friday prayers we have some dear Muslim guests from the friendly Muslim country of Brunei. The sultan and his entourage are participating in our prayer ceremony. The fact that a national leader, despite his usual program when visiting another country, should remember the Friday prayers is a source of great satisfaction. They have come to the prayers and we welcome them and thank them. [passage omitted]
