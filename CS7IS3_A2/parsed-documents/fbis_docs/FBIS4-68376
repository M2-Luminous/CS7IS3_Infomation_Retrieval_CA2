FBIS4-68376 "jpusr047___94038" FBIS-USR-94-047 JPRS FBIS Report: Central Eurasia 15 April 1994 RUSSIA REGIONAL AFFAIRS News From St Petersburg News From St Petersburg City Budget Viewed 944F0582A St. Petersburg SMENA in Russian 15 Apr 94 p 1 944F0582A St. Petersburg SMENA Russian CSO [Article by Vika Uzdina: "Will New Revenues Compensate for Expenditures?"] [Text] In keeping with the prognosis of the receipt of revenues into the municipal budget during the second quarter of this year, it is suggested that only 50 percent of the costs of the municipal economy be financed in May. In May 97.1 billion rubles [R] will be spent on the needs of the city. This was announced at yesterday's meeting of the St. Petersburg Government by the chairman of the Committee on Economics and Finance, Aleksey Kudrin. In June the rough limit on financing for the distributors of credit (committee chairmen, administration chiefs, local administration heads, etc.) was set in the amount of R125.1 billion. This money is intended to fully satisfy the needs to pay wages and to finance all the city's sociocultural expenses. Aleksey Kudrin emphasized that the reduction of the volume of financing of the municipal economy was brought about by the reduction of the revenue side of the budget. In the second quarter of this year the projected revenues for the city budget will be R3,535,205, which will in no way compensate for the expenditures on maintaining the municipal economy. In all probability certain programs for social protection of disabled persons will be suspended in May (provision of transportation, payment for gasoline, etc.). The reduction of financing for the housing and municipal sphere will make it impossible to conduct prompt repair of 46 city streets which are in unsafe condition. In order to somewhat improve such a pathetic situation, the city authorities intend to look for additional sources of revenue. For example, just increasing rents and introducing new methods of settlement for certain categories of lease holders could bring R53.8 billion into the city budget (during the period from 1 May through 1 January 1995). By increasing the rates of the land tax and paying for plots of land into the revenue side of the budget during the period from 16 May through 31 December it will receive an anticipated R67.3 billion. (The draft of the corresponding directive from the mayor, which will be approved, establishes the average rate for land tax in the amount of R735 per one square meter.) In the opinion of Deputy Mayor Vladimir Yakovlev, it is necessary to draw up a kind of target program for financing the city economy which will determine not only the priority areas for financing but also the deadlines for allotting funds.
