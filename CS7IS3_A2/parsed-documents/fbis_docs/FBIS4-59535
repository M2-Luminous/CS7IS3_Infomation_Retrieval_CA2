Sanaa announced yesterday that its forces have moved into the strategic city of al-Dali', while Aden stressed that its forces have recaptured Zanjibar, capital of Abyan Governorate, from the northern al-'Amaliqah Brigade. Aden denied that northern forces have seized al-Dali', a stronghold for a large number of southern army commanders. However, neutral sources have told AL-HAYAH that it seems that northerners have made advances in al-Dali', and that fierce fighting is taking place in the directorate. With regard to Zanjibar, the sources say they can confirm Aden's information in this connection. Former President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad has issued a strongly worded statement in Damascus, stressing his "willingness to return to Yemen to mediate between the Yemeni leadership parties in order to safeguard unity." He denied the existence of any link between him and "the political bases agreed between the two partners (the Socialist Party and the General People's Congress)." [passage omitted] Responding to accusations leveled at him, he said: "I am not a party to the disputes tearing Yemen apart. My full support is for Yemen, its unity, and national unity." He added: "I am proud of my supporters wherever they are. They will serve nothing except the issue of unity, for the sake of which they have made sacrifices. And they will struggle to safeguard it." He said that what is happening in Yemen does not help the two sides to engage in calm negotiations. "However, it is not the end of the road yet for the negotiations, an understanding, and national reconciliation, despite the ferocity of the fighting there." He pointed out that he has done "a great deal and I am still willing to play a constructive role between the two parties to the conflict in order to secure a solution that safeguards the Yemenis' unity, spares them the calamities of war and destruction, and spares Yemeni blood."
