The Information and Press Department of the Army (DIDE) pointed out that "the current government is democratic, and it is very difficult to accept proposals from an illegal group that is constantly breaking the law." Nevertheless, DIDE said the Armed Forces will adhere to any decision made by General Commander and President Ramiro de Leon Carpio. It also warned that any guerrilla position must remain within the framework of their negotiations with the government. The rebel Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (URNG) stated in a communique released in Mexico City that the constitutional and institutional changes the country needs can only be accomplished through a "Unity and National Salvation" government. The URNG views the approval of constitutional reforms through the referendum held last Sunday as a "failure" and pointed out that the popular consultation confirmed the government's lack of credibility and legitimacy. The guerrilla's claims are prompted by the results of last Sunday's popular consultation, in which only 10.75 percent of the 3.4 million electorate voted to approve 37 constitutional reforms. Vinicio Hernandez, leader of the Guatemalan Workers Trade Union, told Notimex it is impossible to establish a united government because, to begin with, the peace negotiations are being held in secret. "We believe that rapprochement efforts are very positive but if the civilian, labor, Indian, or student sectors do not participate in the dialogue we will never reach a firm agreement," Hernandez added. The labor leader said there has been talk of an imminent signing of peace to end the 30-year armed conflict, but pacification "will not be accomplished unless there is consensus among the people who are affected." Meanwhile, the Peasant Unity Committee (CUC) has said that as long as there is a shortage of land, housing, and health care in Guatemala, a "Unity and Salvation" government will rapidly disintegrate. CUC leader Sebastian Morales said: "as long as there is hunger, cold, disease, and human rights violations, peace will be very far away." The peasant organization said it might join the URNG's initiative as long as the solutions proposed are specific. President Ramiro de Leon Carpio, who has not commented on the rebel statement, claims he "won" the popular consultation by a margin of seven to one votes. According to the president, the referendum results are the first step toward ending the political crisis that was unleashed on 25 May when former president Jorge Serrano Elias, who is exiled in Panama, disrupted constitutional order.
