FR940805-1-00037 FR940805-1-00006 5. Is testing at the worksite practical? Is it a good measure of the effectiveness of training? Should individuals or teams be tested? 6. If MMS specialists are used to observe operations and to determine the need for further training of personnel, can the process be sufficiently objective to be fair to lessees and contractors? Option 3. Under option 3, MMS would retain the current training system_i.e., submission of programs to MMS for review and approval and onsite review of programs by MMS personnel_but would modify requirements, where possible, to replace prescriptive requirements with performance requirements. In other words, standards would attempt to specify the performance that was necessary rather than specifying detailed requirements for courses. If MMS chooses this option, lessees, operators, and training institutions need to identify possible changes to the current regulations. 7. What specific changes should MMS make to current training regulations contained in 30 CFR part 250, Subpart O, Training? 8. Individualized or self-paced training programs allow each worker to learn at his or her own pace and allows training to be customized to meet a worker's specific need. The availability of computers and the rapid development of interactive computer technology may make individualized, self-paced training more effective. Since responding to emergencies during drilling or other operations is a team effort, interaction between personnel has always been an important aspect of training and drills. Does individualized training impede the ability of a worker to learn to work as a member of a team? Should MMS allow the use of individualized training (such as in an interactive computer format) as a means of complying with these training requirements, and if so, how should MMS ensure that workers are properly trained in working as a team member? Option 4. Under option 4, an independent third party would certify training institutions using MMS standards or standards established by other organizations. The third party could establish a program for the United States, or it could establish an international program. Workers who completed a training course at a school approved by the third party would be considered to be properly trained for work in the OCS. The MMS would review the standards established to ensure the system established properly addressed areas of concern to MMS. 9. Should a single independent third party be the only group that could certify training schools or should MMS establish a system that allows other groups to establish alternative training certification programs? 10. Under current training requirements, courses cover MMS regulations as part of the required curriculum. Will having courses approved on a broader basis make it impractical to ensure that workers are adequately trained in MMS regulations governing OCS operations? Opton 5. Option 5 is intended to be used in combination with one of the other options and would provide that any lessee or operator, on a case-by-case basis, could develop and document a training program and petition MMS to be exempt from MMS requirements. Option 5 would take advantage of the fact that many companies are developing safety and environmental management plans. The objective of a safety and environmental management program is to reduce the risk of accidents and pollution from OCS operations by incorporating safety management practices into facility management and procedures. A safety and environmental management program could describe the syllabus and responsibilities of a company's training program and provide the means for ensuring compliance with MMS regulations. If MMS approved the company's program, MMS would use that program as a standard and would require that the company follow its own program. 11. If MMS allows companies to develop their own training program, how will MMS monitor performance? 12. If MMS allows companies to develop their own training program, would problems occur if a worker transfers from one company to another? The MMS seeks responses to the questions and an assessment of which option is considered to be the most effective and efficient. After analyzing the comments received from this notice, MMS will determine the need for a public workshop to further exchange ideas. The MMS encourages all interested parties to respond to these questions and to provide comments on the various options. Dated: July 22, 1994. Nancy K. Hayes, Acting Assistant Secretary, Land and Minerals Management. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;19127 Filed 8&hyph;4&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4310&hyph;MR&hyph;M
