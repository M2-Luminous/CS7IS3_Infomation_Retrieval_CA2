The statement said that Li's visit, although in the name of "holiday making," was actually aimed at developing substantive relations with Indonesia and to create a situation of "two Chinas" in the world. The five-day visit which began Feb. 9 violated Indonesia's commitment on the "one-China policy" undertaken at the time when diplomatic relations between Indonesia and China were resumed. The China Government has lodged a strong protest against the Indonesian Goverment on the incident. The embassy statement further said the China Government hoped that the Indonesian Government would uphold overall interest in safeguarding the Sino-Indonesian friendly relations and cooperation. They also called for efforts to stand on-guard against the political designs of the "southward policy" pursued by the Taiwan authorities.
