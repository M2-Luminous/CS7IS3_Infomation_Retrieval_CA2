FR940525-1-00003 FR940525-1-00002 40 CFR Part 52 [IN33&hyph;2&hyph;6306; FRL&hyph;4887&hyph;7] Federal Highway Funding Assistance Limitations and Emissions Offset Requirements; Indiana AGENCY: United States Environmental Protection Agency. ACTION: Proposed rule; withdrawal; cancellation of the public hearings. SUMMARY: On January 24, 1994, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) published a proposed rule proposing to impose sanctions on Indiana under the discretionary authority granted USEPA under the Clean Air Act as amended in 1990 (Act) for failure by the State to meet its commitment to adopt and submit an enhanced motor vehicle inspection and maintenance (I/M) State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision as required by the Act for the Lake and Porter County ozone nonattainment areas. The Indiana legislature passed the legislation required to support such a SIP revision and on March 4, 1994, Indiana Governor Bayh signed the legislation. Because of this favorable action, USEPA is withdrawing the January 24, 1994, proposed rule initiating the process to impose discretionary sanctions. In addition, USEPA is also canceling the previously announced public hearings scheduled for February 16, 1994, in Valparaiso; for February 18, 1994, in New Albany; and for February 22, 1994, in Indianapolis which were postponed on February 15, 1993, by USEPA because of significant progress made by the Indiana Legislature toward adoption of necessary legislation up to that date. DATES: The public hearings scheduled for February 16, 18, and 22, 1994, which were postponed on February 15, 1994, are canceled. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Francisco J. Acevedo, Environmental Engineer, Regulation Development Section, Regulation Development Branch (AR&hyph;18J), United States Environmental Protection Agency, Region 5, 77 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois 60604, (312) 886&hyph;6061. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On January 24, 1994 (59 FR 3544), USEPA published a proposed rule proposing to impose sanctions on the State of Indiana under the discretionary authority granted USEPA under section 110(m) of the Act for failure by the State to meet its commitment to adopt and submit an I/M SIP revision as required by the amended Act for the Lake and Porter County ozone nonattainment area. USEPA had notified Indiana by letter dated December 30, 1993 of its finding that Indiana had failed to submit the required I/M SIP revision. The Indiana legislature subsequently passed Senate Bill 285 to support such a SIP revision, and on March 4, 1994, Indiana Governor Bayh signed the Bill. Because of this favorable action, USEPA is withdrawing the January 24, 1994, proposed rule initiating the process to impose discretionary sanctions. The USEPA is also canceling the previously announced hearings scheduled for February 16, 1994, in Valparaiso; for February 18, 1994, in New Albany; and for February 22, 1994, in Indianapolis. This withdrawal terminates the discretionary sanctions process initiated by the January 24, 1994, proposed rule. The mandatory sanctions process under section 179 of the Act initiated by USEPA's December 30, 1993, finding that Indiana failed to submit the required SIP revision is not affected by this action. Under that process, USEPA must impose sanctions within a certain time frame unless Indiana adopts and formally submits a complete I/M SIP revision. Because of the recent March 8, 1994 United States Court of Appeals order concerning the issue of I/M committal SIPs, ( NRDC v. EPA , D.C. Cir. No. 92&hyph;1596) if Indiana does not submit a complete SIP by the July 15, 1994 deadline established by the court, the State of Indiana will be subject to sanctions pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 7509. Dated: May 10, 1994. Valdas V. Adamkus, Regional Administrator. [FR Doc. 93&hyph;12770 Filed 5&hyph;24&hyph;93; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;F
