A sizable minority of the population sometimes goes hungry... Nearly one of five Maghrebians is living under the poverty line and suffering nutritional deficiencies. This is the situation for 20 percent of Algerians, 17 percent of Tunisians, and 30 percent of Moroccans, according to figures presented at a workshop held recently in Alexandria (Egypt) on food problems in the Maghreb region. "We are seeing an increasingly visible movement of the poor into urban milieus, a consequence of rural exodus by the most impoverished peasants," reported Martine Padilla, economist at the Mediterranean Agronomy Institute (IMA), one of the workshop leaders. Although significant progress has been registered since the 1960's, when an estimated two-thirds of all Tunisians were living under the poverty line, a sizable minority of these countries' inhabitants still suffers from malnutrition. In Algeria, "15 percent of the women have a significant deficit in protein calories," the economist said. This despite large annual appropriations to support national food policies (2.6 percent of GDP in Morocco and Algeria, and 3.5 percent in Tunisia). The food planning policies pursued over the last 30 years have raised the average standard of living: There has been a measurable increase in life expectancy, with most nutritional needs being met; but this progress has left behind a not insignificant minority of the population. Martine Padilla notes paradoxically that while "some people are suffering from deficiencies, others show signs of dietary excess. Many cases of obesity, especially among women, are found in Morocco and Tunisia." Countrywide distribution of staple foods (cereals, vegetable oils, milk, and sugar in all three countries, plus eggs in Tunisia and coffee in Algeria) has also had the perverse effect of depressing local agricultural productivity. Augmented consumption, fostered by easy access to products, has forced governments to allocate more and more foreign exchange for food. Between 1970 and 1992, Algeria's external food dependency increased fourfold. Currently, 80 percent of staples consumed there are imported. In Tunisia, the imported share is 60 percent. Only Morocco, a traditional exporter of agricultural products, has managed to keep food imports and exports in some kind of balance. End of Subsidies Morocco has kept dependency down to 20 percent, but only by curtailing consumption of certain foods (e.g., milk, mutton) that are not produced locally in sufficient quantity. Declining export earnings (oil for Algeria and phosphates for Morocco) exacerbated budgetary imbalances and increased indebtedness, leading governments to revise their food security policies. Especially after imposition of Structural Adjustment Programs by the IMF. Since the inauguration of these programs (1985-90), Tunisia and Morocco have initiated a truth in pricing policy. This year they must categorically eliminate all subsidies. Algeria, now in the midst of a debt renegotiation round, has already ended subsidies on all products except bread and semolina. The myth of food self-sufficiency has had its hour. Gone are the days when whole populations could be inundated with food staples made available at prices totally disconnected from the market: Interventions today must be selective. "What governments need now is to identify the people who are being hit hardest by malnutrition, who present the risk of a social explosion," says Martine Padilla. Already Morocco is getting aid from an American NGO [nongovernmental organization], Catholic Relief Services, which distributes food to the neediest, as well as generous alimentary assistance from the United States ($15 million this year). In 1991 Algeria instituted a "social safety net" policy that affects half of its population but remains notoriously ineffective. In fact, it costs as much as countrywide subsidies while doing nothing to solve the country's serious budgetary problem. For all these reasons, the Algerians would like to modify their strategy. There are also purely technical problems. What kind of targeting: by product, by geographic zone, by both together--or perhaps distribution of "food tickets" giving access to certain stores? Aid channeled to society's neediest also poses the question of how to mobilize the funds to purchase vast quantities of food products on the market, store them, and distribute them at sites accessible to a diffuse public, including many inhabitants disinclined to accept the stigma of the "poverty" label. Maghrebian rulers must consider all possible solutions to the dilemma of how to reduce undernourishment in an international environment of recession and budgetary restrictions.
