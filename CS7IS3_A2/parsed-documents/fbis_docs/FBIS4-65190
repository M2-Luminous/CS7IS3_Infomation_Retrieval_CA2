Only 18 percent of Europe's 255 million citizens would vote in a referendum to quit the Union, the poll shows. Yet 49 percent of voters oppose "a United States of Europe with a federal government." Just 32 percent are in favour, and there are substantial majorities against federalism in eight of the 12 EU member countries. The result of the far-reaching poll, conducted by MORI [Market and Opinion Research International], will come as a significant boost to the clutch of parties fighting next month's European Parliament elections on an anti-Maastricht ticket. Until recently, the vision of a federal Europe has been an article of faith among main-stream politicians across much of the continent. Now, eight months after ratification of the Maastricht Treaty, the findings suggest that the public is in a more questioning frame of mind. According to the poll, across the 12 EU states 70 percent of people would vote to maintain membership of the Union. Even in Britain, the home of Euro-scepticism, only just over one-third of voters would back withdrawal. But, according to MORI, the appeal of full-blooded federalism is now confined to Greece, Italy and Belgium -- the latter itself a federal country, where backing is highest at 58 percent. In Spain, traditionally viewed as one of the most ardently European nations, opinion is almost evenly split. In France and Germany, in spite of their leaders' unswerving commitment to the Maastricht blueprint for EU integration, the electorates are also firmly resistant. In Germany, supporters of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's avowd aim to build a United States of Europe are outnumbered almost three to one. Predictably, some of the most ferocious opposition comes from sovereignty-conscious Denmark and Britain. In both countries around 70 percent of voters are hostile to federalism. But more significant as a trend may be the high level of opposition in the Netherlands, one of the founder-members of the then EEC, which has traditionally looked to Brussels to fight the corner of small countries. According to the survey, only 21 percent of the Dutch support a United States of Europe, compared with 73 percent against. With the Germans about to begin a bold new federal initiative when they assume the EU presidency at the beginning of July, the findings are bound to be used as ammunition in the increasingly bitter battle over Europe's institutional future. Rows are already erupting over the agenda for the Inter-governmental Conference (IGC) in 1996, which is expected to quicken the pace of federalism. Although anti-federalist politicians are still in a minority, the poll shows that their views have the support of a surprisingly large proportion of the population. It will be a further warning to political elites of the dangers of a high-handed approach to European issues. Federalists will already be uneasily aware that the political landscape of Europe is changing. Antonio Martino, the new Italian foreign minister in the Berlusconi government, and a founder-member of the anti-federalist Bruges Group, is expected to take a cooler approach to European integration than his predecessors did. In a crucial policy shift, he is set to assert Italian national interests at the expense of ceding further powers to Brussels. The political partnership between Chancellor Kohl and Spain's prime minister, Felipe Gonzalez, could be abruptly terminated. Gonzalez is under increasing pressure to resign as a result of growing corruption scandals in Spain. The right-wing opposition leader, Jose Maria Aznar, who may well succeed him, is less fervent and idealistic about Europe. For this ambitious Europe-wide survey, MORI and associate pollsters in the 12 EU nations interviewed 7,300 adults over 18 years old, undertaking the fieldwork between 10 and 30 April. In terms of the future political make-up of the European Parliament, the poll puts the Socialists and the Centre-Right European People's Party level-pegging on 34 percent. The European People's Party is an umbrella grouping of Christian Democrats, the British Conservatives, the French UDF and Gauliists, and possibly the new right-wing Italian groupings. This neck-and-neck voting result would make the Socialists the biggest single party, owing to the character of European electoral systems. The Left would emerge with roughly 40 seats more than the European People's Party, yet would lack an overall majority. The final political line-up will ultimately hinge on how right-wing parties align themselves after the June election.
