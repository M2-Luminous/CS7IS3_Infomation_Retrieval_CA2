With just over three weeks to election day, the result of the poll among 850 respondents in the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging], Western Cape and Natal provinces show a leaching of support away from the ANC, a growth in National Party [NP] support and a surprising surge in DP [Democratic Party] fortunes. Although the ANC's dominance in the PWV and Natal is unchallenged, the new poll indicates that the NP is poised to take the Western Cape. The province is poised to be one of two -- the Northern Cape is the other -- that will not fall to the ANC. But the poll, a revisit of the national survey commissioned by the SUNDAY TIMES in November, also shows a considerable number of white voters are undecided. This means voting patterns could change even further in the next three crucial weeks. The main points of the poll are: The ANC has shed support in the PWV, Western Cape and Natal, but is still comfortably ahead in voter-rich PWV. Because of the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] election boycott, it is likely to win majority support in KwaZulu/Natal. In the Western Cape it has been overtaken by the NP. The NP has made gains in all three provinces, and in particular the Western Cape where coloured voters are flocking to its side. At the time the poll was taken it had lured much support away from right-wing parties. The Democratic Party is winning back the support of white voters who had ditched it in favour of Inkatha and the NP. In the provincial elections in the PWV and Western Province, the DP is benefiting from the introduction of the two-ballot system and could qualify for provincial cabinet seats in both provinces. Support among blacks in Natal for Inkatha has grown since the Zulu king entered the political arena. But is has lost virtually all its support among non-blacks. Had the IFP contested the election, sufficient numbers of voters who intend voting DP and NP in national elections would have switched support to the IFP in the provincial poll. By now the IFP would have been running a neck-and-neck race with the ANC for control of the province. Support for the AVF [Afrikaner National Front] and CP [Conservative Party] was negligible in the three provinces at the time of the poll. This support had gone to the NP, but Constand Viljoen's Freedom Front could win it back in the remaining weeks. The poll was conducted before the Freedom Front registered and therefore does not reflect support for it. Large numbers of white people (35 percent in the Western Cape and 15 percent in the PWV) who were willing and able to vote did not know how they would cast their ballots or refused to say. A high proportion of these would-be voters are likely to be right-wing supporters. In an election dominated by personalities, the influence of the two major players -- President F W de Klerk and ANC leader Nelson Mandela -- is clearly visible in the poll. The NP's lead in the Western Cape can be attributed to Mr de Klerk's enormous popularity among coloureds -- a third said they were "totally in favour" of him. Only 4.2 percent of coloured voters said this of Mr Mandela. That the ANC is still in with a chance in the Western Cape can be attributed to the fact that a massive 78 percent of black voters said they were totally in favour of him. Only two percent of blacks said this of Mr de Klerk. Voters are equally polarised over election issues. Whites regard violence, jobs, education, securing a free enterprise economy and attracting foreign investment as the most important issues. More than half of them believe the NP has the best policies to tackle these issues. In the PWV the number of whites who think the DP has the best policies to tackle these issues has doubled to about 25 percent since November, explaining the steep rise in its support in the province. Almost 50 percent of black voters said creating jobs was the most important election issue. This was followed, in order, by houses, ending discrimination, education and violence. About half of black voters in Natal, more than 80 percent in the PWV and more than 90 percent in the Western Cape think the ANC has the best policies to address these issues. Coloured voters in the Western Cape list their chief concerns as violence, jobs, education, housing and inflation. More than half think the NP has the best policies to tackle these issues. In KwaZulu/Natal the Pulse of the People poll showed that overall support for the ANC dropped from 40.9 percent in November to 32.3 percent in March. But because of the IFP boycott and the likelihood of a low poll in the province, Markinor estimated the ANC would get the backing of 50.4 percent of the province's willing and able voters in the national elections on April 27-28. About 20 percent of IFP supporters said they would ignore boycott calls and cast their ballots. Some 70 percent of these voters said they would support the NP in the national elections, pushing its support up to 29.9 percent (21 percent) in the province. The DP has clawed back the support of whites and Indians from the IFP to increase its support among voters to 6.4 percent (3.5 percent). In the provincial elections it will also get the backing of some Inkatha supporters, pushing its support even higher to eight percent. In the PWV, support for the ANC is down from 65.9 percent in November to 56.5 percent in March. However, the main reason for this is that the boundaries of the PWV province have been altered since the first Pulse of the People poll in November. As a result there are almost two million fewer black voters in the province than there were in November. Among black voters in the province, support for the ANC has remained constant at about 80 percent. About 10 percent of black voters have not decided how they will vote and five percent will not vote. It is among white voters in the PWV that there has been the greatest swing. About 7.3 percent of whites said in November that they would back Inkatha and 20 percent the CP/AVF. Now support among whites for these parties is down to four percent and 3.2 percent respectively. The biggest beneficiary has been the NP which has seen its support among whites grow from 40.7 percent to 55.7 percent for the national elections. As a result its support is up to 23.2 percent. The DP also gained, with its support among whites increasing from 9.3 percent to 19.7 percent. Its support among willing and able voters in the province for the national election is up to 9.4 percent (3.2 percent). Neither party has made inroads among blacks. Nor can either party be entirely confident it will retain this support. The DP is under threat from the Federal Party while General Viljoen's Freedom Front is likely to draw support of conservative whites away from the NP. A high proportion of white voters -- some 16 percent -- said they did not know how they would vote. In the Western Cape the ANC's support had dropped from 42.9 percent in November to 31.3 percent in March. It has lost half its white supporters and about a quarter of its coloured supporters. However, it retains the backing of about 90 percent of black voters. The NP has lost some of its white supporters to the DP but has made major inroads among coloureds. More than 55 percent of coloureds now say they will vote NP, giving the party the support of 37.8 percent of willing and able voters. Given this voting trend, it can be confident of getting the backing of significant numbers of the 35.6 percent of white voters and 20.9 percent of coloured voters who said they had not made up their minds or refused to tell pollsters how they would vote. The marginal improvement in support for the DP in the national elections in the Western Cape (from 5.7 percent to 6.7 percent) is the result of the party making a modest inroad into the coloured community. However, in the Western Cape provincial elections, Markinor estimates that the DP will win 10.5 percent support -- enough to qualify it for membership of the provincial cabinet. The reason for this increase is that people who said they would vote for the NP in the national elections indicated they would support the DP at a provincial level. Although support for right-wing parties was down from 2.6 percent to 1.7 percent, General Viljoen stands to gain the votes of some undecided white voters.
