Lu's success filled a blank page in the history of the Chinese aviation industry, according to experts of the Test Flight Research Institute of China. When a stalling spiral happens, an airplane stalls in mid-air and drops spinning at an accelerating speed, which leads to a crash. For decades, the test has not been tried on advanced Chinese-made fighters. But Lu Jun took on the task last December, and succeeded in 78 stalling spirals during 21 flights in a new type of Chinese-made airplane at an altitude of 11,000 m. Lu has test-flown airplanes of ten models in three kinds in the past.
