An ADS correspondent learned this from Anatoliy Ogurtsov, chairman of the Russian Committee on Machine Building, who visited Hanoi as part of a government delegation headed by vice-premier Yuriy Yarov. Between 12 April and 15 April the delegation held talks within the framework of the intergovernmental Russian-Vietnamese commission on economic, trade-related and scientific-technical cooperation. During a meeting with Tran Lum, Vietnam's minister of heavy industries, said Anatoliy Ogurtsov, the Vietnamese expressed their intention to renew the partnership between machine builders in the two countries, particularly with regard to the manufacture of electric machines with a capacity of 10-50 kilowatts and 5,000 kilowatts for the micro-hydroelectric power plants and small hydroelectric plants that Vietnam is preparing to build in inaccessible areas in the northern part of the country. Since it was with assistance from the former USSR that Vietnam built virtually all its large-scale energy facilities, including seven units of the Hoa Binh Hydroelectric Power Station, with a capacity of 1.92 gigawatts, according to Mr. Ogurtsov it is like God himself is telling Russian machine builders to continue their partnership with their Vietnamese colleagues in the field of electrification. Particularly since the Central Boiler and Turbine Institute Scientific Production Association, the Leningrad Metals Plant Joint-Stock Company and the Syzran Turbine Plant are already manufacturing a series of small-scale hydroelectric units developed by them, units that are already operating successfully in the republics of the Northern Caucasus, Tajikistan and Kirghizia. Vietnamese machine builders have also indicated an interest in the joint manufacture of certain types of metalworking machinery with computer numerical control, as well as assembly of the Vladimir Tractor Plant's DT-50 and DT-52 wheeled tractors, the Volgograd Tractor Plant's DT-75 caterpillar tread tractors and KamAZ vehicles at plants in Vietnam. Also announced was a shipment of sheet metal-bending presses manufactured by Tyazhpressmash Joint-Stock Company (Ryazan) and the Kolomna Heavy Machine Tool Plant Production Association. According to Mr. Ogurtsov, all these proposals by Vietnam are presently under consideration, and by the time of the May arrival in Moscow of Vietnam's minister of heavy industries Tran Lum the forms of cooperation between machine building enterprises in the two countries will have been worked out, as well as schedules and prices for shipments in both directions.
