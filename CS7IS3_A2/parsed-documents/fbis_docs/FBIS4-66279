We visited the five cities of Suzhou, Zhenjiang, Yangzhou, Yancheng, Xuzhou, and 10 counties and districts. According to relevant information, by the end of August 1993 Jiangsu had 8,801 township enterprises (bodies) under various stock systems (excluding Huaiyin City). Total capital stock was 7.569 billion yuan, of which 2.088 billion yuan was newly increased capital stock. Viewed from regional distribution, more than 60 percent of them were located in the three cities of Nantong, Yancheng, and Yangzhou. Viewed from the proportion of stock system enterprises in township enterprises, 7.45 percent was the average figure for the whole province, and the above-mentioned three cities made up respectively 27.56 percent, 12.98 percent, and 6.92 percent, whereas the three cities of Suzhou, Wuxi, and Changzhou only made up 1.74 percent, 3.64 percent, and 5.59 percent. There are five types of stock systems now being carried out in various places: increase the number of shares, discount the number of existing shares, joining shares by legal persons, joint partnership shares, and collective shares by individuals. Most were transformed from original collective enterprises. Altogether, there were 5,676, accounting for 64.5 percent of the existing stock-sharing enterprises. Trends show that southern Jiangsu primarily focused on collective enterprises and northern Jiangsu mainly targeted individual and private economies to implement stock systems. We can see from the above data that Jiangsu had an uneven development in carrying out the township enterprise stock system. However, the general trend is that it is unfolding from pilot programs to large areas, and in some cities and counties the practice is gradually gaining momentum. Evaluation of Carrying Out the Stock System at Present In general, in recent years various localities carried out the stock system by pilot programs, promoted it only after gaining experience, and development has been healthy. Practice shows that carrying out the township enterprise stock system is another great creation of the Chinese farmer. It is also another new breakthrough in continuing rural reform at present. Viewed from achievements made in various localities, the role of this move stands out in the following five areas: It is conducive to (1) clarifying the relationships of property rights in enterprises; (2) strengthening the sense of masters and risk on the part of the cadres and staff of enterprises; (3) increasing new channels for raising capital; (4) adjusting the organizational structure and product mix, and strengthening the competitiveness of enterprises; and (5) establishing and perfecting constraining mechanisms, and standardizing collective economic organizations of communities and the managerial behavior toward enterprises by the government. At present, current problems in carrying out the stock system are mainly: One, some cadres and masses have so far not unified their thinking. They still have quite a few "mistakes" and doubts in understanding. Second, some localities over emphasized the fund-raising function of stocks and neglected the transformation of management mechanism of enterprises. Thus, the stock system became a mere formality. Three, there was a lack of standardization in demarcating property rights and establishing stock rights. Particularly, controversy grew intense and practices varied over two issues, namely, the establishment of enterprise stocks and the change of collective stocks to individuals. Four, the proportion of individual stock partnership was low, only about 10 to 15 percent throughout most parts of the province. In practice, it is difficult to increase the staff's concern over the performance of enterprise management by this proportion. It is also very difficult to bring into play the superiority of the stock system. Five, relevant policies do not match. Particularly, the nature of enterprises under stock systems, registration, and credit policies are not clear yet. This has affected the enthusiasm and initiative of enterprises. The Issue of Linking the Stock System to the Contract Management Responsibility System Some comrades believe that practicing the stock system means the replacement of the contract management responsibility system. This is a misunderstanding. There is no exclusionary relationship between the stock system and the contract management responsibility system. What the stock system solves is the property rights of enterprises, that is, the ownership of assets. What the contract management responsibility system solves is the management mechanism of enterprises. Some people simply put this kind of relationship into "property rights are shared in the form of stocks and management is revealed in contracts." This statement is reasonable. For township enterprises to establish modern enterprise systems, there should be a good combination of the stock system and the contract management responsibility system. Mutually complementary, these two systems will bring their roles into full play. In terms of linking the stock system to the contract management responsibility system, Zhenjiang's experience is worth noting. Their practice is "two changes and two nonchanges." That is, "the form of distribution changes but contractors normally do not change; plans for management and development change in accordance with actual circumstances, but the contract quota system normally does not change." "Stocks" and "contracting" will combine to achieve a stable link. Board of directors, board of supervisors, and stock holders meetings must actually exercise their functions and powers. Township governments must reduce their administrative interference in enterprises. The form of entrusting stock holder representation can be employed to ensure the appreciation of collective assets of enterprises under the stock system. Experiences of grassroots organizations show that the relationship between township governments and enterprises practicing stock systems should include four areas: planning, coordination, supervision, and service. At the same time, attention should be paid to training a contingent of township entrepreneurs who have vision, clear thoughts, know how to manage businesses, and are knowledgeable of modern commodity economy. Only by so doing can we truly establish a highly efficient enterprise management mechanism in which property rights are clear, two powers are separated, and shareholders participate in democratic management and democratic supervision. The Issue of the Distribution of Benefits The distribution of benefits is a critical link in carrying out the stock system. Whether this can be handled well has an important impact on mobilizing the enthusiasm of the collective, enterprises, and individuals so as to let the stock systems develop in a healthy way. Two principles should be adhered to in distributing benefits: One is the principle of rational accumulation to accumulate reserve strength for the development of enterprises. Earnings resulting from tax reduction or remittance on other preferential policies can be retained in enterprises as "state support funds" to be used for developing production, but not for profit distribution. These funds belong to all stockholders. Two is the combination of the principle of distribution according to work and distributing profits according to stock shares. In terms of distribution according to work, enterprises can determine the form of distribution within the scope of ratified wages. In the implementation of distributing profits according to stock shares, the principles that should be carried out are "effectiveness determines distribution," and "hand in first, put aside reserves, and then distribute." After taxes are turned in, the accumulation funds, public welfare funds, and bonus funds can be withdrawn. Then, profit funds can be withdrawn. In principle, profit distribution has no maximum or minimum limitations. What is actually implemented is that both benefits and risks are shared. In enterprises under the stock system, in practice profit distribution after taxes are turned in is done in various localities by adopting "50-50 distribution." That is, 50 percent will serve as enterprise development funds, and the other 50 percent as profits and staff welfare funds and bonus funds. Within a certain period of time, the distribution of the "50-50" proportion is feasible, provided that enterprises have retained adequate production development funds. This form of distribution is conducive to gradually training stockholders in a sense of risk and reducing difficulties in setting up the stock system. In various localities the distribution of benefits from individual shares takes three forms, namely, drawing extra dividends while retaining interest, drawing extra dividends while taking interest, and drawing extra dividends while excluding interest. For the stock system to become standardized as much as possible, the practice of drawing extra dividends while taking interest should be gradually transferred to drawing extra dividends while excluding interest. Drawing extra dividends while retaining interest should not be advocated. Stock system enterprises that have implemented the practice of drawing extra dividends while retaining interest should change within one or two years (normally the limit is within one cycle of profits distribution) into drawing extra dividends while excluding interest. Only drawing extra dividends while excluding interest can actually strengthen the staff's sense of risk, enhance the staff's concern over the business performance of enterprises, and thus form a management mechanism of sharing both benefits and risks. In the perfection of a stimulus mechanism for benefit distribution, we can imagine some measures as follows: 1. Increase the volume of individual shares. Enterprises that have conditions can gradually increase the proportion of individual shares in the total capital of enterprises as much as 30 percent, or greater. At the same time, they should encourage management decision makers to invest more shares, invest large shares, and gradually form enterprise stock controlling circles. 2. To mobilize enthusiasm of the staff, 10 percent to 20 percent of the collective stocks can be taken out as the basis for drawing extra dividends but the ownership will not be transferred. A change of such a share should be accompanied by one or two cash matching shares from the staff. 3. After implementing the stock system, profits that were originally turned in to the township after taxes can be substituted by drawing extra dividends according to shares. Any dividends above 20 percent can be retained in enterprises for the expansion of collective shares. The Issue of Matching Policies Many policy issues are involved in the system change of stocks. Viewed from general areas, attention should be given to work in four areas. One, the departments concerned in the province should work out relevant policies and regulations as soon as possible. Two, establish and perfect rural cooperative economic organizations to exercise the management function of collective assets. Three, establish rural cooperative economic accounting offices and auditing offices as soon as possible. Four, establish share rights circulation service organizations, and guide the rational flow of property rights in stock system enterprises within a certain scope. We suggest that policies in the following areas be clarified in the near future: 1. The nature of enterprises should be clarified. Various types of enterprises under the stock system should normally be treated as a new type socialist economic nature and supported vigorously. 2. When business changes and registrations take place, we should follow the principle of "seeking truth from facts, and simplifying formalities." Business administration departments should examine and approve based on enterprise charters and have them registered as their first priority. When old enterprises transform their systems, fees should be charged only as registration change. 3. In the areas of credit, township enterprises that had stock system changes should still be treated as the nature of their original enterprise. Appropriate support should be given to stock system enterprises with individual stock pooling. Individually pooled shares, which are also an important aspect of consumption funds being changed into production development funds, should be encouraged.
