That is, while the country had an obvious excess of weapons, it did not have an army capable of quickly and effectively pacifying the country. On 31 October 1992 there were 2.5 million servicemen in the Russian Army. There were over 600,000 in the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs], but when 5,000 paratroopers, motorized riflemen and other such men were needed for the operation in Ossetia-Ingushetia, the General Staff and the MVD scraped them up with tremendous difficulty, company by company and platoon by platoon, from Russia's cities and garrisons. Still earlier, by the way, in January 1990, partial mobilization had to be carried out in the Northern Caucasian Military District for the operation in Baku. The former Soviet Army found itself totally unsuited to lightning-fast peacemaking operations. The military reform, which was planned to pursue a leisurely course until the year 2000, was seen more and more clearly as being inconsistent with the requirements of the times. Circumstances forced Russia's military leadership to improvise as the events unfolded, as one peacemaking operation blended into the next. But in general, the plan for reform by the year 2000 was in a certain sense completed: The Russian Army became a mixed army, consisting of both conscripts and professionals. Even numerical strength corresponded approximately to what had been planned--1.5 million persons. By the way, this is not counting the highly expanded forces of the MVD, as well as the local national-tribal auxiliary formations in the outlying areas (in Central Asia, in the Caucasus, in Ukraine etc.). Professional mobile combat units became the Russian Army's main strike force in the year 2000. The first such combined units (then still experimental) were formed in 1993-1994 out of soldiers serving on a contract basis. But the first complement of contract soldiers was generally unsuccessful: Common ill-disciplined people, often with a criminal past. Elite combat units could be hammered together out of such rabble only through merciless disciplinary measures. This required professional, highly paid junior officers, but there were none in the Russian Army then. However, the army was almost perpetually at is business, and these random people were gradually sifted out. In Russia, as we know, improvisation often produces better results than planned measures. By the year 2000 the army's strike forces consisted of five "old" airborne divisions, 20 brigades and 15 separate helicopter regiments. By the end of the century the tactics of intervention had been fully worked out: Peacetime generals managed to gain some experience. The operation to pacify the Northern Caucasus is still considered to be one of the best examples of a total air-land operation. In it, by the way, the Russian Army made its first use of "invisible" ground-attack aircraft, built according to "stealth" technology to penetrate the air defense system armed with S300 surface-to-air missiles, which the Confederation of Nations of the Northern Caucasus had purchased from Ukraine earlier. (The first flying prototypes of Russian "stealth" aircraft were tested back in the late 1980's, but because of insufficient funds the aircraft could not be introduced into series production until the mid-1990's, with the support of France's Dassault and Israel's military-technical assistance. After this, "stealth" technology began spreading successfully through the world arms market.) Mobile peacemaking strike forces didn't usually stay in one place very long. An effort was made to replace them in regions of operations as quickly as possible with "conventional" brigades and divisions of ground forces and MVD, consisting mostly of conscripts, as well as with volunteer formations made up of local proponents of integration of the former USSR into the "new" Federation. Thus the General Staff almost always had a reserve at its disposal for unforeseen complications. By the way, mobile peacemaking forces were used extremely rarely in the territory of the Russian Federation itself (with the exception of the Northern Caucasus). The unity of the Russian Federation was fully ensured by special MVD units by the year 2000. As in 1993-1994, the unemployed, adventurers, vagrants, mercenaries who had managed to make war in various hot spots, and other unreliable persons sought the opportunity to enlist in the prestigious mobile forces. Special units were created for this contingent under the principle of the French Foreign Legion, which accepted all physically healthy men who were citizens of any independent country. The mobile peacemaking forces protected the enlistee from prosecution by the law, and provided him with "clean" documents. However, during the contract period professional junior officers maintained the strictest possible discipline in the special units, essentially having uncontrolled life and death power over their soldiers. Also, a sizeable number of women were serving on a contract basis in "conventional" combined units of the mobile forces. By the year 2000, pacification of the former USSR was practically complete, and the now-stronger Russian Armed Forces had once again become the strongest army in Eurasia.
