Around 467,000 tonnes of petroleum products have leaked out of the airbase, and the ``deposit'' lies at a depth of seven meters, with individual lenses of pure kerosene between three and five meters thick. The contaminated area lies not far from the bank of the Volgograd reservoir and is only 500 meters from the Engels city water supply. Over 20 years around 60 tonnes of rocket fuel have also been lost from the fuels and lubricants depot. The damage to the environment, according to the preliminary figures, is assessed at 24.5 billion rubles. Meanwhile, kerosene ``prospectors'' are wasting no time: Each morning they drive up and fill their tanks for free. One truckful of illicit fuel earns at least 1 million rubles.
