Let us listen to the assessment by Nikola Koljevic [vice president of the republic of Srpska]: [Begin recording] [Koljevic] I believe that the talks were very brief, very concrete, and very efficient. We did not find out in what way and within what framework the next talks will be held, that is to say, in what way the Serbs will be involved, however, we have laid a sort of basis for participation. It seems to us that prior to any sort of official participation after the signing of the federation agreement between the Muslims and the Croats, we must primarily accomplish peace, sign a document on peace and not about a cease-fire. Namely, the only thing that we can fear is the formation of a new military alliance, while everything else is their free will. Therefore, first of all we will be interested in establishing peace and in the document about peace, and then in the talks of our side with the federation on an equal footing, which would mean without sanctions. [Unidentified reporter] Were there any concrete proposals today? [Koljevic] There were concrete proposals regarding the situation on the ground today as evidently greater efforts are aimed at establishing peace on the ground than on further problems regarding the constitutional order, that is to say, federation, confederation, and with whom. There was some mention of Tuzla, that is, in what way could the Serbian observers be incorporated in light of the fact that the Muslim side had rejected the initial proposal. Also discussed was that, if a sort of federation and confederation is being created, the Serbs would normally be interested in very close links, not to say a confederation, with Yugoslavia. Actually, we have never left Yugoslavia, legally speaking. All these problems regarding the political solution will arise. They were not raised today because the new mediators evidently care most about success on the ground and success with two sides, and to accomplish some success with the third side later. [Unidentified reporter] Were you officially invited to join the negotiations? [Koljevic] This was not officially offered to us, because this was not an official meeting. We must create the framework, officially. However, it is perfectly clear that this offer is on the table and will be proposed to us. It is difficult to imagine, bearing in mind that the other two sides have already rejected the possibility of a confederation with Yugoslavia, that this will be a serious option. However, all this will only come into consideration when the official talks with the Serbian side will commence. [end recording]
