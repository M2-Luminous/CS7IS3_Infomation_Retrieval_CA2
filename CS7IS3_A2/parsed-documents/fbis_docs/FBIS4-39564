MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS asked Yegor Timurovich for details. The Russia's Choice leader said that they had discussed the general political situation in the country and problems related to the package of economic edicts both already signed by the president and those that will come out shortly. During their confidential meeting they also discussed the formation of the Russia's Choice party, in which the president is taking an "interest." Chances are that Yeltsin will not attend the Choice founding congress on 12 June but, according to Gaydar, he relates positively to Russia's Choice, and the formula "Russia's Choice is the party the president leans on" is still in force. Just a few months ago democratic leaders were complaining about the Yeltsin apparatus, which "closed" the president to contacts. Now, however, Yegor Timurovich noted, "the situation is developing in an extremely positive way."
