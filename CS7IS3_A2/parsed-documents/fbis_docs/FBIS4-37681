The Israeli enemy escalated its acts of aggression yesterday. Enemy artillery bombarded several areas in the south, creating severe tension in these areas amid reports from the occupied border strip on Israeli military movements inside the strip. According to security sources, Israeli enemy forces and agent militia [South Lebanese Army] [SLA] increased their military ground movements in the occupied strip and launched large raking operations in the woods and beside the roads. These sources noted that the enemy set up barriers beyond curves in the roads, and Israeli and SLA soldiers searched cars and interrogated passengers. In addition, the Israeli forces set up a new center east of Tallusah, which the resistance men attacked with rockets. Other enemy movements were spotted in the Hula area. The UN Interim Forces in Lebanon [UNIFIL] reports confirmed that the heavy Israeli bombardment continued yesterday and covered the western, central, and eastern sectors, noting that the UNIFIL areas of operation also came under the barrage, including the Fijian contingent area of operations in al-Mansuri, the Nepalese area in Rshaf, the Irish and Ghanaian area in Majdal Silm, and the Finnish area in Wadi al-Siryan. These acts of aggression were accompanied by hostile overflights over various sectors of the south. Israeli helicopters flew over the western sector of Tyre up to the international border from midnight until early this morning. The resistance retaliated by firing a number of missiles at the border strip.
