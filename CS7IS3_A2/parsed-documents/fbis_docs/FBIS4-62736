Laar was quoted as saying that the government should sell everything possible to private owners, irrespective of price. The premier also allegedly claimed that granting excessive rights to the trade unions may threaten the state's economy. Paavo pointed out that such claims could be made by a right-wing politician, but not "a prime minister of a democratic state, a leader of a coalition government which includes Social Democrats." He also pointed out that the premier's statements contradict the Estonian law on privatisation which stipulates profitable sale of state property. As for the rights of the trade unions, Paavo stressed that the Estonian trade unions obey the Estonian laws as well as the conventions of the International Labour Organisation, ratified by the Riigikogu [parliament].
