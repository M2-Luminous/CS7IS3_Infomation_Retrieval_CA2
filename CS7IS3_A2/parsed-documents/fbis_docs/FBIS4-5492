Hata, who is also a leader of Shinseito, one of the ruling parties, told a press conference the coalition has not broken up because meetings of the senior executives of the parties are still being held. "It's true that various emotions are entangled," Hata said. "But if we go back to the starting point of why we established the coalition, I think we can restore it." He added that the coalition has solved various difficult problems since it came to power eight months ago. The seven-party coalition is at odds over at what level to decide on a candidate to replace Hosokawa. The Social Democratic Party (SDP) called for a meeting of all the coalition party heads, but Shinseito, Komeito and the Japan New Party rejected the call. Hata said Shinseito has already voiced its opinion in the executives' meeting that a meeting of the top leaders should be left to the last in deciding the succession issue. He suggested a meeting of executives and top leaders of the coalition together.
