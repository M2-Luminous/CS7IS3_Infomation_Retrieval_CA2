According to broadcasts from Seoul, today, on the eve of the 14th anniversary of the 18 May Kwangju resistance struggle, about 50,000 people, including members of opposition organizations and college students throughout South Korea, held rallies and staged demonstrations demanding to know the truth about the Kwangju resistance struggle and the punishment of responsible figures. The National Alliance for Democracy and National Reunification held a national meeting with participation of 2,000 of its members and students in Chongmyo Park in Seoul at 1600 today. The participants in the meeting strongly demanded that the truth about the Kwangju incident, which is still concealed behind the curtain, be revealed and those responsible for oppression be punished. The students of 13 universities in Seoul, including Yonsei University and Chungang University, rose in the struggle. About 700 students from the Korea Federation of University Student Councils held a rally in Yonsei University, and dashed toward Yonhui-tong, where the houses of traitors No Tae-u and Chon Tu-hwan are located, and staged demonstrations. About 600 college students from the Seoul Area Federation of University Student Councils gathered at Yonsei University and demanded to know the truth about the Kwangju democratization movement and the punishment of those responsible for repression. They then staged street demonstrations advancing toward the homes of traitors Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u, the ringleaders of the Kwangju massacre. On the other hand, the puppet authorities deployed about 12,000 police forces around their homes and placed them under the posture for repression. The number of students who rose in the struggle throughout South Korea, including Seoul, reached more than 10,000 from 44 universities. They held events marking the Kwangju resistance struggle in their universities respectively. Meanwhile, on the eve of the 14th anniversary of the 18 May Kwangju democratization resistance struggle, events paying tribute to Kwangju martyrs were held in Kwangju. About 10,000 Kwangju citizens and students gathered at the plaza in front of the building in South Cholla Province, and recalled days of the resistance struggle by singing the "Song of May." At 1500 that afternoon, 300 students from Chonnam University and Choson University staged an on-street drama, reproducing the repression by the martial law troops in May 1980 and the resistance struggle of citizens. An international seminar on the Kwangju mass democratization resistance struggle viewed overseas was held at 1400 with the participation of figures from four foreign countries, including Japan and Thailand. A rally for the resolution of Pusan citizens to probe the truth about the Kwangju resistance struggle was held at 1430 that afternoon with the participation of about 200 students and citizens. Since a broad range of students and people rose in the struggle throughout South Korea, the Kim Yong-sam group mobilized enormous police forces and placed them under the posture of alertness, thus creating a terrorism-ridden atmosphere.
