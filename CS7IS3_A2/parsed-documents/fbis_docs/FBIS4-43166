Beijing is thus adding an element of tension to a situation which has been taking on worrying dimensions over the last couple of weeks. The -- hitherto "soft" -- handling of the situation has partly concealed the increasing dangers on the peninsula. Over the past months, the greater part of the international community has adopted a moderate attitude toward the regime of Kim Il-song. It only vaguely threatened sanctions if Pyongyang persisted in refusing to allow inspections of some of its installations which were considered essential by the UN International Atomic Energy Agency, the IAEA. This episode has not yet come to an end, because it is now certain that North Korea has discharged the core of its Yongbyong reactor without the obligatory controls to which it is subjected. Thus, it will no longer be possible to evade the proposal for sanctions which the UN Security Council is preparing and which will probably be debated next week. But this episode, which is still at the diplomatic stage, is fraught with difficulties and threats. Difficulties: For different reasons, neither China nor Russia, both permanent members of the Security Council with a right of veto, favor the use of force. Threats: Kim Il-song's regime is raising its voice by stating that sanctions would be regarded and treated as a "declaration of war." Clearly it is Beijing's position which has to be observed with the utmost attention from now on. It is caught in a dilemma, much to the confusion of its partners in the international community. First, it wants to succeed in its spectacular economic breakthrough by pushing its integration in the West's free market economy, and it cannot ignore that this implies obligations, in particular with regard to the recognition of the vital importance of nonproliferation for mankind. Beijing, however, does not -- or almost not -- intend to give in on two points: first, on what it considers to be its "interior domain" (the form of its regime and the way it treats its opponents); and second, on its status of great power, in particular by refusing to accept U.S. world leadership. So, will diplomats be able to find a solution which would allow China to "let down," without losing face, an old ally for whom, moreover, 1 million Chinese died during the Korean War? On the answer to this question will depend the tranquility of Asia and, maybe, world peace.
