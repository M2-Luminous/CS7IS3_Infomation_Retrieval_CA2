Western radio stations have reported that the expert economists -- Professor Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard University and his Swedish colleague Anders Aslund -- have ostentatiously given up the posts of advisers to the Russian Government. Several BBC programs have carried the farewell interview of probably the most famous of the monetarist puppeteers, with whose name the economic schemes of our own Russian "Chicago boys" were linked in the past. Jeffrey Sachs reported that he now deems it impossible to teach reason to the Russian authorities, which are ossified in antimarket dogmas, since with the departure of Gaydar and Fedorov it is no longer a government of reforms. World news agencies have simultaneously disseminated a report that the Russian Government has decided to enlist as experts two economists from the entourage of USSR ex-President Gorbachev -- Nikolay Petrakov and Leonid Abalkin, who have already embarked on elaborating a "more moderate economic policy." The change of scenery and prompters on the Russian political stage probably gives second wind to a popular anecdote from the times of perestroyka, which in its time was even heard from the rostrum of the Congress of People's Deputies. This amusing parable maintained that the U.S. president's 100 bodyguards included one who, to put it mildly, was insufficiently reliable, but the U.S. president did not, alas, know precisely which one. If the anecdote is to be believed, the French president, to whom, as to all other Frenchmen, rumor ascribes particularly ardent feelings for beautiful women, has somewhat similar problems: How is he to divine which of the 100 most charming ladies is infected with AIDS? But, according to the anecdote, the great reformer Gorbachev had the gravest thoughts: There are 100 expert economists in his entourage, and just one of them knows the path to market prosperity, but Gorbachev cannot guess precisely which one. The events of recent years, however, even make us seriously doubt that the ex-president really did have even one expert seer! At any rate, the majority of his advisers gambled on the salutary and miracle-working self-regulating role of the market, which Gorbachev, although not an economist, had perfectly reasonable grounds to doubt -- back in 1989, with righteous irritation, he made the following comment on the prescription of Vasiliy Selyunin, also an economist, who has now become one of the leaders of "Russia's Choice": "He says that the market itself will put everything in place within a month.... I know just one thing: Within two weeks such a 'market' will bring the entire people out onto the streets and sweep aside any government, however much they swear loyalty to the people!" The ex-president somewhat underestimated our people's legendary long-suffering, but the recent elections show perfectly well that the people's angry reaction will, in the final analysis, be precisely like that, sweeping aside the government. As is known, the experts surrounding Gorbachev included exemplary, assiduous apprentices of Jeffrey Sachs. Grigoriy Yavlinskiy and Stanislav Shatalin did not promise the country market prosperity as quickly as Selyunin did, but nor did they defer it for too long -- just 500 days. That spirited program elicited caustic comments from world-renowned specialists. Hisao Kanamori, chairman of the Japanese Economic Research Center, called the scheme "an impossible dream, totally incompatible with the real state of affairs in the Soviet Union." In his conviction, "the very fact that this kind of program has been advanced proves that Soviet people do not know what a market economy is." Four years ago, in the same interview with the KYODO News Agency, the leading Japanese economist also did not spare Petrakov and Abalkin, whose "moderate plan" for market transformations was ultimately approved by Gorbachev: Hisao Kanamori concluded that this program also did not contain "even short-term economic goals." Most of all the Japanese economist warned against the very "shock therapy" that was imposed on us in recent years. In response to the radical reformers' complaints that their plans had been "completely emasculated" he gave a truly prophetic warning: "...If the reforms had been implemented at such a fast pace, the muddle (in the Soviet economy) would have been still further exacerbated. The Soviets have no choice other than to advance gradually, implementing phased economic reforms." In connection with the demarche of Yegor Gaydar and Boris Fedorov and then that of their foreign guides-advisers, the debate in the mass media over whether there was "shock therapy" in Russia has once again become lively. Jeffrey Sachs himself maintains that there was not. Of course, everything is relative. Russians, who have been subjected to total impoverishment as a result of the "Gaydar reforms," must bear in mind that a yet harder fate would have awaited them if our Russian monetarists had paid still more attention to Jeffrey Sachs' promptings. The Russian economy, to use the figurative expression of WASHINGTON POST commentator Jim Hoagland, would have "floated belly up" much sooner. The true aim of Jeffrey Sachs' prescriptions is precisely to turn Russia's economy "belly up." An interesting analytical document has been disseminated by researchers at the well-known Schiller Institute. They neatly set out, as it were, the whole package of "obligatory recommendations" from the IMF and the Harvard school of monetarists. The scheme provides theoretically for a reduction in inflation and in the budget deficit to 5-10 percent a month, but the chief aim of the "reforms" is to open the borders to Western goods and to devalue the national currency in order to increase profitable (for the West!) exports of raw materials. The opening of the borders to Western capital investments and the closure of the majority of loss-making Russian enterprises are aimed at the same thing. "At the same time," the researchers state, "the nature of the reforms is not so important in itself (the only stipulation is for a reduction in the share of ownership). The chief thing is self-restriction and openness. But such a policy will lead in practice to the closure of almost all Russian enterprises and, accordingly, to a production slump, unemployment, and then also inflation." So it makes sense to give the matter some serious thought: Will Russia gain a great deal if it approaches these "yawning market heights" not in one month or even 500 days but much later -- on the basis of "mild reforms" according to the latest recommendations of Petrakov and Abalkin?
