In Guizhou there are more than 10 million people living below the poverty line, one-eighth of the country's total of such people. This month the first batch of over 410,000 donated items, worth four million yuan, have been sent to two poverty-stricken areas with an annual per capita income below 200 yuan and over three million people living in dire poverty. Minority nationalities, including the Miao, Bouyi and Yao, account for over 90 percent of the population in the mountainous areas of Guizhou. The drive is being headed by Governor Chen Shineng and Secretary of the Provincial Communist Party Committee Liu Fangren. According to a local official, individuals and more than 100 enterprises based in cities in Guizhou have contributed money or articles to the poor.
