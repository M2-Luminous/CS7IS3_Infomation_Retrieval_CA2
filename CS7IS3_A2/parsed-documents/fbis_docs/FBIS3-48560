Both the ruling coalition parties and the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) should have been "more sensible" in discussions that led to last Friday's rejection by the House of the Councillors of the four political reform bills, said Takeshi Nagano, president of the Japan Federation of Employers Associations (Nikkeiren). If both parties fail to reach compromise by the end of the current Diet session Saturday and the bills are scrapped, Japan's international standing would be eroded substantially, Nagano told a lecture meeting sponsored by KYODO NEWS SERVICE. The bills' scrapping is likely to spawn a sense of disappointment in industrial sectors across the nation, possibly putting added downward pressure on stock prices, a major gauge of the health of the Japanese economy, Nagano said. He said he hopes "from the bottom of my heart" that the political reform package will pass the Diet through an early compromise at a joint committee of both chambers of the Diet. The stalled discussion on political reforms has prevented the government from formulating a new economic stimulus package, a third supplementary budget for fiscal 1993 to finance the package, and the main budget for fiscal 1994. Turning to the coming spring wage negotiations with labor unions, Nagano reiterated the Nikkeiren policy decided earlier that it is virtually impossible for the management side to agree to a wage hike for workers. In view of the unabated worsening of economic conditions, allowing a wage hike "easily" would endanger the maintenance of employment, so businesses should give their top priority to securing employment rather than hiking wages, he said. The employment situation is deteriorating day by day, with the number of idled workers standing at an estimated one million to three million across the nation, he said. The actual jobless ratio may have reached 5 to 6 percent, a level seen in the United States and Europe, Nagano said. It is "impossible" for management to agree to a 5 to 6 percent wage increase for fiscal 1994, which was recently proposed by the Japanese Trade Union Confederation (Rengo). He said nominal wage levels for Japanese workers are the highest in the world and they should give up a hike during the era of the economic slump. In the United States, business performance is picking up due to drastic restructuring measures centering on a cut in personnel costs, he said, noting that U.S. real wage levels have dropped to those seen before 1960, after reaching a peak in 1972. He said the government should focus on deregulating controls as a means to reduce Japan's consumer prices, also the highest in the world. Such a step would enhance the standard of living of the Japanese people, he said. Nagano proposed anew that the government carry out an income tax cut of 10 trillion yen "as soon as possible" as a way to turn around the economy. Raising the consumption tax to cover an income tax cut is not desirable in light of the current economic situation but if it is unavoidable, such a hike should be delayed to "substantially later," he said.
