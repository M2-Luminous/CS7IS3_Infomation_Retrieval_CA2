The recommendation has been made by the government's Independent Expert Panel on Air Quality Standards (EPAQS), chaired by Professor Anthony Seaton of the University of Aberdeen Medical School, and is one in a series of standards being recommended for pollutants. The panel assessed available health and air quality data for ozone and have recommended that the standard should be 50 parts per billion as a running eight-hour average. In their report the panel state that: "This recommendation is intended to reduce the exposure of the population, including individuals who may be particularly sensitive to ozone, to levels at which harmful effects are unlikely to occur. We recommend that techniques for monitoring the standard are consistent with those of the Department of the Environment's national ozone monitoring networks. "We recognise that this is an ambitious standard which will need international action to be achieved. In order to monitor progress we recommend that ozone monitoring data in the UK are reported in terms of the number of days the standard is exceeded at any one site per year. We note from past evidence that if the 50 ppb [parts per billion] 8-hour running average is exceeded on less than 10 days per year, at any one site, then the maximum 8-hour concentration at that site is unlikely to exceed 100 ppb, a concentration at which health effects in healthy individuals have been clearly demonstrated." Commenting on the panel's recommendation, Robert Atkins, minister of Environment and Countryside said: "I am grateful for the panel's report, which the government will consider carefully, particularly in the context of the Framework for Air Quality Standards outlined in the discussion paper "Improving Air Quality," which I recently published. My Department will be consulting with industry, environmental groups, and other bodies on the standard. "The Government recognises the need to take action to halt the rise in ozone levels described in the recent report of the Photochemical Oxidants Review Group (PORG). As ozone is an international problem, this will require cooperation with our neighbours in Europe. Meanwhile we already have policies in hand to reduce emissions of the precursor pollutants which form ozone: -- all new petrol cars are catalyst equipped -- a strategy was published last year for reducing by 30 percent emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCS), one of the two precursors of ground level ozone by 1999 on a 1988 basis -- discussions are beginning within the UNECE [United Nations' Economic Commission for Europe] on a revision to the Nox Protocol (the other main precursor) which was signed in 1988 and which freezes emissions in 1994 at the 1987 level. The UK is on course to achieve this target and the Government welcomes international discussions on the opportunities to make further reductions." Mr Atkins added: "I am pleased to announce that my department will be upgrading its air quality bulletin service to provide hourly information on ozone to the public via CEEFAX, TELETEXT and Freephone by the summer." Notes to Editors The Expert Panel on Air Quality Standards (EPAQS) was established following the government's commitment in the 1990 White Paper "This Common Inheritance" to set up a panel to recommend air quality standards for the UK. It is chaired by Professor Anthony Seaton, Head of Environmental & Occupational Medicine at the Aberdeen University Medical School and members include medical and air pollution experts. The report is the second in a series which will make recommendations for other pollutants suggested to the panel by the government. Recommendations on carbon monoxide, 1,3 butadiene, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide and particulates are expected in due course.
