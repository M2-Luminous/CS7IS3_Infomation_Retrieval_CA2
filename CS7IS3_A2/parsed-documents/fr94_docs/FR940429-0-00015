FR940429-0-00015 FR940429-0-00008 Amendments 13 and 18 to the groundfish FMPs for the BSAI and GOA, respectively, authorize a comprehensive domestic fishery observer program. An Observer Plan to implement the program was prepared by the Secretary in consultation with the Council and issued by NMFS, effective February 7, 1990 (55 FR 4839, February 12, 1990). At its December 1992 meeting, the Council reviewed draft changes to the Observer Plan that were developed by NMFS and a Council-Appointed Industry Oversight Committee. The Council recommended that NMFS make the draft changes and initiate a rulemaking to implement them. A proposed rule to implement the Council's recommendation was published in the Federal Register October 28, 1993 (58 FR 57979). Comments on the proposed rule were invited through November 29, 1993. Two letters of comments were received and are summarized in the ``Response to Comments'' section of this preamble. After reviewing the reasons for the draft changes to the Observer Plan and the comments on the proposed rule to implement them, NMFS has determined that this action is necessary for fishery conservation and management and implements the following changes to the Observer Plan and its implementing regulations at §§672.27 and 675.25. (1) Change the definition of a ``fishing trip'' and base observer coverage requirements on a new definition of ``fishing days'' instead of ``fishing trip days''. ``Fishing day'' is defined as a 24-hour period from 0001 Alaska local time (A.l.t.) through 2400 A.l.t. during which fishing gear is retrieved and groundfish, as defined at 50 CFR 672.2 and 675.2, are retained for further processing. (2) Increase observer coverage on vessels equal to or greater than 60 feet (ft)(18.3 m) in length overall (LOA) but less than 125 ft (38.1 m) LOA during each calendar quarter, so that vessels in this size category are required to carry an observer 30 percent of the fishing days in each calendar quarter in which the vessels participate for more than 3 fishing days in a directed fishery for groundfish. Each vessel required to carry an observer during a calendar quarter must carry an observer during at least one fishing trip for each of the following fisheries in which the vessel participates: Pollock, Pacific cod, sablefish, rockfish, flatfish, and other species of groundfish. (3) Increase observer coverage of vessels using hook-and-line gear in the Eastern Regulatory Area of the GOA by requiring operators of catcher/processor and catcher vessels using hook-and-line gear that participate in a directed fishery for groundfish to carry a NMFS-certified observer during at least one fishing trip in the Eastern Regulatory Area during each calendar quarter that they participate in a directed fishery for groundfish in this area;
