He welcomed the fact that, in spite of the difficult situation it found itself in, the Russian Government had promised considerable funds. The German Interior Ministry would make available a total of 65 million marks this year for the settlement centers for Russian Germans. The money is to go to housebuilding, cultural institutions, and medium-sized enterprises.
