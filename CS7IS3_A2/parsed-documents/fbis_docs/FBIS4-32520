Here is what he told our correspondent Ivica Tomica about the tasks facing the man with three important functions in the Federation and the government of the Croat republic of Herzeg-Bosna, in an exclusive interview for Croatian Herzeg-Bosna radio. [Begin recording] [Tomica] Asked whether the newly appointed deputy premier of the Federation and defense minister will keep his post as prime minister of the Croat republic of Herzeg-Bosna, Prlic said: [Prlic] There are in fact three positions here. In line with the constitution of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation, the government has a premier and a deputy premier, so that, speaking about the Federation's government, I am deputy premier, and, speaking about the government of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, I am deputy prime minister [podpredsjednik vlade], and I am consequently defense minister in both cases. The government of the Croat republic of Herzeg-Bosna and Herzeg-Bosna itself will continue functioning in the interim period. There will be many problematic relations and decisions, but one thing must be understood: Life goes on both through inertia and through things which have already been initiated. I would like to say something -- I will say this next week in Sarajevo: the Croats have entered the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina with a considerable dowry. They had a regulated legal system, a regulated system of payment of soldiers, police force, state administration, health service, education system, judiciary, and care for the families of the dead and wounded members of the Croatian Defense Council [HVO]. I am speaking about all these things which have not at all been regulated on the territories which have until now been under the control of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. There is a great imbalance in that respect. We will -- I will personally -- demand very high standards for the organization of the state administration and the full implementation of the Federation's constitution. This is the basis on which I, in my capacity as deputy premier, will not back down. Consequently, I believe that all other members of the Government of Croatian nationality will do the same. I believe that other government members will support this stance as well. [Tomica] What will you do as the new defense minister? [Prlic] At this moment, as defense minister of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, I am nominally the defense minister of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army. This situation should be solved because the HVO has its own Defense Ministry and its own system of logistics, and everything else a military force needs. I will try to attain gentleman's agreements in that respect, which will clearly specify all issues. I believe that I should be the defense minister of a joint command. All the many variations were set up when the Federation's constitution was signed and relevant military agreements which followed the signing. [end recording]
