[Zizka] The Partnership for Peace plan is being reproached for not providing real guarantees to the Central European countries. In a meeting with the U.S. President, the Czech Republic did not join the criticizing voices that were raised by Poland, for instance. Why? [Zieleniec] The Czech Republic, as well as other countries in this region, is not under an immediate threat. Of course, there is a possibility of negative developments in East Europe, particularly in Russia. Of course, we would be happy if we were admitted into NATO right now or if the Partnership for Peace plan provided a clear deadline for our admission. Nevertheless, we have accepted the plan with pleasure. The entire plan was drafted gradually. It looked quite different when we learned about it for the first time. It seemed that it was only a proposal for joint exercises and intensifying professional contacts between the Armies. The intensive dialogue that we held with the NATO countries, particularly with the United States, had an impact on the final shape of the Partnership for Peace plan. The partnership is built on the civilization's common values and on a responsibility toward these values. We feel that we view the life and the importance of the freedom of individuals in the same way as the West Europeans do, and we are happy that the Alliance understands this attitude of ours. I am convinced that a quick opening of the Alliance eastward without setting clear criteria would not be in our best interests. I believe that we should be able to understand the feelings of members of the Alliance because we ourselves will certainly become a member within several years. If we want this organization to be efficient and able to secure its goals--that is, the protection of our life-style--this organization cannot admit a country that is not stable politically or whose appreciation of the said values is not so patent. [Zizka] In the past, the Alliance admitted countries such as Greece and Turkey, which did not meet the criteria for admission at that time. [Zieleniec] In the past, the Alliance was an anticommunist pact. The problem of common values was not so important. The main task was to stop communism. Now, the Alliance wants to assume a new face. It seeks to find a new raison d'etre for its existence. Admitting a country that does not fully accept the said values and that is not prepared to defend them without hesitation could create an opportunity for establishing a fifth column within the Alliance, which would then become more vulnerable in view of outside pressures. [Zizka] Are you then rejecting the opinion that injustice has been done to us? Some people in the Czech Republic believe that this a new Munich or Yalta. [Zieleniec] The politicians who used these words before the summit have stopped using them. The fact that they agree with us also demonstrates the stability and unequivocality of Czech foreign policy. Since the elections in 1992, our efforts to become a NATO member and assume responsibility for the Western values have become the key pillar of our policy. Many people in neighboring countries who vehemently speak about joining NATO did not even think about joining it several months ago. [Zizka] Did you ever see any danger in the fact that admitting the Central European countries into NATO could, sooner or later, lead to a new division of Europe and that Russia and other countries could find themselves on the other side? [Zieleniec] Europe's security system has always been based on a certain structure and division. Two blocs do not have to stand against one another and pose a threat to one another. On the other hand, I repeat, the Alliance is a defense alliance that secures freedom and democracy. Let us be sincere. All countries do not have the same life-style, and not everywhere is the state based on the same values. Democracy is not in all countries. [Zizka] Should we take into account the fact that NATO's eastward expansion could strengthen the position of Russian nationalists? [Zieleniec] I believe that the West's reaction in the form of the Partnership for Peace plan is quite adequate. It allows a flexible reaction to possible developments in Europe--in Russia, in particular--and gives us the opportunity to either become a member of democratic European countries that accept the values on which Western civilization has been built or to go in the opposite direction. [Zizka] This is the viewpoint of the West. What is the viewpoint of the Central European countries? Should we also try to prevent Russian nationalists from gaining more power? [Zieleniec] This is not only our problem or the West's. Russia is a nuclear power. It is a pan-European and even a worldwide problem. However, we should not forget that the Czech Republic's membership in the Western key structures is not a question of our immediate profit in the economic or security spheres. To us, it is a question of demonstrating our historical identity and our place within the civilization. All of our history is the history of a Western civilization. The fact that 45 years ago the Iron Curtain was established on our borders and we were separated from the countries that belong to our family as regards civilization, culture, and history does not mean that we should forget the thousand years of our history. [Zizka] Is our NATO membership a necessary condition? Switzerland is not a member of the Alliance; nevertheless, no one doubts that Switzerland belongs to Western civilization. [Zieleniec] I could cite more examples--Sweden, for instance. Switzerland is in a different place than the Czech Republic. It is impossible to become another Switzerland. We must take a firm position in this space; otherwise, we could end up somewhere we do not belong or want to belong to. The geographic position--or, better, the geopolitical situation--plays a key role here. Our situation adds shape to our history. Switzerland is Switzerland because of where it is. [Zizka] Were you not afraid that Clinton's visit could be adversely affected by reports that the Federal Security and Information Service and some politicians had tried to support former President Bush in the election campaign? [Zieleniec] No. I believe that the United States is a serious partner who would not want to put unverified reports on the agenda of such an important meeting. We have to wait for the results. I know that the appropriate authorities are conducting an investigation. I must say that I would be very sorry if the reports proved to be true. [Zizka] The Czech Republic was against coordinating the Visegrad countries' stance before the meeting. Does that mean that Prague wants to spread propaganda about its exclusiveness? [Zieleniec] No. We did not want to coordinate our course of action. Finally, however, everyone took the same stance. The whole Partnership for Peace plan is conceived as bilateral relations between NATO and other countries. I do not believe that it would be proper to cooperate in our region in any way other than by holding consultations. A more binding cooperation would be a direct road toward establishing alternative security structures. This contradicts our objectives--that is, our early admission to NATO. I believe that this is also clear to our partners. There is another problem: Our views are very different. We have not adopted the all-or-nothing strategy with respect to NATO. It is not because we are too cautious or that we would be satisfied with the little we could get, but there are reasons that I have already explained. I am afraid that, because of this, it was not possible to formulate our common stance. [Zizka] If, in the future, there are similar differences in our views and we are not able to coordinate our joint course of action when holding talks with Western institutions, the Visegrad Four's role of conducting political dialogue will dwindle. A solitary Czech voice will become hardly audible then, will it not? [Zieleniec] I do not believe so. The Partnership for Peace plan testifies to the fact that they have listened to us. It is important to create a good atmosphere in regional cooperation. We should cooperate in the economy, as well as in the spheres that are closely related to the problem of the regions--environment, infrastructure, transportation network, and energy supply. Of course, it is also important to be able to solve political problems in our region. When we have this, plus bilateral relations, the feeling of togetherness should prevail in the region. Yet, I would like to stress again that I do not understand the all-or-nothing attitude, which we heard about in connection with the Visegrad cooperation. Those who have adopted this attitude are damaging a vast sphere in which cooperation is possible and in which something has already been done. Everyone knows about a situation in his own life where more people had to jointly fight to push for a certain thing. In such a situation, a man who wants to force his all-or-nothing attitude upon others becomes a destructive element. One of the basic features of Western civilization is its ability to fruitfully cooperate and do constructive work. I spoke about it with my partners, and I believe that, when they were leaving Prague, they changed their opinion, which is also due to the influence of our U.S. friends. I hope that the summit, despite what we heard during its preparation, will become a very positive influence that will help intensify and accelerate cooperation within the Visegrad group. [Zizka] You stressed the fact that the economic sphere and specific projects are the most important things in regional cooperation. It also depends on the political contacts, whether trust or mistrust will be established between countries. Certain actions of Czech diplomacy--be it the absence of the defense minister at the consultative meeting or your statement at the time of the preparation of the summit, when you said that the summit would have mostly a bilateral character--met with a negative reaction. [Zieleniec] I only described how much time will be devoted to what. I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the summit was as I said: The first day was devoted to Czech-U.S. bilateral relations, and the second also had mostly a bilateral character inasmuch as the United States conducted talks with individual countries of the Visegrad Four. The dinner in honor of President Clinton was the first multilateral action. The increased nervousness, particularly in Poland, caused other people to think that we wanted to usurp the entire meeting. This was not the case. We were not influenced by the nervousness that prevailed during the preparation of the meeting, and we continued to push for our objectives. The Visegrad partners finally left Prague satisfied. Their words testify to it. Slovak Prime Minister Meciar rejected opinions that the Czech Republic is a partner that does not want to cooperate. President Walesa also eased up on his critical statements. [Zizka] You mentioned Meciar's statements. His words are a significant reversal because, shortly before that, Ivan Mjartan, Slovak ambassador to Prague, said that the Czech Republic's attitude could destabilize the region. Does that mean that a new Czech-Slovak partnership is in the offing? [Zieleniec] Our bilateral relations with Slovakia are a very important matter. I believe that the reason for this shift, not only in Slovakia's opinion but also in Poland and Hungary's, has been caused by our diplomacy's decent and calm attitude toward the preparation of the summit. We explained to our partners now and again what the essence of our policy was. We explained our efforts to search for a more intensive cooperation without having to compromise on our stance. I believe that U.S. diplomacy also helped us achieve that goal. During a meeting with foreign ministers, Secretary of State Warren Christopher stressed several times that bilateral relations were important for establishing the security system in our region. [Zizka] How do you view the Hungarian proposal to jointly sign a treaty applicable to the Partnership for Peace plan? [Zieleniec] Again, this is a search for symbols and a matter of stressing something that is not important at all. [Zizka] Some people are saying that the organization of Clinton's visit was in the hands of the Americans. Czech correspondents did not have easy access to individual events. The security measures taken by the Americans blocked traffic in Prague. The Czechs should have been given more clout in that matter, should they not have? [Zieleniec] President Clinton is a man who has enormous power due to the Constitution of the United States and the role the United States plays in the world. This power often represents the existential issue for the entire humankind. Because of Kennedy's assassination in 1963, no wonder the United States has become very concerned with the security of its presidents. The visible part of the security measures was only a tiny part of the entire job the United States had to do on our territory. It is true that it complicated the life of many Prague citizens. I would like to thank them for having coped with the situation. On the other hand, I would also like to say that our laws and sovereignty have not been violated at all. Our correspondent had a difficult time getting to various events. This is the negative side of the fact that there were hundreds of foreign correspondents who referred to this event and transmitted the picture of Prague and its representatives to the world. Two billion people all over the world watched the visit. This is no small effect of the visit. It paid off to put up with discomfort, if not for other reasons, then for this effect.
