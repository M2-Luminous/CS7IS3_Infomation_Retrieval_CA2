"Conflicts between clans and selfish interest goups must end," General Aidid said in the latest of a series of increasingly dovish statements. But he blasted his arch-enemy, self-styled interim president Ali Mahdi Mohamed and his allies for calling for the formation of a new government after meetings in Cairo this month which Aidid did not attend. "We all now face a transitional period of two to three years, during which the foundations of a new decentralised Third Republic and its cooperation with our neighbours will be agreed upon and set out in a national charter," Aidid said in a statement in the Kenyan capital Nairobi. He has held a series of meetings with regional and Somali leaders in Nairobi since he left Mogadishu in December to attend peace talks brokered by neighbouring African countries. Aidid said he would return to Mogadishu soon and urged all parties "to come together and form an interim administration and secure our future." Most key Somali faction leaders and political figures are currently in Nairobi for informal peace talks. One set of UN-mediated negotiations has brought together Aidid's ally Omar Jays and his rival, warlord Mohamed Said Hersi, known as General Morgan. Their struggle for control of the southern port city of Kismaayo sparked factional fighting that killed nine people last month. The adversaries will meet at the United Nations complex outside Nairobi this week to agree a date and venue for a peace conference to end the bloodshed in Kismaayo, UN spokesman George Bennett said. "There seems to be a greater willingness on all sides to make concessions," Bennett said. Aidid's newly conciliatory tone has raised hopes of peace in Somalia after US and other Western troops withdraw this month, leaving a smaller UN operation manned mainly by Pakistani, Indian and other Third World troops. But diplomats and aid workers remain cautious. Many are convinced that low-level guerrilla warfare among the clans will engulf the country after the Western pullout, welcomed by Aidid whose rag-tag militia humiliated the UN and forced the United States to abandon Somalia after sending thousands of troops to end a famine that killed at least 300,000 people. The famine was triggered by anarchic clan-based fighting that erupted after Aidid and other rebel leaders ousted former ruler Mohamed Siad Barre in 1991. "Aidid has switched roles. Now he's cultivating the image of a statesman, and he's playing clan politics with some skill, but he's still on a collision course with Ali Mahdi," said an African diplomat involved in the Somali peace process. "Many other disputes will have to be settled before Somalia returns to genuine peace. It's bound to be a slow process," the diplomat told AFP.
