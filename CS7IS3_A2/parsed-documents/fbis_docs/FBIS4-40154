FBIS4-40154 "drsov115_a_94007" FBIS-SOV-94-115 Daily Report 14 Jun 1994 RUSSIA INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Commentator on DPRK `Publicity Stunt' Commentator on DPRK `Publicity Stunt' LD1406192194 Moscow Mayak Radio Network in Russian 1530 GMT 14 Jun 94 LD1406192194 Moscow Mayak Radio Network Russian BFN [Text] [Announcer Yevgeniy Grachev] The main news drawing everyone's attention abroad is the statement by the Foreign Ministry of North Korea on the pullout of the DPRK from the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]. The Agency monitors how the non- proliferation treaty is being observed. The statement was the subject of numerous telephone conversations between heads of states and governments. One such conversation took place between the Russian and U.S. Presidents. But the most interesting thing is that 24 hours after its statement on withdrawing from the IAEA, North Korea has sent no official notification about it to anybody as yet. We have already reported this in our Mayak Panorama. And now the report has set us wondering how this situation has arisen. I would like to put this question to my colleague, observer Vladimir Pasko. [Pasko] You know, Yevgeniy Tikhonovich, this is not the only puzzling thing. Having announced its withdrawal from the IAEA, Pyongyang let it be known at the same time that it had not yet left the non-proliferation treaty. I will remind you that last year during a very similar conflict with the IAEA over inspections, Pyongyang was so careless as to state that it intended to pull out of the treaty. But having seen what reaction that decision had provoked, Pyongyang realized that it had gone too far and backtracked, saying that it would suspend its decision. So, now it has confirmed that that formula continues [two-second break in transmission] without stepping over the line which must not be crossed. But at the same time it has been loudly stating that it would not allow any unjust inspections of its nuclear sites. [Grachev] In other words, as I understand it, Pyongyang is now in limbo, as it were. It is both party to the treaty and yet it does not subscribe to it. [Pasko] All this, in my view, is just a publicity game, what is more, it is a publicity stunt for the benefit of the domestic, North Korean audience, since these verbal histrionics will mislead nobody else. Representatives of the IAEA said that they believe North Korea to be party to the non-proliferation treaty, and that as this is the case it is obliged to abide by all the requirements which are imposed on it by the treaty, including inspection of its nuclear sites for collecting information about the North Korean nuclear program. Pyongyang is refusing to let the inspectors in, while the IAEA, because of the absence of the information, is refusing to confirm that North Korea is not engaged in developing nuclear weapons. [Grachev] You know, judging by the publications which I have read, nothing is clear. [Pasko] You know, the argument over inspection is nevertheless of fundamental importance. If Pyongyang triumphs in this argument, it will set a precedent for others to start refusing inspection, and yet the IAEA is the only body guarding the non-proliferation treaty. To undermine its authority is tantamount to sawing off the branch on which one is sitting. [Grachev] Then the question is how the DPRK can be made to comply with the IAEA's demands. [Pasko] You know, sanctions are not out of the question. But a number of countries believe that there is no rush here. Pyongyang has been cunningly playing on this. Curiously, the statement in question was made prior to the meeting of the Security Council which must discuss the report by the IAEA and its decisions to stop technical aid to the DPRK. It is possible that the Council will raise the issue of sanctions. In its statement, Pyongyang reduces the essence of the argument with the IAEA to the issue of inspection, implying that this is too trifling a crime for a punishment as severe as sanctions. [Grachev] That is not a trifling matter. [Pasko] Some think, whether you want it or not, that this behavior means that Pyongyang keeps the door ajar for dialogue. But one cannot help seeing that the bargaining campaign which Pyongyang whipped up around inspection is fundamentally impermissible. The non-proliferation treaty is not an object for bargaining or exploitation. It can only be observed, and observed without reservations. All games must be stopped, in my view, in the most determined way. [Grachev] Absolutely. All this is connected with nuclear weapons. Of course, things are too serious to start political games, you will agree. But I nevertheless think that sanctions are not the only measure that can be taken by the Security Council. I think the proposal made recently by Moscow on convening an international conference on nuclear-free status for the Korean peninsula must not be forgotten. [Pasko] Of course, this proposal cannot be ignored. But it must not be mixed up with the question of compliance with the treaty on implementation of the IAEA's requirements. North Korea says it is against the idea of its argument with the IAEA being resolved collectively. It demands talks solely with the United States [two- second break in transmission]. [Grachev] Many believe that they [as heard] will be continued. We have received a report from Japan today from which it is clear that the temperature of the water is being sounded. How will Americans react to such proposals? The Americans have thus said nothing. But I would like to note that proposals by Moscow seem to have been adopted by Pyongyang in recent days. Nevertheless I would like to draw your attention to the following: The issue of the argument with the IAEA seems to be akin to that of a conference on nuclear-free status for the Korean peninsula. Nevertheless they are not the same. [Pasko] Indeed, they are not the same. I would like to remind our listeners that this was an opinion of our observer Vladimir Pasko.
