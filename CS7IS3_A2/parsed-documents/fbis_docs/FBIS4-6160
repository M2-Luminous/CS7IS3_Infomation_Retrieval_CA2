Additionally, this development will evolve into the active assignment of the division to projects designed to develop new types of services. The company will beef up its services development capabilities as a way to better compete with rival Kokusai Denshin Denwa (KDD). As of 1 March, IDC had a total of 530 employees, of which 38 were assigned to the Information Systems Division. That number will be increased to about 70 in fiscal year 1994. Recruiting will focus primarily on experienced applicants, but will also include some newly graduated applicants. IDC formerly assigned most of its new services development projects to two activities known as "Services Development Promotion Section" and "Business Promotion Division." The "Information System Division" specialized in projects in the administrative area such as the design and operation of billing systems and late-payment follow-up systems. However, now that communications services have become sophisticated and complicated and billing formats will change drastically, IDC seeks to enhance developmental efficiency by involving the Information Services Division from the early stages of services development work.
