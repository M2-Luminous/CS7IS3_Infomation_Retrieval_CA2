Subpart B_Salary Offset §179.201 Purpose. The purpose of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97&hyph;365), is to provide a comprehensive statutory approach to the collection of debts due the Federal Government. These regulations implement section 5 of the Act which authorizes the collection of debts owed by Federal employees to the Federal Government by means of salary offset, except that no claim may be collected by such means if outstanding for more than 10 years after the agency's right to collect the debt first accrued, unless facts material to the Government's right to collect were not known, and could not reasonably have been known, by the official or officials who were charged with the responsibility for discovery and collection of such debts. These regulations are consistent with the regulations on salary offset published by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) on July 3, 1984 (49 FR 27470) in 5 CFR part 550, subpart K. §179.202 Scope. (a) These regulations provide procedures for the collection of monies from a Federal employee's pay by salary offset to satisfy certain debts owed the Government. (b) These regulations apply to all collections by the Director of OPM (except collections involving debts because of payments made from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, payments made under the Retired Federal Employees Health Benefits Act (74 Stat. 849), the Panama Canal Construction Annuity Act and the Lighthouse Service Widows' Annuity Act and payments or premiums relating to the Federal Employees' Life Insurance Fund or the Federal Employees Health Benefits Fund) from: (1) Federal employees who owe debts to OPM; and (2) OPM employees who owe debts to other agencies.
