Finance Minister Carlos Rafael Silva -- who held talks with Central Bank President Ruth de Krivoy yesterday -- made this announcement. Although he did not explain the type of measures involved in the implementation of this program, he said that they are joint efforts by the Central Bank, the Deposit Guarantee Fund (FOGADE), and commercial banks. [Reporter] Does it mean that liquidity will be injected into the financial system? [Silva] Obviously, because I do not think that withdrawals are being made at this time. The minister said he did not know the quantity of resources to be made available for this plan. He also denied knowledge of the possibility that the government, through FOGADE, will capitalize Banco Latino stocks, which is one of the options under study. Asked about the exact date when Banco Latino will reopen its doors and start returning their money to depositors, he noted that matters concerning Banco Latino were already entrusted to a board of auditors [Junta Interventora] on Friday. This board is made up of Julio Santodomingo, Hernan Oyarzabal, and Tesalio Cardenas. The board of auditors is the top authority in handling that institution, Silva said. He added: I understand that they are assessing the patrimonial status of the bank in order to make a decision. The finance minister was also asked about the decree that suspended the Value-Added Tax (VAT) and he replied: "Let's not talk about that." However, it was learned that the decree in question has not been published in the official gazette because of the legal difficulties that would result from suspending a law by decree, a decree that was not approved by the Attorney General's Office and the finance minister who will not sign the decree.
