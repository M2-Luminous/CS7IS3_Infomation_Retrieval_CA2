ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: The Secretary proposes to amend the regulations governing the campus-based programs (Federal Perkins Loan, Federal Work-Study (FWS), and Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) programs). These amendments are needed to implement changes made to the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA). The Secretary also proposes to reduce the administrative burden imposed on applicants for student financial assistance and educational institutions resulting from the verification requirements by amending the verification regulations contained in subpart E of the Student Assistance General Provisions, 34 CFR part 668. DATES: Comments must be received on or before August 22, 1994. ADDRESSES: All comments concerning these proposed regulations should be addressed to: Susan M. Morgan, Chief, Campus-Based Loan Programs Section, Loans Branch, Division of Policy Development, Student Financial Assistance Programs, Office of Postsecondary Education, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue SW. (Regional Office Building 3, room 4310), Washington, DC 20202&hyph;5447.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Student Assistance General Provisions regulations implement requirements that are common to the student financial assistance programs under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, (title IV, HEA programs). The title IV, HEA programs include the Federal Pell Grant, Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL), Federal Direct Student Loan, State Student Incentive Grant (SSIG), Federal Perkins Loan, Federal Work-Study (FWS), and Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) programs. On February 21, 1992, a notice was published in the Federal Register requesting public comments on statutes and regulations that substantially impede economic growth, are no longer needed, or otherwise impose unnecessary costs or burdens. The proposed change to the Student Assistance General Provisions regulations results from the public comments received in response to that notice. These proposed amendments also revise the existing campus-based program regulations. The campus-based programs are authorized as follows: Federal Perkins Loan_20 U.S.C. 1087aa&hyph;1087hh and 20 U.S.C. 421&hyph;429; FWS_42 U.S.C. 2751&hyph;2756b; FSEOG_20 U.S.C. 1070b&hyph;1070b&hyph;3. These proposed regulations would implement provisions of the Crime Control Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;647), enacted November 29, 1990, the National and Community Service Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;610), enacted November 16, 1990, the Higher Education Amendments of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;325), enacted July 23, 1992 (Amendments), and the Higher Education Technical Amendments of 1993 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;208), enacted December 20, 1993 (Technical Amendments). A description of the major proposed changes follows. The proposed changes that pertain to more than one program are described first followed by descriptions of provisions that pertain to only a specific program. The Federal student financial assistance programs support the National Education Goals by enhancing opportunities for postsecondary education. The National Education Goals call for increasing the rate at which students graduate from high school and pursue high quality postsecondary education and for supporting life-long learning.
