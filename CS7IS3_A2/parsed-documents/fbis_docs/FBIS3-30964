According to that proposal, the Serbs would not have the right to leave the Bosnian union. [Karadzic] No, we have accepted the Bosnian union, but according to the Muslim-Serbian declaration, we have the right to leave it whenever we wish. We may be within the union or outside it. If at any given moment this is easier for reaching peace, we are going to accept the union as well. [Correspondent] Do you think that the danger of air strikes is greater or smaller as compared to the situation two days ago? [Karadzic] This has never depended on our behavior. This is an internal problem of the NATO pact.
