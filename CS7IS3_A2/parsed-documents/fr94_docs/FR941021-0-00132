FR941021-0-00132 FR941021-0-00020 (iii) DOE shall determine the frequency of the Financial Status Report for each project or program, considering the size and complexity of the particular project or program. However, the report shall not be required more frequently than quarterly or less frequently than annually. A final report shall be required at the completion of the agreement. (iv) DOE shall require recipients to submit the SF&hyph;269 or SF&hyph;269A (an original and no more than two copies) no later than 30 days after the end of each specified reporting period for quarterly and semi-annual reports, and 90 calendar days for annual and final reports. Extensions of reporting due dates may be approved by the DOE upon request of the recipient. (2) SF&hyph;272, Report of Federal Cash Transactions. (i) When funds are advanced, each recipient shall submit the SF&hyph;272 and, when necessary, its continuation sheet, SF&hyph;272a. DOE will use this report to monitor cash advanced to recipients and to obtain disbursement information for each agreement with the recipients. (ii) Recipients shall forecast Federal cash requirements in the ``Remarks'' section of the report. (iii) When practical and deemed necessary, DOE may require recipients to report in the ``Remarks'' section the amount of cash advances received in excess of three days. Recipients shall provide short narrative explanations of actions taken to reduce the excess balances. (iv) Recipients shall be required to submit not more than the original and two copies of the SF&hyph;272 15 calendar days following the end of each quarter. DOE may require a monthly report from those recipients receiving advances totaling $1 million or more per year. (v) DOE may waive the requirement for submission of the SF&hyph;272 for any one of the following reasons: (A) When monthly advances do not exceed $25,000 per recipient, provided that such advances are monitored through other forms contained in this section; (B) If, in the contracting officer's opinion, the recipient's accounting controls are adequate to minimize excessive Federal advances; or, (C) When electronic payment mechanisms provide adequate data. (b) When DOE needs additional information or more frequent reports, the following shall be observed: (1) When additional information is needed to comply with legislative requirements, DOE shall issue instructions to require recipients to submit such information under the ``Remarks'' section of the reports. (2) When DOE determines that a recipient's accounting system does not meet the standards in Section 600.121, additional pertinent information to further monitor awards may be obtained upon written notice to the recipient until such time as the system is brought up to standard. DOE, in obtaining this information, shall comply with report clearance requirements of 5 CFR Part 1320. (3) Contracting officers are encouraged to shade out any line item on any report if not necessary. (4) DOE may accept the identical information from the recipients in machine readable format or computer printouts or electronic outputs in lieu of prescribed formats. (5) Computer or electronic outputs may be provided to recipients when that expedites or contributes to the accuracy of reporting. ยง600.153 Retention and access requirements for records. (a) This section sets forth requirements for record retention and access to records for awards to recipients. DOE shall not impose any other record retention or access requirements upon recipients, unless such requirements are established in program regulations. (b) Financial records, supporting documents, statistical records, and all other records pertinent to an award shall be retained for a period of three years from the date of submission of the final expenditure report or, for awards that are renewed quarterly or annually, from the date of the submission of the quarterly or annual financial report, as authorized by DOE. The only exceptions are the following: (1) If any litigation, claim, or audit is started before the expiration of the 3-year period, the records shall be retained until all litigation, claims or audit findings involving the records have been resolved and final action taken. (2) Records for real property and equipment acquired with Federal funds shall be retained for 3 years after final disposition. (3) When records are transferred to or maintained by DOE, the 3-year retention requirement is not applicable to the recipient.
