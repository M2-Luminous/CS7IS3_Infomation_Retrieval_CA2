FBIS4-10242 "drlat069_f_94004" FBIS-LAT-94-069 Daily Report 8 Apr 1994 El Salvador FMLN Urges Fulfillment of Land Transfer Program FMLN Urges Fulfillment of Land Transfer Program PA1004155294 San Salvador Radio Cadena YSU in Spanish 1800 GMT 8 Apr 94 PA1004155294 San Salvador Radio Cadena YSU Spanish BFN [From the "YSU Radio News" newscast] [Text] The FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front] has denounced the fact that the Land Transfer Program [PTT] for former guerrillas is at a standstill. Meanwhile, the United Nations has appealed to the government to resolve issues pending in the peace agreements. Antonio Alvarez, of the FMLN's Secretariat of Agrarian Affairs, questioned President Cristiani's announcement regarding the deadline to fulfill this point of the peace agreements. [Begin Alvarez recording] The current problem is that the implementation of the PTT remains at a standstill. Some 100 properties from the first phase have not been legalized. These properties would benefit 5,000 landowners and former guerrillas. To date, the first phase has not been completed and the second phase has not begun; it has not even begun. In the second phase, there are 1,879 properties located primarily in Morazan and Chalatenango Departments. The properties in the second phase would benefit 20,000 landowners and former fighters who are still awaiting the legal transfer of lands. I am talking about 111,000 manzanas. The government pledged to guarantee the transfer of 1,300 properties in Morazan and Chalatenango after noting it had encountered judicial and legal difficulties in registering them. Their registration would require an exceptional judicial, legal decree which the government promised that the Legislative Assembly would approve, but to date this has not happened. Therefore, it is impossible for these 1,300 properties to be legalized. The delays in the first and second phases involve 1,989 properties and 20,000 landowners and former fighters. Therefore, I would characterize as incredible and unrealistic President Cristiani's remarks to the effect that by 31 May the PTT will have concluded. He knows perfectly well that this assertion is neither true nor realistic. We believe this program will take much longer. [end recording] Alvarez said the government's land transfer proposal does not take into consideration the UN's stipulations regarding the number of beneficiaries. [Begin Alvarez recording] We maintain that the government must adhere to the figure established in the UN General Secretary's 13 October 1992 proposal, which is 32,500. The problem is that the government has registered less landowners than the 32,500 stated in the UN secretary general's proposal. Therefore, there are 6,500 landowners who are living on properties that have owners whose names can be verified, who have not been registered by the government, and who, therefore, have been excluded from the government's lists. [end recording] To this end, the FMLN representative gave assurances that this situation will foster social unrest. He added that to date the government has not provided any loans to the former fighters, which will hinder the country's next agrarian cycle.
