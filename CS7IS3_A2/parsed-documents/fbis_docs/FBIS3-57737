In it, the Duma is proclaimed a political successor the Supreme Soviet. If adopted, this declaration will become the State Duma's first serious challenge to the president. So far this is merely a declaration -- a document whose adoption does not entail any legal effects. In a conversation with KOMMERSANT-DAILY's correspondent, Mr. Isakov stated that since the deputies' attitude to this document is controversial, it should be executed precisely in the form of a declaration and submitted to the Duma only after being carefully studied in the committees. Apparently Vladimir Isakov sees the declaration as a feeler of the deputies' attitude to this sensitive issue. Apart from the declaration, the legislation committee is preparing a number of other draft laws that can give rise to serious friction with the president. Laws based on concepts differing from the president's are also ripening in other committees. The constitution, however, substantially limits the possibility of adopting laws not suiting the president. The Duma can approve such a law: to do so, the majority of deputies need to vote for it. Further, the law is submitted to the Federation Council: the president uses all levers on its members to influence them either to adopt the law or reject it. If the president's efforts are unproductive, he can use his veto power. To override his veto requires two-thirds of the vote in both houses of parliament, which is very difficult to get. Thus, in making the first attempt to pass a law which is absolutely unamenable to the president, the Duma has been confronted with the problem of its own legislative powerlessness. To overcome it, the Duma should probably seek the president's opinion at the early stages of work on draft laws. (Incidentally, a proposal has come from the presidential administration whereby not only adopted laws but also their drafts should be sent to the Kremlin). This opinion is apparently also shared by Mr. Isakov. According to him, each law adopted by the Duma must be the result of a compromise, combining provisions both attractive and not very attractive to the president: this should make the draft law veto- proof. Not only the Duma but also the president and the government are interested in such a compromise formula: If the latter fail to find a common language with the house and block the laws adopted by it, the lower chamber of parliament will very soon become a politically embittered and aggressive state body, a powerful center attracting all those unhappy with the president, including those who have invested heavily in electing "their" deputies in the hope for future profits resulting from the passage of beneficial laws.
