Borowski, presenting to the Sejm the governments draft budget for 1994, said that the size of the planned deficit at 83 trillion zlotys (about 3.8 billion dollars) was "within the boundaries of the possibility of its financing by the banks." He also noted that servicing Poland's foreign and domestic debt in 1994 would amount to 112 trillion zlotys out of total forecast expenditure of 693 trillion zlotys. Gross domestic product should rise by about 4.5 percent, he noted. Borowski told the chamber that the aim of the budget was to further reduce inflation to 27 percent by mid-year and 23 percent by December, to accelerate the tempo of economic growth and the growth in exports, and to limit cuts in the public sector. Also, support for agriculture would be increased. The public sector is likely to absorb about half of total expenditure, but radical improvements in this sector can only come after fundamental reforms of the social security and health systems. He said that the government would present draft proposals on social security by June, and proposals to reform the system of family benefit payments would be presented by the end of the first quarter of 1994. Borowski also announced that the government is considering plans to introduce a small levy on stock-market transactions, and is also examining the possibility of taxing stock-market earnings. Critics of the government who are demanding this, and are looking for major inflows from such a tax "treat the issue as a test of the governments leftism." In his opinion, however, the government had more to gain from seeing the continued growth of the stock market, since this would help to accelerate the introduction of new companies onto the exchange. He noted that the successful recent flotation of Bank Slaski (BSK) had brought over 3 trillion zlotys (about 140 million dollars) to the State Treasury. If income tax is levied, it could result in a fall in share prices, and thus a fall, rather than an increase, in budget revenues," he said. Also addressing the Sejm, National Bank of Poland (NBP) President Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz said that the draft budget "illustrated in all its drama the problem of servicing the public debt." If the public debt is financed by increasing the state's debt with the banks, this amounts to the emission of uncovered money - ie, inflation. She added that the NBP was concerned that a lack of control over rising budget outgoings could lead to a short-term increase in inflation. The NBP president also dismissed as "harmful and in no way justifiable," speculation that there might be a deep devaluation of the Polish zloty. In 1993 Poland fulfilled all the criteria in her agreements with the World Bank, including the rebuilding of the foreign currency reserves. She emphasised that it is not anticipated there will be changes to exchange-rate policy. Earlier on Thursday, Ms Gronkiewicz-Waltz said in a radio interview that since October, Poland's foreign currency reserves had been held steady at 300 million dollars.
