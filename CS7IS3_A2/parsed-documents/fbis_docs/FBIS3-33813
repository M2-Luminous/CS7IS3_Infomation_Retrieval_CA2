Which are these points? [Al-Ahmar] In the first place, I want to say that our acceptance of the dialogue that led to this document was based on our eagerness to maintain the Yemeni unity. Our acceptance of most of what the document contains was based on the desire to satisfy the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] because it hinted at separation, and we do not want separation. [Al-Qallab] But what are your reservations? [Al-Ahmar] We have reservations, and the team that represented us in the dialogue registered these reservations in the minutes of the meetings. [Al-Qallab] Are your reservations on the point concerning local government, or are there other issues? [Al-Ahmar] We have reservations on more than one issue, but as I said we accepted dialogue in the first place for the sake of unity, and we offered several concessions to the YSP since the beginning of unity and until today for the sake of unity. [Al-Qallab] Do your reservations mean that you do not accept this document? [Al-Ahmar] No, we accept the document, but we have reservations on some of its points. [Al-Qallab] What is one of these points? [Al-Ahmar] One of these points is that we reject the division of Yemen into regions or semi-states. Yemen should be divided into administrative units, which are the governorates. [Al-Qallab] We heard that you insist that the document should be worked out by the House of Representatives and not by the dialogue committee that represents the main parties. Is that true? [Al-Ahmar] This is untrue. The dialogue committee is not a constitutional establishment. The House of Representatives is the legislative establishment. The document includes some procedural points that do not need parliamentary approval, and includes other topics that should be presented to the House of Representatives because they conflict with the constitution. [Al-Qallab] President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih received an invitation from His Majesty King Husayn to meet in Jordan. Do you think this meeting will end the crisis? [Al-Ahmar] If, after the signing of the document in Jordan, the brothers in the YSP return to Sanaa to carry out their duties, then this will be the beginning of resolving the crisis, but if after the signing everyone returns to his present position and to where he is now, then nothing will change and the crisis will continue. [Al-Qallab] Did you settle this issue with the YSP? [Al-Ahmar] The dialogue committee is continuing its efforts, and it is the party that can answer your question. [Al-Qallab] Does this mean that you want the president and the vice president to return to Sanaa aboard the same plane after they sign the agreement in Amman? [Al-Ahmar] Yes. This is a natural thing if we want the crisis to end and the document to be implemented. [Al-Qallab] But the brothers in the YSP say that there have to be security measures before they return to Sanaa so they can resume their normal duties. [Al-Ahmar] This is a pretext. Since unity was achieved, they have been safe among us. Their brothers in the north received them with open arms. [Al-Qallab] But if you remember the famous incident when Prime Minister al-'Attas's motorcade was stopped at a checkpoint and was about to be prevented from entering Sanaa? [Al-Ahmar] This is not true. What happened is that when a large motorcade arrived at that checkpoint, the policemen only wanted to check the identity of the official who was escorted by this large motorcade. When they found out who he was they saluted him and let the motorcade proceed. [Al-Qallab] The brothers in the YSP say they have lost around 152 officials in explosions and assassinations and that their houses and families were constantly harassed. [Al-Ahmar] This is a big lie, and if we wanted to escalate things, we would sue them for such claims. [Al-Qallab] What is the case, then? [Al-Ahmar] All these figures are incorrect, except for one or two. They know who did the killings. [Al-Qallab] The YSP says its leaders will not go back to Sanaa before the suspects in the assassinations and explosions are tried and military troops are withdrawn from the cities? [Al-Ahmar] The first demand is approved by everybody. Yes, we insist that the criminals be tried and security be achieved. We are against sheltering or abetting criminals. [Al-Qallab] What about withdrawing the army from the cities? [Al-Ahmar] We in Sanaa regard the Armed Forces as the protectors of the homeland and of Sanaa. The Army of the Yemeni Arab Republic has never gone on a rampage in Sanaa as the YSP Army did in Aden. [Al-Qallab] It is said that Yemeni authorities have managed to seize some lists of the names of the "Jihad" group that is behind the incidents in Yemen and some incidents in Egypt. Is this true? [Al-Ahmar] Investigations have proven that all those elements and their camps are in the southern and eastern governorates. None of them is in the north. [Al-Qallab] But the lists Egypt handed over to the Yemeni envoys speak differently. [Al-Ahmar] No such lists have been handed over. The Egyptians say it was Aden Governor Salih Munassar al-Siyali who informed them about the presence of extremists' camps in the north during a secret visit to Egypt. This is an unfounded falsehood. [Al-Qallab] But, Shaykh 'Abdallah, foreign oil experts continue to be kidnapped in the north and this harms the reputation of Yemen. [Al-Ahmar] These kidnappings are directed by the YSP in order to underscore the impression that the security situation in the north is unstable and that there are terrorist acts and kidnappings. All elements undertaking these vile operations are supported by the YSP. [Al-Qallab] Reports say the three tourists whose release is now being negotiated were kidnapped by the Hashid tribe. [Al-Ahmar] They belong to the al-Ahfum tribe, which sometimes says it is from Hashid and other times from Bakil. It is a small tribe, but the ones who kidnapped them are from the YSP, from Sufyan. They did so in return for 100,000 riyals. [Al-Qallab] Apparently, the gap between the three coalition parties--the YSP, the General People's Congress [GPC], and the Reform Grouping--is still very big. What step do you think is necessary to end the present crisis? [Al-Ahmar] The first step is to unify the army. Unifying the army is the beginning of the unification of the state. We want the army to be an army for the whole country and not for parties. There is now an army for 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and another for 'Ali Salim al-Bid. [Al-Qallab] Some say there are four armies in Yemen: An army for 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, an army for 'Ali Salim al-Bid, an army for 'Ali Nasir Muhammad, and an army for the Reform Grouping. What is your opinion? [Al-Ahmar] This is not true. There are only two armies. They are the army of the south, which is 'Ali Salim al-Bid's army, and the army of the north, which is 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's army. [Al-Qallab] It is noted that following the recent crisis the state of affairs has reverted to the pre-unity stage. Has division become a fait accompli? [Al-Ahmar] For your information, the situation now is much worse than it was before the unity. The bitterness existing now as a result of lack of confidence is much greater than that which existed four years ago. [Al-Qallab] Why? [Al-Ahmar] Because of lack of confidence and because unity was based on power sharing between the YSP and the GPC. I can frankly tell you that unity as well as pluralism and democracy have not entered the southern and eastern governorates.
