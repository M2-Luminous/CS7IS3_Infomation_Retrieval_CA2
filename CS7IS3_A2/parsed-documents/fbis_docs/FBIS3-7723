Since your government does not recognize the RSK government and does not want to exchange information and engage in arguments with it, I suggest that our two parliaments establish working contacts and thus contribute to ending the war and the suffering of innocent people and to solving all disputes in the territory of the former Yugoslavia by peaceful means, the letter says. Vojnica informs the parliaments about the history of the Serb people in the territory of former Croatia and stresses that the Serbs do not want to live in the same state with Croats. The letter also quotes the results of the multiparty elections held in the RSK last December, and says that through the elections the people of the RSK confirmed their right to self-determination.
