ACTION: Final rule and confirmation of interim rule. SUMMARY: The final rule requires FDIC-insured mutual state-chartered savings banks that are not members of the Federal Reserve System (State Savings Banks) that propose to convert to stock ownership to file with the FDIC a notice of intent to convert to stock form and to comply with new substantive provisions of the FDIC's regulations when proposing to convert to the stock form of ownership. The intended effect of the final rule is to assure that mutual-to-stock conversions of FDIC-regulated institutions do not raise safety-and-soundness concerns, breaches of fiduciary duty or other violations of law. The final rule confirms, with modifications, an interim rule that has been in effect since February 15, 1994. EFFECTIVE DATE: January 1, 1995. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert F.
