One minute they are feeding society "version No. 1," trying to accuse the opposition of attempting to destabilize the situation, and when this falls through they come over all innocent and say: But we were only making public a document about "an incipient palace coup." We have been misunderstood. The next minute they are circulating a "directive from Yeltsin" on locating Russian military bases on the territory of former Soviet republics, including Latvia, thereby wrecking the Russian-Latvian talks, and all this is subsequently explained away as a "technical error" -- it appears that some clerk or typist is to blame for the whole thing. And now it seems our ears are deceiving us again: "Let's buy Siberia! For a paltry $3 trillion we can save Russia, add seven stars to our flag, and give an entire generation the prospect of unprecedented prosperity" -- ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA reported this initiative put forward by the U.S. political scientist U. Mid [name as transliterated] just the other day. This initiative first surfaced a year ago and was viewed by the public here as gibberish not worthy of serious discussion. But the author of the article "Siberia for $3 Trillion" had absolutely no qualms about writing the following: "It would be interesting to find out what Siberians and Far Easterners, for whom the land beyond the Yenisey is their native region, think about this proposal." Citing the U.S. press, he adduces a whole series of "pieces of evidence" in support of this idea. The sale of Siberia "would be the best way to resolve Russia's problems," since Russia could use the money from the deal "to start the transition to the First World instead of the slide into the Third." The article continues in the same vein: "All Siberia's inhabitants would be U.S. citizens enjoying all the rights and privileges of Americans"; "Russia would be able to pay off all its foreign debts and modernize its infrastructure." And so on. U. Mid published his scenario in order to "provoke serious discussion of how to extricate Russia from its blind alley." He believes that "economically speaking, this sort of solution is possible." He says that he came across Americans everywhere in Russia, and it was the same story in Hawaii: "Missionaries first of all, then traders, and finally the Navy." We could safely ignore all this gibberish if it were not published in ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, which in the very same issue reported that it is "the official newspaper of the state." What is this -- another "technical" (in this case editorial) error, or a cautious sounding-out of Russian public opinion?
