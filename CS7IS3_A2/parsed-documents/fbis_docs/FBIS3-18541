So said European Affairs Minister Ulf Dinkelspiel confidently when he made public the agreement he reached yesterday with the 12 EU countries in Brussels. "The agreement is a very good base for the referendum," Ulf Dinkelspiel said. "With a real effort from the yes side and with the involvement of all those who want Sweden to join the EU, I am convinced that the result will be a yes." Three heavyweight issues in the negotiations were settled during the weekend's and Monday [28 February] morning's marathon session: the budget, agriculture, and regional policy. On the budget question, the main stumbling block in the final round of negotiations, there was a half victory for Sweden: "We asked to be let off paying ECU2,000 million for five years. The result is ECU1,025 million," Finance Minister Anne Wibble said. What Sweden was demanding was a reduced EU membership fee for the initial years of Swedish EU membership. In the first year Anne Wibble wanted to give to Brussels as much money as the EU paid out to Sweden in the form of agricultural and regional support and so on -- that is, a zero net payment. After that the sum would gradually increase. At first the EU rejected the Swedish demand but later softened its stance step-by-step. However, it did say a blank no to the principle of reduced membership contributions. Instead the EU will put money directly into Sweden's state coffers. But it is unclear what this money will be called, what it will say on the payment advice to Anne Wibble. This means that in the first year of EU membership Sweden will pay a net sum of 450,000 kronor [SKr] to Brussels. After that net inpayments will increase rapidly. The EU's first offer on the budget came on Saturday [26 February]. It was improved on Sunday night. When Monday dawned, ECU125 million divided the Swedish and EU positions. Then the EU threw in a final ECU60 million, an offer that Sweden accepted. The heavyweight agricultural negotiations did not get going in earnest until Sunday night. But Agriculture Minister Karl Erik Olsson declared himself to be largely satisfied with the final result: "Highest on my list of priorities was preserving the high quality of Swedish food without an increased risk of disease and contamination," he said. "Here we more or less hit the jackpot. The Swedish people need have no fears about poorer food quality even though imports of foodstuffs will increase," the agriculture minister said, referring in part to the agreement on protection against salmonella that was finalized on Sunday. The second matter close to Karl Erik Olsson's heart was support for Norrland's agriculture that today receives almost SKr1 billion a year in additional state support. The Swedish negotiators wanted the EU to approve the principle of additional support for northern agriculture and also agree to share the financial burden. The green light was given to the principle itself. The EU has approved Norrland support for the whole of the Swedish support region as far south as Dalsland. In actual fact the support is supposed to be paid north of the 62d parallel, but Karl Erik Olsson noted contentedly that "the 62d parallel runs a long way south of the 61st parallel here." But the Swedish state itself will have to finance Norrland support. The EU said no to opening its pocketbook. Nevertheless Norrland's farmers can count on quite a lot of EU money -- in part in the form of the EU's so-called LFA support for less-favored areas that could give Sweden a total of around SKr350 million a year from Brussels. In addition the EU will also pay Sweden SKr1.5 billion per year from its new farming environmental program -- money that can be spent on solving the problems of northern Sweden in particular, the agriculture minister said. Karl Erik Olsson was less satisfied with the result of the negotiations when it comes to the important questions of production quotas for Swedish agriculture. Both the milk and sugar quotas were smaller than Sweden had demanded, even though the EU improved its offer on the last lap of the negotiations. Sweden will receive SKr2.4 billion per year for five years in regional support for the EU's structural funds. Of these, 360 million will go to Objective 6 -- the new support for sparsely populated regions that the EU created specifically for northern Scandinavia. The Objective 6 region covers parts of Norrbotten, Vasterbotten, Jamtland, Vasternorrland, and Kopparberg provinces, and Torsby local authority in Varmland and Ljusdal local authority in Gavleborg. "We have succeeded in the task of creating an understanding of our country's special character with its sparse population and long distances," Labor Minister Borje Hornlund said. The rest of the structural fund money will be shared between EU's Objective 2, 3, 4, and 5b regions. This means that it will go to industrial areas in decline, measures to counter youth unemployment, measures to prevent unemployment, and rural development.
