At a news conference in a Mexico City hotel today, 47-year-old Camacho Solis said he will not be a candidate in the 21 August presidential elections. He also said he will not be a candidate for senator or deputy. "Yes, I would like to be president of Mexico, but not at any price," Camacho Solis stressed when he reiterated that he will not be a candidate in the next electoral period, although he did not rule out that he might run in the elections in the year 2000. Camacho Solis said that "between seeking a presidential candidacy and the contribution I can make to the peace process, I choose peace. The decision might disappoint some, but I would reproach myself if I placed another decision above peace." [passage omitted]
