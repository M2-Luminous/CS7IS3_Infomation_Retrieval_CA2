The report, submitted to the government's tax commission and the ruling coalition, also adds miscellaneous increases and decreases in government spending to dodge the criticism that the ministry intentionally excluded specific items and limited conditions for its estimates. The ruling parties and the advisory tax panel to the prime minister urged the ministry to make such additional estimates. The earlier estimates presented last Friday only included a consumption tax hike to 7-10 percent from the current 3 percent, and limited the maturity for stopgap bonds to 10 years. The stopgap bonds are to fund a three-year time lag on conditions of continuing 6.2 trillion yen in tax cuts, including 5.5 trillion yen cuts in income and residents' taxes, and hiking the consumption tax. With the tax cuts now limited to the current fiscal year, Japan vowed in its March market-opening package to decide by the end of June on a full-fledged tax reform led by semipermanent tax cuts. Under the revised report, the ministry estimates a revenue deficit of 6.4 trillion yen to 11.3 trillion yen in fiscal 2000 with a hike in the consumption tax to 4-6 percent to cover the tax cuts, bond redemption, and expected increases in social welfare spending. For a hike to 7-9 percent, it estimates a deficit of 0.5 trillion yen to 5.3 trillion yen. A increase to 10 percent is the only estimate with revenue surplus, ranging from 0.7 trillion yen to 1.6 trillion yen. [sentence as received]
