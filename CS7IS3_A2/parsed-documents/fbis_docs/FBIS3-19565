FBIS3-19565 "drweu053_p_94007" FBIS-WEU-94-053 Document Type:Daily Report 18 Mar 1994 GREECE * Pangalos Seen Aiming Higher 94P20509 94P20509 Article Type:CSO [Editorial Report] In a brief article, the 24 February Athens daily I KATHIMERINI cites Theodhoros Pangalos, alternate minister of foreign affairs in charge of European affairs, as stating to the Athens daily MESIMVRINI that Greece is in bad economic straits. Pangalos also stressed the need for "five years of harsh austerity" and expressed the fear that the European Union [EU] may remand Greece to the control of the IMF. Pangalos, who, according to rumors, does not wish to remain in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs beyond the end of the Greek EU presidency in June, also disagrees with the government's ongoing "social dialogue" with professional classes. In this regard, the alternate minister said that "the government is conducting talks with representatives of tax evaders." The article comments that Pangalos clearly no longer intends to limit himself strictly to matters within his own purview, especially in light of the forthcoming Panhellenic Socialist Movement congress.
