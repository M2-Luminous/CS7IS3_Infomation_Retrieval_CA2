On the afternoon of 25 October, the Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute held its 21st Conference To Report Atomic Energy Safety Research Results, and the majority of the five reports and lectures were related to this issue. This implies a shift away from the past, which dealt mainly with reactors. Here I will introduce one bit of welcome news concerning the deep underground disposal of high level waste. In the report entitled "Movement of Radioactive Nuclides Deep Underground," Muneaki Aneo (Lab Director, Environmental Safety Research Department) presented results of tests conducted at an underground research facility in Canada's Manitoba Province in 1987. Recently the amount of water in downtown Tokyo leaking from rusted (oxidized) water pipes has grown too great to be ignored, but the environment deep underground, which is nearly oxygen free, is quite different. The image held by most of the general populace is that high level waste buried deep underground will come back via our underground water supplies in the not too distant future. This is the idea behind the movement protesting the plan by PNC's Storage Engineering Center for a site at the town of Horonobe in Hokkaido. However, the environment deep underground is completely different from that of the ground near the surface that is producing such a ridiculous amount of leakage in downtown Tokyo. In the tests JAERI conducted at a facility 240 meters below the surface in Canada, the underground water that flows through this layer (a fissure zone) was drawn into a large, sealed steel box via a pipe. Inside this box were large diameter pipes packed with various types of rock from that layer and arranged so the underground water would flow through them. Several types of radioactive substances were introduced via the inlet pipe, and the distance of their movement through the rock-filled pipes was carefully studied. The results of these experiments are as follows: - Roughly 90 percent of the radioactive substances introduced into the underground water were absorbed by the rock; - The greater the ratio of iron and biotite in the rocks, the greater the absorption of radioactive substances; and - Most significant, among the various types of radioactive substances, the "lighter" the nuclides were, the faster they moved through the rock, and the movement of "heavier" nuclides such as neptunium, plutonium, americium, etc., which are found in high level wastes, was much, much slower (for example, iodine moves 110 times as fast as americium). This fact is important because water 200 or 300 meters underground flows only a few meters a year. Because it flows so much slower than water near the surface, it is no exaggeration to say that movement of radioactivity from high level waste through the layers of rock in underground water occurs in ultra-slow motion. We must remember that the purpose of these tests by JAERI was to focus only on the relationship between the bedrock (a natural barrier) in which the high level waste will be buried and the movement of radioactivity that has leached into the underground water. We should not forget that the high level waste will be surrounded by a triple wall (artificial barriers) consisting of (1) vitrification, (2) a metal protective container, and (3) a buffer material (a type of clay) between the protective container and the bedrock that will be nearly impermeable to underground water. Through many years of testing and research PNC has obtained a perspective on sealing in radioactivity for more than a thousand years, and this research by JAERI further supports the geological disposal of high level waste.
