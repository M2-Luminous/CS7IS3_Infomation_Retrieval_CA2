FBIS4-33620 "drlat111_r_94005" FBIS-LAT-94-111 Daily Report 31 May 1994 Peru New SL Faction Discovered Through Arrests New SL Faction Discovered Through Arrests PY0806212294 Lima EXPRESO in Spanish 31 May 94 p A6 PY0806212294 Lima EXPRESO Spanish BFN [Excerpt] The recent arrest of several Shining Path [SL] leaders has alerted the antiterrorist forces to a new and powerful organization within the unruly Red Path [Sendero Rojo] faction of the SL organization which has for some time planned and directed subversive actions in Lima. The new SL organ, called Lima-Regional Committee [Comite Lima-Regional] has become the strongest political-military SL sector in Lima. The Lima-Regional Committee is the result of the merging of the Peoples' Aid [Socorro Popular] and the Metropolitan Committee, both of which are SL groups that operated in Lima. The National Counterterrorism Directorate (Dincote) has announced that the new group is responsible for numerous cases of murder and terrorist actions in Lima these past few months. Among them are the recent attacks against City Hall, the Air Force headquarters, and the U.S. Embassy as well as the murder of neighborhood leaders and members of the Peruvian National Police. Dincote believes the new committee is one of the most powerful the SL has throughout the country, although it is unaware of its real operating capacity. The police know the group is headed by a collegiate leadership. SL members arrested by Dincote have said the Lima Regional leadership comprises: Jenny Rodriguez Neyra, aka Rita; Ostap Morote Barrionuevo, aka Luis; Maritza Infante Yupanqui, aka Milagros; Abdon Cruzat Cardenas; and two other unidentified terrorists. The first information about the group was disclosed by an SL member arrested by Dincote in May 1993. Until then the police were unaware of the Lima-Regional Committee's existence. An SL member identified as Guillermo Pflucker Ruiz, whose alias is Raul according to his police records, said the Peoples' Aid and the Lima Metropolitan Committee united their weakened force following the arrest of Abimael Guzman and several other SL leaders. It seems the harsh blows sustained by the SL's military and political structure forced the merger because the two sectors had been seriously affected by the police action. By late 1992, the Peoples' Aid and the Lima Metropolitan Committee had lost their main leaders and their operation capacity had been seriously affected. With the merge the SL has maintained, although at a significantly lower level, its capacity and presence in Lima through its criminal actions. [passage omitted]
