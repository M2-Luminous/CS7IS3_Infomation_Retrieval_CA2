Suphachai said this while in Seoul as member of the prime minister's delegation. He said the impact on Thailand might not be great because the higher value of the yen will benefit Thai exports to Japan. However, frequent changes of government in Japan could change the Japanese policy of using Thailand as the base for entry into Indochinese countries, affecting its continuity. [Begin recording] [Suphachai] Regarding frequent changes of government in Japan, we are concerned about a couple of points. First, the policy of using Thailand as the gateway to Indochina -- to induce investment from Thailand to Indochina -- has already changed three times, and we are concerned about its continuity. Second, we, and the prime minister himself, tried on several occasions to schedule a visit to Japan because there were several issues to discuss. Our trade deficit with Japan now totals no less than $4 billion and Japan is a country with which we have a priority to solve trade problems. Our trade problem with Japan is just as big as with the United States. A visit which was postponed several times is not good for us. If Japanese economic growth continues as normal, opportunities for Thai goods will be quite good. Also, there is assistance which we seek from Japan on a few issues. For example, Japan is considering assistance in small and medium industries. There will be a meeting on this issue in October to organize assistance to our small and medium size industries, such as the spare part industry. [end recording] Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri said: [Begin recording] [Prasong] If the resignation of the Hata government is true, contacts, particularly trade and so forth, will not halt but the hesitation and lack of confidence over stability in Japan will slow down everything. Trade and economic cooperation will continue unaffected, but confidence will be affected... [interrupted by correspondent, who is unheard]. The LDP [Liberal Democratic Party] has been the government party all along. Therefore, the party will again lead the government. It is a matter of who will become the party leader. [end recording] Regarding the Japanese invitation for the prime minister to visit in September, the foreign minister said once an invitation is issued it becomes a commitment for the country regardless of whether the government is still in power.
