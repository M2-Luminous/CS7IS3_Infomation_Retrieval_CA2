There was in fact a surprise: the announcement by the foreign minister of the normalization of relations between France and the People's Republic of China [PRC]. Here is Alain Juppe's statement recorded by Luc Lemonnier: [Begin Juppe recording] The political weight of China and its economic power today and tomorrow justifies France's decision to resume the ties of trust along the line of what General de Gaulle did in 1964. We have thus conducted talks that have borne their results today, and I am pleased. We have, on the other hand, explained to Taiwan that we would honor our commitments and that in the future we will exercise self-restraint in the supply of arms. Now I hope that all this will be implemented through the resumption of an intense political dialogue with Beijing and through the strengthening of economic relations. I remind you that today, our share of the Chinese market is 1.85 percent, while Germany's is five percent. The Chinese market is huge. The rate of China's development -- more than 13 percent -- is the fastest in the world. Thus I think we have considerable possibilities that should be achieved now. [end recording]
