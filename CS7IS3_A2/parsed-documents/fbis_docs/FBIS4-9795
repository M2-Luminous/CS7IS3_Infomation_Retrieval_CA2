Francisco Javier Reynoso Nino, Baja California Congress secretary, has made this announcement in Mexicali. [Begin Reynoso recording] We have started direct relations with the two chambers of Congress, the chambers of deputies and senators. Those contacts will, of course, be in both directions and directed to further the investigations. We know, of course, Congress is not an office to investigate crimes, but we will be attentive to any information that becomes available and we will immediately report it to the corresponding authorities.
