I sincerely welcome you to ancient Kiev in the hospitable land of Ukraine. I am confident that today's meeting will play an important role in strengthening relations and promoting greater understanding understanding among the countries of the Black Sea region. I am especially pleased that Ukraine was chosen as the site of the second session of the Parliamentary Assembly of Member States of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Organization. This event is of truly symbolic significance to our country, because tomorrow marks the second anniversary of the day when the Act of Proclamation of the Independence of Ukraine was ratified by a national referendum. Despite the shortness of the period during which we have been building our statehood and setting our own foreign policy course, the process by which Ukraine has gained international recognition as an independent state and joined the world community of nations as an equal is now virtually complete. In July of this year, the Ukrainian Parliament approved the "Principal Directions of Ukraine's Foreign Policy"--a document that sets forth the fundamental national interests of our country, the goals of our foreign policy, and the principles underlying this policy. These principles are based on the universally recognized norms and principles of international law, the UN Charter, the Helsinki Final Act, and the Paris Charter for the new Europe. Our foreign policy is based on pursuing an open foreign policy and a desire to cooperate with all interested states. We are building our bilateral and multilateral relations with other countries and international organizations on the principles of voluntarism, mutual understanding, equality, mutual respect, and noninterference in domestic affairs. Ukraine also adheres to the principle of the indivisibility of international peace and international security and believes that a threat to the security of any one state carries with it a threat to international security as a whole. Our country's approach in foreign policy is "security for Ukraine through security for all." One of the key principles of Ukraine's foreign policy is our desire to attain nonnuclear status in the future. Recently the Supreme Council took a step forward in this direction, although I am convinced that this was only the first step and that we must return to this issue. Our policy must be consistent and predictable. To make this possible, apart from all else, we need the support of the world's countries, understanding of our difficult situation, and assistance in "clearing away the impediments" that were created when the USSR collapsed, including those involving nuclear arms. We emphasize: in following the path of nuclear disarmament, Ukraine expects to receive national security guarantees from the U.S., Russia, and other nuclear states, as well as the financial and other assistance that we need to destroy our nuclear weapons. These are not conditions, as some would like to portray them, but a foundation without which the actual process of destroying nuclear weapons may become complicated. We simply do not have the money for this. Our economic situation is difficult. We look upon our nuclear arms not as weapons but as material assets and ask for compensation. I consider this to be a normal demand. The decision of the Supreme Council confirms that Ukraine's policy to attain nonnuclear status remains unchanged, and all the Supreme Council's earlier decisions on this issue remain in force. This is the most important thing. We have to move forward, based on today's circumstances, focusing our attention not only on criticism of the Supreme Council's decision, but also on constructive actions. This will produce profitable results and open up the way to new steps in nuclear disarmament. I believe that this unchanging position will enable us to find a solution that will serve the interests of the Ukrainian people, those of the world community, and the goal of the total elimination of nuclear weapons in the world. Esteemed guests and participants in the session! Ukraine is interested in developing mutually advantageous bilateral relations with other countries and in expanding her role in regional cooperation and in the work of the United Nations and of other international organizations of a universal nature. In our opinion, Ukraine's geopolitical location, the long history and cultural traditions of her people, her rich natural resources, and her large economic, scientific-technical, and intellectual potential not only allow Ukraine to view a European orientation as paramount in her foreign policy, but also to play an important role in safeguarding Europe's political and economic stability. Having a deep-seated sense of herself as a European state, Ukraine wants to move as fast as possible "to build strong bridges" of cooperation with the countries along the entire perimeter of her borders. It is a universally recognized truth that the international position of any state is judged primarily by the relations that it enjoys with its neighbors. That is why we have taken an unequivocal stand on this matter: we regard all of Ukraine's neighbors as priority partners. An important component of this approach is regional and subregional cooperation. It is quite natural and essential in international relations to look for points of convergence and common interests with close neighbors, in particular with the kind of neighbors that the countries of the Black Sea region are. The notion of an opening to the sea as a country's "window" in one direction or another has now become commonplace. For Ukraine, the Black Sea serves as such an opening to the Mediterranean region, the Near East, and North Africa, not to mention the states of the Black Sea region. Ukraine--and it gives me great pleasure to underscore this--was one of the initiators of the creation of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Organization. The history of relations between countries in this region is measured not in years but in centuries. Since the earliest history of the Pontus Euxinus, or the "Hospitable Sea" as our ancestors called the Black Sea, there have been close and vigorous trade links and friendly relations among the peoples living along its coasts. Of course, there have also been difficult periods, but the wars and conflicts always passed and were followed by periods of peaceful cooperation. Today, as never before, there exist exceptionally favorable conditions for the countries of this region to develop mutually advantageous cooperation in all spheres of interstate relations. By coordinating our efforts towards this end, we can transform the Black Sea region into an important area of cooperation in the new Europe. In today's difficult times, when crisis phenomena in the economies of many countries are being exacerbated by domestic political conflicts or even armed hostilities, coordinated actions, support, and mutual assistance are especially important. We need to keep strengthening the ties that evolved over the centuries in the Black Sea region and developing them on a new basis that takes into account the new historical realities. We are very interested in developing friendly relations and close cooperation with the countries of the Black Sea region. It is Ukraine's position that the realization of the plan to transform the Black Sea into a zone of peace and multilateral economic cooperation will in a short time create conditions conducive to expanding mutually advantageous relations in such areas as sea transport, the development of the fuel and energy and the agroindustrial complexes, health care, and the pharmaceuticals, food, and processing industries. In our view, the progressive growth of multilateral economic cooperation in the Black Sea region will create the most favorable conditions for establishing a Black Sea foreign trade and investment bank. We should make an immediate start at further institutionalizing this cooperation, establishing permanent commissions and working groups to resolve various important issues. To promote the expansion of political and economic relations within the framework of the Istambul Declaration we need to work out an additional contractual and legal basis for multilateral economic cooperation aimed at fostering broad trade and economic links, the growth of entrepreneurship and business ties at the state level by making possible the free movement of goods and services. The Black Sea is already a zone that is free of nuclear weapons. The reduction of military activity by the countries of this region could be the next positive step towards creating a zone of peace, stability, and prosperity along the Black Sea coast. Unfortunately, today the waves of the Black Sea also carry human blood that is being shed along its shores. The wider the horizons of cooperation within the framework of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Organization become--in terms of economic relations, parliamentary contacts, cooperation in the sphere of culture--the less tolerance there will be for the existence of "hot spots" in this region. Our common and paramount goal is to put an end to the terrible advance of war. Expanding economic cooperation in the Black Sea zone is the most effective means of strengthening trust among the countries of the Black Sea basin. The development of commercial and economic ties, increasing investments in the economies of neighboring countries, establishing the most favorable possible regimes for trade, and participating in joint economic projects will promote increased economic interdependence among states, thereby objectively reducing the threat of potentially new conflicts among them involving the use of military force. At the same time, the expansion of mutually advantageous bilateral and multilateral economic relations is being hampered by the fact that the Black Sea zone of economic cooperation is still a zone of military conflicts. In those places where blood is being shed, other, so far unresolved, problems in the bilateral relations of a number of countries, including the inviolability of borders, pose a potential threat to peace and stability in the region. Given the military hostilities that are continuing inside some countries or between countries, as well as the tension that remains in the relations between some neighboring states, the growth of military activity in the Black Sea and its coastal regions is cause for grave concern. Recognizing that economic cooperation is not possible unless a climate of trust is established among the member states of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation zone and stability and security in the region are assured, Ukraine proposes implementing the following measures to build trust in the military and political spheres: If this formula is accepted, the necessary details can be worked out: 1. That provisions for holding naval exercises be worked out with a view to reducing them, as well as reducing the number of military vessels in peacetime, thereby helping to reduce hostilities. 2. That a declaration on the sanctity and inviolability of the sea borders of the countries in this basin be adopted. 3. That the countries of the Black Sea region sign a memorandum renouncing the use of naval forces, either directly or in other ways, against one another. 4. That the countries of the Black Sea basin adopt a declaration committing them to refuse the use of their territory for acts of aggression or subversion against other Black Sea states. The above is only an outline of our initiative. We are prepared to join in working out the details of this proposal, taking into account the interests of all interested states. What is needed is joint action and collective wisdom. [I would also like to deal with] another issue. There is an increasingly urgent need, in my view, to concretize an environmental policy in Black Sea cooperation. It is exceptionally important to work out a convention on protecting the Black Sea from pollution. This convention should cover a wide range of issues with respect to improving the ecological state of the Black Sea and utilizing and developing the bioproductive potential of this body of water. For Ukraine, with her first-hand experience of a real ecological disaster resulting from the Chernobyl catastrophe, the establishment of environmental safety guarantees and the implementation of a plan to improve the quality of the environment are "vital issues" in the full sense of the term. The Mediterranean countries, too, have directed their efforts at improving the environment by their recent adoption of a number of joint measures designed to accomplish this goal. If we consider that the Mediterranean and Black seas comprise a single natural organism, the need for ecological cooperation becomes obvious. Esteemed participants in the session! I have already stated that the ancient name for the Black Sea was Pontus Euxinus. But legend has it that it was also known by another name, Pontus Axenos, which means the "Inhospitable Sea." That was the name given it by those who came to its shores by force and with evil intent. I believe that productive cooperation among the peoples of the countries of the Black Sea region is the best guarantee of this sea always being hospitable to them. Allow me to welcome you once again at the start of this forum and to wish you success. Thank you for your attention.
