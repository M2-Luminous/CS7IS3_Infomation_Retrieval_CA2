FR941121-1-00018 FR941121-1-00006 S8 Tests and Procedures for Integral Beam and Replaceable Bulb Headlighting Systems. *␣*␣* S8.1 Photometry. Each headlamp to which paragraph S8 applies shall be tested according to paragraphs 4.1 and 4.1.4 of SAE Standard J1383 APR85 for meeting the applicable photometric requirements, after each test specified in paragraphs S8.2, S8.3, S8.5, S8.6.1, S8.6.2, S8.7, and S8.10.1 and S8.10.2 if applicable. A 1/4 degree reaim is permitted in any direction at any test point. * * * * * S8.10 Chemical and corrosion resistance of reflectors of replaceable lens headlamps. S8.10.1 Chemical resistance. (a) The entire optical surface of the reflector of the headlamp in the headlamp test fixture with the lens removed shall be wiped once to the left and once to the right with a 6-inch square soft cotton cloth (with pressure equally applied) which has been saturated once in a container with 2 ounces of one of the test fluids listed in paragraph (b). The lamp shall be wiped within 5 seconds after removal of the cloth from the test fluid. (b) The test fluids are: (1) Tar remover (consisting by volume of 45% xylene and 55% petroleum base mineral spirits); (2) Lacquer thinner; or (3) Fluids other than water contained in the manufacturer's instructions for cleaning the reflector. (c) After the headlamp has been wiped with the test fluid, it shall be stored in its designed operating attitude for 48 hours at a temperature of 73 ○F # 7 ○ (23 ○C # 4 ○) and a relative humidity of 30 # 10 percent. At the end of the 48-hour period, the headlamp shall be wiped clean with a soft dry cotton cloth and visually inspected. S8.10.2 Corrosion. (a) The headlamp with the lens removed, unfixtured and in its designed operating attitude with all drain holes, breathing devices or other designed openings in their normal operating positions, shall be subjected to a salt spray (fog) test in accordance with ASTM B117&hyph;73, Method of Salt Spray (Fog) Testing, for 24 hours, while mounted in the middle of the chamber. (b) Afterwards, the headlamp shall be stored in its designed operating attitude for 48 hours at a temperature of 73 ○F # 7 ○ (23 ○C # 4 ○) and a relative humidity of 30 # 10 percent and allowed to dry by natural convection only. At the end of the 48-hour period, the reflector shall be cleaned according to the instructions supplied with the headlamp manufacturer's replacement lens, and inspected. The lens and seal shall then be attached according to these instructions and the headlamp tested for photometric performance. Issued on November 9, 1994.
