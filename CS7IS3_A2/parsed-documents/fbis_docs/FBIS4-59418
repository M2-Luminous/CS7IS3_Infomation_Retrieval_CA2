Do you have any comment? [Nasrallah] We adopted many clear stances immediately after the government's measures, with official statements and on other occasions. We expressed more than a little satisfaction with the security measures taken against the Lebanese Forces. I remember it was said at the time that the action to purge Lebanon of the Israeli groups should have been taken long ago. This is so because the presence of any Israeli political group in Lebanon is a threat to Lebanon, its unity, security, and stability, and to the coexistence of its various sects and factions. We know that the Israeli plan in Lebanon and the region seeks sedition and division as a prelude to Israel's control of all the region's resources. Our view on this is clear. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] What is the political picture in view of the negotiations? What is wanted is the head of the Resistance as a primary condition for ending Israel's occupation of Lebanon. [Nasrallah] We discussed negotiations often. We said we do not believe these negotiations will produce results, at least not in the foreseeable future. All the optimism that prevailed after the Geneva summit between President al-Asad and Clinton diminished as the days passed. We even noticed in the past weeks that the daily political commentaries carried by Syrian newspapers and Damascus radio and television, as well as statements by Syrian officials, were very clear in accusing the U.S. Administration of abandoning many of its obligations undertaken at the Geneva summit. Obviously the United States cannot be an impartial mediator in the settlement process. Obviously the Israeli enemy is not willing to give even the minimum in convincing concessions to the Syrian side. In the negotiating process, there is a very big difference between a man like Yasir 'Arafat and one like President al-Asad. 'Arafat is ready to make concessions unconditionally and he does this every day. As for President al-Asad, he is a different person. From the beginning he defined and adhered to a series of principles despite difficult world and regional pressures and circumstances. Israel's intransigence over imposing a truce and settlement fully compatible with its conditions and the complete U.S. support for and protection of Israel on every level mean that we should not expect a result or progress in the foreseeable future. We used to hear statements that a settlement would be effected in late 1993. It did not even happen in the spring of 1994. Every recent U.S. statement has said: "We will work toward making some kind of progress on the various tracks in 1994." This means that the atmosphere is not one of settlement. [Correspondent] Do you expect anything to come out of Christopher's current visit? [Nasrallah] He said his visit was routine. [Correspondent] Israel recently attacked Sidon and areas in the heart of Lebanon, which was regarded as a message to influence the Lebanese Government because its positive stance on the Resistance was not firm. [Nasrallah] The government's main responsibility is not only to support the Resistance. The Resistance men are often told that the official stance supports the Resistance. There is a debate now on the theme: "Is resistance to occupation the responsibility of the government or the people?" It is the responsibility of the state and the people to fight the enemy and drive them away from our country. It is not enough for the state to tell the people that they have the right to resist. This is a shortcoming of the state. It is incumbent upon the state to support the resistance--and not just verbally and politically. The state must support the steadfastness of the southerners and implement its pledges them. The escalation of the Israeli attacks dictates that the Government provide the Resistance with all means to enable it deter and prevent these attacks. We should never fear the Israeli attacks or allow them to forcibly alter our official stand on the Resistance and on steadfastness. The Government's stand on the massacres in al-Nabatiyah and Sidon demonstrates its impotence and indifference at times. This is a major weak point in the Lebanese Government's performance and politics. [Correspondent] Some people believe that the Government's support for the southern people should be expressed in a political stand or financial support. Are you hopeful that this will improve? [Nasrallah] I doubt it. In the past when the south was attacked, the Government used to lodge a complaint with the UN Security Council. But now it is different: the Government no longer lodges any complaints. This means that the Government is not giving serious consideration to this. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] It is said that Hizballah is with the regime but against the law. [Nasrallah] We may discuss some details, but not the issue of resistance. We support everything that bolsters peace in Lebanon. We are against any show of force. What happened in Ba'labakk on Al-Quds Day was exaggerated by the media and political bodies, and it was exploited by several parties. Nevertheless, it was a hasty action by some brothers, who used to celebrate similar occasions with the same way in the past. But is had no political connotations. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] How do you coordinate between your military-security capability and maintaining domestic peace at a time when Islamists in other countries have failed in this? While maintaining domestic peace and engaging in quarrels with the regime, if political or other developments occur in the region and the Resistance's role ends, would you fail to maintain domestic peace? [Nasrallah] First I would like to explain one fact. The Islamic movements or the Islamists may converge--or naturally should converge--in their goals. It is also natural for them to have different programs and means to achieve these goals, considering the characteristics of each country and society. Lebanon is different from Algeria, Egypt, and many other Arab countries. Moreover these countries themselves or the Islamic countries all have different characteristics; each society has its own structure, which the Islamic movement should take into consideration. The special characters, circumstances, and events do not change the goals, but dictate to the wise man to deal with them and take them into consideration in his own methods and programs. [passage omitted] We might disagree with the Islamist brothers in Algeria on some details concerning this policemen or that soldier. Personally I do not believe the allegations that Islamists prepare a booby-trapped car here or place an explosive charge there to kill civilians, not in Algeria or in Egypt. I accuse the regimes of violence. I read a report in an Egyptian opposition newspaper that the baby girl killed in the [attempted] assassination of the prime minister some time ago was not killed by the explosion but by the bullets of the prime minister's guards, but the Islamists were accused of killing the girl. In any case, whether in Algeria or in Egypt, it is the regime which insists on using violence and repression. This regime has declared war on the Islamists. So far, the Islamists have not been allowed to form legal parties. The regime there [Egypt] even prevents the Islamists from carrying out any political activity and expressing their opinion. It uses repression against them, jails, tortures, and kills them on the streets under the cover of the Emergency Law. [passage omitted] As for Lebanon, our military power was established in 1982 simply on the basis of resisting the occupation--which still continues--not to show off or make domestic political gains. The continuing jihad operations over the past years, especially in recent years, confirm that we have only used force in a real, serious confrontation, and not for propaganda, one-upmanship, to show off, or for political gains. The Israeli enemy acknowledges that the 1992 operations were more violent and fierce than those of 1991. They said the same thing at the end of 1993 and, God willing, will say the same at the end of 1994. Since early 1994, the operations escalated significantly, especially recently. Most of the agents killed were not ordinary soldiers but security and military leaders working for agent Lahd's army. As I said, this is a military power which we should not fear. Every one agrees that resistance is a legitimate right and duty and anyone who fails to perform this duty is neglectful at the religious, national, pan- Arab, moral, and humane levels. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] What about the party called Hizballah Palestine? [Nasrallah] This party no longer exists. There was a group of Palestinian mujahidin who called themselves Hizballah Palestine for a certain period. But it ceased to exist after a short period. Currently, there is no Palestinian group bearing this name. But statements are sometimes issued inside Palestine by mujahidin who have no organizational affiliation. They might use the name due to its morale and jihad value. But there is no any organization called Hizballah Palestine. [Correspondent] What is your comment on the Government's decision to turn down any request by any party or sect to own any information media establishment? [Nasrallah] Generally speaking, we are awaiting the Government's laws. The Government must honor its promise and present a bill on the audio/visual law. This bill will be submitted to the Chamber of Deputies for discussion. We have a parliamentary bloc that will participate in this discussion. At any rate, the Government can do whatever it wants, but the Chamber of Deputies has the final say. We believe that all political parties must enjoy freedom, particularly the freedom of expression. No sect has its own media. [passage omitted] Preventing the parties from expressing their own views represents an unjustified violation of freedoms. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] Many figures want to join the Cabinet in the event of any reshuffle or change. Do you have the same attitude? [Nasrallah] We are not enthusiastic about participating in the Cabinet, nor do we have any desire to join the establishment. Our participation in the Government is contingent on the political program and the extent of the Government's honesty and sincerity about implementing a persuasive and logical political program that would serve the interests of our Lebanese people. [Correspondent] As a rule, the Government is formed first and then the policy statement is prepared. [Nasrallah] Governments in the advanced countries are usually formed as a result of alliances and coalitions. As far as I know, they agree on a political program and then the government is formed. This is followed by the policy statement, which normally puts forth a selected political program. Therefore, whoever wants to participate just for the sake of participation will accept anything.. [Correspondent] Does this mean that you will not take part in the event of a cabinet reshuffle? [Nasrallah] I said that this question cannot be answered either yes or no. It depends on the program to be implemented by the Government. It also depends on the Government's seriousness and honesty in implementing this kind of program. [Correspondent] Has any main party in Lebanon been raided and have weapons been confiscated? [Nasrallah] There are no weapons in the [Southern] Suburb. Hizballah fighters have weapons only to fight the Israeli enemy. It is logical to distinguish between the Resistance's weapons and those used to serve the enemy in some way or another.
