Ikeda, H. Muragishi, R. Bairinji, and T. Uemura of Toray Industries, Inc., Otsu, 520, Japan] [Text] Summary In this presentation, we will mention new reverse osmosis membrane modules developed recently for novel ultrapure water production processes, ``SU-900S'' and ``SU-700P''. ``SU-900S'' is the second stage membrane module in two stage RO process, and has high rejection of cations at low concentrations and high pH. Consequently in the two stage RO process using SU-700 for the first stage and SU-900S for the second one, high resistivity of product water, which is equal to the primary ion exchange process (5-10 M_O_-cm), can be obtained. ``SU-700P'' is the RO membrane module for post-treatment of ion exchange process, and has high rejection of TOC and special cleanliness without self-elution. Consequently an induction period to attain an original TOC level of feed water can be shortened to less than several hours, and the TOC level finally reached can be 8-10 ppb lower than the original level of feed water TOC concentration (10-20 ppb) by using this module. Introduction We have already developed several kinds of high performance polyamide composite membranes for reverse osmosis. They have replaced cellulose acetate membranes in the field of ultrapure water production, seawater desalination, softening and desalination of brackish water, and recovery of valuable materials. In the conventional ultrapure water production system, which example is shown in Figure 1 [not reproduced], the RO process is already indispensable fundamental technique because it is the most suitable separation technique for production of ultrapure water from raw water such as municipal or well water. As Large Scale Integration (LSI) circuit technology has progressed and its micro-processing technology requires ultra clean environments and materials, the need for higher quality ultrapure water is growing and consequently organic extractables come out of ion exchange resins[.sup]1-3[/] are becoming a main problem. Table 1 shows the ultrapure water quality target for semiconductor manufacturing in Japan.[.sup]4[/] ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 1.

Shinoda, Sangyo Kikai, Jan. (1989) | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- Another problem is fluctuation in water quality mainly caused by ion exchange processes using regeneration type resins. Furthermore, regeneration of resins is required every several days and needs plenty of chemicals. An an effective solution to these problems, using ``two stage RO process'' and/or using RO for the post-treatment of ion exchange processes are proposed. The Second Stage Membrane Module in Two Stage RO Process Figure 2 [not reproduced] shows promising examples of a two stage RO process in the ultrapure water production system for mega bits LSI. The process uses RO membranes in two stage and is designed to remove ions, TOC and silica in the primary pure water system and acts as a substitution for the primary ion exchange process. The purpose of two stage RO process is to substitute regeneration type ion exchange process by RO. Therefore, the need for chemical regeneration and possible organic substances from ion exchange resin are eliminated. The resistivity of product water in this process is required 5-10 M_O_-cm. But until now it is ordinarily 1-3 M_O_-cm using conventional membrane modules such as SU-700 when the feed is typical tap water, owing to its low cation rejection at low feed concentration and insufficient removal of carbon dioxide. For the second stage membrane in such process, it is required high cation rejection at low feed concentration and effective removal of carbon dioxide. The principle of carbon dioxide removal is shown in Figure 3 [not reproduced]. In water, carbonic acid shows equilibrium among dissolved carbon dioxide gas, bicarbonate ion and carbonate ion. Since carbon dioxide gas dissolved in water cannot be effectively removed by RO membrane, it is necessary to make the raw water alkaline so as to convert the carbon dioxide gas to bicarbonate ion or carbonate ion, which can be effectively rejected by RO membrane. The carbon dioxide almost perfectly dissociates into bicarbonate ion and carbonate ion at approximately pH 9. Therefore, the pH of feed water is adjusted to be approximately 9 to greatly reject these ions by the RO membranes.[.sup]5[/] The electrolyte rejection of conventional fully-aromatic polyamide composite membranes, such as SU-700, from aqueous solutions containing more than several hundred ppm of electrolytes are extremely high. However, if the electrolyte concentration is lowered to several ppm such as the feed of secondary membrane in the two stage RO process, the electrolyte rejection of these membranes is usually reduced. Especially if the operation of the RO is carried out at an alkaline pH, cation rejection is drastically reduced. Therefore, high rejection of ions at pH 9 are required to attain the high resistivity value, and the elimination of silica and TOC is also expected. The requirements for the second membrane in the two stage RO process are as follows: 1) high cation rejection at high pH (ordinarily 9) 2) high bicarbonate and carbonate ion rejection 3) high silica and TOC rejection 4) low operating pressure We have developed the RO membrane module designated ``SU-900S'', which is based on fully-aromatic polyamide composite membrane but chemically modified by cationic functional group, and it has a high rejection of cation at low feed concentration and alkaline solution compared to SU-700, which is widely used as a primary RO module, and any other membrane modules. Figure 4 [not reproduced] shows the pH dependence of sodium and chloride ion rejection of SU-900S and SU-700 when the feed is 1 ppm NaCl. Figure 5 [not reproduced] shows the pH dependence of resistivity and sodium ion concentration of product water attained by the two stage RO process. The first membrane is SU-710 and the second membrane is SU-910S. There are two cases concerning adding points of alkali solution; one is at the inlet of the first membrane (process A), the other is at the inlet of the second membrane (process B). Feed water is tap water in these experiments and the inlet pH at the second membrane is accurately measured. The recovery ratio of the second membrane is 30 percent. In both cases, high resistivity of product water is obtained. In process A, the resistivity of product water becomes 7.5 M_O_-cm at pH 9, and 3.6 M_O_-cm in process B. In process B, because of a high amount of carbon dioxide in the feed to the second membrane, more alkali is needed to adjust the pH. By degasification of carbon dioxide the resistivity of product water will become higher. In the two stage RO process using SU-700 for the first stage and SU-900S for the second one, high resistivity of product water, which is equal to the primary ion exchange process (5-10 M_O_-cm), can be obtained. It may be difficult to measure the concentration of carbonate ion at low concentration, so we tried to calculate the behavior of ion concentration, pH and resistivity of product water as a function of the feed pH from the cation and anion rejection at 1 ppm NaCl feed. In this calculation, we calculated under the conditions that the feed is 1 ppm NaHCO[.sub]3[/] and NaOH is added to control feed pH, cation and anion rejection are 98 percent and 95 percent respectively. The result is shown in Figure 6 [not reproduced] compared with observed values. The calculated curve shows good fitting to the observed values. As the pH of feed water is increased (i.e., quantity of added NaOH is increased), sodium ion concentration of product water is also increased. On the other hand, the concentration of total inorganic carbon (TIC, due to dissolved carbon dioxide gas, bicarbonate ion and carbonate ion) is decreased because the rejection of TIC is increased as a result of the dissociation of dissolved carbon dioxide becomes larger at alkaline pH. The pH of product water is determined by the difference of concentration of sodium ion and TIC, and the pH of product water becomes approximately 7 when their concentrations become equal. And then the resistivity of product water attains to the highest value. RO Membrane for Post-Treatment of Ion Exchange Process Another application of RO membrane in the ultrapure water production system is the post-treatment of the ion exchange process. The main purpose of the RO is reduction of organic substances eluting from the ion exchange process, especially from the cartridge polisher, which is set in the final stage of the primary pure water system or in the subsystem. Therefore, high TOC rejection and special cleanliness without contamination by self-elution are required for the RO membrane modules. We have developed the RO membrane module designated ``SU-700P'', which is assembled with the best suited crosslinked fully-aromatic polyamide composite membrane and designed in view of the total clean system including the proper choice of materials and effective module structure with an internal flow path to eliminate stagnant space. Figure 7 [not reproduced] shows the start-up characteristics of TOC using SU-700P. In view of electrolytes and organic substances, low contamination by the module is shown by quickly reaching the value of ultrapure water (feed water) in which the level of resistivity is more than 18.1 M_O_-cm and the TOC concentration is 10-20 ppb. In the process using SU-700P as the post-treatment of ion exchange processes, an induction period to attain an original TOC level of feed water can be shortened to less than several hours, and the TOC level finally reached can be 8-10 ppb lower than the original TOC level of feed water concentration (10-20 ppb). In the typical ultrapure water production system, organic substances are eluted from ion exchange resins after regeneration of them. These impurities are electrolytes and nonelectrolytes. The former can be removed by a cartridge polisher, but the latter cannot be removed by a cartridge polisher or UF membranes. Only RO membranes can remove these nonelectrolytes. In this point, the RO module for post-treatment of the ion exchange process is able to act as a buffer and controls the concentration of TOC when organic substances elute from ion exchange resins. Conclusion 1. For the second membrane in the two stage RO process, we have developed the SU-900S RO module which has high rejection of cations at low concentrations and high pH. 2. For post-treatment of the ion exchange process, we have developed the SU-700P RO module which has high rejection of TOC and has a special cleanliness without self-elution. 3. We can prepare all of the RO modules that are applicable in the ultrapure water production system. References 1. F. M. Cutler, Ultrapurewater, 5(6) (1988) 40. 2. A. P. Emery, J. E. Girard and P.
