Guillin, who was of Mexican origin, died at the age of 57 on Friday and his remains will be transferred to Cuba, the embassy reported in a communique in which they stated they had sent their condolences to relatives in Cuba and Mexico. Guillin had come to Mexico two weeks ago at the head of a three-member delegation from the Cuban Education Ministry. "The official was due to return to Cuba today (Saturday) at the end of his mission," an embassy spokesman said. Guillin was 19 years old in December 1956 when he embarked on an expedition aboard a yacht that departed from the Mexican port of Tuxpan, Veracruz State, bound for Cuba to begin an armed struggle that ended in January 1959 with the rebel triumph. The expedition was led by Cuban President Fidel Castro.
