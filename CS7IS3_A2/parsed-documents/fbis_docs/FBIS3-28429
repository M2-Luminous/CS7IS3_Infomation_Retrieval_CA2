Regarding this, a spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry exposed the U.S. intentions behind the initiation of Radio Free Asia in his answer to the question raised by a reporter from the Korean Central Broadcasting Committee and strongly demanded its cancellation. This is a clear expression of our people's unshakable will to stop the infiltration of U.S. ideology and culture, and to protect our nation's sovereignty. It goes without saying that Radio Free Asia which the United States is trying to initiate is targeting our Republic and other Asian socialist countries. A byproduct of anti-socialist, anti-Republic strategic maneuvers, the U.S. Senate's passage of the bill on initiating Radio Free Asia is an intolerable interference into the internal affairs of our country and other Asian countries and a hostile, criminal act against them [uri narawa tarun asia naraduredaehan chamulsu omnun naejonggansobigo choktaejogin pomjoehaengwi imnida]. As is known, the United States turned its spearhead of attack to the Asian region in recent years following the waning of the Cold War era from the international arena and the frustration of socialism in some countries. The reason lies in the fact that there are numerous important strategic points, and abundant manpower and resources in the Asian region. With rapidly growing economies, many countries in this region oppose domination and interference by outside forces, and are constantly walking along the road of independence. The United States has declared the Asian Pacific region as a region of vital importance and interest in the 21st century, and is regarding our Republic and other Asian socialist countries as the stumbling blocks to the expansion of its sphere of domination. Based on this notion, the United States has focused its world strategy on the Asian region and attempted to set up Radio Free Asia, a tool for ideological and cultural infiltration, in addition to its military threat. Every country has its unique tradition and culture, and, accordingly, implements an independent broadcast policy in conformity with its people's taste and customs. However, the United States attempts to paralyze [mabi] the Asian peoples' ideological consciousness and create social chaos and disorder by spreading the U.S. life style and culture so as to demolish the Asian countries from within. Where else in the world could there be such a shameless and brigandish interference in internal affairs! The true intention of the United States in initiating Radio Free Asia is to infuse the so-called U.S.-style democratic values and the toxin of bourgeois ideology into our country and other Asian countries in order to crush [apsal] socialism in this region and demolish the independent governments there from within. However, this is a foolish and indiscreet act. The United States was able to effectively use all sorts of machination and propaganda with Radio Free Europe, under the command of the Central Intelligence Agency, to bring about the cave in and return to capitalism of former socialist countries in another region, but it will far from work with our country. We have the chuche idea, the great guiding ideology of the era of independence, the spirit of independence, and our-style of life. Clearly acknowledging the fact from their life experience that only socialism can provide genuine freedom and rights and ensure their abundant and happy life, our people regard the chuche socialism, in which the leader, the party, and the masses are wholeheartedly united, as their life and lifeline. If the United States thinks it can create the false image among our people and perpetrate social chaos and disorder with Radio Free Asia so as to topple the might of the socialism of our own style as it did in eastern Europe, it is grossly miscalculating. Many Asian countries strongly denounce the U.S. maneuvers to start broadcasting Radio Free Asia as interference into their internal affairs and a violation of the rules of international relations, and express their will to protect their tradition, culture, and consciousness from Yankee culture. If the United States initiates Radio Free Asia despite the consistent opposition and rejection of the people of Asian countries, it will gain nothing from it. The United States should immediately stop the game of initiating Radio Free Asia, a propaganda and machination organization aimed at ideologically disintegrating our country and other Asian countries. The Asian people, including our people, will resolutely confront the U.S. ideological and cultural infiltration, and the rascals' anti-socialist, anti-Republic strategic maneuvers will not be able to avoid failure.
