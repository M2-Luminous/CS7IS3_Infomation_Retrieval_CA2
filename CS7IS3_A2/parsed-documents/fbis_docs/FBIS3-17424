Implementation of the Federal Budget in the First Quarter of 1994 Analyzed"] [Text] The Russian Government has analyzed the conduct of the budget policy in the first quarter of this year and sent a note on the matter to the State Duma. This document notes in particular that state expenditure was funded mainly from tax revenue to the tune of 8.5 trillion rubles [R] and Central Bank credits to cover the deficit totaling R7.5 trillion. The issue of state securities provided the budget with R1.1 trillion. Another R1.6 trillion was collected from additional sources. As of 15 March, R13.1 trillion out of the R17.6 trillion expected during the first quarter had been allocated from the federal budget to fund expenditure. A priority sphere of state policy in the sphere of expenditure was the funding of measures ensuring the social protection of the population, and also giving support to individual sectors of the national economy. According to preliminary data, in the first quarter industry received R909 billion; R969 billion went into state investments; R1,109 billion into social and cultural measures; R3,627 billion into defense; and R1,077 billion into the law enforcement organs. Territorial budgets received considerable support -- R2,080 billion. Moreover government experts note that the 1994 budget is being implemented in the face of continuing negative trends in the economy: The decline in production is continuing, and reciprocal unpaid debts are increasing. For these reasons, tax payers are delaying the transfer of funds into the federal budget. During January-February, payments to the tune of R4.7 trillion came into the treasury. In March the total will not exceed R3.3 trillion. The extreme strain on the budget can in many respects be attributed to the poor financial discipline displayed not only by enterprises but also by certain Federation components. Thus, in January 1994 Bashkiria's [Bashkortostan's] arrears to the treasury were R52 billion, Tataria's [Tatarstan's] -- R37 billion, and Yakutia's -- R32 billion. Apart from that, over R20 billion of income from foreign economic activity was paid into territorial budgets, whereas these funds should have been paid into the federal budget in their entirety. According to the Finance Ministry specialists, the implementation of the budget in the first quarter can be called more or less stable. Neither the government nor the State Duma adopted decisions which might "blow up" the expenditure entries. This enabled the financiers not to go beyond the limits of the credit emission established by presidential edict back in 1993. At the same time, admittedly, it must be borne in mind that despite the promise given by the head of the Cabinet to settle accounts fully with the peasants and defense industry workers in terms of last year's debts (R4.6 trillion), it did not prove possible to do so. Millions of Russians have experienced for themselves the results of the moderately tough credit-monetary policy and the government's fairly successful maneuvers between the threats and demands of sectoral and regional lobbyists -- primarily through the reduction in the rate of inflation. As compared with January, the increase in prices in February-March fell to a record low of 9.9 percent. For the first time the increase in wages, which reached 10 percent in February, overtook inflation. The Finance Ministry experts call the relative regulation of the funding of the social sphere a second achievement. This should be understood to include the prompt payment of wages to people whose work is funded from the budget, a growth in social allowances for children and invalids, and support for institutions of higher education. It is noted in addition that the majority of expenditure on the social sphere is borne by local budgets, whose state is far from the optimum. The discrepancy between the local and federal income and expenditure entries in budgets is often the reason for "failures" in funding, which causes people rightful dissatisfaction.
