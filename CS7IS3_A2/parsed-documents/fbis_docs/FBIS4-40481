Luzhkov pointed out that an extremely tense criminal situation in the country and ways out of it are the most important problems faced by the city today. He pointed out that the situation in the city had acquired an entirely different character by now. Earlier, mafia structures used to settle scores between themselves, building up tension in the city without directly affecting the life of city residents, whereas today, the level of criminal activities not only expanded in scope, but acquired an entirely different quality. It affects major businessmen, bankers and other business people who are involved in the formation of new economy in the city. A recent statement made by the board of the "Logovaz" joint stock society in connection with an attempt on the life of its director general has exasperated the city authorities, Luzhkov said. Apart from prominent activists, major state and commercial agents, common people die, who have nothing to do with this but and who happened to be on the scene of the tragedy. "To transfer the police to a reinforced system of maintenance of law and order - this is what the new decree provides for," the mayor said. He pointed out that the city is prepared to meet the interests of the most important department for ensuring the city's well-being as never before: police stations are being provided with new premises and funds are being allocated, including hard currency, to provide the police with the necessary facilities and equipment.
