The decision on establishing the post of "the parliamentary undersecretary of state" in the Ministry of National Defense [MON] was made during the talks with the participation of Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk. Jerzy Milewski, National Security Office head and secretary of state in MON, did not take part in the last stage of the negotiations. The first deputy of the national defense minister has been in the hospital for a week now. "The possibility cannot be ruled out that the personnel decisions will be made as early as next Monday [28 February)," Colonel Wieslaw Rozbicki, MON spokesman, informed on 25 February. Jerzy Szmajdzinski, general secretary of the Social Democracy of the Polish Republic, Sejm deputy of the Democratic Left Alliance, and chairman of the Sejm Defense Committee, confirmed on 25 February that the agreement on the filling of the post of the "political" deputy minister had been reached with the MON leadership. In line with the procedures, the candidate for the deputy minister should be proposed to the prime minister by the minister. "There already exists a list of candidates for the portfolio of the deputy minister," said Szmajdzinski; he firmly denied that his name is on that list. "The Government Press Office is not in the habit of acting before things actually happen. We issue information about recalls and appointments that have actually been made in the government," we heard on 25 February in the Office of the Council of Ministers.
