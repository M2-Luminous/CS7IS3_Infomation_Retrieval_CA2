ACTION: Closure. SUMMARY: NMFS is prohibiting retention of Greenland turbot in the Bering Sea subarea (BS) of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management area (BSAI). NMFS is requiring that catches of Greenland turbot in the BS be treated in the same manner as prohibited species and discarded at sea with a minimum of injury. This action is necessary because the Greenland turbot total allowable catch (TAC) in the BS has been reached. EFFECTIVE DATE: 12 noon, Alaska local time (A.l.t.), June 8, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Michael L. Sloan, 907&hyph;586-7228. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The groundfish fishery in the BSAI exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the Fishery Management Plan for the Groundfish Fishery of the BSAI Area (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 675. In accordance with ยง675.20(a)(7)(ii), the Greenland turbot TAC for the BS was established by the final 1994 initial specifications of groundfish (59 FR 7656, February 16, 1994) and subsequent apportionment of reserve (59 FR 21673, April 26, 1994) as 4,667 metric tons. The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS has determined in accordance with ยง675.20(a)(9), that the Greenland turbot TAC in the BS has been reached. Therefore, NMFS is requiring that further catches of Greenland turbot in the BS be treated as prohibited species in accordance with ยง675.20(c)(3), effective from 12 noon, A.l.t., June 8, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994. Classification This action is taken under ยง675.20 and is exempt from OMB review under E.O. 12866. Authority: 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq . Dated: June 8, 1994. David S.
