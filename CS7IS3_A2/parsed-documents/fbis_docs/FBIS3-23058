In the notes, Alpha-66 warns that they will regard as military targets anyone anywhere in the world who visits Cuba, negotiates with the Cuban Government, or expresses support for this country. [passage omitted] Orestes Joubert, Cubanacan deputy manager in Granma Province, reports that Alpha-66 has threatened Canadian tourists who made reservations at the new Farallon del Caribe Hotel last year. [Begin Joubert recording] As we all know, this hotel was inaugurated in November after considerable hype. The number of reservations made in Canada in October was large. A large number of tourists were expected after November. Nevertheless, we found that this number had been greatly reduced because requests for visas for 40 percent of those who had made reservations had been turned down. We wondered about the situation. Through some Canadian papers we learned that a counterrevolutionary organization called Alpha-66 had unleashed a campaign against Cuba through newspapers and radio and television stations. Much to our satisfaction, however, this situation lasted only a few days. Since late December, 90 percent of the hotel rooms have remained occupied. [end recording] This is new evidence showing that Alpha-66 attempts to prevent everyone from coming to Cuba with the specific purpose, in this particular instance, of blocking one of the country's leading development sectors. They did not prevail, but this attempt can be added to the long list of actions against Cuba when an inquiry is opened.
