The incident, which occurred on 31 December at about 1100 PM in Mahotiere near Moron, erupted when the deputy, while participating in a dance, was taken to task by a group of opponents who were fired into action. The situation degenerated and came to blows. Deputy Jacinthe drew his gun and fired several shots. The young Rosemanette Jean-Louis, 16, candy seller, fell dead from a gunshot wound in the neck. Two other persons -- Celestin Lenet, 38, and Kettia Similien, 13 -- were also injured. We have learned from hospital sources that Celestin is in critical condition and will most likely not survive. Pursued by his detractors, Deputy Jacinthe took refuge in the Moron barracks. He was then transferred to Jeremie on 1 January. He is allegedly under police protection at this time. A reliable source, however, told us that the deputy was to enter Port-au-Prince on the night of 3 January, but we have not yet been able to verify this information. Signal is following the situation closely. As soon as we have further information, we will let you know.
