Guy] [Text] Umtata March 17 SAPA -- Former Transkei Justice Minister Tsepo Letlaka accepted his position as Eastern Cape premier designate for the Pan-Africanist Congress [PAC] at a lunch in Umtata on Thursday [17 March]. "The Eastern Cape region has a new problem of having the boundaries imposed by the World Trade Centre process without consulting the people in the region," he said. "Consequently the region is still divided on whether it should be divided into two -- Border/Kei and Eastern Cape." He said it also remained a sensitive issue whether the East Griqualand-Mount Currie-Umzimkulu area should be part of his region or kwaZulu-Natal.
