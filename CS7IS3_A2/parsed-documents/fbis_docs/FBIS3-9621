The prime minister believes his candidacy to be "professional, prepared, competent, and responsible" within this government, Kwasniewski said. The president's objections connected to the FOZZ [Foreign Debt Servicing Fund] affair are not substantive, and they are meaningless when confronted with official reports received by the prime minister from the prosecutor general and the head of the State Protection Office, which state that "there are no grounds why Rosati should not hold the highest government posts," Kwasniewski said. In his opinion, the president is once again "not showing proper interest in stabilizing the situation in the country." The argument that someone is working abroad and is involved there with the process of transforming the economies of West European countries just does not hold water, he added. "Everything is now in the hands of the prime minister," said Kwasniewski. He also assured his audience that Rosati would not make any hasty decision. Should the prime minister receive an official letter from the president, we will be dealing with a new situation, but this will be a situation between the coalition and the president, declared Kwasniewski.
