This tragedy worries all of us, and we mourn together the terrible loss of the victims. Even after this destructive event, the Armenian culture is rich and prospering, it shows excellent flexibility and courage. American Armenians have a great input in our progress and development as a country. Now, with creation of independent Armenia, headed by the President Levon Ter-Petrosyan, Armenian people are building democracy and contemporary economy in their own land with similar determination. Remembering the courageous soul of the victims of the tragedy of 1915, these important efforts are a sign of respect to their inheritance. As long as we dedicate ourselves to construction of a flourishing Armenia and lasting peace, I send my best wishes and insure my deep respect to everyone".
