FR940930-0-00074 FR940930-0-00013 Background and Purpose The Carteret County Chamber of Commerce, through the North Carolina Department of Transportation, asked the Coast Guard to change the operating regulations governing the Beaufort U.S. 70 highway bridge by limiting required bridge openings for commercial boats to one opening at the top of each hour, and for recreational boats to one opening at the bottom of the hour. To supplement this request, they provide copies of bridge logs which showed the bridge opened as many as eight times an hour for the passage of vessels during the summer of 1993. The Coast Guard also obtained traffic counts from the North Carolina Department of Transportation which showed average annual vehicle traffic counts of 20,000 per day during the same period. The current Federal Regulation for this bridge requires that it open every hour on the half hour from 7:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. for the passage of pleasure craft. During these same hours, the bridge is required to open on signal for all other vessels. From 7:30 p.m. to 7:30 a.m., the bridge opens on signal for all vessels. The numerous random openings of the bridge under this regulation were causing vehicular traffic delays and traffic safety problems. At times, bridge openings backed traffic up through the downtown area of Beaufort to the east and west Morehead City across the channel. The intent of the requested change was to reduce the number of bridge openings and improve the flow of highway traffic. The Coast Guard conducted an investigation into the operations of the bridge, consulting with the bridge tenders, the Mayor and City Council of Beaufort, North Carolina Department of Transportation officials and some of the local commercial waterway and highway users. The Coast Guard, in response to all comments received during our investigation, decided to pursue a more balanced approach than that originally requested by establishing a temporary deviation to the regulations and evaluating the results of that test schedule to determine if it resulted in a reasonable and beneficial compromise for both modes of transportation. The Coast Guard conducted the test for a sixty day period which provided three scheduled openings per hour for all vessels; the first at the top of the hour, the second at twenty minutes past the hour, and the third at forty minutes past the hour. The temporary deviation also extended the hours of restricted openings from the current 7:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. timeframe to include the hours of 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. This temporary deviation to the existing regulation was intended to establish a schedule that will meet the reasonable needs of the waterway users and at the same time reduce delays to and improve the flow of highway traffic crossing the bridge. The Coast Guard anticipated the test would show that the total overall number of bridge openings would decrease during the trial period as compared to the same period in 1993. Data collected by the North Carolina Department of Transportation from August 1, through August 19, 1994 showed that under the temporary deviation, the number of bridge openings during the hours of restriction was reduced by over 100 compared to the number of openings during the same dates and hours in 1993. North Carolina Department of Transportation traffic officials also stated they noted no significant highway traffic backups as a result of bridge openings during the test period. Although the Coast Guard has not yet received the additional bridge opening and highway traffic data collected by the North Carolina Department of Transportation during the remainder of the test period, all indications are that results will continue to show a reduction in the number of bridge openings and on improvement in the flow of highway traffic across the bridge. Based on the lack of complaints received during the test period, the positive written and verbal comments received on the test schedule by concerned interest groups, the demonstrated positive results shown through data collected from August 1 through August 19, and the unanimous request of all who have contacted the Coast Guard not to revert to the previous opening schedule, the Coast Guard believes it is in the public interest to continue the opening schedule used during the test period without interruption by publishing this interim rule. For the reasons above, it would be contrary to the public interest to revert to the existing regulation upon expiration of the temporary deviation and therefore, good cause exists for publishing this rule without prior notice and opportunity for comment, and making it effective in less than the 30 days after publication normally required. This rule should be effective immediately because it is in the overall public interest to do so, and the Coast Guard is not aware of any reasons not to.
