SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This proposed rule change is designed to adjust the PTO fees in accordance with the applicable provisions of title 35, United States Code, and section 10101 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (Public Law 101&hyph;508), as amended by the Patent and Trademark Office Authorization Act of 1991 (Public Law 102&hyph;204). Background Statutory Provisions: Patent fees are authorized by 35 U.S.C. 41 and 35 U.S.C. 376. A fifty percent reduction in the fees paid under 35 U.S.C. 41(a) and 41(b) by independent inventors, small business concerns, and nonprofit organizations who meet prescribed definitions is required by 35 U.S.C. 41(h). Subsection 41(f) of title 35, United States Code, provides that fees established under 35 U.S.C. 41(a) and (b) may be adjusted on October 1, 1992, and every year thereafter, to reflect fluctuations in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) over the previous 12 months. Section 10101 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;508) provides that there shall be a surcharge on all fees established under 35 U.S.C. 41(a) and 41(b) to collect $107 million in fiscal year 1995. For fiscal year 1995, the PTO has proposed appropriation language that credits directly to the agency all patent fee surcharges collected pursuant to sections 10101(a) and (c) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (Public Law 101&hyph;508). Under the proposal, the PTO will not request appropriations from fees deposited to the Fee Surcharge Fund as has been the practice from fiscal years 1991 through 1994. Subsection 41(d) of title 35, United States Code, authorizes the Commissioner to establish fees for all other processing, services, or materials related to patents to recover the average cost of providing these services or materials, except for the fees for recording a document affecting title, for each photocopy, and for each black and white copy of a patent. Section 376 of title 35, United States Code, authorizes the Commissioner to set fees for patent applications filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT). Subsection 41(g) of title 35, United States Code, provides that new fee amounts established by the Commissioner under Section 41 may take effect thirty days after notice in the Federal Register and the Official Gazette of the Patent and Trademark Office. Recovery Level Determinations: The proposed rule would adjust fees for a planned recovery of $571,439,000 in fiscal year 1995, as proposed in the Administration's budget request to the Congress. The patent statutory fees established by 35 U.S.C. 41(a) and 41(b) are proposed to be adjusted on October 1, 1994, to reflect any fluctuations occurring during the previous 12 months in the Consumer Price Index (CPI&hyph;U). In calculating these fluctuations, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has determined that the PTO should use CPI&hyph;U data as determined by the Secretary of Labor. However, the Department of Labor does not make public the CPI&hyph;U until approximately 21 days after the end of the month being calculated. Therefore, the latest CPI&hyph;U information available is for the month of April 1994. In accordance with previously proposed rulemaking methodology, the PTO uses the Administration's projected CPI&hyph;U for the 12-month period ending September 30, 1994, which is 3.0 percent. Based on this projection, patent statutory fees are proposed to be adjusted by 3.0 percent. Before the final fee schedule is published, the fees may be slightly adjusted based on actual data available from the Department of Labor. The proposed patent statutory fee amounts were rounded by applying standard arithmetic rules so that the amounts rounded would be convenient to the user. Fees of $100 or more were rounded to the nearest $10. Fees between $2 and $99 were rounded to an even number so that the comparable small entity fee would be a whole number. Certain non-statutory patent processing fees established under 35 U.S.C. 41(d) and PCT processing fees established under 35 U.S.C. 376 are proposed to be adjusted up to the three percent fluctuation in the CPI in order to recover their estimated average costs in 1995. Three patent service fees that are set by statute will not be adjusted. The three fees that are not being adjusted are assignment recording fees, printed patent copy fees and photocopy charge fees.
