Fleeing government soldiers and government-backed militias are continuously butchering innocent civilians. Mr. Edouard Karemera, first vice chairman of Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development and minister of internal affairs in the current Sindikubwabo so-called government, yesterday was blaming government soldiers who are revenging their massacred relatives by militias. He claimed that the government is not in control of militias. As minister of internal affairs, Karemera should be ashamed of this claim. Why doesn't he stop programs for the inciting of militias to kill civilians on radio RTLM [Radio-Television Libre des Milles Collines] and Radio Kigali? Does he also claim not to be in control of the two radios? Mr. Karemera should not deceive himself. This genocide which he has helped in planning and executing, like those of his clique, will weigh heavily on him. It is not peace that the so-called government of Rwanda wants, but more time to massacre the remaining people. One wonders how the Rwanda Government forces are committed to peace while they continue to massacre civilians behind their lines.
