President de Klerk discussed the controversial station's future with telecommunications minister, Piet Welgemoed, and Post Master General Ters Oosthuizen. They haven't issued a statement yet. Radio Pretoria was still broadcasting today four days after the supreme court had ordered the Afrikaner Kultuurbond [Cultural League] to get the station off the air. The Kultuurbond lodged an application this morning to appeal against the court order. A date for hearing the application has still to be fixed. At Radio Pretoria' Donkerhoek premises the station is guarded round the clock. Last week two officials of the Post Master General's Office were turned back at the gate. Mr. Oosthuizen says the officials did in fact have the necessary know-how for sealing the transmitter, but they were not allowed in.
