In the event that the personal conflict of interest does not become known until after performance on the contract begins, the Contractor shall immediately notify the Contracting Officer of the personal conflict of interest. The Contractor shall continue performance of this contract until notified by the Contracting Officer of the appropriate action to be taken. (d) The Contractor agrees to insert in any subcontract or consultant agreement placed hereunder, except for subcontracts or consultant agreements for well drilling, fence erecting, plumbing, utility hookups, security guard services, or electrical services, provisions which shall conform substantially to the language of this clause, including this paragraph (d), unless otherwise authorized by the Contracting Officer. (End of clause) 10. Section 1552.209&hyph;74 is added to read as follows: 1552.209&hyph;74 Limitation of future contracting. As prescribed in 1509.507&hyph;2(c), insert the following clause or alternate: Limitation of Future Contracting (ARCS) (May 1994) (a) The parties to this contract agree that the Contractor will be restricted in its future contracting in the manner described below. Except as specifically provided in this clause, the Contractor shall be free to compete for contracts on an equal basis with other companies. (b) The Contractor will be ineligible to enter into a contract for remedial action projects for which the Contractor has developed the statement of work or the solicitation package. (c) The following applies when ARCS work is performed under this contract and when both ARCS work and Field Investigative Team (FIT) work are performed on the same site under this contract: Unless prior written approval is obtained from the cognizant EPA Contracting Officer, the Contractor, during the life of the work assignment and for a period of five (5) years after the completion of the work assignment, agrees not to enter into a contract with or to represent any party, other than EPA, with respect to: (1) any work relating to CERCLA activities which pertain to a site where the Contractor previously performed work for EPA under this contract; or (2) any work that may jeopardize CERCLA enforcement actions which pertain to a site where the Contractor previously performed work for the EPA under this contract. (d) The following applies to FIT work at sites under this contract where only FIT work is performed, except for those sites where EPA has made a determination of ``no further remedial action planned'' (NFRAP): Unless prior written approval is obtained from the cognizant EPA Contracting Officer, the Contractor, during the life of the work assignment and for a period of three (3) years after the completion of the work assignment, agrees not to enter into a contract with or to represent any party, other than EPA, with respect to: (1) Any work relating to CERCLA activities which pertain to a site where the Contractor previously performed work for EPA under this contract; or (2) any work that may jeopardize CERCLA enforcement actions which pertain to a site where the Contractor previously performed work for the EPA under this contract. (e) The Contractor agrees in advance that if any bids/proposals are submitted for any work that would require written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into a contract subject to the restrictions of this clause, then the bids/proposals are submitted at the Contractor's own risk. Therefore, no claim shall be made against the Government to recover bid/proposal costs as a direct cost whether the request for authorization to enter into the contract is denied or approved.
