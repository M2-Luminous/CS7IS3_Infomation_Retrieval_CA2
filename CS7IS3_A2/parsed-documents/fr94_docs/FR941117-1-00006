FR941117-1-00006 FR941117-1-00002 Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 1. Reason for Action: The changes to Part 2 of the Commission's Rules proposed herein are for use of the spectrum that is being reallocated from Federal Government to non-Government use. This reallocation of spectrum is required by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. 2. Objectives: The Commission seeks to allocate the spectrum for services that present the greatest potential to provide benefit to the public by providing for the introduction of new services and the enhancement of existing services. These new and enhanced services will create new jobs, foster economic growth, and improve access to communications by industry and the American public. 3. Legal Basis: The legal basis for these rule changes is found in Sections 4(i), 303(g), 303(r), and 332(a) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. §§154(i), 303(g), 303(r), and 332(a). 4. Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Other Compliance Requirements: No reporting, recordkeeping, or other compliance requirements are proposed in this item. 5. Federal Rules Which Overlap, Duplicate or Conflict With These Rules: None. 6. Description, Potential Impact, and Number of Small Entities Involved: Many small entities could be positively affected by this proposal because the allocations proposed will foster new technologies, resulting in new jobs, economic growth, and improved access to communications by industry, including small entities. The number of small entities that will be affected is unknown. 7. Any Significant Alternatives Minimizing the Impact on Small Entities Consistent with the Stated Objectives: This Notice of Proposed Rule Making solicits comments on a variety of alternatives. Additionally, all significant alternatives presented in response to the Notice of Inquiry in this proceeding have been addressed in this Notice of Proposed Rule Making. 8. Paperwork Reduction: This proposal has been analyzed with respect to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 and found to contain no new or modified form, information collection and/or recordkeeping, disclosure or record retention requirements and will not increase the burden hours imposed on the public.
