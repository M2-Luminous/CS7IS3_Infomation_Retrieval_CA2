Do you expect the special summit to be more than just a big media spectacle? [Paye] I think it is very good that President Clinton has convened this conference. The special summit is useful just because it directs public attention to a problem, for which the alarm bells have been ringing here in Europe for years. The governments increasingly now are trying to find recipes against unemployment. [Berschens] So far, they, particularly in Europe, have not had a lot of ideas. [Paye] We in Europe are paying the bill now for the fact that politicians and partners to the wage negotiations believed in growth far too long. Until the end of the 1980's, it was assumed that the high growth rates of the 1950's and 1960's could be reached again. As a result, one continued to be generous with wage raises, with pensions, and with the services of health insurance. The expansion of the social net has made the European economies increasingly inflexible, even though they should be more flexible than ever -- in view of the racing technological progress and the rising pressure of international competition. [Berschens] What do the Europeans have to do? [Paye] They must abolish negative developments in the tax system and in social security. In some countries, excessive ancillary wage costs prevent the employers from hiring people. It also happens that an unemployed person earns more in net terms than if we were working. Why should he then look for a new job? In addition, there is the abuse of social services. The labor exchange office, for instance, would have to cancel unemployment benefits if the recipient refused to accept an appropriate job. [Berschens] Your proposals harbor the danger that the poor will get even poorer. [Paye] There is no doubt that the necessary structural reforms require great sacrifices from parts of the population. Certainly, those affected must not be simply dropped. If these people get the feeling they are hopeless losers, then we will be facing a social explosion sooner or later. Therefore, state and society must help the people to react flexibly to new requirements on the labor market, above all through improved training and retraining. [Berschens] You want the state to pursue a more active labor market policy, to reduce payroll tax, and to take over part of the ancillary wage costs. At the same time, however, you demand a reduction of the budget deficits. How is this going to work? [Paye] If the state wants to get the money back from another source, it would be conceivable to raise value-added tax or the energy taxes. As a third alternative in our report, we suggest an increase in capital-yield tax.... [Berschens] ...which would immediately provoke capital flight, as in Germany after the introduction of the withholding tax. [Paye] Any tax increase harbors risks. By the way, the danger of capital flight would be clearly lower if all 24 OECD states could decide to take such a step together. [Berschens] The unemployment rate in the United States is clearly lower than in the European states. Do the Europeans have to imitate the U.S. hire-and-fire system? [Paye] The direction is correct, but the Europeans cannot go as far as the Americans. In times of an upswing, the U.S. system works like a machine that produces jobs. This is also due to the enormous mobility of the Americans regarding jobs and distances. In Europe, however, there will always be a denser social net than in the United States. [Berschens] Really? The French have just introduced minimum wages for adolescents, which is almost as much as social welfare in Germany. [Paye] I have four children. For them, it would still be better to work for a low salary than to be unemployed. In the long run, one cannot pay the people above the level of their productivity, unless society expresses sufficient solidarity. [Berschens] Unemployment in Germany will continue to increase more strongly and for a longer period than in other European states, according to the OECD forecast. Have the Germans in particular committed many mistakes? [Paye] The influx of hundreds of thousands of immigrants and ethnic Germans from abroad has put a great strain on the German labor market. In addition, the country has not yet overcome the shock of reunification. The economy is suffering under the high state debts and the pressure of inflation. Here I think the other Europeans have to share responsibility. [Berschens] Are you saying that the British and the French should have contributed to paying the costs of unification? [Paye] Of course, something like that is easier said than done. The French may have understood this more easily than the poorer Irish, Spanish, or Greeks. Nevertheless, it was a mistake to leave the country with the strongest economy and with Europe's key currency alone with the shock of reunification, in particular since everyone had to suffer from the German policy of high interest rates. The Europeans would have been better off if the burden had been shared right from the beginning.
