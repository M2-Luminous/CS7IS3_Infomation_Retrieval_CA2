Shijiazhuang is the capital of Hebei Province in north China. The new customs depot includes two warehouses and a whole range of services regarding imports and exports, commodity inspection and quarantine. Customs officials said that goods passed by the depot will travel direct in sealed railway trucks and containers to their customers in Russia, Hong Kong, Macao and South-East Asian nations, without needing to go through other Chinese customs formalities further along their route. Goods on their way to Russia, north and East Europe via the Euro- Asian Continental Rail Bridge can also clear their custom formalities at the depot, said the officials. It is understood that the opening of the facility will greatly help Hebei Province's 400 state-owned firms and 4,300 joint ventures with direct import and export businesses. The officials believe that some enterprises in the neighbouring Shanxi and Henan Provinces will also choose to export their goods via the new customs depot.
