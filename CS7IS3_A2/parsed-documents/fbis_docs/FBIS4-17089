Such a plan can be hammered out in a relatively short period of time, said international mediator, Lord Owen, here on Wednesday [20 April] evening. He arrived in Moscow on Wednesday together with Thorvald Stoltenberg for talks with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev. According to the co-chairman of the coordination committee on the international conference on Yugoslavia, many Serbs want peace and would be ready to approve a concrete plan as an alternative to war. The Vance-Owen plan contained appropriate proposals. This document needs some supplements, taking into account agreements on setting up a federation of Bosnian Moslems and Croats and the talks on Serb Krajina in Croatia. It is necessary to set up a mechanism which would enable representatives from the U.N., the EU, Russia and the U.S. to meet on a confidential basis and to agree positions. Incidentally, they do not differ much. Owen explains the absence of Washington's immediate reply to the invitation to participate in quadripartite consultations by the attention given by American politicians to the request of U.N. Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali to continue military pressure on Bosnian Serbs. Owen said that part of his delegation will remain in Moscow to continue consultations with the Russian Foreign Ministry. It is necessary, the international mediator stressed, that "the four" should meet as soon as possible.
