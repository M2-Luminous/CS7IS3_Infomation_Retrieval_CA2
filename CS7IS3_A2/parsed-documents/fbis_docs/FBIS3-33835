[Talabani] We have freed ourselves from the Iraqi tyranny and this gives us the strength to resist, the strength to bear all difficulties. [Hoffmann-Ostenhof] For how long? [Talabani] Forever. Certainly, the economy is very bad. But there are also rays of light. Thousands of Kurdish villages that were destroyed by Saddam have meanwhile been reconstructed. The people are returning to the rural areas and they are beginning to produce food again. Last year we had enough grain, rice, vegetables, and fruit. [Hoffmann-Ostenhof] Iraqi Kurdistan is surrounded by countries that do not exhibit any sympathetic feelings for Kurdish democracy -- in Turkey and in Iran there are also large Kurdish minorities. And the West does not want Iraq to crumble and chaos to develop. [Talabani] In order to avoid chaos, our autonomy must be preserved. We will defend ourselves against any attack on us -- this will then lead to chaos. Iraq can remain united in the long run only as a democracy. [Hoffmann-Ostenhof] Or under a strong dictator. [Talabani] No. A strong dictator has just lost. Saddam has split Iraq. Now everybody is fighting everybody else: Sunni against Shi'ite, Sunni against Kurd, Turkmen against Arab. [Hoffmann-Ostenhof] When your people fled from Saddam Husayn's army, the world paid attention to the Iraqi Kurds. Now international attention is rather directed toward the Kurds in Turkey and watches Ankara's armed struggle against the guerrillas of the Workers Party of Kurdistan, PKK. [Talabani] Turkey must remain unified. However, Kurdish rights must be accepted in this framework. If Turkish propaganda pretends that there is only the PKK problem, it just helps this organization. It becomes popular. [Hoffmann-Ostenhof] Do you feel solidarity with the armed struggle of the PKK? [Talabani] Of course, we have differences with the PKK. We want nothing to do with its Marxism-Leninism. We do not agree with its tactics in Western Europe. We believe that a popular struggle is more effective than the occupation of embassy buildings or airline offices. Above all, we believe that it is not a realistic demand to divide Turkey. [Hoffmann-Ostenhof] Occasionally you meet Mr. Ocalan, the leader of the PKK. Do you then recommend that he give up the armed struggle? [Talabani] No, but I urge him to look for political solutions. Last March he announced a unilateral cease-fire. Unfortunately, there was no positive response the other side. Ankara did not want to negotiate. The end of this cease-fire was a tragedy -- 32 Turkish soldiers were massacred. We condemned that. [Hoffmann-Ostenhof] Ocalan is a Stalinist. Can one actually negotiate with him? [Talabani] Certainly. One can hold a dialogue with anyone in the world. You saw how Mr. Rabin shook Mr. 'Arafat's hand. And a short time ago it was inconceivable that Her Majesty's prime minister would talk to the IRA. Why should this not be possible in Turkey? Mr. Ocalan has indicated to me through mutual friends that he is willing to make peace. Whether you like Ocalan or not: He heads the biggest Kurdish movement that has ever existed in Turkish history. One cannot ignore that.
