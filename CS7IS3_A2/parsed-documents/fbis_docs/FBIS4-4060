One of the major counter-measures is to set up an unemployment warning line, according to Zhang Xiaojian, head of the Employment Department of the state's Labor Ministry. The official said that the warning line will be determined in light of the jobless rate, mass layoffs and the economic targets of various localities. A special organ headed by the labor departments will be set up in order to take charge of organizing counter-measures to cut the unemployment rate. Zhang revealed that the government will promulgate a series of relevant laws and regulations for the purpose of supervising or penalizing enterprises when they conduct illegal layoffs. The enterprises should set up a declaration system for releasing redundant personnel and have to pay placement fees when conducting mass layoffs. According to the official, the government will still issue administrative orders to prevent enterprises from firing aged working staff. As for the enterprises whose assets cannot offset debts, yet which are still hopeful of being rescued, the concerned departments will help to pull them through difficulties, so as to avoid bankruptcy and large-scale layoffs. To help curb the growth of unemployment, the enterprises have to confine rural recruitment within strict limits and give priority to those people who have lost their jobs. Moreover, according to the official, the state will set up unemployment insurance funds at central and provincial levels. He said that when the unemployment rate in certain localities surpasses the unemployment warning line, they may take advantage of the central and provincial funds to make up for local fund shortages. As for the bankrupt enterprises, the concerned government departments will ask the enterprises to appropriate special funds out of their remaining assets as relief aid to the unemployed staff. Zhang, the leading official charged with resolving the state's unemployment problem, attributed the serious unemployment state to the radical transformation of economic structures and the sharp contradiction of labor supply exceeding demand. Zhang expects the number of the unemployed to reach 5 million by the end of this year. He stressed that it will be still possible to contain the jobless rate within 3 percent.
