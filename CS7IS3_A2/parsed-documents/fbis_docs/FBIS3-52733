TISHRIN says: It is clear that all Israeli provocations are part of a carefully-studied plan to cast doubts on the usefulness of the Syrian-U.S. summit, which the entire world views as important and extremely vital for activating the peace process and ending the current stalemate. Regional developments have shown the falsehood of Israeli arguments that the Syrian and Lebanese tracks of negotiations are unimportant. These arguments have proven to be baseless. This is because events have shown that Syria's role is crucial, and that it is impossible to achieve peace in the Middle East without Syria's involvement or participation. It was no coincidence that U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher announced in occupied Jerusalem in the aftermath of talks he held with Rabin and Peres during his recent tour of the region that the United States is interested in achieving a comprehensive and durable peace in the Middle East, and that Syria demonstrated genuine and serious cooperation with the efforts to achieve peace. What nurtured the Americans' convictions regarding the need to achieve comprehensive and just peace were the deadlock reached by the Gaza-Jericho accord, as well as the deterioration of the overall situation in all occupied territories. TISHRIN affirms that Israel is preparing for war, rather than peace. It is not unlikely that Israel will mobilize the Zionist lobby in the United States and the West to bring pressure to bear on the U.S. Administration to make it back down on the objective of achieving just and comprehensive peace. Likewise, it is not unlikely that Israel will exacerbate the situation in southern Lebanon and the region. For Israel believes that peace must result in the endorsement of its expansionist plans and settlement ambitions. It is looking forward to swallowing up the Golan, Jerusalem, and most occupied territories, the paper argues. The paper believes that the impudence of Zionist settlers has reached the limit when they said that President Clinton does not have the right to discuss the issue of the occupied Golan. This is a serious development, particularly since the Golan issue has, since 1967, continued to be debated by the world community, not to mention that this community has passed several resolutions on it, all of which called for Israeli withdrawal from the Golan. The paper believes that Israel and Jewish settlers are robbing the world community of its prerogatives and responsibilities. By so doing, the settlers are posing a serious threat to the entire world community. Concluding its commentary, TISHRIN says: The Golan is Syrian territory, and will remain so. No single Zionist settler will experience comfort or peace as long as the Golan is occupied. Moreover, regional peace is contingent, first and foremost, upon a complete Israeli withdrawal. Indeed, there can be no peace unless this withdrawal takes place. Under the headline "The Credible Syrian Positions," the newspaper AL-THAWRAH addresses the same issue, saying: The regional developments that have been unfolding since the signing of the Oslo agreement have proven beyond any shadow of doubt that any unfair agreement is doomed to failure. Moreover, any agreement that is not comprehensive is unviable. For, as the regional conflict is an indivisible whole, and as the occupation of the Golan, southern Lebanon, and the other occupied Arab territories is an indivisible whole, the solution itself is an indivisible whole. The conclusion of separate deals, as well as claims that there is a need to delay progress on some tracks to allow for digesting an agreement on a single track are useless. Syria has warned against the consequences of accepting separate deals, regardless of the television stunts and the high-falutin words and terms used to promote them. Israel's policy is to promote separate deals to foment inter-Arab divisions, hold on to the occupied territories, or, at least, part of them, blackmail Arab sides one at a time, and undermine the foundations of just and comprehensive peace, which is not in the interest of Israel's aggressive plans. Concluding its commentary, AL-THAWRAH says: Undoubtedly, the Syrian position is the mainstay of the full-blown Arab position in terms of preparation and coordination. This position is necessary for proceeding with the peace process to achieve a comprehensive and just solution, which is firmly advocated by Syria. Syria will not allow Israel to torpedo the components of just and comprehensive peace, particularly since the entire world in general, and the United States in particular are well aware that the achievement of peace is contingent upon a complete Israeli withdrawal. Likewise, they are well aware that Syria cannot bargain over this principle. Under the headline "Various Means To Achieve The Same End," the newspaper AL-BA'TH says: The Israeli rulers' current positions have shown that their daily jargon is divorced from any frank or clear handling of the facts and terms which could result in the achievement of true peace in the region. These rulers have persisted with their acts and practices, which are bound to torpedo the peace process, although the entire world community has reached the conclusion that separate and partial agreements cannot produce peace, nor even help achieve security and stability, and defuse conflicts and disputes in the Middle East. The paper adds: The Israeli rulers have continued to circumvent substantive issues in the peace process to turn this process into empty slogans, which they are using on the international scene to obtain huge funds under the guise of developing the Palestinian territories and launching what they call a new Middle East, in which Israel would have the upper hand. By so doing, Israel seeks to be in a position to control the region's resources and destiny, and determine the fate of its future generations. The paper goes on to say: We in Syria have always been sincere in our efforts to achieve just and comprehensive peace. Similarly, we have been sincere in our respect for international legitimacy and its resolutions. Given this sincerity, we are extremely concerned about the foundations of the peace process. We also want to restore our territories and rights. The Israeli rulers, as well as the U.S. Administration, which launched the peace initiative, are well aware that it is impossible to achieve peace in this region as long as Israel continues to reject the principle of trading land for peace, and to oppose the implementation of the relevant UN resolutions. Concluding its commentary, AL-BA'TH says: Syria will always remain willing to cooperate with any international endeavor to achieve just, comprehensive, and honorable peace in the region. But, under no circumstances will it accept the version of peace that would result in abandoning rights, territories, and dignity.
