Kuchma-Grinev Bloc Conference Begins"] [Excerpt] The first All-Ukraine Conference of the Interregional Bloc of Reforms [IBR] created by former parliament speaker Volodymyr Grinev and Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma started work on 21 January 1994 in Kharkov. The objectives of this event were clearly defined by Volodymyr Grinev: first, to create an organ that would coordinate the activities of regional structures of the IBR. Second, to draw up program-concept documents that could be offered to voters. Third, to set a date for the next conference, which would determine the optimum line of conduct for candidates for election as people's deputies. Grinev, who read out a report, clearly defined the IBR's strategic line -- orientation to the regions because it is they that come to the fore in the real processes taking place today in Ukraine, while "the sum of the center's errors has exceeded the level beyond which these errors constitute a threat to the state." Grinev defined as one of the IBR's main tasks "to transfer managerial cadres from the regions to the center." According to Grinev, the bloc's banner should be order and a market system in which a market-based economy based on the inviolability of private property would function in full measure, and state authority would efficiently control all the processes in society. Volodymyr Grinev motivated his point of view by the fact that Ukraine would yet for a long time have this peculiar dualism: the coexistence of the private and government sectors of the economy. Grinev also defined three main principles of the interregional bloc's activity. First is a market-based economy which is supposed to pass the three stages: financial stabilization, privatization, and structural adjustments. Second, the development in Ukraine of a multinational state which would realize the interests of the entire population rather than those of some ethnic groups. Third, Ukraine should proceed from the fact that it is a strategic and geopolitical ally of Russia. This strategic alliance, according to Grinev, consists in the fact that Ukrainian goods would for a long time find only Russian markets, and Ukraine and Russia can and should act as stabilizing factors in Eastern Europe and to assist its speedy integration in European processes.
