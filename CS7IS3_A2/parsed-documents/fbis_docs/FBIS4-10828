In a message at the first meeting of Latin American presidents, including Spain and Portugal, in Guadalajara, Mexico, in 1991, Cuban President Fidel Castro stressed the significance of that meeting being the first one to gather Latin American heads of state and government without being convened by the White House. Regular meetings have followed since July 1991 with the succeeding summits of Madrid (1992) and Salvador Bahia, Brazil (1993), conveying the unpostponable need for integration and regional unity on the brink of the year 2000. The Caribbean Basin has not been excluded from the integration process, thanks to the creation of the Association of Caribbean Nations, which will soon hold a summit of heads of state and government. Initiatives that exclude the United States, at a time a united Europe is emerging as a powerful economic rival, might have motivated President William Clinton to revive the old idea of the inter-American summits, tried for the first time almost 40 years ago in Panama and coinciding with the 130th anniversary of the Amphictyonic Congress called by Simon Bolivar. A general, Dwight D. Eisenhower, occupied the White House in 1956, while for John Foster Dulles, who was then secretary of state, his obsession was to try and contain what he called Soviet expansionism in Europe, and with this same outlook dealt with the neighboring subcontinent at the First Inter-American Summit. These were the years of splendor in Hollywood, the years of absolute U.S. leadership in the steel and automobile industries. South of the Rio Grande, dictators, armed and backed by Washington, led the destinies of numerous countries as if they were administrators of U.S. ranches. These realities are offensive 40 years later, but are nonetheless absolute truths. A brief review of those who attended the Panama meeting in 1956 confirms the presence of nine generals and two colonels. The list would have been longer if Peruvian dictator Manuel Odria, General Gustavo Rojas Pinilla from Colombia, Gen. Paul Magliore of Haiti, or members of the Honduran military junta had attended. Men who evoke sad memories for Latin America sat beside Gen. Eisenhower -- dictators who were some of the most faithful U.S. allies stood out -- Fulgencio Batista (Cuba), Anastasio Somoza (Nicaragua), Rafael Leonidas Trujillo (Dominican Republic), Marcos Perez Jimenez (Venezuela), and Alfredo Stroessner (Paraguay). The second summit called for by Lyndon Johnson and held in 1967 in Punta del Este, Uruguay, was no less flattering, with four of the five South American generals. They represented Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay. Bolivian Gen. Rene Barrientos did not attend, and Haiti was represented by Francois Duvalier. The noticeable U.S. interest in this meeting was to strengthen its failed Alliance for Progress and create an atmosphere of confidence with memories of the 1965 Dominican Republic invasion still fresh. Johnson proposed to Latin Americans what he called a rational development program to reach "a dream of a renewed America" for the decade of the seventies. Twenty-seven years after the Punta del Este summit, Washington still pursues the old postwar national security doctrine fostered by the White House, which served to prop up the area's military regimes and dictatorships. But now the national security doctrine attempts to attain agreement in its foreign policy, interpreted as a hegemonic concept of democratic and economic development as well as internal security for the area. Also left behind is Ronald Reagan's Caribbean Basin Initiative and the Brady Plan -- tariff reductions for Latin American products and a reduction of the government debt through privatization of state enterprises, respectively. For Washington and for South Americans, former President George Bush's "Enterprise for the Americas Initiative" today too is a dead letter. Now the question is what new proposal will the United States make in the area of trade and financing. For the time being, following President William Clinton's summons, he is known to want to open "a new era in Inter-American relations," according to his own words. The U.S. President's probable bait will be the approval by the U.S. Congress of NAFTA between Canada, Mexico, and the United States, the main trump card to show visitors. The Latin America that will be at the Miami summit will be a Latin America wishing to find solutions to its scourge of social inequalities, economic crises, and administrative corruption, situations that are a contradiction to the very essence of the weak democracies. Despite this, the Latin American countries are beginning a slow integration process, the only route to solving their pressing problems, a joint unitary effort that has marked the steps of a difficult path. If the intention is to improve inter-American relations, it is impossible to exclude any peoples of the area from these summits. For U.S. Senator Jose E. Serrano, who is of Puerto Rican origin, no area leader can be excluded if one wishes to speak of consolidating democracies. And for those who oppose Cuba's presence at the Third Inter-American Summit, the congressman says that no country on the subcontinent has the same system of government, and he asks himself: What is true democracy?
