Entrusted by the provincial government, Cui Zhikang, director of the provincial statistics bureau, made public economic development in Anhui Province: Last year, in the course of establishing a socialist market economy in Anhui, while further emancipating our mind and deepening opening up, we witnessed rapid growth in the national economy; the overall economy showed the most rapid growth, greatest vitality, and most sound development since reform and opening to the outside world. According to preliminary estimates, the gross national product for the whole year topped 94 billion yuan, an increase of 22 percent over 1992, and higher than the national growth by about 9 percentage points. Anhui has already been ranked among provinces with relatively rapid economic growth. In 1993, there were three salient features in the economic operations of the province: By Seizing Opportunities, our Economy Shows Rapid Growth -- Industrial production saw the most rapid annual growth since 1978. In 1993, the total industrial output value of the province reached 140.2 billion yuan, up 44.6 percent over the previous year; of which industrial output value at and above township level reached 94.9 billion yuan, up 26 percent over the previous year, bringing our national ranking from the 14th place in 1992 to the 12th place in 1993. Along with industrial growth, economic efficiency improved markedly. Total sales of industrial products reached 95.5 percent, up 0.8 percentage points over last year. Income and profits, and taxes from sales of industrial products are estimated to have grown by 42.1 percent and 90 percent respectively. -- Agricultural production reaped an all-around bumper harvest. Since last year, the central government has issued a series of measures in a bid to improve agricultural production and develop the rural economy. These, along with various other factors such as favorable climatic conditions, price hikes for grain and other farm and sideline products, reduction of peasants' burdens, and cash terms for purchases of farm and sideline products, have provided a favorable environment and external conditions for enhancing agricultural production. Initial estimates indicate the total agricultural output value for the year will reach 41.7 billion yuan, an increase of 8.5 percent over the previous year, which would be far higher than the average yearly growth of 2.8 percent achieved during the Seventh "Five-Year Plan." Total production of grains, edible oil products, and silkworm cocoons all registered their highest levels of growth, while cotton and aquatic products neared their highest levels in history. -- Investments showed robust growth. Investment in fixed assets by state-owned units totaled 17.17 billion yuan, up 42.6 percent over last year. Of this, investment in infrastructure realized 10.03 billion yuan, up 40.3 percent; and investment in renovations and transformation accounted for 6.26 billion yuan, up 42.6 percent. A large number of infrastructure projects in communications and transportation, as well as on key raw materials were completed and put into operation. Construction of a large number of infrastructural projects, including the Chang Jiang Bridge in Tongling and the Hefei-Jiujiang railway, which have a bearing on the overall situation, made good progress. Construction of a number of raw and semi-finished materials projects, including the Anqing acrylic nitrile and Tongling cement plants, were quickened to further build up Anhui's strength for further economic development. -- Steady increase of market sales. The total volume of retail sales reached 39.17 billion yuan, up 15.9 percent from 1992. -- Rapid rise in the income of urban and rural residents. Per capita income of urban residents was 2,025.7 yuan, up 24.8 percent, or 9.1 percent after deducting price rises; that of peasants was 724.5 yuan, a net increase of 151 yuan and the biggest since the introduction of reform and opening up, or an increase of 9.4 percent after deducting price rises; and the average wage of workers of state-owned units reached 3,095 yuan, up 20.8 percent from 1992, or 5.6 percent after deducting price rises. Residents' savings deposits have increased markedly. At yearend, the balance of savings deposits by urban and rural residents throughout Anhui was 34.181 billion yuan, or 8.518 billion yuan more than at the beginning of the year. Vitality for Economic Growth Increases Continually -- Gradual invigoration of the internal mechanisms of state enterprises. In 1993, we conducted active and fruitful experiments on transforming the operating mechanisms of state enterprises, strengthening property rights, and establishing a modern enterprise system. For example, we achieved notable results in introducing the share-holding system to large and medium state-owned enterprises, in instituting the contracting and management of deficit-ridden state enterprises by nongovernment sectors, in allowing superior enterprises to absorb inferior ones, in inducing foreign capital to upgrade domestic industries, and in auctioning small state enterprises. So far, 377 enterprises have implemented the standardized share-holding system. The successful issuing and listing of stocks of the Meiling Enterprise, Anhui Energy Corporation, and Maanshan Iron and Steel Company has not only helped these enterprises expedite the pace of transforming operating mechanisms and become better known, but also raised over 7 billion yuan to accelerate the development of enterprises. -- Versatile ideas for developing the rural economy. Guided by market-oriented agriculture, we have made headway in readjusting the agricultural structure while the principle of stressing "high yields, high quality, and high efficiency" has brought about sweeping changes in traditional agriculture. Noteworthy is the new road of transferring surplus rural labor, pioneered by 4 to 5 million peasants from Anhui at the beginning of the year. Judging from actual results, the exodus of peasants did not have an adverse effect on agriculture but slightly increased the province's revenue. Moreover, some peasant laborers, who acquired new knowledge and learned technical skills while working in the coastal regions, have played an active role in local economic development. -- Vigorous development of non-state economic sectors. In 1993, non-state economic sectors, with village and town enterprises as the mainstay, have expanded rapidly. The annual total output value of village and town enterprises is expected to set a record 110 billion yuan. In terms of growth rate, while it took Anhui only two years to increase the total output value of village and town enterprises from 30 billion to 110 billion yuan, it took such coastal provinces as Jiangsu and Zhejiang from three to five years. -- Flourishing export-oriented economy. The total volume of foreign trade exports was $960 million, up 16 percent from 1992. The total supply of foreign trade goods increased 43.6 percent over the previous year. A total of 1,040 new Sino-foreign ventures, cooperative ventures, and solely-foreign funded enterprises were approved, the largest number since the introduction of reform and opening up. The actual amount of foreign capital utilized was $370 million, up 160 percent from the previous year. -- Flexible macroeconomic regulation and control. Since last June, we have conscientiously implemented the central authorities' Document No. 6 in a timely manner, and carried out macroeconomic regulation and control in the light of realities in Anhui. We have refrained from demanding uniformity in implementation, adopted realistic measures to curb the overheated economy in localities as deemed necessary, and conducted structural readjustment while keeping the same scale of currency issuance, loans, and investment, thereby maintaining a good momentum for economic growth and warding off economic upheaval. Macroeconomic Regulation and Control Yields Positive Results -- Noticeable alleviation of "bottleneck" constraints. The production of major energy, and raw and semi-finished material products has increased. The output of raw coal was up 6.6 percent, while that of electricity generated, rolled steel, and cement were all up by more than 10 percent. Raw coal, rolled steel, cement, and timber in stock were basically able to meet demand. Meanwhile, prices of capital goods began to drop sharply. In the second half of 1993, the index of purchasing prices of major capital goods registered an average increase of 23.8 percent [sentence as published], or 10 percentage points lower than the margin of increase in the first half of the year. -- Fairly rational investment structure. In 1993 investment in the tertiary industry province-wide rose 61.5 percent, increasing its ratio to the total investment in capital construction to 42.8 percent from 37.1 percent of the same period of 1992. Investment in such basic industries as energy, raw and semi-finished materials, transportation, and posts and telecommunications accounted for 68.2 percent of the total investment in capital construction, or 70 percent if allocations for improving investment environment were included. The rate of allocating funds for key state construction projects also rose sharply. -- Conspicuous increase in financial revenue. The annual financial revenue totaled 7.32 billion yuan, up 32.8 percent from 1992, thus ending the stagnant situation, in which the revenue amounted to some 5 billion yuan for four successive years since 1989. All 16 prefectures and cities overfulfilled the annual budgeted revenue, with most of the prefectures and cities registering an increase of more than 20 percent. -- Improved financial order. Anhui's efforts to rectify financial order brought about a turn for the better in the banking situation. Savings deposits have increased by a wide margin. As of the end of 1993, the balance of savings deposits throughout the province was 49.4 billion yuan, or 8.2 billion yuan more than the figure at the end of June. Currency supply has gradually returned to normal. The total volume of currency supply in 1993 rose 45 percent over the previous year, while currency withdrawn from circulation was up 47.1 percent. The rate of reserve funds has also returned to standard. Cui Zhikang also discussed a number of contradictions and problems in Anhui's economic life. They are mainly high price rises, poor economic efficiency, and a shortage of funds.
