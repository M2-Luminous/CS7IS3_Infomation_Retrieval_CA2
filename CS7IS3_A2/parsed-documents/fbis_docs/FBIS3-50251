Prior to his talks, he gave an interview to MAGYAR SZO, the paper of Vojvodina Hungarians. Arpad Madarasz reports from Novi Sad. [Madarasz] It is a fundamental interest of the two neighboring peoples to live in peace and good-neighborliness with each other, the Hungarian foreign minister told the Novi Sad paper MAGYAR SZO. Geza Jeszenszky stressed that Hungary wishes to have friendly relations with every southern Slav people, and from the beginning of the crisis it has been striving to establish well balanced ties with each successor state of the disintegrating Yugoslavia. First of all, I would like to see and experience personally how people live in Yugoslavia today and how it feels to be a Hungarian in Vojvodina, said Jeszenszky. He added that he does not expect spectacular results from the visit and talks. However, he expects us to confirm that it is our mutual determination to improve interstate ties gradually, step by step, taking the possibilities into consideration, to restore confidence. The Hungarian Government supports the autonomy concept of the Democratic Community of Hungarians in Vojvodina [VMDK], but it does not regard it as its task to discuss this with the Yugoslav Government, Geza Jeszenszky pointed out. However, he said he is pleased to learn that President Milosevic has invited [VMDK leader] Andras Agoston to attend the talks.
