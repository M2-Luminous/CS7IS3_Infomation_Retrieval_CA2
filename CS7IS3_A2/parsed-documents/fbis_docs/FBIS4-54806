Presidential Spokesman Valentin Stoyanov reports on the main topics discussed during the talk: [Begin Stoyanov recording] There are no political differences between the two countries. This is a prerequisite for intensifying relations between the two countries, especially in the trade and economic sphere. We hope that this will be achieved. President Zhelev asked Alatas to influence the Islamic Conference Organization to drop the Bulgarian Turks issue from its agenda. This issue has been on the organization's agenda for several years already. This is a a total anachronism, because the rights of the Bulgarian Turks have been fully restored. They are among the members of the parliament and in the organs of the municipal power, and it appears that the whole issue is now obsolete. Alatas promised to raise the issue during the organization's next session in Tunisia, because, according to him, the organization has other more important issues that it must resolve.
