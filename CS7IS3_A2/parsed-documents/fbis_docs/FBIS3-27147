However, Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic and Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic told the press after the meeting that the two sides had become much closer in their positions. They described the negotiations as "very positive" although problems still exist. They also said they were more confident of finding a solution to their conflict. Both sides agreed to continue their talks next week. The two sides told the press that today's meeting was about the future constitution of Bosnia, cease-fire between Croatians and Muslims and humanitarian issues. But neither Granic nor Silajdzic disclosed the details of their talks. However, Croatian Embassy Spokesman Zarko Plevnik said before the meeting that one topic would be a new map dividing Bosnia between Croats, Muslims and Serbs. According to Granic, the two sides will first hold meetings at experts' level in the Croatian capital of Zagreb and then summit talks. Silajdzic expressed the hope that the negotiations would be resumed after three or four days.
