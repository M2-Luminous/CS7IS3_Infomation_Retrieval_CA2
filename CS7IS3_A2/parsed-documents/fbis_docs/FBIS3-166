The message was in connection with developments in the Bakassi peninsula. State House Correspondent Chris Ngu reports: [Ngu] General Abacha told a four-man French delegation, led by Mr. Bruno Delaye, President Mitterrand's adviser on African affairs and ecology, that Nigeria's concern in the disputed Bakassi peninsula is the security of Nigerians who form 96 percent of residents of the area. The head of state explained that the presence of Nigerian soldiers there is to prevent clashes between communities in Akwa Ibom and Cross River states, both in Nigeria. He restated Nigeria's commitment to peaceful coexistence worldwide. On claims and counter claims of authority over the peninsula, Gen. Abacha told the delegation that evidence of history showed that the disputed area for long had Nigerian presence in the form of a police post. Not only that, several census exercises have been conducted in the area by Nigerian authorities. The head of state reaffirmed his belief that the dispute could be resolved amicably without foreign assistance. Mr. Delaye had explained that French paratroopers were in the Cameroon only to honor the defense pact between France and the Cameroon. Mr. Delaye and Nigeria's foreign affairs minister, Ambassador Babagana Kingibe, later walked into a waiting party of State House correspondent. Mr. Delaye was not forthcoming with answers to questions. That way he left Nigeria's foreign minister to do the talking.

[Kingibe] Mr. Delaye, who is the special adviser to the president of France, accompanied by his delegation, has come to see the head of state with a message from the president of France conveying to the Nigerian authorities the observations of the French authorities on the ongoing situation in the Bakassi and on the general relationship between Nigeria and France. I think that is .... [pauses] Mr. Delaye said he had very useful discussions during his visit to Abuja and I think that they will now go towards a resolution of the problem in the way that will be satisfactory to all concerned. Well, at least there is a determination in that commitment on both sides, it seems, but definitely on our side, for a peaceful resolution of the problem through dialogue. And there is this proposed summit of the two heads of state to which we were looking forward and for which we were prepared and the sooner this summit takes place, the sooner we will find our way forward towards finding a solution.
