In spite of the cold wind from the north over the need to march in step with Beijing -- and competition posed by Shanghai, Pudong and myriad upstarts -- Hong Kong's favourite province looks set to preserve what American economics guru Ezra Vogel calls its No. 1 status. In return for a relatively free hand to experiment with quasi-capitalistic market tools, however, Guangzhou has to make concessions to the cadre mandarins in the capital in economic, and particularly, political matters. At the current Guangdong People's Congress, provincial leaders have unveiled a growth target for this year of 15 per cent, well above the national average of nine per cent. Local economists say this is an underestimation aimed at allaying Beijing's fears for hyperinflation and runaway capital construction. Individual cities, however, have openly vowed to maintain if not better their fantastic development clips of 1993. These range from 23 per cent for Guangzhou and an incredible 96.9 per cent for Huadu, where the new Guangzhou International Airport would be located. Equally important, Guangdong leaders have obliged Beijing to tone down tax policies -- mainly the "dual tax system" and the Value-Added Tax (VAT) -- aimed at boosting contributions to central coffers. When the fiscal reforms were promulgated late last year, Beijing was unequivocal about the fact they would be implemented on January 1, and that provincial authorities would have no autonomy to make local variations. In a briefing to a group of Hong Kong editors last weekend, however, Guangzhou mayor Li Ziliu hinted that Beijing had vouchsafed the province a "stable transition" of at least two years from the original "financial contract responsibility system" (FCRS) to the dual tax system. Under the old regime, Guangdong made a mutually agreed-upon contribution to Beijing, which took into consideration its need to retain more of its profits for re-investment. The new system, which will carve out tax bases for the centre and the localities, will give Guangdong no such edge. Mr Li claimed that the synthesis between the FCRS and the new tax regime will result in both central and local coffers getting more. Guangdong officials have also assured Hong Kong and other overseas developers that, Beijing's strictures notwithstanding, there will be subtle regional variations to the VAT to be imposed on property deals. Mayor Li had this to say about the much-feared VAT on real estate: "Guangzhou will take into account practical realities and pay attention to dovetailing the new taxes with the old ones with a view to safeguarding the interests of investors." Translation: Guangdong officials will ally themselves with foreign investors in lobbying Beijing to acquiesce in modifications that will benefit all parties. In spite of Beijing's recent emphasis on "boosting macro-level adjustment and control," Guangdong has made new strides in quasi-privatisation. Last year, exports from enterprises with foreign participation overtook those from state concerns. Mayor Li disclosed that all government-owned business units in his city will be converted into "Western-style" corporations within two years. Most of Guangzhou's money-losing state enterprises, which have assets amounting to 8 billion yuan, will be overhauled through means including their conversion into shareholding companies where workers and overseas investors can hold large stakes. With its aggressive strategies of attracting foreign funds to hitherto taboo areas including airport construction, Guangdong's lead over the rest of country in the creative utilisation of non-Chinese capital is widening. Perhaps most important to the long-term prosperity of the "before-the-times" province, Guangdong has undertaken a number of relatively sensitive political reforms. For example, the legislative session this week is open to a record number of citizens, including the bosses of private businesses. The congress is also set to pass a landmark Law of Supervision that will vest powers in the provincial and municipal legislatures to "oversee and supervise" the work of the government, the courts and the procuratorates. For the first time, the congresses can summon officials to explain policies or account for dereliction of duty. Guangdong is also a pace-setter in the fight against graft. A number of cities have established anti-corruption or clean-government organs that are partially modelled on Hong Kong's Independent Commission Against Corruption. Pronouncements by provincial leaders this past week have also made it clear, however, that Guangzhou has made major accommodations with Beijing. In deference to Beijing's revival of the old ideal of "taking grain as the key link", Guangdong will follow the national trend by laying down specific targets for the production of rice and wheat. To preserve arable land, the area of new industrial development will be cut by at least 10 per cent this year. Investment in agriculture will also increase substantially. It is unlikely Guangzhou can succeed in persuading Beijing to let it assume overall responsibility for "national-level" projects like the new airport. Beijing has foisted more serious political baggage on Guangdong with the imperative of building "spiritual civilisation," a tattered euphemism for strengthening one-party dictatorship and weeding out "all-out Westernisation". In his report to the congress, Governor Zhu Senlin toed the harsh line by reiterating the "firm with both hands" policy meaning that political control will be boosted in tandem with economic liberalisation. Largely following Beijing's initiative, ideological police in the province have since late last year launched a ruthless crackdown on a dozen-odd publications for propagating "bourgeois liberalisation". Reports in the Hong Kong and Taiwan press said that punishments had been meted out to the media including the Nanfang Weekend [NANFANG ZHOUMO SUPPLEMENT of NANFANG RIBAO], Tourism Trend, Hope, Culture Square, the Dongfang Evening News [DONGFANG WANBAO], the Star [English-language newspaper published in Shanghai], the Guangdong-Hong Kong Information Daily [YUEGANG XINXI BAO] and the Guangzhou Youth Paper. The new war against "Western spiritual pollution" contradicts not only the nascent spirit of political reform but also Guangzhou's commitment to integrate its economy with the capitalistic world.
