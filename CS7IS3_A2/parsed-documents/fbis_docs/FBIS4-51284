On may 26 President Clinton announced his decision to extend China's MFN status for 1994-1995 and to delink future annual MFN reviews from the human rights issue. "We welcome President Clinton's decision, which accords with the fundamental interests of the two countries and peoples," the spokesman said. He said that the MFN treatment that China and the United States grant to each other is a reciprocal and mutually beneficial arrangement. It is the core of bilateral trade agreements and serves as the foundation stone for bilateral trade relations. China has consistently opposed linking MFN with non-trade issues or attaching conditions or requirements, said the spokesman. The Chinese Government always attaches great importance to Sino-U.S. trade relations, and it has made major efforts for the maintenance, improvement and growth of such relations, he said. The actions the U.S. side has taken in the past few years in connection with the MFN issue has done harm to bilateral trade and the overall relations between the two countries, and the peoples of the two countries. U.S. entrepreneurs and a great number of consumers especially have expressed their concerns and worries, the spokesman said. "We welcome the positive efforts that the U.S. side made to change this situation " said the spokesman. "But," he said, "we have to point out with great regret [shi fen yi han 0577 0433 6695 2013] that, while announcing the renewal of China's MFN status, the U.S. side stated that the existing sanctions against China would be maintained." The spokesman expressed the hope that the U.S. Government would, proceeding from the fundamental interests of the two countries and peoples, remove all sanctions against China, so that Sino-U.S. trade relations can enjoy smooth and healthy progress. He pointed out that the current situation offers a historical opportunity for the enhancement of Sino-American relations, especially bilateral trade relations. "We believe that so long as both sides, on the basis of mutual respect equality, and mutual benefit, adopt positive measures and eliminate the artificially imposed obstacles, the trade relations between China the U.S. will be further developed," the spokesman said.
