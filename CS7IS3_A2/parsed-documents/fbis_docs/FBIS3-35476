Consultations are currently taking place among the group's leaders to choose one of the fugitive members to assume the post in Egypt. The candidate who has the best chances is Rif'at Zaydan, commander of the military wing in Asyut, who has been leading the terrorist operations there and was Tharwat al-Hajjaj's right-hand man in Asyut. He is considered the most capable among the group's members to assume the post after having managed to avoid being captured by the security forces in the past two years and to carry out all the terrorist operations with his group, which includes Ahmad Sanusi, 'Abd-al-Nabi Husayn, and Jamal 'Abd-al-Hamid. Rif'at Zaydan is from Dayrut. He assumed the command of the military wing after Jamal Huraydi, commander of the Manshiyat Nasir massacre, was arrested and after Ahmad Zaki al-Sharif was killed in the Firyal Company incidents in Asyut.
