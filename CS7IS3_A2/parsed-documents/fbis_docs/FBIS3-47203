Sen. John Rockefeller IV said in a meeting with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa that the U.S. Congress will focus its attention on a meeting between President Bill Clinton and Hosokawa scheduled for February 11 as a "checkpoint" of bilateral trade ties, the official said. The Democratic senator elected from West Virginia also reportedly said the U.S. legislature hopes the two leaders can chart a new future course for U.S.-Japanese trade relations at the planned talks. The statement apparently means the U.S. Congress wants some progress in trade negotiations between Washington and Tokyo, which are being held under the bilateral trade framework agreement reached last July. While acknowledging the importance of progress in the trade negotiations, Hosokawa touched on the need for efforts from both sides, the official said. Calling Clinton and Hosokawa reform-oriented leaders, Rockefeller said he is pleased with Hosokawa's emergence as a new leader in Japanese politics and that he wants to be a friend of the premier, according to the officials. Rockefeller told reporters after the meeting that his talks with the premier were "just a private conversation."
