FBIS4-6966 "dreas080_a_94016" FBIS-EAS-94-080 Daily Report 25 Apr 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan `Accord-Building' Process Ignored `Accord-Building' Process Ignored OW2504180594 Tokyo KYODO in English 1743 GMT 25 Apr 94 OW2504180594 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text]- The announcement came several hours after the socialists cast their ballots for Hata in a prime ministerial nomination vote in both chambers of the Diet. Hata swept to power on the strength of 274 votes in the lower house, defeating Yohei Kono, president of the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). The SDP, with 74 members in the lower house, held six cabinet posts in the government of Morihiro Hosokawa, Hata's predecessor as premier. The strength of the coalition excluding the SDP stands at 182 seats, compared with the 206 of the LDP in the 511-seat lower house. Asked by a reporter whether the SDP will withdraw support for a policy platform accord inked on April 22 by the seven coalition partners, Murayama replied, "We will no longer be bound by the agreement." The agreement calls for cooperation in such key policy fields as the proposed imposition of a new indirect tax and Japan's response to the issue of Pyongyang's suspected development of nuclear weapons. The accord followed two weeks of tough coalition horse-trading designed to reconcile sharp differences in key policy fields, a prerequisite for launching a new coalition government. "It is outrageous for a certain political party or an individual to have destroyed the current combination of coalition parties while ignoring the process of the accord-building," Murayama said, apparently referring to the Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]-led conservative mainstream. The sudden flare-up of a coalition standoff delayed the formation of a new cabinet by Hata, who was expected to announce his new ministers Monday [25 April] evening. The coalition stripped the LDP of its 38-year lock on power last August. The new parliamentary caucus, named "Kaishin (Innovation)," comprises Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], the Japan New Party, and the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), as well as two splinter groups that recently defected from the LDP -- the Liberal Party and Kaikaku no Kai. Including former Labor Minister Toshio Yamaguchi, an LDP rebel who is now an independent, the parliamentary strength of the new group is 130, dwarfing the SDP's 74 seats. The SDP apparently perceives the sudden convergence of five political blocs as a move aimed at accomplishing a proposal by the Shinseito-led conservative mainstream to create a new unified party, political analysts said. Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa and his Komeito [Clean Government Party] counterpart Yuichi Ichikawa originally proposed such a convergence to defeat the LDP in an upcoming general election under the newly-legislated electoral system, which has introduced a mix of single-seat constituencies and proportional representation. The move suddenly gathered momentum when DSP Chairman Keigo Ouchi told party legislators the coalition parties should initiate such a parliamentary group to create a "firm support base" for the Hata administration. The DSP leader was earlier one of the chief critics of such a move. Ouchi later told a news conference, "The reason why we have to establish the parliamentary group to back the new prime minister is to facilitate the implementation of the nine-point policy platform agreed upon by the coalition parties." Ouchi also said, "We need to consolidate the parliamentary base to support the prime minister and we put together parties that could quickly agree to the convergence as it is hard to enlist all the parties immediately into the new group." The new parliamentary group "Kaishin" also plans to entice Komeito with 52 lower chamber legislators into its folds, coalition sources said. In a related development, Ouchi told reporters that the coalition partners will appeal to the SDP to drop its decision to leave the coalition. The selection of new cabinet ministers will follow a meeting of the leaders of coalition parties, who will start their discussions on Tuesday morning. Ozawa, leaving the premier's official residence in a limousine, told reporters he and other coalition leaders will assemble at 10 A.M. [0100 GMT] to discuss the situation.
