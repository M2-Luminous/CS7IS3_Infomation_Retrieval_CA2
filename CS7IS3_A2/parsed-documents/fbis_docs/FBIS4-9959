The treaty will expand their economic exchange as of 1995. Salinas de Gortari and Calderon signed the document at a ceremony in Los Pinos presidential residence after the Costa Rican president's arrival in Mexico for a two-day visit that will end tomorrow. Costa Rica is the first Central American country to sign a free trade agreement with Mexico. The latter is holding similar negotiations with Nicaragua, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras. "This treaty will allow a greater flow of commerce and investments between our countries" and will strengthen the ties of friendship and cooperation between Mexico and Costa Rica, Calderon said in a speech he gave at the event, which was also attended by Salinas de Gortari. Calderon said: "The 21st century begins for Costa Ricans" with the signing of this treaty. He said the agreement represents "a great step toward" Costa Rica's future integration into NAFTA, signed by Canada, the United States, and Mexico, which has been in effect since January.
