FBIS4-36223 "drnes109dd_94001" FBIS-NES-94-109 Daily Report 6 Jun 1994 Palestinian Affairs `Reliable Sources' Cited on 'Arafat's Poor Health `Reliable Sources' Cited on 'Arafat's Poor Health JN0706105594 Amman AL-MAJD in Arabic 6 Jun 94 p 1 JN0706105594 Amman AL-MAJD Arabic BFN [Text] AL-MAJD has learned that President Yasir 'Arafat's state of health is not reassuring. He is suffering from irregular heartbeats, fever, and acute influenza, in addition to a deteriorating morale and nervous system. Reliable sources told AL-MAJD that 'Arafat's health is more serious than declared and that his aides are extremely worried about his health although they downplay the seriousness of his illness in their public statements. 'Arafat's entourage was split over his treatment. One team proposed transferring him to the al-Husayn Medical Center [in Amman]. Another team proposed summoning a French medical team to treat 'Arafat in Tunis and thus keep his critical health condition a secret. 'Arafat, weakened by the plane crash in the Libyan desert, has recently been exposed to many psychological and political pressures which exacerbated his health condition and greatly sapped his strength. One of his aides told AL-MAJD that 'Arafat's fear of the self-rule experiment, the opposition forces' firm refusal to participate in the National Authority, and the failure of Europe, America, and Japan to provide him with the promised billions, in addition to the abstention of many personalities from supporting him and sharing power with him, have made him susceptible to anxiety, sleeplessness, constant tension, and loss of balance and concentration. The close aide added: What can Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] do when he finds that his closest companions like Faruq Qaddumi, Khalid al-Hasan, and Muhammad Jihad have disappointed and abandoned him? They object to his plans and refuse to accept any post he is proposing to them. Concluding, the aide said with a sigh: "I am afraid that Abu-'Ammar's proponents and opponents have started to think of the stage after him and of the need to fill the leadership vacuum expected after his departure."
