Trukhin, V.I. Filippovich, K.V. Filippovich, Eurasia Limited Partnership] [Abstract] The limitations on using available foreign CAD/CAM systems, e.g., DUCT-5, UNIGRAPHIX, etc., at most CIS enterprises with numerical control (ChPU) equipment and the difficulty of designing an individual postprocessor for each specific ``machine tool-numerical control system'' complex prompted the development of an off-line invariant postprocessor (AIP) designed for CAD/CAM programs for numerical control equipment. The AIP invariant postprocessor contains a library of 280 ready-to-use descriptors which encompass virtually the entire pool of machine tools at 350 CIS enterprises equipped of numerical control equipment. The use of the invariant postprocessor for the CAD/CAM system adaptation to numerical control equipment is cheaper than developing an individual postprocessor by fifty-to-hundredfold while the labor outlays for developing an individual descriptor vs. an individual postprocessor are lower by 100-200 times. The service personnel skill requirements can also be relaxed. The AIP has been adapted to the ANVIL-5000, DUCT-5.2, EUKLID, APT, MODAPT, and other systems whose processors have a CLDATA-file output. The invariant postprocessor has been implemented at a number of mechanical engineering enterprises in Russia.
