The differences between the big parties have diminished considerably, but the ranking has not changed. Therefore, in the midst of all the distress about the predicted losses, the PvdA [Labor Party] in particular can breathe again while the CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal] is experiencing the most difficult period of its existence. The outcome of the municipal elections are reason enough for the VVD [People's Party For Freedom and Democracy] and D66 [Democratic 66] to be satisfied, but not elated. They did win, but they attracted only half of the votes lost by the government parties. In particular D66's growth was smaller than what had been predicted in recent years. Therefore, the Democratic power base in the cities is narrower than what looked likely before the elections. The results are only of limited importance for the parliamentary elections of 3 May, but the present coalition looks certain to lose its majority. A third party will soon be necessary to be able to form a cabinet. Therefore, in the coming months the struggle will be dominated by the question of which party will finish second after the CDA. A section of the electorate is showing an increasing aversion to the minor differences between the main tendencies in Netherlands politics. This can explain the strong growth of GreenLeft, and the Socialist Party is also benefitting from this factor. It is regrettable that the extreme right is tapping into all forms of dissatisfaction, but the new councils will be able to combat them.
