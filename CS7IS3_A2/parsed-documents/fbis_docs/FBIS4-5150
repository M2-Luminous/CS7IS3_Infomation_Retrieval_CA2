The four items on the agenda of the Assembly meeting are: 1/ the message from Cambodia's king; 2/ the report by the National Assembly's Standing Committee; 3/ the discussion and decision on the invalidation of the status of the people's representatives and the validity of new assembly members; and 4/ other matters. Before the opening of the session, the third item attracted the most attention because it was expected that the Assembly would discuss the cases of 17 members who will leave the assembly as they are taking up public positions which are incompatible with the role of assembly members. The assembly was also expected to examine the validity of 17 new members. Due to differences in the views concerning the wording of the agenda, the third item was withdrawn. This difference of views stemmed from the words "invalidity of assembly members' status" which many members thought improper, as the wording seems to look down on those who are leaving the assembly. Objection was also raised concerning the fourth item over the wording "other matters." A large number of assembly members demanded to know precisely what these matters are. There were two conflicting views on the third and fourth items. A minority view held that the wording can be changed; however, the majority objected. This objection led to the withdrawal of items three and four and the meeting closed cheerlessly after listening to the king's message and the report by the National Assembly's Standing Committee. It is worth noting that Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh, first prime minister, attended this session but Samdech Hun Sen, second prime minister, did not, for health reasons. His Excellency Loy Simchheang, acting National Assembly chairman, said at this meeting that it was almost the day the meeting was due to open and yet the National Assembly's Standing Committee seemed to have found nothing of importance to include in the agenda...[ellipsis as published] This was probably why this session's agenda is so short. Earlier, it was expected that the immigration law, the new investment law, the press law, the bill on the Supreme Council of Judges, the 1994 state plan ... [ellipsis as published] would also be discussed at this session. However, what was planned and what some personalities have disclosed were not raised in the agenda of the second National Assembly's plenary session following a three-month recess. Some Assembly officials said that the fact that the session does not have any bills for the National Assembly to debate and decide upon was due to the delay in forwarding those bills from the government to the National Assembly's Standing Committee so that these can be included in the agenda. Analysts say that there seemed to be something hidden in this movement to object to the third item concerning the switching of Assembly members. An assembly member from FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] is of the opinion that this switching of Assembly members "is complex and that there is certainly no way out." However, what people did not expect was the fact that this issue has not even been resolved at its agenda stage.
