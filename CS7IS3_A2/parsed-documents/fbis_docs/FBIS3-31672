Our conference is one in a normal organizational series, but the prolonged economic crisis and especially the tense political situation that is seriously jeopardizing democracy, pluralism, and normal political life in the country give it the dimensions and importance of an extraordinary conference. One can see everywhere the tangible consequences of such a situation, in an unbridled and unprecedented war of words, in the persecution of political opponents, in political murders like that of Gjovalin Cekini in Shkoder on 14 January, down to the arrest and illegal and anticonstitutional detention in prison for political motives of the deputy Fatos Nano, our party's chairman. It is nevertheless to the credit and honor of the Socialist Party [PSSh] that, as a party whose symbol is a rose, it has been able to preserve a cool head and maintain its political balance, presenting itself at home and abroad as a mature political force, responsible for the nation's destiny, and with wide popular support. With a highly developed sense of dedication and tangible commitment to the progress of democracy in Albania, even though in opposition, it has continually sent out a message of understanding, tolerance and democratic cooperation. Here at our Second National Conference is a political force with credibility for the future. Our party now spreads throughout the country and includes, not just notionally but in reality, more than 100,000 members grouped in 3,720 party organizations. In 1993 alone, more than 3,000 new members were admitted to its ranks. The massive Eurosocialist Youth Forum and the Socialist Women's Forum, which give a truly democratic spirit to the PSSh's structures, are evidence of the party's present and future strength. The admission of our Eurosocialist Youth Forum as an observer at the Socialist Youth International is a deserved sign of appreciation and a joy for us all, for which we send our warm congratulations from the platform of this conference! We are nevertheless aware that successfully confronting the challenges of the times will in the future demand increasing attention to the party's standards and its work, calling for a party that will accompany diversity of opinion, a vigorous democratic life within its ranks, and a courageous commitment in all its structures with exemplary discipline and organization, very different from the models of centralist parties with a rigorous class character. We are determined to build on what we have achieved, in order always to have a party that is responsible for its duties and up to its well known option of democratic socialism. A New Political Settlement -- A Demand of the Times The political life of our country is marked by phenomena and contradictions that indicate an increasing restriction of the scope of democracy. The political struggle is being waged with great intensity, savagery, and a marked lack of dialogue and consensus, fraught with severe historical and contemporary prejudices. The Democratic Party [PD] is using a new class struggle as its main instrument for maintaining power. The PD strikes at diversity of opinion, the opposition, views that oppose or compete with those of the state, and all those who think differently accompanying all this with the outlines of a police state. The PD is responsible for the currently tense political situation in the country. Even though, for demagogy and political rhetoric, it does not hesitate to say "good morning" to the opposition, in reality it is attempting to paralyze every kind of opposition, including even the parties with which it is formally in coalition. The marked absence of will to create the political leeway for social compromise has led it into the absurd position of rejecting every other alternative and all forms of cooperation and tolerance. It is showing the mentality and practices of a one-party state everywhere and in almost everything. As a result, the PD can no longer conceal its failure as a political force that equated itself with democracy or hide its inability to correct itself and its lack of confidence, ideas, and solutions. Chill disillusionment and a mass flight from its ranks have become a growing protest against the many illusions that its spread with its promises and its programs. In an attempt to cope with its identity crisis, it is merely pursuing paths that deepen it further. Authoritarian centralism of power, a strengthening of the executive at the expense of parliament, the blockade of local government, and the creation of intermediary links in the shape of directorates appointed by and dependent on the central authorities are among the main signs of the crisis of the PD's government, as are the violations of democracy and the abuses of the people's free votes. The corruption of the members of government lifts them above the poverty of ordinary people, and cannot fail to be at the latter's expense. The PD's rule is now in political and institutional crisis, and it cannot emerge from this with the help of piecemeal repairs and patches, as the president is attempting to do with his aim of rescuing the PD's "top political command." The open subjugation of the judiciary to the executive and the party-state is another highly dangerous and very disturbing phenomenon in our society today. The forced approval through the use of majority voting cards of some antidemocratic laws such as 24-1, the Press Law, and the totalitarian-style amendments to the Penal Code add to this disquieting phenomenon. The violation of human rights and freedoms has become the most dangerous and disturbing phenomenon for our society. The mass dismissal of PSSh members and sympathizers from organs of the state and other institutions, even academic institutions, through the use of the antidemocratic 24-1 law, mass unemployment, court proceedings against journalists including members of the PSSh's forums, physical violence against some PSSh deputies, savage police terror and violence even inside police stations that has in some cases led to irreparable physical injury and even death, have become very worrying phenomena. Only in totalitarian states are counter rallies held, deputies are forbidden to meet their electorate, people are imprisoned for taking part in peaceful rallies and protests, or even just because they go to the cemeteries of the nation's martyrs, as happened on 29 November last year in Durres, Gjirokaster, and elsewhere. The radio and television have virtually closed their doors to the PSSh. For five months now, the police throughout Albania have been rejecting on the most absurd pretexts the PSSh's applications to hold rallies in city squares. The example of Tirana, where the police have refused nine applications by the PSSh Managing Committee (on the final occasion with an unprecedented demonstration of force) clearly demonstrates the significant and worrying narrowing of the scope of democracy in our country. The arrest and political imprisonment of Fatos Nano, PSSh chairman and People's Assembly deputy, marks the culmination of flagrant violations of human rights and freedoms. The manner in which he was accused, the time at which this charge was raised, his arrest a few days after the removal of his immunity and a few hours before the PSSh's peaceful and authorized rally, the replacement of two prosecutors in order to carry out the order for his arrest, his arrest by a newly-appointed prosecutor, his detention in prison under a harsh police regime, and the return of his file by the court because of lack of facts and evidence as a result of the investigating group's prior judgment of the case -- all these things show that Fatos Nano has been arrested as an opponent of the regime and has been imprisoned for political revenge and in order to attain definite political goals, to divide and liquidate the PSSh. However, such goals can never be attained, not today, and not tomorrow! This is our viewpoint. This is the will of the PSSh's members and supporters! The powerful support of more then 700,000 members of the Albanian electorate who gave their signatures for the release of Fatos Nano and the broad support of well-known democratic organizations in Europe that have considered the "Nano affair" a political matter are proof to us of the justice of our stand. On this basis, we have demanded and demand from this conference too Fatos Nano's immediate release. This is a legitimate and democratic demand, and not an indicator of any "passion for creating cults!" We have never identified the party with individuals, whoever they may be. This matter has for us the value and weight of a principle! Comrade delegates, faced with such a reality, the PSSh has played its vital and historic role for democracy as a constructive opposition, a force that expresses and defends broad social interests and an alternative that is well known in Europe. The PSSh is intensively struggling and working with legal means and democratic methods, not to bring back the old system, which failed and will never return, but to ensure the normal conduct of the transition and a changeover to a genuinely democratic society. In this sense, we as an opposition have not been the PD's "editors," but the "creators," of course not the only ones, of the Albanian political scene. Also, from the political struggle that has been waged so far, the PSSh has emerged more mature, more consolidated, and clearer in programing how its work is to be carried out. It now enjoys broad national and international support. We have never viewed the struggle between political forces, particularly between the two main ones, the PD and the PSSh, as a struggle between opposing systems or between mutually exclusive poles, but as a competition of alternatives and concrete solutions for the difficult problems of the transition. In our view, it has never been said that competitors should necessarily be each other's enemies. The PD leaders, especially certain extremist sections in its government, cannot manage to understand this. Certain representatives of these sections, who pay only lip service to pluralism, do not even flinch from such statements as "Albania will never again allow itself to be led by the PSSh," thus further inciting divisions among the people. On this occasion, we would like to return to the familiar principle that in a democratic country the opposition does not exist at the mercy of those in power, but is a legal and vitally important factor for the functioning of society and the defense of national interests and the basic values and principles of democracy. Whoever genuinely feels responsible for the country's fate must not behave demagogically with the opposition and must not resemble someone who "stabs you in the night and mourns you in the morning." It is precisely these developments that disturb people, who are increasingly asking what is going on, where are we heading, how we will get over this excessively tense situation, how democracy will be defended and developed, how the crisis will be brought to an end, and whether or not the road will be opened toward stability, economic revival, employment, higher labor productivity, and the living standards without which there can be no genuine democracy. In order to provide an answer to such reasonable questions, the PSSh today reemphasizes its political alternative. We aim thereby, first of all, to say "no" to confrontation, social tensions, the persecution of political opponents, corruption, and every other negative and antidemocratic phenomenon that threatens to become a social blight. Second, we give a powerful "yes" to a new political settlement in Albania, economic reform, democratic tolerance, pluralism, national understanding, social peace, and everything else that will assist Albania's dignified integration into a changing and developing world. We think that the country today finds itself in a phase when the overthrow of the old, failed communist system has on a political plane come to an end, and is irreversible. It therefore follows that the strategy of political tension and confrontation that the ruling PD persists in following is not only outdated, but also extremely harmful and dangerous, because a basic orientation toward carrying out the economic reform, and all that means, guides all the Albanian political forces today. That is why the foundation of our political alternative rests upon the conclusion that the basis of a secure and prosperous future requires the responsibility of all political forces, the compilation of an anticrisis program, and a strategy of economic and institutional reform, scientifically based and with broad social support. In order to achieve this, to further promote the establishment of a democratic society in Albania, and to unblock the economy, it is our belief that it must be admitted that the premature political and moral exhaustion of the PD regime is a real fact, and that it has become imperative to create a new political balance and a new formula for government. New elections! That is our demand today. That is our slogan of the day! We will struggle for these with democratic means, for the sake of democracy. Our demand for early elections at a time when the PD holds sway as an undemocratic force that admits no alternative, is neither anticonstitutional, antidemocratic, nor destabilizing, but in harmony with the dialectic of transition and the state of our institutions. We ask for elections for the sake of stabilizing the country, the defense of the country, and national affirmation. We see that such a thing is common practice in other countries, even in countries famous for their democratic traditions. The PSSh's demand to put the political forces to the test once gain is therefore not exceptional, and is hampered by no constitutional obstacle. Article 28, Item Nine of the Main Constitutional Dispositions provides for and permits the dissolution of parliament by the president and the announcement of early elections. Besides, in a period of transition such as this, there are many factors that prompt such an idea or could in practice lead to early elections. First of all, there is the economic factor, the economic crisis. When electors voted for the PD on 22 March [1992] with the motto, "Let's give the PD a try," they were thinking of the PD's promises to extract the country from its deep economic crisis and to create the necessary stability to pave the way for economic development. Of course, the PD's two-year period in power has not been enough to fully achieve such an aim. However, it is enough time for the electorate to see whether the government and its management for affairs are heading in the right direction, whether the government shows dedication, and whether it has placed able and uncorrupted people in positions of power. We must admit that people's massive disillusionment in the PD and its government is entirely well- grounded. This was evident on 26 July 1992, when local government elections were held, in which not only the majority of the electorate voted for the PSSh's candidates, but there was a significant increase in the number of people not going to the polls. Since that time, the pressure for change among the electorate has been rising, and we will not prejudge the issue by saying whether or not this is entirely to the benefit of our party. At the same time, it must be said that the balance of forces within the PD itself has changed, with the departure from it of the group of "motionists," who formed the Democratic Alliance, and most recently, the departure of a realistic right-wing group, which is expected to form its own party. Changes have also occurred within other parties that did not achieve parliamentary representation. Such changes cannot fail to bring not only confusion, if not a situation of crisis, to the Albanian parliament, but also a significant decline in its authority and effectiveness. The Albanian parliament today does not reflect the country's political and electoral balance. In response to these changes and this deep disproportion, and bearing in mind that the ruling party shows no readiness to cooperate with other political forces, especially of the opposition, in order to solve the many acute problems common to our society (and cooperation does not necessarily mean a government coalition), we have issued now well-known proposals: 1. Let the parliament approve as soon as possible the Albanian constitution, seeing this as a condition to guarantee the operation of all democratic institutions and mechanisms of the state and the judiciary, as well as for Albania's integration in the Council of Europe and other international organizations. We consider it necessary for the constitution to be subjected to the people's judgment and vote of confidence. Therefore, during the general elections, let the people also be given the opportunity to vote on the Albanian constitution. 2. Let a "roundtable" of parties start work in order discuss how to relieve the tension of the situation and to establish the equilibrium that has been so seriously upset. We think that the holding of early elections before this autumn would be the sole constitutional way to reach a new political settlement. For this, we propose the approval of a paraelectoral social pact that will ensure that the elections are held in a calm political situation. The General Management Committee thought of singling out these two demands from the others, not only in order to indicate their importance, but also to give the conference the opportunity to express its view of them, and to say whether we agree to put them at the center of our action program this year. We take the view that these two demands require a total commitment from us, from all the PSSh structures, the Eurosocialist Youth Forum, and the Socialist Women's Forum, in publicizing the PSSh's achievements as a political force that knows no generation gap and has the ability to govern because it knows how to cooperate and to give the best alternative, in sounding out the electorate through frequent and lively meetings, in drawing up draft programs that will be as concrete as possible, and in selecting able candidates who enjoy the voters' support and trust, etc. In the present situation, the General Management Committee also believes that the work of the PSSh parliamentary group claims priority, alongside cooperation with other political forces and such associations as those of the National Liberation War veterans, the war and labor invalids, the former prisoners and victims of political persecution, the Albanian Confederation of Trade Unions, and others. The PSSh again publicly declares that it respects every officially-recognized organization and association, because these are a product and necessary ingredient of democracy. It is open and ready to cooperate with them both locally and centrally. The nation and the development of the country, now as never before, require new and broad scope for cooperation and understanding among all representatives of society. We are open to dialogue and cooperation with all political forces on the basis of the principles of equality among parties, whether great or small; of mutual trust and respect accompanied by a concern not to turn differences into obstacles to cooperation but into impulses toward finding a common language on definite issues; and of noninterference of one party in the affairs of another. As so far, so in the future too, we will not hesitate, on the basis of these principles, to support just standpoints of the Democratic Alliance, the Social Democratic Party, the National Unity Party, the Popular Party, the Social Workers Party, the Agrarian Party, and even the PD and its government, just as we have always welcomed every standpoint of theirs that supports our alternatives, or criticizes them and presents other alternatives that are more realistic than ours. Such cooperation is to the benefit of democracy and the social peace that is so necessary, and does not constitute a kind of "anti-PD bloc," as the PD executive chairman hastened to call it. We use this opportunity to tell the PD that, if you feel isolated, you should look for the reason in your party and government, because finding room for cooperation is the ABC of a genuine democratic society, showing the ability of a political force to govern. Room for cooperation in a genuinely democratic society can and must be found, but this requires the will and tolerance on all sides. In particular, no political force must lack this will as far as the national cause is concerned. So far, the political parties and certain groups both "affiliated" and "nonaffiliated" have devised theories and have also organized some political activities on the subject of national conciliation and unification. The PSSh has also several times come out in favor of this splendid initiative. However, the influence of this initiative is not evident in our sociopolitical life. One can even occasionally notice the opposite. Our option is for all the pan-Albanian political forces to talk and to agree on two essential matters: first, a single national platform, and second, a long-term plan of action to realize the national cause. The time has come to put an end to this centuries- old delay, and for the Albanian political parties, all together, to take up the banner of pan national consensus as the first step toward national unification. The Social Market Economy -- The PSSh's Priority Alternative Almost three years ago, when the Albanian economy was at the nadir of its crisis, the PSSh's program aimed to achieve two main goals: the stabilization of the economy and its orderly and carefully-considered transition to a social market economy. However, as is well known, political developments brought the PD to the leadership of political life in Albania, and the PD represented and began implementing its economic program based on the famous theory of "shock-therapy." We do not say that there have been no successes at all during its two years in power. We appreciate the work done to draft and approve legislation that aims to establish a market economy in our country. Another positive feature has been the creation of a new class of businessmen who are increasingly assuming importance in the economic reform. The reining in of the inflation rate, although accomplished mainly by administrative rather than effective economic methods, has been a step that should be followed by other more effective ones. However, we think that these and a few other achievements are first of all a result of the fact that Albania has now embarked on the road of irreversible transformations, and all Albanians and all political forces have been involved in them. Second, these achievements are not such as to justify the euphoria and demagogic exaggeration of successes and the concealment of failures in which the ruling party indulges, attempting to create an atmosphere in which people become accustomed to the crisis by saying, "Albania is all right with the PD, don't ask for any more!" With regret, but with a feeling of realism, we must admit that the PD program, which is based on neoliberalism, monetarism, the myth of the free market, and on the hope to stabilize the economy fast and to solve everything with help from abroad, in other words on one sidedness and haphazardness, is not as successful in our country as it is portrayed. The medium-term program put forward by the Meksi Government shows this very clearly. "The Albanian miracle" in the implementation of "shock therapy" has now failed, as also happened in other countries of East Europe. The measures taken by the Meksi Government to control the crisis, beyond a strenuously-applied brake on the inflation rate, have not hit their targets: Production remains in general at minimal levels, far below the level of 1989 (although it is said that its decline has been halted); unemployment has reached the colossal figure of 44.5 percent of the able-bodied population, or about 400,000 people, while living standards have fallen more than 40 percent in one year, because the prices of consumer goods have risen nine- or 10-fold, while pay has only risen two- or three-fold. The foreign debt has risen from $400 million to $625 million and is continuing to rise fast because of the very serious foreign trade deficit. The galloping internal debt has totally asphyxiated the operations of enterprises. The market demand for goods and services is mainly ascribable to foreign-currency remittances from economic emigrees, a normal mechanism of the free market when the value of the lek falls in relation to goods on the domestic market, while it is artificially revalued in relation to foreign currencies. The state of public finances remains serious, and public finance relies solely on additions to the variety and size of taxes and on emergency interventions from the sale of state assets accumulated by the people for almost five decades. Meanwhile, the opportunities for the state and for investment credit for the expansion of production are very low. The failures to solve such vital problems as water, electricity, and fuel supplies, housing, and the health service, and the failure to guarantee minimum living conditions have become intolerable for ordinary people. It can no longer be said that the economic crisis through which we are living is solely a result of the legacies of the past, because it is also a result of the policies pursued by the ruling PD in these two years of efforts to roughly shift us into a market economy. The incompetence of members of the government, the maladministration of foreign aid, and the lack of the hoped-for foreign investments led to the failure of such a course; the PD is therefore hastening, in the midst of this confusion, to make what "self-corrections" are possible, and even to talk about the "social economy of the market," which has now been reduced to a "welfare economy" without prospects. Being much more realistically aware of the critical state of the economy than the party in power, the PSSh declares that it considers the reforms irreversible, but that it is necessary, as they are carried out, to make the necessary corrections. The PSSh is also a political force that is able to draw up and to present to the country its own alternative that ensures more successful solutions to the current and forthcoming problems of the economic reform. The two fundamental axes of the PSSh's economic program remain the control of the economic and social crisis and the structural transformation of the economy in order to establish a social market economy. Of course, the social market economy is neither an "abstract notion" nor a "play on words." The concept of the social market economy is much deeper than that which leaders of our right-wing leaders occasionally sneer at, as they attempt out of demagogy and political opportunism to equate it with some funds for social welfare which, in our country's case, would not suffice even to keep alive for six to 12 months our country's hundreds of thousands of unemployed. Nor is a social market economy made by adding a few public holidays, which are given to us by history or by God! Still less can it be achieved by the five-day week at a time when production and productivity are at very low levels. The social market economy is now a theoretical and practical alternative that is mostly supported and implemented by political forces of a social-democratic tendency, which understand by the term a correction of capitalism in order to make it a humane society in which it becomes possible to achieve a genuine political democracy and an genuine economic democracy, a society that gives individuals equal opportunities and in which freedom of the citizen coexists with social responsibility, and a remuneration of ability with social solidarity and a struggle against poverty under the state's supervision. The social market economy is an economic model based on private property, whose sanctity we will defend with the law, and on free initiative and competition, but which does not exclude a variety of forms of ownership, the public sector, and other forms of ownership administered according to the principles of the market economy. Relying on such an understanding of the social market economy, we Socialists place at the foundation of our economic alternative the idea of the new role of the democratic state, which obliquely intervenes in the economy with the aim of giving the market social and humane dimensions and guaranteeing the predominance of private property by creating total scope for the competition of all kinds of ownership. We are for a society that will be based on the logic of profit but at the same time on a logic of social solidarity, on a dynamic combination of the self-regulating mechanisms of the market and factors that balance the market's shortcomings. In our economic alternative, the state will be required to devise the theoretical instruments for an anti-crisis reform program, but it will in particular determine measures for their practical implementation in two interrelated phases: In the first phase, in accordance with the mechanism of the market economy, by giving continual regulatory nudges, while strategically, in the second phase, when the economy has assumed its normal form and will be close to using its potential, it will move to self-regulation. The concept of property also lies at the basis of our economic alternative, with concrete programs to transform, restructure, and develop it, in order to lay the foundations of a mixed economy in which private and public property will coexist, confronting the competition of the market. Privatization is for us too a basic component of the economic reform and a cardinal precondition for the creation of a market economy. However, the PSSh does not see it as a goal in itself or as the sole road. We are not for "total privatization," as it is normally put, but for the fastest possible privatization, while aiming at the decentralization of some enterprises, transforming them entirely and making them public, independent, and productive both nationally and locally, so that "a state of the best kind" may act in the economic field as a normal shareholder and a market agent, and so that there will be respect for the coexistence of the private sector and the public sector, which will gradually be wound down in favor of the private. Our strategy in this direction remains the use of such methods as will be able to ensure, not the destruction and looting of property, as is happening, but a managerial transformation and a considered privatization that will guarantee the restructuring and revival of the economy. Our motto in this direction is, "Not change and privatization in order to simply change the owner, but in order to secure more production and more employment." The PSSh considers to be illegal the privatization of more than 500 small and medium-sized state enterprises by government decrees, or by local privatization boards, without action and openly in the favor of certain individuals and groups. It promises to review the mistakes committed in the course of this process, and to redress all injustices with the help of modern legislation. The PSSh has relied for its privatization program as a whole on the best European experience. This program also anticipates the privatization of large state enterprises, aiming at making property owners out of the largest number of citizens. The PSSh favors privatization on the basis of vouchers assessed on the basis of the contribution, direct or indirect, of everybody who has labored and sweated to create this wealth during the last five decades. Bearing this in mind, we say that only the parliament elected by the people must legally decide on the distribution of this wealth, in order to avoid injustices and social tensions, whether old or new. This will mean that the correction of the injustices of the past will not lead to new injustices and social tensions. We do not see privatization as a return to the economy of 1938, but as a premise for putting ourselves on the lines of an up- to-date European economy. The PSSh has come out against the PD's idea of privatizing everything. We think that the most sensitive sectors such as hydroelectric stations, mining, oil, the railroads, telecommunications, military industries, urban utilities, etc., should remain in public ownership. This stems from the idea of the new role of the democratic state in the social market economy and the need for a variety of forms of ownership, with the natural aim of creating total scope for competition and free initiative. In short, the PSSh's economic alternative will, in changing the course of the economic reform, aim to simultaneously achieve three main objectives: a) The maximal and effective mobilization of all our resources and assets, seeing this as the core of an anticrisis program. b) Continuing to restructure the economy in order to adapt it as fast as possible to the demands of the market. c) Guaranteeing the activities and high and stable profits of domestic and foreign capital. Such changes in the course of the economic reform, seen both macro- and microeconomically, will be accompanied by the drafting and implementation of a range of concrete policies and solutions. Thus, the PSSh does not view restraining inflation as an end in itself or in isolation from such social problems as high unemployment. We are for the optimal balance between these two indicators, and for a level of inflation that will reduce unemployment to 10-15 percent, i.e. slightly more than in other European countries. Our country's academics and economists are able to draft and implement programs for the maximal and effective mobilization of all our resources, deepening the restructuring of our economy for its fastest possible adaptation to the demands of the world market, guaranteeing high and stable profits for foreign capital alongside a higher spirit of cooperation and partnership, unfreezing economic emigration. Particular attention must be devoted to the effective reactivization of some sectors of industry such as mines, mineral processing, engineering, light industry, the food industry, tourism, etc., in which it is anticipated that large numbers of people both in the towns and the countryside will find work. In these directions, the PSSh is planning national, regional, and local programs to create new jobs, bearing particularly in mind the areas most affected by unemployment and a legacy of poverty. It is well known that the liberalization of prices and their free determination by the market on the basis of supply and demand have significantly increased the cost of living, because the government has not allowed pay to follow the movement of prices. The PSSh favors an elastic policy in this, and believes that the free determination of prices should be followed by the necessary adjustments in the system of wages, pensions, social welfare, etc. Our economy is not prepared to cope with the normal operation of the prices and wages mechanism, which is at present influenced by foreign production factors, earnings from emigration, international prices, customs tariffs, and currency exchange rates. Under these conditions, the state must now and again intervene in order to avoid possible speculative and undeserved profits. It is also necessary to maintain state guaranteed prices for the procurement of agricultural and dairy products, with the aim of encouraging the development of the products and byproducts the market demands. As for pay, we favor a better appreciation of intellectual labor; reasonable differentials, in accordance with the economic situation, between high and low pay; a minimum wage calculated on the basis of a minimum subsistence; and wage freedom in the private sector, all to be regulated by laws approved in parliament. The PSSh favors a credit, fiscal, and customs policy that will aim to stimulate and do what is possible to protect the domestic market for agricultural and industrial production, whether of traditional kinds or those "in their infancy." It also favors expanding the private sector and employing tens and hundreds of thousands of people in towns and centers of employment. Fiscal policy must be regulated in two main directions: first, in order to stimulate and protect the development of domestic production and the equilibrium of the market and supply and demand. This would be helped by the establishment of a progressive taxation system and the replacement of turnover tax by a value-added tax. The second direction involves tightening the taxation administration in order to administrate revenue in the best possible way through improved financial control, and a struggle against corruption and improper profits that damage the interests of the state and of working people. A policy of reducing the budget deficit must take more care to distribute the burden better between the productive and the retail and service sectors. As part of a social market economy, we will reform the banking system, a financial institution with an irreplaceable role, by using the instruments of money, credit, and the financial market (in money and securities), in order to stabilize and further develop the range of production and to develop international economic relations and investments. The establishment of local government on a stable and independent economic basis is a basic problem for us Socialists. We think that this is not simply a question of a skeletal law or a "local" budget that depends almost entirely on the government and the ministries, but an issue that demands a total regulation of the prerogatives of popular self-government and the assets and financial resources of these authorities, which will, on one hand, oblige and encourage these authorities to manage their productive activities and their natural resources, and also to confront and solve the many key problems of public services in the towns and the countryside. A special policy will be devised favoring the countryside, especially the poor mountain regions. This will be supported by a range of concessionary policies for prices, loans, agricultural machinery, and nitrate fertilizers, and by devising and introducing at the proper time a customs and taxation system that will not only cover the fiscal aspect, as happened with the decree of the Meksi Government. We aim "to give oxygen" to Albanian agricultural and livestock production, or those products and trades for which every opportunity exists and where we do not lack a tradition. The PSSh opposes introducing taxes for the peasantry in 1994. This conclusion is based on the current situation of agriculture and the countryside in general, which is in reality quite different from what those in power claim. The state of the countryside is serious. Land distribution has stuck at 70 percent, while official spokesmen claim that it has reached 95 percent. The countryside and agricultural production cannot set off on the right road without title deeds being distributed. Albanian agriculture is still not in a position to secure bread and other products for the rural population, let alone the towns. The irrigation network has been to a large extent destroyed, the seed distribution system does not work, and the production of chemical fertilizer has sunk to the levels of several decades ago. The overwhelming majority of private peasants, especially those a long way from the towns, do not have any opportunity to send their produce to market. At the same time, peasants are obliged to buy industrial goods at European prices. Our policy for the development of sheep-farming also aims at alleviating these areas today. Millions of dollars are today leaving Albania in order to import agricultural and dairy products that we used to export until yesterday, and can be produced at home; meanwhile, no ways are being found, no financially considered economic ways and means, to invest these millions in Albania, in agriculture, tourism, and other sectors. We want to correct the anticonstitutional and illegal steps that were taken to destroy the agricultural enterprises. The parliament must issue a comprehensive law to cover these major assets of 200,000 hectares, which used to account for 25 percent of the country's agricultural production. It is clear to everybody that Albanian agriculture cannot progress and achieve European levels divided into about 500,000 individual plots; we therefore, in time, support the idea of the modern organization of private agricultural production. We think that the future of democracy and the market economy in Albania depends on the abilities the political forces will show in devising and developing a social infrastructure and up-to-date systems of education, health, culture, social security, consumer protection, etc., things we regretfully note have been neglected or destroyed. The PSSh has devoted more attention than any other political force to human concerns and to the social dimension of the market economy, on the basis of the fact that we are faced with a marked deterioration of the social position of increasingly broad strata of our society; that 20 percent of urban families, or one in five, are totally destitute and receive no income other than what they receive as welfare; and that services in health, education, culture, etc., are less and less well covered. We think that the economic reform can only be crowned with success if we show ourselves sensitive to human concerns, or, in other words, to the social costs of the reform. This is the reason that has impelled us not to rest content with compiling the most up- to-date social program possible, but to insist on realizing it on the basis of the new political settlement that we propose. For example, the PSSh's alternative in the field of education lays down the goal of reforming and modernizing the educational system at all levels, in content and in structure, and completing the relevant legislation to make education open, democratic, secular, and modern. The broad basis of the education of Albanian citizens will continue to be in state schools. In this context, the educational rights of the minorities will be respected. Education will be paid for and conducted by the state. Private education will be permitted by law and its curricula will be subject to state standards. This will also be true of foreign schools. The criterion for employment and for promotion to supervisory responsibility at all levels of the schools will be professional ability. The status of a teacher and lecturer, of a school pupil and college student, and the duties of a parent in his relationship with the school, will be covered by a PSSh legislative initiative. Cooperation in European projects and the twinning of our schools and universities with those in foreign countries will remain an important resource in the future too. In its program for health, the PSSh will rely on the principle that every citizen will receive the health care he requires, regardless of his social position or economic level. Faced with the economic condition of a state that cannot promise adequate budget resources for health, the idea of health insurance, dependent on income, will be gradually introduced, as the only way to achieve a modern medical service, the best possible pay for health personnel, and also the basic preconditions for a struggle against corruption in the health sector. The aim will be to improve all three levels of the health service, and to devote particular attention to the modernization of preventive medicine and the emergency service. By means of the social security system, we aim to offer protection against the perils of age, illness, accidents, invalidity, unemployment, and at the same time the poverty in which certain strata of society will continue to find themselves. The social security system at which we aim combines personal responsibility and social solidarity. Its structure will be subdivided into insurance, solidarity funds, aid, etc., and also for different ages and professions. We will care for war veterans according to the same standards other European countries adopt toward those who contributed to the struggle against fascism. At a time when cultural and academic contacts with other countries are increasing, our state and society have the duty to maintain and support our national cultural identity. We therefore favor support for the dignified revival of central institutions of pan-national importance such as the Academy of Sciences, the National Theater, the Opera and Ballet Theater, Albanfilm, the Naim Frasheri Publishing House, the central museums, etc. This will be supplemented by cooperation between the central institutions and social organizations, by agreements with international organizations and associations, and also by demanding a certain quota from private enterprises. In this same area, the PSSh alternative provides for certain specific measures for the intelligentsia, for the operation of existing academic institutions and their increased cooperation with individual European bodies and projects, the maintenance of high university numbers, legislative and economic incentives for the private sector to invest in academic institutions, improved pay and welfare for intellectuals with high levels of postgraduate qualifications, and the legal protection of authors' copyright within Albania and abroad, etc. In conclusion, the PSSh declares that its alternative gives optimal solutions to the problems that have accumulated during our country's economic crisis, and that it is able to confront the challenges of the times in this difficult transition period. Nevertheless, it defends the view that the country requires medium- term and long-term macroeconomic guidelines that cannot be included within the framework of the program of an individual government of whatever party. These guidelines require a broad consensus and we will be unsparing in our commitment and efforts to achieve this. For an Active and Realistic Foreign Policy The PSSh has assembled a broad and realistic vision regarding both foreign policy and the influence of foreign factors on the successful realization of the reforms in Albania. It has clearly expressed its stands in its program documents and in its daily work. Therefore, without pretending to give a total overview of foreign policy, we would wish merely to stress certain objections and priorities. We value the steps that have been taken to overcome Albania's foreign isolation and support the development of the process of international relations as well as efforts to establish a new order of peace and stability that will exclude all kinds of political, national, economic, ethnic, or religious conflict among countries and peoples, especially in our tense region. The PSSh once again takes the opportunity to express gratitude to the countries and states of Europe, the United States, China, and the countries of the Islamic community for the help they have given to our country in this difficult period of transition. We appreciate the continually active roles of the EU, the Western European Union, and more broadly, that of the CSCE, not only in the process of economic renewal, but also politically and in support of our national cause. We hold fast to the view that new geopolitical realities have brought regional factors to the fore. Our foreign policy in this field should therefore be marked by dynamic equilibrium. We view regional factors as extensions of nonregional factors of European and Atlantic security. We cannot respond to this situation with the haphazard and amateur enthusiasm of much of our foreign policy, over which we have already expressed our objections. The priorities given to chance opportunities have detracted from the work of Albanian diplomacy, and brought a kind of chill in relations with Europe, a chill that cannot be hidden by spectacular scenes at airports and numbers of handshakes. Relations with neighboring countries also constitute a priority that can never be neglected, and we must therefore continually be making efforts to ensure we are always friends with these countries, bringing problems out into the open and solving them, but above all not allowing the creation of new problems that cool relations. The political conditions in the region are not those of four or five years ago. The war, the unprecedented violence of the Serbian chauvinists in Bosnia and other areas of the former Yugoslavia, and the grim terror against the Albanians in Kosova include ingredients that could lead to this war spreading. This would be fatal to the peoples of the Balkans. We therefore support every effort, within our beyond the Balkans, to avert this. In this tense situation in the region, the PSSh repeats its stand in support of our brothers in Kosova, in their own territories in the former Yugoslavia, and in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. We clearly hold fast to the idea that respect for the principle of that borders cannot be changed by force does not conflict with the recognition of the rights of people to self-determination. The PSSh thinks that there is an urgent need today to find new ways for the peoples of the Balkans to live together in peace and to work for prosperity and democracy, not allowing antagonisms to be created among them through the exploitation of differences in economic levels, or national, religious, linguistic, and cultural differences, etc. We think that an independent Kosova free from Serbian occupation would not only realize aspirations of the people of Kosova and be an important step toward solving our national question, but would also be a factor of peace and stability in the region. Despite the serious conditions now prevailing in the Balkans, the PSSh repeats its familiar stand that Albanian diplomacy should take realistic and tangible steps with clear initiatives to reactivate bilateral and multilateral Balkan cooperation in political, economic, and cultural fields, in technical and academic cooperation, etc. The PSSh powerfully supports and will devote all its energies to encouraging dialogue, mutual understanding, and cooperation among the peoples of the region, in the belief that interdependency and peaceful coexistence constitute a contemporary framework for guaranteeing national independence and identity. The problems of the Balkans must be solved first of all by the peoples of the Balkan themselves, but must of course be viewed in close connection with European and world problems. Among other things, we favor acting on the initiative for all the progressive left-wing forces in the Balkans to sit down together "round one table." At the same time, the PSSh declares itself against the creation of miniature alliances and the spirit of speculation and distrust that these create. Good bilateral relations should pave the way for the establishment of broad, multilateral cooperation in the region. In this context, the PSSh long ago expressed its stand that relations with such neighboring countries as Greece and Italy must take priority in the region. We have always considered these countries as natural gateways for Albania's integration in Europe. However, unfortunately, a kind of undesirable chill has arisen in our relations with them. Diplomatic efforts in this field have been haphazard and dilettante. We therefore wish that the Albanian state would undertake a clear strategy in relation to our neighbor Greece, especially now that there is a Socialist government there and we are familiar with the predisposition and readiness of Pasok [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] to normalize relations, to achieve cooperation and good- neighborliness, and to legalize Albanian emigrants working in Greece. We support the readiness of Greek diplomacy to view more realistically both the concept of Europe and the Cam problem. We have been and will remain committed in our efforts and stands on respecting and defending all the rights of the Greek minority in Albania, recognized by the CSCE documents. The PSSh appreciates Greece's assumption in her turn of the EU chairmanship, and believes that she will play a significant role in Albania's integration in civilized Europe. The Albanian state, too, must be more active in this. The Albanian people are grateful to friendly Italy for the help that it has given and for its generosity in welcoming thousands of young Albanian men and women. However, we cannot agree with the Albanian Government's hasty and unargued standpoints toward Italy, which recently, in the absence of efforts to find a common language, have led to a cooling relations between our two countries, something that is unacceptable for the friendly feelings the Albanian people cherish for the Italian people. We appreciate the need to strengthen relations with Turkey, for these are traditional relations with a friendly people that supported Albania with their own generous help at the start of democratic processes in the country. We similarly appreciate the need to make more tangible relations with Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia, and Slovenia, as Balkan countries. We have desired and still desire good relations with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, not only because we wish to see this country a factor of peace and stability in the region, but also because more than 800,000 Albanians live there. However, we have noticed some attitudes on the part of the Macedonian state that are not in the least realistic toward the fair demands of the Albanian population to enjoy the same rights and freedoms enjoyed by citizens of other nationalities. We cannot in any way agree with the statements of the highest officials of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, rejecting the Albanians as a state-forming element. In this direction, the PSSh has criticized the tolerant and often irresponsible attitudes of the Albanian Government, which has both been in a hurry when there was no need, and has kept silent when it should not have done. We do not consider Albania's opening to the world to be complete solely with stable and friendly relations with the Balkan countries, Germany, France, Britain, the Scandinavian countries, etc., and with the United States, but also with Japan, China, Canada, the Russian Federation, the Arab countries, etc. The government's occasional welcome steps in this direction have either been inconsiderable or spectacular, without any clear strategy, and without vigor. We do not see Albania's inclination toward Europe as the sole direction of our foreign policy. In this context, we Socialists have always appreciated relations with the United States. We have valued the standards of U.S. democracy and U.S. technical and professional assistance, which we would like to see grow and expand. We repeat the belief that any role and any step in foreign policy is acceptable as long as it develops the concept of the independence, sovereignty, integrity, and freedom of the homeland, under conditions of interdependency. We favor the dignified integration of Albania in Europe and in all its political, economic, and military organisms. In this sense, we value and appreciate cooperation with NATO, especially within the framework of the Partnership for Peace initiated by U.S. President Clinton. We see this as an important step toward more solid forms of integration in European processes and Euro-Atlantic security, which will also lead to commitments for our country to respect the principles of democracy and human rights and freedoms, an area in which we are still far from familiar international standards. The PSSh thinks that to express a wish at a verbal level, as did the parliament, is not enough to join Partnership for Peace at the highest levels, because deserving and acquiring partnership with NATO will, as we know, require proposals, measures, and tangible commitments to be studied, coordinated, and supported by legislation. For these, in our view, the parliament must neither be left to one side or presented with a "fait accompli," making what it has to say a mere formality, as happens. Comrades delegates, the PSSH is a force of the European left, committed to recognizing the traditions and characteristics of European social democracy, which has now created its own social- democratic profile. Its prestige is continually rising among the circle of the socialist and social-democratic parties of Europe. Since the party's First Congress in June 1992, it has not only consolidated its relations with its sister parties, but has further expanded them with the Spanish Socialist Party, the Democratic Party of the Left in Italy, and the social-democratic parties of the Netherlands, Denmark, Belgium, etc. Positive steps have also been taken in relations with the German Social Democratic Party. It is our task to promoted and consolidate these. We appreciate the interest being shown and the help recently given to our party by the Socialist International Committee for Central and East Europe as an important step toward the PSSh's gradual integration in the Socialist International. While this is one of our objectives for the future, we repeat that we have never acted with the idea of affirming ourselves first abroad and then in Albania. We therefore see our integration in the Socialist International first of all as an ongoing duty toward democracy in Albania. The new political, economic, and social settlement that we propose is the most tangible expression of this commitment to the democracy, social peace, and economic reform that Albania needs so badly. We are aware of the responsibilities and sacrifices required from us, and we therefore declare once again from the platform of this conference our readiness and dedication, and that of all the PSSh's many members and supporters. Long live the PSSh! Long live the Albanian people!
