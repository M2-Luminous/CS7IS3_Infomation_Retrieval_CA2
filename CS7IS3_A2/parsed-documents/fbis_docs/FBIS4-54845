Although he enjoys the support and is respected by his ministry as well as by the Croatian Army, Minister Susak, together with President Tudjman, was one of the most criticized men of the Croatian state leadership by the opposition. We talked to Minister Susak about that as well as about the latest withdrawals from the HDZ [Croatian Democratic Community] of the President of the Chamber of Representatives Stipe Mesic and the President of the Chamber of Counties Josip Manolic. At the beginning of the interview, we asked him about the latest events in the ruling party, and Minister Susak, who is also the vice president of the HDZ, said: [Susak] I personally think the present process in the party is extremely positive. In the evolution of the Croatian state, we entered the political scene as a movement which, in due course, must grow into a party whose views and guidelines were publicly and clearly set by President Tudjman at the Second General Assembly of the HDZ. We voted and agreed to ratify the party program and people who will implement it. Such phenomena are normal in all parties in the world, not to mention our process of transformation from a movement into a party. I do not see it as a rift, nor as a cause for panic in the party. I think, and so do most HDZ members, that, after they [Mesic and Manolic] leave, the membership of the HDZ will be even stronger. Therefore, I believe this will prompt a large number of people of quality to join the HDZ. [Pudja] Leaving the HDZ, Mr. Manolic and Mr. Mesic were very critical of your work at the Ministry of Defense. What do you think about that and is this constructive criticism? [Susak] In the past year, and it will probably be so for a while, the Defense Ministry has been one of the most important departments, but also one of the most controversial ones, owing to the global political and military situation of the Republic of Croatia. And it is only natural that both the Defense Ministry and myself are subject to criticism regardless of whether it is well-founded or not. Criticism is always welcome. The fact is that we are now in the position that every citizen, regardless of his or her function, can voice his or her opinion. We advocated that right and our army fought to preserve our territory and such a system. However, criticism is also subject to analysis. Those who criticize the Ministry of Defense and especially myself as the key man of the Ministry, must substantiate their accusations with some proof. I am willing to face the Croatian public, let them analyze the situation if they want, even with the help independent experts, from the moment I took office at the Ministry to the present. That does not justify my mistakes, if there were any, and I must have made some, as I am only human. However, I am willing to face the judgment of the public and of experts and let them evaluate my work and results. Let me remind you that, recently, during a session of the parliament, there was an attempt to call for a vote of no confidence in me. I think that voting for a vote of confidence or no confidence in me in the parliament in free and independent Croatia would be the most exhilarating moment. That would be the system I fought for and I would be honored, regardless of the outcome of voting. I will use this opportunity to ask my party to agree to that. Former Intelligence Services [Pudja] You have not quite answered my question. Do you know why Manolic, in addition to referring to President Tudjman, most often refers to you personally? Is there, perhaps, something we do not know? [Susak] Yes, but in Mr. Manolic's frame of mind, which is probably the result of his life-long orientation and experience, which does not correspond to Croatian views and the road Croatia was supposed to take. He chose his own path and the Croatian public will have their say about that and decide whether his way is better than what I advocate. After all, there will be more elections and we will see the judgment of the Croatian nation. [Pudja] Could you comment on the fact that some people from the ruling party are founding a new party? As those men are the presidents of the two chambers of the parliament, could this result in a parliamentary crisis and malfunctioning of the state? [Susak] Our party itself could not have chosen a better moment for such an event. The HDZ has not for a single moment, in the past four years of its existence, been in a better position to solve such problems. The international and domestic situation in Croatia has never been safer or more stable. The fact that their timing is bad points to their political naivete. If their plan was to provoke and destabilize the system and disrupt the functioning of the state, my opinion is that they could not have chosen a worse moment. But that is their choice and we will accept the challenge. We will not deal with them the way they dealt with their enemies while they had power in the former regime. From the beginning, we advocated a Croatia whose every citizen will be able to air his or her views, whatever they may be. [Pudja] At the meeting in Dubrovnik, you also brought up three of Manolic's followers -- Boljkovac, Karic, and Degoricija -- as they were members of former intelligence services and you said the HDZ would get stronger after they leave. [Susak] Regarding the said gentlemen, we know they come from similar structures and have similar views. At the beginning, the HDZ was organized as a movement comprising all kinds of views and structures. I think they were the only structure that was connected by the fact that they all, at one point, worked for former intelligence services, regardless of what they were called, from 1945 to the free general elections. They all have that in common, from those leaders who chose to leave to those who will follow them. I do not want to speculate about that, but there is a possibility that they will resort to some kind of blackmail or something else. Regardless of what we may think, Manolic was one of the most responsible officials in our time, as well. If the system of a law-ordered state failed at the Ministry of Defense or some other ministry, why did he not react then? That is odd. He had the opportunity to call us to account for what happened and he could even dismiss us. I find it odd that he chose to do that now. That should tell us much about his intentions. As for their holding us accountable, I would like to see both Manolic and Mesic present concrete examples and substantiate their accusations. [Pudja] Manolic's group also blames the Croatian leadership and you personally for the conflict between the Croats and the Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina. [Susak] I think that what Manolic reproaches us for is the least important factor in the conflict between the Croats and the Muslims. If he had cared about interests of the Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina, he would have taken concrete steps in the past three to four years and done something himself, both publicly and secretly. There had to be much secret work in order to organize the local Croat population and defend the territory where they live. I think the fact of the matter is something completely different. They say we are to blame, that those conflicts were caused by Croatian state politics, but my only reply is that the Croatian state leadership and the leaders of the HDZ -- and I am one of them -- have been consistent in implementing our policies toward Bosnia-Herzegovina, from the moment Bosnia-Herzegovina was recognized to the referendum and acceptance of all proposals of the international community. The Bosnia-Herzegovina Croats and their leadership were the only one of the three nations to have accepted all proposals of the international community in order to establish peace. We could not have implemented that on our own, for it takes at least two sides to reach an agreement. The conflict between the Croats and the Muslims, which unfortunately broke out, was not in the interest of Croatia, nor in the interest of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Croats. It was against our interests and that is why Croatia cannot be blamed. That does not justify mistakes that happened on lower levels among the Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, our policies have been consistent from day one and we are prepared to render an account of our implementation of such policies. The Example of Konjic [Pudja] You also said that the first shipment of weapons from Croatia went to Foca. [Susak] Yes. The first shipment did go to Foca thanks to a local Muslim representative. Unfortunately, they lost Foca, not because they had no desire to defend it, but because they did not receive support from where they were supposed to get it. That does not mean that, given that support, they could have defended it, but during the most critical moments, the Bosnian leadership did not realize how serious the situation was. I do not mean this as a criticism, we all made mistakes, but this is a fragment that must also be considered in analyzing the events of the past two and a half years. One cannot blame the policies of one side or the other for the conflict between the Croats and the Muslims. As a result of the Serb aggression, several thousand refugees were forced into a small area where it was impossible to live and that is why there were misunderstandings. Very often the official Bosnia-Herzegovina leadership failed in the most crucial moments. Afterwards, they tried, and are still trying, to make up for that, but that is another matter. That will not justify the first days when they were not up to the moment and when we could not find partners in the Bosnia-Herzegovina leadership to organize a more effective defense together. Their dilemma was whether to ask the "Yugoslav Army to defend them from the Chetniks." However, when that army showed its true colors there as well, it was too late to do anything efficiently. Unlike their leaders, some Muslim individuals realized what was the essential problem and came directly to Zagreb for help. That is why we sent those weapons to Foca. [Pudja] The Croats were accused of being responsible for those conflicts at the Bosnia-Herzegovina assembly in Sarajevo as well. [Susak] Those were isolated examples. Prime Minister Silajdzic said that himself. The Croats cannot be blamed for that tragic conflict. The Muslims could not have gotten their first weapons from anywhere else but from Croatia or from the Bosnia-Herzegovina Croats against whom they used them. I repeat, there were mistakes at lower levels and in some Bosnia-Herzegovina Croat structures. We have documented the case of Konjic, where the ratio of Croats and Muslims is less favorable. The first shipment of weapons from Croatia that got to Konjic was divided equally among the Croats and the Muslims. The Muslims abused that and seized power in Konjic using weapons they got from the Croats. The cases of Bugojno, Travnik, and other towns are well-documented too. In a nutshell, the enemy of the Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina was far too recognizable and powerful for the Croats to reach for another enemy. Investigation Into Sesvete [Pudja] Your political opponents also say you are responsible for the explosion in Duboki Jarak [a suburb of Zagreb]. They think you should be held accountable as the defense minister. [Susak] The defense minister would, in normal procedures and conditions, have to be responsible for what happened in Duboki Jarak. However, there has been much misinformation in the public and two items are very important. Firstly, at the time of the accident I was away on business in Mostar. I was informed about the accident at about 1430 and I reported to the supreme commander and the president of the Republic at about 1900. Newspapers say I came one day later, which is not true. I will not reveal what the president and I talked about. I was prepared to resign. In normal circumstances, I take the political responsibility regardless of the facts. However, President Tudjman, who appointed me defense minister, thought I should not resign. It is common knowledge that a defense minister does not hand in his resignation to the parliament, but to President Tudjman, and it is up to the parliament to analyze all the events and form their opinion about me in a regular procedure. [Pudja] With regard to what happened in Sesvete, you personally suggested to bring in commissions from abroad. [Susak] It would be irresponsible of me if I did not get several opinions about the explosion. At the meeting with President Tudjman, in addition to the commission of the Defense Ministry which was appointed by the president personally, I requested to send for another independent commission from abroad. At the same time, we filed a request with NATO and France. The French contacted us first and we accepted their commission. NATO, which contacted us later, offered to send a group that would help us destroy leftover bombs which did not explode, and we accepted. Those commissions will soon submit their reports to appropriate organs, which will then decide about who is responsible for the explosion. [Pudja] Can you, perhaps, tell us when will those reports be made public? [Susak] I think the commissions will finish their job within the next two weeks. First results could be expected even sooner. All things considered, the results will be presented to the public and for discussion in the parliament in the next two weeks. There is no way I can influence the work of those commissions and their results. You know that the Ministry of Justice appointed a judge who gives entrance and exit permissions to all commissions. [Pudja] Are there any indications as to the cause of the explosion? [Susak] I would not like to speculate about that at this point. It would not be good for the work of the commissions. Journalists and analysts can afford to speculate, but a defense minister cannot. Spegelj's Slander [Pudja] In spite of various expectations about the respectability of the Croatian Army and about the situation regarding the military industry of Croatia, you were the one who spoke about that the least. [Susak] You are here to ask questions, and I am here to answer them. I would not like to discuss the respectability of the Croatian Army at present. That is up to military experts to say. In public, we hear both views. However, the most surprising thing is that former defense minister and commander of the Supreme Headquarters General Spegelj says that the Defense Ministry and Supreme Headquarters are mostly composed of people who are not trained for their jobs. I do not know to whom he refers, perhaps General Bobetko or somebody else. Professional skill is assessed by means of comparison. I, as the defense minister, can be reproached for not being a soldier. I think this ministry is just like any other ministry. My role is to find the best possible personnel and means in order to make the system work. I think it is in the interest of Croatia that a civilian, regardless of who it may be, be at the head of the Defense Ministry, for we do not want Croatia to be a military state, but a democratic country. The Army is just one of the factors which protects and establishes the system of the state. Whether, in the past two and a half years, I justified the confidence of the president of the Republic and of the prime ministers, that is up to them and to the Croatian people to deduce on the basis of unbiased analyses. They should look into the state of the Croatian Army when I took office, into circumstances regarding the acquisition of its equipment, into the state of Croatian military industry, and compare the responsibility of the Croatian Army then and at present. Let me remind you, when I became defense minister, an arms embargo was already imposed on Croatia. [Pudja] People think that the Croatian Army can regain the remaining part of the occupied territory of Croatia. So far, we have been trying to regain that territory and include it in the system of Croatia in a peaceful manner. Will that be the case from now on as well? [Susak] According to estimates and reports of not only those who are in charge of that in our ministry, but also of other reports, the Croatian Army can liberate the entire Croatian territory, by force if necessary. But I would like to repeat what our president said: The first task of our state politics is to reach our goal with minimum casualties. However, if we are forced to resort to force, if there is no way out, we are prepared to do that and liberate our territory. [Box, p 6] Accusation [Susak] Manolic's statement that I stepped in and arranged the release of a certain colonel of the Information and Security Service, and that he was smuggling drugs, is an accusation that deserves to go to court. Both the Justice Ministry and the Ministry of Interior and their ministers have publicly denied those accusations. If I were doing something else and if I had the time, I would immediately begin legal action against Joza Manolic. [Box, p 7] Emigration and the Croatian Independent Democrats [Susak] The Croatian Independent Democrats would like to spread some information about emigration and the names of people who allegedly want to join their party. I think the emigration will commit themselves on that. Manolic and Mesic have only a handful of emigrants' names -- I say names, for those are obviously not people. As to the question why there are so many emigrants, that should be answered by Mr. Manolic, who had a very important function at the time when a large number of Croats were forced to leave their homes. [Box, p 7] Christian Morality [Susak] We, members of the HDZ, do not advocate a clericalist party, as Mr. Duka and Mr. Juric say; rather, we advocate what every party of that orientation in Western democracy wants -- to build the state on Christian morality. On the basis of that and as a national party we want -- as long as we enjoy the confidence of the Croatian nation -- to create the Croatian state. [Box, p 7] Care [Susak] Caring for disabled veterans and families of soldiers who died defending our country is the duty of the entire Croatian state. At the latest session of the government, I proposed that a session be dedicated exclusively to problems of wounded soldiers and families of dead soldiers, and the proposal was unanimously accepted. Within our means, the Defense Ministry will make a concrete step toward solving at least those initial problems with accommodation. I will propose that housing funds be established in every county and that loans be provided for those who could solve their housing problems. I think that, if we continue with our present budget policy and with this government, we will be able to solve that part of the problem.
