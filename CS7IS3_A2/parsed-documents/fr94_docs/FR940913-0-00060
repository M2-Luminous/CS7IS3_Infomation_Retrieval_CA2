ACTION: Interim and final rule. SUMMARY: Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A&hyph;110 provides standards for obtaining consistency and uniformity among Federal agencies in the administration of grants and agreements with institutions of higher education, hospitals, and other non-profit organizations. OMB issued Circular A&hyph;110 in 1976 and made a minor revision in February 1987. To update the Circular, OMB established an interagency task force to review the Circular. The task force solicited suggestions for changes to the Circular from university groups, non-profit organizations and other interested parties and compared, for consistency, the provisions of similar provisions applied to State and local governments. On November 29, 1993, OMB issued a revised circular which reflects the results of these efforts. This final rule adopts the revised circular as it pertains to HUD. However, this rule contains, in subpart E, special provisions relating to the use of lump sum grants. Therefore, subpart E will be treated as an interim rule, and the public is invited to submit comments on subpart E. DATES: Effective date: October 13, 1994. Comments due date: Comments on subpart E are due on November 14, 1994. ADDRESSES: Interested persons are invited to submit comments regarding subpart E of this rule to the Rules Docket Clerk, Office of General Counsel, Room 10276, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20410.
