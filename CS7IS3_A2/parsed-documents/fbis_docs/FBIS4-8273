"I still consider the preparation of an atomic law to be a condition for the licensing process for the Temelin power plant to be initiated," he said on the Nova television station. Nova claimed information given by the State Office for Atomic Safety (SUJB) in a government hearing cast doubt on the date the south Bohemian plant is due to be brought into operation. That report "confirms the caution I have been trying to push for with regard to the total nuclear energy programme," Benda said. If no atomic law existed he would oppose the operation of Temelin, he said. The process of loading fuel into Temelin's reactors is scheduled to begin at the end of 1994 and by mid 1995 the first reactor should be working at full performance. The second reactor should be brought on line in 1996. The completed plant is expected to produce 2,000 MW.
