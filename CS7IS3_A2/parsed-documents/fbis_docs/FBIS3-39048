Pointing out that at today's talks an agreement was reached to make the most of the existing potential, Demirel said that the agreement to be signed tomorrow will document their mutual political will and provide the security sought by Turkish businessmen for investments. Pointing out that regional problems were also discussed in depth, Demirel said that the fact that 20 percent of Azerbaijani territory is occupied by Armenians poses a threat to regional peace, stability and security. Demirel continued: [Begin Demirel recording] From the very beginning of the conflict we called on the Armenians to respect Azerbaijan's territorial integrity. We pointed out that such a stand is in the interests of all the regional countries and primarily Armenia. The Armenians, however, have continued to seek the solution through brute force. We hope that the Armenians will immediately and unconditionally withdraw from all the Azerbaijani territory they have occupied in line with the UN resolution. Otherwise, sooner or later they will have to go just as they have come. [end recording] Demirel said that one can observe that the Azerbaijani people have acquired a new consciousness regarding the concept of nation and expressed his satisfaction over the issue. He noted that at the talks they have also decided to consolidate bilateral relations through cooperation at international organizations in which both Turkey and Azerbaijan are members. Demirel said that Turkey will continue to extend the necessary support and assistance to Azerbaijan's efforts to unite with the international community. Aliyev said that after gaining its independence, Azerbaijan has begun to attach great importance to developing its ties of friendship and brotherhood with Turkey. He added that the ties between Azerbaijan and Turkey, which date back to history, have never been severed despite the difficult periods. Stressing that the peoples of the two countries have immediately formed a close rapport despite the fact that they have remained apart for 70 years, Aliyev added that it is their duty to further advance the bilateral relations. Pointing out that the Azerbaijani Army has attained significant victories in defending the country's integrity through great sacrifices, Aliyev said: We still maintain that the path of peace is in the forefront of our war plan. We will, however, continue our just struggle to attain our goal. Thanking Turkey for all aid the it has extended in all fields, Aliyev concluded by expressing the hope that it will continue. After the dinner, Aliyev received Democratic Left Party leader Bulent Ecevit and conferred with him for some time.
