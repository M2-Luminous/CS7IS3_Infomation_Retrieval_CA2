FBIS4-36301 "drnes110_k_94002" FBIS-NES-94-110 Daily Report 1 Jun 1994 IRAQ Columnist Views Cabinet Reshuffle, `Scrutiny Stage' Columnist Views Cabinet Reshuffle, `Scrutiny Stage' JN0706163594 Baghdad BABIL in Arabic 1 Jun 94 p 1 JN0706163594 Baghdad BABIL Arabic BFN [Article by Abu-Sarhan: "The Cabinet Reshuffle"] [Text] Market observers noticed on Monday [30 May], that the price of the dollar has dropped to 350 dinars. Some people said it was offered for 320 dinars but nobody bought it. In addition, there has been a visible drop in the prices of all supplies. This clearly indicates that there is no scarcity of items, which would force prices up due to increasing demand. This means these supplies have not been affected by supply and demand. Otherwise, the prices would have remained stable in spite of the cabinet reshuffle. At any rate, even if some changes do occur, they would be slight and not sudden. This confirms our past arguments that the increase in the price of the dollar is not the outcome of the blockade or the supplies that enter the country and the human consumption of these supplies. Rather, it is our firm conviction that there is an integral system made up of a group of people who have sold out to the foreigner. This group represents around 20-30 percent; 70 percent of this misled group has been blinded by greed and a desire to amass money. The group that makes up the 20-30 percent has foreign links, specifically with Saudi Arabia. This group manipulates the price of the dollar to bring about such an increase on the black market. Therefore, and as a result of observing the financial market in al-Shurjah, we noticed yesterday, Tuesday [31 May], that a group of Kurdish traders, who are not well known, started to buy dollars at any price, paying 420 or 450 dinars, in an open attempt to raise the price of the dollar. Here, we hope the security agencies and the Interior Ministry will work seriously and closely watch these developments. Had it not been for God's care for Iraq and its leader, many unexpected developments would have taken place. The most important thing about the cabinet reshuffle, apart from the people's joy and the drop in prices, is that this reshuffle will make the source of decisions close to the executive tools, that is, close to the ministries and their leading personalities. Another important point is that we should not judge the work of ministries until at least three months have elapsed, because the Iraqis are known for their initial rush, which soon subsides. These three months represent an observation stage to be followed by a scrutiny stage, which will reveal whether a certain ministry is really doing its job or is just posing for television.
