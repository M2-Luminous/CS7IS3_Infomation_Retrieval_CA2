Fedorov based his decision on the fact that his two conditions had not been met: first, that Aleksandr Zaveryukha be removed from the government, and second, that Viktor Gerashchenko be released from the post of chairman of the Central Bank of Russia. Fedorov added that his decision was also explained by his "disagreement with the program planned by the government."
