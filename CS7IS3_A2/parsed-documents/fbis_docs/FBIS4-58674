With the help of God and the resolve of brave men, the units of valiant Armed Forces--the forces of unity and constitutional legitimacy--in the Lahij, Abyan, al-Bayda', and Ta'izz Governorates continue their confrontations and successive offensives against the units of the forces of evil, wickedness, and apostasy, which have been controlled and commanded by the rebellious, separatist elements in the Socialist Party command since they exploded the military situation in a comprehensive manner last night, beginning with the Dhamar and Aden Governorates, and extending to other governorates. The forces of constitutional legitimacy--the defenders of unity and democracy--have inflicted successive defeats on all the units that have been pushed into this losing and destructive battle. They forced a large number of those forces to surrender to the will of the people, the power of truth, and the heroism of the forces defending unity and democracy. Other units have surrendered of their own free will, declaring that they have joined the trenches of constitutional legitimacy and the ranks of the defenders of the people and the homeland and their great achievements. This morning, units from the Ba Suhayb Brigade Camp were forced to surrender and join the ranks of constitutional legitimacy and Yemeni unity. With the same spirit of defending unity and democracy and defeating the forces of treachery, apostasy, and separation, the forces of the 2d Armored Brigade in the al-Rahah area continue their great steadfastness, warding off all the fires of rancor, which will be defeated, God willing. In the al-Bayda' and Abyan Governorates, the forces of the 56th Brigade, 3d Armored Brigade, the 8th Special Forces Brigade, and the al-Wahdah Brigades continue their determined, capable advance as they confront the forces of separation in the Mukayris area. They encircled and seized the 20th Brigade and all its fortifications. In the same spirit aiming at bolstering the people's unity victory and defeating their treacherous enemies, the supported [muda'am] 3d Infantry Brigade confronted the forces of apostasy and separation in the camps of the al-Rahidah and Sarif areas. They are now continuing their heroic and valiant advance to achieve their mission. In the city of Aden, our valiant heroes at the Central Security Company in Khormaksar have continued their unique heroic steadfastness in the face of the fierce large-scale aggression carried out against them by a number of the rebelling military units. In the Ibb Governorate, the forces of the constitutional legitimacy and Yemeni unity have continued their attack on the units and brigades of the forces of apostasy and secession in the al-Dali' region. The forces of the al-Hamzah Camp inflicted heavy losses on the 'Abbud Brigade forces. Fighting is still raging and the treacherous ones, aggressors, and those rebelling against the constitutional legitimacy, of the enemies of the people and unity, will receive their punishment. Ever since last night, the al-'Amaliqah forces have been heroically confronting the sea and air attacks against them in the Abyan Governorate. They were able to repulse these attacks and prevent them from achieving any of their objectives. This morning, the capital, Sanaa, and the cities of Ta'izz and al-Hudaydah witnessed air raids by the aircraft of the rebelling secessionist forces, which targeted some vital and strategic installations. These raids also targeted a number of the military brigades in some governorates. The units of the air defense forces confronted them and downed two aircraft belonging to the rebelling secessionist gang in the al-Rahah region, two aircraft in Mukayris, and another aircraft in al-Rahidah. Last night and this morning, large numbers of officers, noncommissioned officers, and soldiers willingly handed themselves over to the forces of the constitutional legitimacy, announcing that they want to join these forces, and voicing their rejection of the despicable secessionist conspiracy which was hatched by the secessionist gang in the leadership of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], headed by war criminal, traitor, 'Ali Salim al-Bid and his evil secessionist clique, against the homeland and its unity, and against the people, their freedom, and democracy. The expressed their denunciation of all the criminal acts which resulted in this comprehensive military war which was ignited by this rebelling clique, which will be crushed, God willing. In a subsequent statement, we will detail the names of these units and the number of the officers, noncommissioned officers, and soldiers who joined the forces of the constitutional legitimacy and the trench of the Yemeni unity, the party of the one Yemeni people, which is above all the sick parochial, personal, and selfish loyalties, because it is the people's army whose loyalty is to God, the homeland, the revolution, the unity, and democracy.
