He recalled Clinton's idea, voiced during his visit in Europe, that solving economic and social problems and ensuring prosperity for all was one of the prerequisites for the peace and security of states. Grebenicek said it was necessary that this idea not to remain a mere oratorial [as received] phrase but be implemented in specific deeds. He said American initiatives designed to help reforms in Central and East European countries were not meeting this task. He said the United States had allocated $400 million to support democratic and market reforms in these countries, which amounts to 13 percent of the U.S annual military aid to Israel. The Partnership for Peace plan would be an "unequal partnership" for Central European countries and would deepen the rivalry among the Visegrad Four countries (the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, and Poland), Grebenicek said. "We are anxious that the Czech political leadership has enthusiastically agreed with it.... A referendum should decide on its acceptance," he added. Vojtech Folip, a KSCM expert on legislation and human rights, said that the agreement crossed the bounds of the Constitution by, for example, the fact that it would station foreign armies on the Czech Republic's territory which, he said, would be limitation of its state sovereignty. The Communists hold the view that cooperation in Europe could be much better secured through the revival of the Helsinki process than through the expansion of NATO, KSCM Deputy Chairman Miloslav Randsdorf said. He pointed to the fact that the Czech Republic would have to "financially participate in North Atlantic Alliance actions." At a time of economic reform this would be an especially sensitive burden for the state budget, he said. The Communists favor a Europe stretching from the Atlantic to the Urals without a privileged position for anyone and the flow of such foreign capital in the Czech Republic which would enhance the economic strength of the country. Grebenicek said that unlike German capital, which could threaten the Czech national identity, the penetration of American capital does not represent such a danger.
