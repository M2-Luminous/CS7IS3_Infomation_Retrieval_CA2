President al-Asad shook hands and talked with everybody. When we all sat down he addressed us like family. Al-Asad said: With the help of God, peace will come. We talk about it and the entire world talks about it. Syria was the one to start the peace process. Since 1973, Syria has been leaning in that direction and agreed to accept UN resolutions. He mentioned by name only UN Resolution 338, which according to al-Asad refers to withdrawal from all the territories and giving the Palestinians back their rights. He said there has been no progress since then due to the Israeli claim that Syria agreed to the UN resolution because it misunderstood the resolution. He said there have been many U.S. and Soviet initiatives since 1973, but that the latest U.S. peace initiative clearly shows that Syria wants peace on the basis of the UN resolutions, which means an Israeli withdrawal. The U.S. initiative conforms with that demand, he said. Al-Asad said that one of the reasons for Labor's success in the last elections, as he understands it, is its peace slogan. After Labor came to power, the atmosphere in the talks improved, and they began to discuss issues of principle, but no progress has been made. The Syrian president sharply attacked Israeli leaders and said that they always make new demands of everybody else. Since the start of the peace process, Syria has contributed a great deal -- it has always initiated things -- while the Israeli Government has contributed almost nothing. Everybody knows that Israel has a policy of procrastination, he said. Israel participated in the Madrid conference because it was under pressure. He presented examples of Israel's foot dragging. Al-Asad said: We offered the land-for-peace principle. The Israelis said it was good, but not enough. We said okay, we will offer a different principle: full withdrawal for full peace. They said it is not sufficiently clear and they do not know what it really means. There is therefore a general impression that Israel is dragging its feet. On the state of Syrian Jewry, President al-Asad said that Israel more that anybody else is responsible if any harm comes to Syrian Jews. It is true that in the 1970's there were restrictions on Syrian Jews, which was vital following the establishment of Israel in 1948. We did not take those steps because we wanted to exploit them, he said. Syria does not deprive anybody; there is freedom of religion and ritual. The constraints were limited to ID's, leaving the country, and movements inside Syria. In the 1980's, and even before that, we understood that there was no justification for continuing those procedures. We decided to discontinue restrictions on 5,000 or 6,000 people because five or six Jews ran away or tried to run away. President al-Asad said that he reached the conclusion that Syrian Jews are Syrian citizens and lifted the restrictions on them. We made life easier for Syrian Jews, but I have learned that many of them have returned to Syria, al-Asad said. Another issue al-Asad referred to was that of Israeli MIA's. He said that Israel has asked almost the entire world to raise the issue with him. Every delegation and VIP that comes to me brings a letter and manifesto from the families of Israeli MIA's. I understand that it is a humanitarian issue and we respect the dignity of man. We always discuss it for moral and humanitarian reasons, but one of our officers once asked a U.S. Congressional delegation why Israel does not permit us to look for our missing, since there are many Syrian MIA's. Al-Asad said that peace is on the agenda and that he wants peace, but that what Syria is being offered is inappropriate and does satisfy the Arab people. When Israel makes offers with the aim of dragging its feet, that means that they do not take the concerns of others into account, or that they make light of them, or ridicule them. Al-Asad said he is always told to copy the late President al-Sadat, but I am not al-Sadat, he said. Do any of the international agreements or UN resolutions contain a clause that al-Asad has to copy al-Sadat? he asked. In reference to peace, he said that Israel has a policy of foot dragging and trying to put up obstacles. Al-Asad was asked why he does not agree to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and when will the peace talks be renewed. He said, and I quote: Our delegation is conducting negotiations with the Israeli delegation. When they make progress we will discuss anything necessary. There was an impromptu news conference tonight at the hotel where we are staying with the leader of the Jewish community in Damascus. The main speaker was Yusuf Jajati, deputy head of the community. [Jerusalem Israel Television Channel 1 Network in Hebrew at 1800 GMT on 9 March quotes the Committee of Arab Local Councils and the Supreme Arab Follow-Up Committee as saying that "Knesset Member 'Abd-al-Wahhab Darawshah's delegation does not represent the Israeli Arab community. The spokesmen told our correspondent Moti Eden that the delegation at best represents the Arab Democratic Party."]
