But We Are Still Alive..."] [Text] The picture of a broken and rapidly falling elevator as a reflection of Russia's present condition is no longer a novelty to anyone. When I visualize this picture, the question that comes to mind for me personally is: Does this mean that we will inevitably crash (after all, an elevator is not repaired while it is falling), and only then will we be able to begin to repair it? But is there a landing pad on which the elevator can plop down with passengers who can still think after the dizzying drop?.. A third of the residents of Novosibirsk Oblast are below the poverty line--this is a statistical fact. Sociologists give other figures: Only 9-12 percent of the respondents they polled believe that they are living normally, and the rest, in their personal opinion, are living in poverty. An interesting fact, people are starting to bake bread not only in the village but also in the city, and they are eating it now far more--alas, they cannot afford many other food products. The residents of Novosibirsk now consume half as much sugar and fish. But what can be said about vegetables, fruit, and meat! Do not be upset, food specialists console us, meat is generally harmful. In 1991, for example, they issued this recommendation: For an adult, 20.9 kilograms of meat per year is quite enough. One would like very much to believe them, if a year earlier these very same specialists had not cited an entirely different figure--they recommended that we eat 80.3 kilograms of meat in a year. How cleverly this turns out for us--we can adjust the "scientific" recommendation to current life. At present, however, there are no recommendations at all about what and how much we should eat. Obviously, there is only this advice: Whatever one can get... It seems that not one bright spot was seen in the stream of unpalatable information that the participants in the social policy section passed out in their speeches at the Novosibirsk scientific-practical conference "Strategy for Stabilization of the Region's Economy." But the fact itself, albeit not of a very equal partnership of the problems being discussed--economic and social--probably was the bright spot at a conference with a technocratically dominant idea. If we do not now make a decisive turn to the individual, and if, as before, we are fixated on searching for a resolution of the problem of "pure" economics, then within 25 years the economic mechanism will chew up the population, rendering it childless and sick. This is the forecast of Academician Vlail Kaznacheyev--it is by no means just an image, it is supported by sound calculations. Kaznacheyev said that a person also has his own KPD [efficiency factor]--the realization of his creative potential. How will society claim from each of us what is embedded by nature? In Russia, this KPD is 3-5 percent (out of 100 persons, only three to five do the work they were meant to do). The KPD of individuals in developed countries is four times higher. Will we catch up to the West in this indicator some day? For the time being, we are showing the world another phenomenon--not only a quantitative but also a qualitative demographic shock that is unprecedented in world history. An understanding of the fact that the time has come to change priorities and to rank the individual higher than the economy seems to be taking shape among Novosibirsk Oblast authorities--a specific social program has been established in the oblast, responsibility for whose implementation has been entrusted to the first deputy governor for the economy. At the conference, incidentally, it was proposed that the deputy governor for social problems be given the status of first deputy. That is the way it is in Yaroslavl, for example.. However, for the time being the Novosibirsk governor...does not have a deputy on social questions at all--the position is vacant. "We came to this conference not with fresh innovations," Kaznacheyev explained, "they have been in preparation for many years. About 100 practical proposals were contained in the recommendations that our section developed. But we think that it is necessary to make the section itself a permanent operation. So that we will be heard at more than just conferences." Novosibirsk Oblast has almost 600,000 families: With children (58 percent), and childless, two-parent, and single parent families (10 percent). It is on the basis of family policy that various socioeconomic problems can be resolved. But in each sphere it is difficult to resolve them in isolation. What can the Novosibirsk social assistance service do when for each insufficiently provided-for person (there are 482,000 of them in the oblast), it is able to allocate from its budget only 1,260 rubles [R] each per year, but the subsistence minimum is R55,250. The government proposes to feed the poor exclusively at the expense of the local budget. Maybe the law on the subsistence minimum, the possibility of the adoption of which was recently discussed in the State Duma, will somehow help set priorities? Meanwhile, the law and its normative documents on employment are far from being completed. But what if the problems of unemployment, migration, and social policy were all tied together in a common program of all of the CIS republics. After all, refugees continue to come to Siberia, but the number of jobs is being cut here as before... According to rumors, albeit not officially verified, as one of the speakers at the conference recounted, a modern Raskolnikov has appeared in Novosibirsk Oblast. He killed an elderly woman who, it appears, made loans at high interest rates to impoverished fellow-villagers. Village pensioners here and there now live better than those who work in agricultural joint-stock companies of machine operators and cattlebreeders, whose monthly earnings fluctuate in the range of R7-12,000 rubles. Will our elevator have to plunge downward much more? It is time to repair it.
