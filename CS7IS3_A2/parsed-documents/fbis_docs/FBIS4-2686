During their meeting here today, Jiang praised Silva's efforts for the development of friendly cooperation between the two countries. He said that although the two countries were far from each other geographically, and had different social systems, they had common interests in safeguarding the peace and stability of the world, and in developing bilateral ties. The president said that he was convinced that the Sino-Portuguese ties will develop smoothly as long as the principles of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit were adhered to. On the issue of Macao, he said that during Silva's visit to China in 1987, the two governments signed the joint declaration on the question of Macao, which was of great significance. Since the declaration became effective, Jiang said, the two countries had seriously abided by it. He added that it has been proved that the joint declaration had laid down a sound foundation for the stable development of Macao, and the friendly cooperation between the two sides on the issue, as well as set a good example for peaceful solution of the historic problems between different countries. Since there were only just over five years left for the transition period of Macao, Jiang said, and lots of work had to be done by the two countries, many problems had to be solved as soon as possible. He pointed out that as long as the two countries strengthened consultation and cooperation, various problems in the transition period would be solved properly. Silva said that since the signing of the joint declaration seven years ago, the two countries had been cooperative not only in carrying it out, but in other aspects. He said that the two countries shared views on many international issues, faced similar tasks of developing the national economy and improving people's livelihood, and had common interests in solving the problem of Macao. "I hope," he said, "the current visit will further the bilateral cooperation in fields of politics, economy and science." Jiang asked Silva to convey his regards to Portuguese President Mario Soares. Among those at the meeting were Peng Qingyuan, vice-chairman of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, Liu Xiliang, chairman of the Chinese Government Reception Committee and Vice-Minister of Radio, Film and Television, and Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Jiang Enzhu.
