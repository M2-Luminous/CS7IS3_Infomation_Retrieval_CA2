FBIS4-22032 "jptot016__l94089" JPRS-TOT-94-016-L JPRS Terrorism FOUO 14 April 1994 WEST EUROPE ITALY Huge Bomb Discovered on Outskirts of Rome Huge Bomb Discovered on Outskirts of Rome LD1404225394 Rome RAI Due Television Network in Italian 2125 GMT 14 Apr 94 LD1404225394 Rome RAI Due Television Network Italian BFN [Text] Several dozen kilos of explosives were found just over two hours ago on the outskirts of Rome. It is likely that the explosives were to be used in an attack on one of the most famous Mafia supergrasses -- Salvatore Totuccio Contorno. The supergrass lives in a secret hiding place, which is probably not too far from where the explosives were found. Francesco Vitale reports from the scene. [Begin Vitale recording] The Mafia has used 70 kilos of explosives to relaunch its offensive against the state and Mafia supergrasses. This evening fear returned to Rome, three kilometers down the Via Formellese, at the junction with the Cassia-Bis road. Five boxes containing explosives linked up to a car battery were placed in a gutter. It was a huge amount of explosives and could have caused a massacre. Carabinieri bomb disposal experts detonated the explosive device and what you are looking at is the crater made by the explosion. Why did the Mafia plant this bomb? The road where the bomb was found is one that supergrass Totuccio Contorno uses every day. He lives just a few kilometers away. The investigators remain cautious, but it is likely that the famous Mafia supergrass was the killers' target. Contorno has not collaborated with investigators for some time, but he is obviously still the Sicilian Mafia's number one enemy. It is still not known how the bomb was found. It was probably reported to the Carabinieri, perhaps by a passer-by. Following jailed Mafia boss of bosses Toto Riina's invectives against supergrasses, the latest was yesterday afternoon, Cosa Nostra has turned from words to deeds. Totuccio Contorno is the supergrass who has paid the highest price in terms of human life. The Mafia has killed nearly all his relatives, including his cousins three and four times removed. Luckily the bomb attack was thwarted, but once again Cosa Nostra has shown it can strike undisturbed just as easily in Rome as Palermo. [end recording]
