Kimmel or Terry Vawter, California Marketing Field Office, Marketing Order Administration Branch, Fruit and Vegetable Division, Agricultural Marketing Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2202 Monterey Street, Suite 102B, Fresno, California, 93721; telephone: (209) 487&hyph;5901. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Pursuant to Marketing Order No. 916 (7 CFR Part 916) and Marketing Order No. 917 (7 CFR Part 917), hereinafter referred to as the ``orders,'' and the applicable provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674) hereinafter referred to as the ``Act,'' it is hereby directed that a referendum be conducted within the period January 6, 1995, through February 3, 1995, among growers in the production area who, during the period April 1, 1994, through November 23, 1994, (which period is hereby determined to be a representative period for purposes of such referendum), were engaged in the production of nectarines and peaches covered by the said marketing orders to ascertain whether continuance of the orders is favored by the growers. The Secretary of Agriculture has determined that continuance referenda are an effective means for ascertaining whether growers favor continuation of marketing order programs. The Secretary would consider termination of the orders if less than two-thirds of the growers voting in the referendum and growers of less than two-thirds of the volume of nectarines or peaches represented in the referendum favor continuance. However, in evaluating the merits of continuance versus termination, the Secretary will not only consider the results of the continuance referendum, but also all other relevant information concerning the operation of the orders and the relative benefits and disadvantages to growers, handlers, and consumers in order to determine whether continued operation of the orders would tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. In any event, section 8c(16)(B) of the Act requires the Secretary to terminate an order whenever the Secretary finds that a majority of all growers favor termination, and such majority produced for market more than 50 percent of the commodity covered under such order. In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. chapter 35), the ballot materials that will be used in the referendum herein ordered have been submitted to and approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and have been assigned OMB No. 0581&hyph;0072 for nectarines and OMB No. 0581&hyph;0080 for peaches. It has been estimated that it will take an average of 20 minutes for each of the approximately 3,500 growers of nectarines and peaches to participate in the voluntary referendum balloting. It should be noted that pears grown in California were also covered under M.O. 917. The Pear Commodity Committee unanimously recommended suspension of the pear provisions under the order, because such provisions are no longer needed. The California Bartlett pear industry is now functioning under a California Pear Marketing Program (State pear program), and is no longer using the pear order provisions. The State pear program, developed by the California Bartlett pear industry and the California Department of Food and Agriculture, is similar to the Federal pear program. An order directing that a referendum be conducted to determine whether pear growers favor continuance of the Federal pear program was published in the Federal Register on March 3, 1994 (59 FR 10053). The representative period for the conduct of such referendum is June 1, 1994, through November 30, 1994. The pear referendum will be conducted within the period beginning December 1, 1994, and ending February 15, 1995. Kurt J. Kimmel and Terry Vawter of the California Marketing Field Office, Fruit and Vegetable Division, Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA, are hereby designated as the referendum agents of the Secretary of Agriculture to conduct such referendum. The procedure applicable to the referendum shall be the ``Procedure for the Conduct of Referenda in Connection With Marketing Orders for Fruits, Vegetables, and Nuts Pursuant to the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as Amended'' (7 CFR Part 900.400 et seq .). Ballots will be mailed to all growers of record and may also be obtained from the referendum agents and from their appointees at the above address.
