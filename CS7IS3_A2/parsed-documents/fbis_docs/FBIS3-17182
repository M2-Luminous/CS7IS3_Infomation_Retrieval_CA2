Having been elevated to the level of a ministry, his agency continues to perform the functions of guarding the Russian establishment. No one, however, knows how wide its powers are because MSD activities are guided by a classified statute. In the opinion of acting Constitutional Court Chairman Nikolay Vitruk, at the present moment the MSD can bring pressure to bear on any, the most senior politicians of the country. Indeed, in Vitruk's words, the MSD "is in charge" not only of bodyguards but also of government limousines, special communications facilities, health centers, stores, tailoring establishments, and the other goodies of former special distributors. Thus, on the one hand Minister Barsukov is supposed to take orders from the premier and his vice premiers. But on the other, it is on himself that all of them depend.
