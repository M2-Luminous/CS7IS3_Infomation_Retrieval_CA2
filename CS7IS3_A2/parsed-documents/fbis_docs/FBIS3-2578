Because the work in management and other aspects failed to keep abreast with the situation of rapid development, the blind expansion of satellite ground stations and cable television stations, poor censorship of programs, and other problems have cropped up in some areas in Tibet in the past couple of years. To solve these problems and to subject the utilization of ground facilities for receiving statllite signals and the management of cable television to legal administration for orderly development, the regional radio and television department, public security bureau, and state security department will conduct a comprehensive inspection, registration, and rectification campaign. All units should immediately stop receiving and relaying programs from the BBC; the Chinese Channel, the Entertainment Channel, and the Sports Channel of Star TV; and other television stations outside Tibet. Units owning two ground satellite stations must close down one of them. The Holiday Inn and other foreign-funded hotels, which have registered to receive programs from outside Tibet, should immediately stop receiving and relaying programs from the BBC. Units wishing to receive programs from outside Tibet should undergo examination and approval procedures again. Units which have applied for the installation of such facilities and have received permits for installation, permit-holding units which have clearified the kinds of programs they are receiving, and units whose installed facilities have passed assessment and have obtained permits to broadcast programs must go through relevant procedures again with the departments concerned by 5 April. Those who do not comply with this order will be punished strictly according to rules, and those who are involved in serious cases will be charged with criminal responsibility.
