Recently, intelligence reports revealed that some LNTG [Liberia National Transition Government] ministers had a meeting in Guinea, in an attempt to destabilize the ongoing peace process. The report said these ministers are financing armed groups to attack Nimba and Bong counties from Guinea. The NPFL said any attack out of Guinea will meet with reciprocal action. In a letter to Guinean President Lansana Conte, NPFL leader Charles Gankay Taylor urged him not to allow his territory to be used as a springboard for launching attacks on Liberia. He said any covert assistance by Guinea to armed groups attempting to derail the peace process in Liberia, will amount to a violation of international law and an encroachment on the territorial integrity of Liberia. President Taylor said the brotherly relations between Guinea and Liberia will continue, and a few power-seekers and unpatriotic citizens of Liberia should not be allowed to destroy the lives of peoples of the two countries.
