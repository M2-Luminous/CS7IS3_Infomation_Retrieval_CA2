The sources told LOS TIEMPOS in La Paz that the subversive group that was broken up in 1991 resumed its terrorist activities in La Paz, Cochabamba, and Sucre by calling for armed insurrection in various rural districts. They said this subversive organization "plans to act with greater force" in La Paz and Cochabamba Departments, and that the signs of subversive activity "are the writing on walls seen by state intelligence in the two departments' rural districts." They indicated that the EGTK, in contrast to other guerrilla organizations with similar characteristics such as the Nestor Paz Zamora Command (CNPZ) or the Zarate Willka Armed Liberation Forces (FAL-ZW), "still have ideological leaders because not all of them were arrested by the intelligence organizations." The sources added: "An example is the recent capture of Victor Poma after three years. He was accused of terrorist activities and actions against state security." [passage omitted]
