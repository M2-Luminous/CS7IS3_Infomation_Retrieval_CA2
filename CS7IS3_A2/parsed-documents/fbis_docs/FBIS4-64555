"We cannot be satisfied with delaying or vague replies," Juppe stressed in a speech in Brussels on Monday evening to the Royal Institute of International Relations. The foreign minister referred to the EU responsibilities to these countries at a time when the "order of Yalta" as decried so much by France and Europe has collapsed. "We welcomed the fall of the Berlin Wall as a first step toward a larger Europe (...). It is time to give concrete effect to this statement, by setting a date for the start of membership negotiations," he added. Flexible Transitions The French foreign minister also recommended a body of "pragmatic measures" designed to facilitate this process. Among other things, he believes this should include a list of countries interested in future negotiations and a certain "flexibility" when examining membership procedures. He proposed an association of future member states in the area of common foreign and security policy prior to EU full membership, together with "transitional arrangements" allowing candidates to adapt their economy to common EU policies. However, France sees the institutional reforms for a Europe enlarged from 20 to 25 member states as a precondition for such moves. "Everyone agrees that the present institutional framework, which is already ill-suited to a Europe of 16, will bring problems which will be difficult to overcome in a Union of 20 or 25 members," Juppe stressed. The French minister gave the example of a parliament which would include 716 members, a Commission of 24 members, a presidency once every 10 years for each member state, and a Council of Ministers paralyzed by sessions taking four hours just for every participant to speak. Even if "the search for unanimously acceptable solutions proves difficult," France "will be the determined adversary of a status quo which we would see as tantamount to paralysis or dilution," he added, calling upon the Twelve to already start the process of reflection with a view to the 1996 intergovernmental conference. The Principle of Subsidiarity During his talk, Alain Juppe also stressed respect for national identities: While accepting the transference of major powers to the EU, he stressed the essential value of the principle of subsidiarity in his eyes. "Europe must only substitute for or complement the member states where its action is strictly necessary: The crisis of confidence (...) is no doubt partly due to our lack of understanding of this principle of reality." France will therefore be very attentive to this point.
