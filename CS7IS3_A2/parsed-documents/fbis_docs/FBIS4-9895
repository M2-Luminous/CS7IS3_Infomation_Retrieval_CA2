Miguel Mancera Aguayo also becomes the bank's first governor. So begins a new phase for Banxico as an autonomous organization, within an atmosphere of stability in the area of monetary policy, guarantees in the fight against inflation, and the highest figure in international reserves the country has ever seen. This means the central financial institution will have independent control over domestic credit and no government agency will have the authority to order it to adjudicate funds to any other. This will ensure the stability of the national currency's buying power. Miguel Mancera Aguayo will head the organization as its first governor. He was a key figure in restricting the Mexican economy. He had the ability to remain calm even in the most difficult of times. [Begin Mancera recording] The Board of Governors must administrate Banxico's credit portfolio to attain stability in the national currency's buying power [end recording] Mancera Aguayo is the author of the consumer price stability plan, which served as the basic economic policy strategy. He was tasked with lowering the inflation rate from 160 percent in 1987 to annual figures under zero [as heard] and monthly figures of only four-tenths of a percent. Banxico's independence is another reason for the local and international financial community to feel confident. It confirms the continuity and honesty of the current economic plans. Miguel Mancera Aguayo will hold the post of bank governor for three years and nine months. Different from the past, Mancera will not be alone at the head of Banxico because he will have four assistant governors to fill out the Board of Directors.
