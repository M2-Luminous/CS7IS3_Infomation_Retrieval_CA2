Noting that the victory of the Cuban revolution was an epoch-making event that terminated domination and subjugation, backwardness and poverty on the land of Cuba and opened a way of socialism guaranteeing sovereignty and independence, creation and prosperity, the editorial article says: The 35 years covered by the Cuban people after the victory of the revolution have been a course of constant confrontation and struggle with the imperialist reactionaries and days in which they decorated their history with creation and innovation. The socialist changes and the victorious progress of the revolution in those years clearly indicate that no force on earth can block the road of socialism of the heroic Cuban people. The Korean people note with high appreciation that the Cuban people are defending the country's sovereignty and national dignity and accelerating socialist construction, not yielding to any adversity. The militant comradeship and unity between the peoples of Korea and Cuba have been further consolidated and developed in the course of overcoming trials together and struggling hand in hand for the common cause. Friendship and unity between Korea and Cuba are an excellent model of comradely relations between the peoples of revolutionary countries. The Korean people will, in the future, too, make every possible effort to strengthen and fully develop their friendship and unity with the Cuban people. The just cause of the Cuban people will certainly end in victory.
