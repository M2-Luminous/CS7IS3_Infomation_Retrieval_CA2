FR941110-0-00003 FR941110-0-00001 Olive production has fluctuated from a low of 24,200 tons during the 1972&hyph;73 crop year to a high of 163,023 tons during the 1992&hyph;93 crop year. The California Olive Committee (committee) indicated that 1993&hyph;94 production totalled about 120,049 tons. Total production for the 1994&hyph;95 crop year is estimated to be 95,000 tons. Because olive trees need to restore their nutrients from one season to the next, various varieties of olives produced in California have alternate bearing tendencies. This results in high production one year and low the next, which usually causes the total crop to vary greatly from year to year. This crop year's estimated production is expected to be smaller than last year due to weather conditions early in the season which resulted in poor fruit pollination. However, based on past production and marketing experience, the committee believes that handlers will need smaller sized olives during the 1994&hyph;95 crop year to meet market demand for limited use styles of canned olives. Limited use olives are too small to meet the minimum size requirements established for whole and whole pitted canned ripe olives. However, they are large enough to be suitable for processing into limited use styles such as wedges, halves, slices, or segments. Absent this action, olives which are smaller than those authorized for whole and whole pitted canning uses would have to be disposed of by handlers into non-canning uses such as crushing into oil. Paragraph (a)(3) of ยง932.52 of the order provides that processed olives smaller than the sizes prescribed for whole and whole pitted styles may be used for limited uses if recommended by the committee and approved by the Secretary. Until October 1, 1991, paragraph (a)(3) also prescribed minimum sizes, by variety group, which could be authorized for use in the production of limited use styles by the Secretary. Effective October 1, 1991, certain non-canning size disposition requirements specified in ยง932.51(a)(3) and minimum sizes authorized for limited use specified in ยง932.52(a)(3) of the marketing order were suspended. The committee may now recommend the use of olives for limited uses that are smaller than those previously permitted under the order. Minimum size and grade requirements may be recommended annually by the committee and approved by the Secretary. During the past three crop years, 1991&hyph;92, 1992&hyph;93, and 1993&hyph;94, the committee recommended sizes smaller than those previously authorized. The minimum sizes which could previously be authorized for limited uses were established in a 1971 amendment to the marketing order. Olives smaller than the prescribed minimum sizes which could be authorized for limited uses had to be disposed of through less profitable non-canning uses such as crushing for oil. Returns to producers are lower on fruit used for such purposes. The use of smaller sized olives for limited use styles has been authorized in all but two crop years since the order was promulgated in 1965. This final rule finalizes an interim final rule that will help growers and handlers to meet the growing market demand for limited use style olives based upon current conditions. The limited use size requirements allow the use of sizes which would otherwise have to be disposed of for less profitable, non-canning uses. Permitting the use of such smaller olives for limited use styles would therefore improve grower returns. On July 13, 1994, the committee recommended by a vote of 15&hyph;1, to establish grade and size regulations for limited use size olives during the 1994&hyph;95 crop year pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of ยง932.52 of the order. The one handler member who dissented was concerned that approval of limited use size olives would be detrimental to handlers, due to already large inventories of such olives from the two previous seasons. The recommended grade and size requirements are the same as those established during the 1990&hyph;91 crop year, which means slightly larger minimum sizes than were in effect during the 1991&hyph;92, 1992&hyph;93, and 1993&hyph;94 crop years. The specified sizes for the different olive variety groups are the minimum sizes which are deemed desirable for use in the production of limited use styles at this time. As in past years, permitting the use of the smaller olives in the production of limited use styles allowed handlers to take advantage of the strong market for halved, segmented, sliced, and chopped canned ripe olives. Handlers will be able to market more olives with this relaxation in size requirements than under regulations effective prior to the interim final rule.
