Disaggregated Accounts. Indicate in Item 5(b) whether other Large Traders that are owned or controlled by or under common ownership or control with the Large Trader have independently filed a Form 13H and been assigned LTIDs.

See Special Instructions to Form 13h_Items 6 Through 8_For Further Instructions Regarding Disaggregation By a Large Trader. C. Instructions for Form 13H_Items 6 Through 8 Lists of Large Trader Accounts. Items 6 through 8 are organized along the three capacities in which a Large Trader may act with respect to a single account (i.e., owner, controller, or custodian). The Schedules correspond to Items 6 through 8 and are organized to capture different combinations of these capacities, based upon the Large Trader's knowledge of information about accounts and the disclosure of ownership to the broker-dealer carrying the account. The Schedules to Items 6 through 8 require a Large Trader to list information about the following types of accounts: Schedule 6a. Accounts that are owned and controlled by the Large Trader, in whole or in part. Schedule 6b. Accounts that are owned but not controlled by the Large Trader, in whole or in part, which are controlled by others. Schedule 7a. Accounts that are not owned but are controlled by the Large Trader, in whole or in part, which are fully disclosed as to ownership. Schedule 7b. Accounts that are not owned but are controlled by the Large Trader, in whole or in part, which are undisclosed as to ownership. Schedule 8. Accounts maintained by the Large Trader as custodian or nominee only, which are undisclosed as to ownership. Depending on a Large Trader's choice for aggregation of accounts, one or more of these schedules must be filed with Form 13H. The schedules attached to Form 13H must reflect the types of accounts that the Large Trader has chosen to aggregate into its Form 13H. Information Required in the Schedules. The Large Trader must provide full names, addresses, and all other information required on Schedules 6a through 8. Large Traders may attach internally produced lists of accounts to the Schedules provided that such lists capture all required information in a format substantially similar to each of the Schedules. If the Large Trader does not know the LTID or DTC ID System number of other Large Traders at the time of filing, it must provide all of such numbers in its next Annual Filing. Qualifications of the Designated Contact Person. The Large Trader is required to designate a contact person for information regarding the accounts listed on each Schedule. The designated contact person must: (i) be a natural person; (ii) be employed by or otherwise affiliated with the Large Trader; (iii) be authorized by the Large Trader to respond to any inquiries or requests from the Commission; (iv) have personal knowledge of all orders and transactions in the accounts listed on the Schedule or be in a position to obtain this information promptly from other persons who have such personal knowledge; and (v) have the authority to provide prompt assistance with the disaggregation of the listed accounts. Disaggregation of Aggregated and Undisclosed Accounts. In the event that the Commission requests, all broker-dealers or large traders that carry or maintain aggregated or undisclosed accounts may be required to assist in the disaggregation of transactions or accounts. The Commission may request disaggregation in any reasonable manner considering the operational capabilities of each broker-dealer or large trader. For example, the Commission may require the Large Trader to disaggregate accounts or transactions of the other persons and Large Traders listed in Form 13H_Item 5(a). The Commission also may require the Large Trader to disaggregate accounts or transactions of the other Large Traders listed in Schedules 7b and 8. All Large Traders That Control or Maintain Omnibus or Otherwise Undisclosed Accounts Have a Duty to Supervise These Accounts to Assure that Persons Effecting Transactions Through These accounts Comply with the Identification Requirements of Rule 13h-1 and to Assure That the Information Contained in Schedules 7b AND 8 is Accurate and Complete.
