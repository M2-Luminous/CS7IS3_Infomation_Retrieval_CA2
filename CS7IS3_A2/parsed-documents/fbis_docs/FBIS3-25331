[Chissano] I think it has been positive because we have not had war since October 1992. We have taken slow but steady steps, and I think that people are getting more confident and more certain that war will not come back. I even believe that there is more trust on the Mozambique National Resistance's [Renamo] side now. At least they know that, whatever the outcome of the elections, they can, if they wish, continue their political work without harassment. They have been talking about the difficulties of their work, and the tendency is to lay the blame for those difficulties at someone else's door, as if the Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo] did not have its own difficulties. Yet, little by little, they are realizing that those difficulties are inherent to party work and that, if they have the courage to continue, they will certainly be able to do their work, irrespective of the results of the upcoming elections. This gives them a little bit more courage and that, in itself, is the result of the correct implementation of the General Peace Accord. By this, I do not mean to say that there have been no lows along the way. There were some lows that were discouraging at times, but they were overcome thanks to perseverance, patience, and understanding. I would have liked to say that this was a mutual thing, but the truth is that much more has been demanded from the government than from Renamo, even though we know that there have been serious violations of the accord that cannot be regarded as fleeting, sporadic, or isolated violations. They have been violations of principle, and those violations have come from Renamo. There is no doubt about that. Well, despite all that, I can say that the implementation of the General Peace Accord has been positive. I think we may enjoy better days when the process of demobilization and reintegration of the demobilized soldiers gets off the ground. That is a process that will also know difficulties, more often than not because demobilized soldiers will not always be aware of the state's duties toward them. [Moyana] Mr. President, do you believe that elections will be held in October of this year? [Chissano] Yes, I do believe that. You will remember that elections were to be held one year after the signing of the General Peace Accord. It was believed that one year would have been sufficient for elections to be held and, as a matter of fact, it should have been sufficient. There were delays, however, and we know the reasons for those delays. These problems have been overcome, and so we now have exactly the same time we would have had if everything had gone according to plan. We are now in January, and we are already preparing to begin training the principal section of the Armed Forces. Many soldiers have already been confined. The Electoral Law has been approved, and bids are under way concerning material preparations for elections. With the Electoral Law issue settled, provinces must already be thinking about who their deputies will be, in other words, they must be thinking about their candidates. Each party must already be preparing for elections. I even think that, in one form or another, people are already being educated with a view to participating in the upcoming elections. [Moyana] Mr. President, concerning the delays in the implementation of the General Peace Accord, what part of the blame would you lay at the door of your government? [Chissano] Let me see...there may be some small things...they are so insignificant, really.... [Moyana] Concerning the issue of housing for Renamo, does the Mozambican Government not recognize that it could have done more to expedite the process? [Chissano] I would say no. The issue of housing is not the government's responsibility. If Renamo had really wanted to cooperate, it would not even have needed to ask for housing. There are so many parties whose leaders have come from abroad but who have not asked for housing. There is the case of the Mozambique United Front, Fumo, for instance. As an individual, rather than as a politician, Fumo President Domingos Arouca was the first to discuss the issue of housing with me. The problem of housing for Mr. Arouca was only recently settled, but his party is functioning. Look at the example of Mr. Jeque, who also comes from Portugal and belongs to Fumo. He looked for a house and a job. He is employed because he had the will to do it. I can cite other examples: Mr. Massinga Chicuarra [not further identified], who had been abroad but who has come back and found himself a place to stay. There is Mr. Padimbe, who belongs to another party, and there is [Mozambican Nationalist Movement President] Maximo Dias. Thus, if Renamo had wanted to cooperate, it could have begun its work without having to depend on such housing. Well, the government has complied with the terms of the General Peace Accord because this is not a matter of giving houses away. The government does not carry houses in its pockets like so many nickels and dimes. The government had to look for these houses. It did so, and it found them. In some instances, it was even necessary to remove the tenants, but Renamo only realized at a later stage that it hd to participate in the search for the houses it would be using. It was a matter of understanding things. This understanding was a bit slow in coming, but it finally came. Perhaps there are, but, off the cuff, I fail to see the reason for the government to be blamed for any major delays... [Moyana] What about the issue of logistical conditions for Renamo advisers to the provincial governors? Did the government act within a reasonable time? [Chissano] Regarding the matter of Renamo's advisers, the delay was, once again, due to Renamo itself. You will recall that it was in August that Renamo made that request. We approved it, but I only received the list before I left on leave. Those officials were not appointed, not because I was on leave, but because the territorial administration minister was not in, either. That happened in December, when everyone was on leave, but it is my belief that, even if I had continued on leave, the appointments would have been made as soon as the territorial administration minister returned. As for material conditions, once we had the men we would see why there were conditions that depended on the international community's good will. When that matter came up for discussion, the problem of increased expenses and what they would represent to the state was one of our first concerns. We also discussed the matter of the premises needed. Now, to encourage us to make a decision, the international community expressed its readiness to help us. Unfortunately, that help did not come with the speed the promises were made. It was a matter of putting up prefabricated homes in all provinces. There were even promises that more houses than we had asked for would be put up so as to meet the needs of state workers but, yet again, the international community failed to deliver as rapidly as possible. I remember that that promise was made at a meeting attended by all ambassadors plus the United Nations. That promise was made when I handed in a report on the talks with Mr. Dhlakama and on the material difficulties I foresaw. The answer: "Do not worry!" Well, I did not stop worrying because I think that advisers can be received in the required conditions in some provinces, but not in others, meaning that other problems would be left unresolved. Renamo itself will need other premises for its political work. Once again, though, delays here cannot be blamed on a lack of material conditions. They should be blamed, first and foremost, on the absence of candidates to fill in those posts since August, resulting in a delay of five months. [Moyana] Does the lack of regular reshuffles mean that you, Mr. President, are satisfied with your ministers' performance? [Chissano] It is my opinion that a government reshuffle should not occur only when the head of state is unhappy. It is, in fact, health to reshuffle the cabinet when everybody is still on good terms. Now, if you talk about reshuffles, there are people who are outside and who have the desire, or perhaps because they believe that a certain official is not acting as wished, and they think a reshuffle would help. [sentence as published] Perhaps because of the trust they place in me, they say: "Look, the president is watching and he will change things. He will replace this person with another." However, there is one standard that many people do not follow, either, and that is to give time to people because people who make mistakes, who have some shortcomings, often feel it themselves and they know they must find ways to overcome those problems. So, there is the need to give people time. I might reshuffle the government today. I might remove this person and bring in another, but I have no idea what the new person will do. There is often the need to give time, help, educate, instruct, and so forth. There will be a time when people will say: "Now, this fellow is no good for this task." There are times, however, when a person is moved because he has shown aptitude and we need that person for other duties where we think he might do better, or where we might need reinforcements. Then, we shift that person. Well, all those assessments have been made. First, prior to the signing of the General Peace Accord, there was the need to strengthen some sectors, to change routine. In some cases, it was not because officials performed poorly. Those measures were needed at the provincial and central levels, but we decided that, as we were going through a process of change, it would have been good for change to occur with the same people at the helm and then, after that change, we would see how to go about a reshuffle. Personally, that is what I thought. Well, the peace accord was delayed and so our decision was delayed. Now we are preparing for elections, people are doing their work, and once again there are rumors going around -- they are rumors because I have never given a thought to what people say outside, they think it and they believe it is reality -- believe me, I have been in some very delicate situations. The rumors were so many that they even affected people who were directly involved and who began to think that the president was considering shifting them about without any explanation. It is not obligatory for me to provide explanations, but, with the trust that exists among us, there is a bad atmosphere when people start to talk and the interested party knows nothing about it. That is because there was nothing like that from my side. I think that those rumors about a government reshuffle reflect the interests of an individual or of a group of persons. I must tell you that the members of government have greatly improved the quality of their work over the last two years or so. There is the need to understand that they, too, are human beings, that they have their weak moments, that they can be uncertain about the future, and so on. There is good morale today, however, much better than anyone might expect, this despite the difficult work they have to do in precarious financial and economic conditions in all sectors. Thus, I am satisfied with the members of my staff, but that does not mean that there will not be a reshuffle for the reasons that I have indicated earlier. I am going to see when a reshuffle is right, so that I can count on the input of all involved in the various sectors. [Moyana] It has been widely said in national political circles that citizen Joaquim Chissano should publicly make it clear when he is visiting a province as head of state and when he is visiting it as Frelimo Party chairman. It is also said that you use the same General State Budget in both capacities. Would you like to comment, Mr. President? [Chissano] I can tell you the following: I have trouble traveling as pure and simple citizen Joaquim Chissano. That is another distinction they are not mentioning. I would like to go wherever I might want to go. For instance, I might want to go to that island alone with my wife, but no one will allow me to do that. There is always the idea that it is the president of the Republic who is traveling, even though I would have liked to go there to swim and eat fish like any other citizen -- like you, for instance. The fact of the matter is that if I went to some province to do my party work, even if I paid for my own ticket -- and I would have liked to pay for my ticket to take an aircraft, a small aircraft -- people would say: "No, not on such a small aircraft." Were I to travel by car, they would say: "That is fine, the car can go, but there must be an escort, the protocol officials must also go, and so on." I would like to ask: What would change? The fact is that, up to now, I have traveled as head of state and I take advantage of those trips to do party work because I have no way to travel as Frelimo Party chairman without that being linked to the fact that I am head of state. It would be very convenient for me to separate those functions, but I cannot be dissociated from my position as head of state. It is impossible. Nor can I allow my party to be at a disadvantage just because its chairman is also the head of state. Nevertheless, that is bound to happen, whether you be head of state or some other official. For instance, if a minister who is also a Frelimo Party Central Committee member goes to some province and is asked questions by party members, he cannot just turn around and say: "No, I cannot talk because I am here on state duties." That is impossible, too. It would mean that parties fighting for power stop being parties when they get to power. These are party cadres we are talking about, and any party coming to power will have its cadres. Now, what is really necessary is to know how to use state property without impairing state functions. One does not spend more money just by talking of party matters when on a state visit. One spends exactly the same.... [Moyana] The fact is, should that be true, Frelimo will enjoy great political advantage over the other parties, because a large number of its members are involved in state duties and are using state funds to do their party work. There is also the example of the Frelimo Party secretary general, who is a minister, traveling to the provinces in his capacity as minister, thereby using state funds, but going there to tackle party issues.... [Chissano] But that will also be the case with any other party. If you have to travel just to do party work as secretary general, obviously the party will pay the expenses, but let me tell you something: Even then, that official will also be doing state work. He cannot stop doing state work simply because the party has paid his expenses. The truth is, though, that when the emphasis is placed on party work, we make every effort to ensure that party funds are made available for that work and not the contrary. [Moyana] Do you think that the party that wins the upcoming elections should take all or that there should be a preelectoral multiparty accord concerning a government of national unity? [Chissano] With regard to that issue, it seems to me that we are beginning to see -- not all over the world but with some international observers -- a distortion of democracy because of events in Angola. It is even beginning to seem as though democracy is of no use to Africa. That is absurd. Some seem to be sorry that they supported an accelerated implementation of multiparty democracy, so they start talking about the need to put the cart before the horse. All over the world, there is much talk of national unity and of national interests. I also endorse national unity views because that is the Frelimo Party's philosophy, and I grew up with it, working for national unity, so there is no need for anybody to tell me about the need for it. Purely and simply, national unity must be based on real foundations. We have created a multiparty system to allow the people to be consulted in different ways. There is the need to see what the people's response will be and, on the basis of that response, to look for the best ways to guarantee national unity. The people will dictate those ways. Perhaps they will be dictated even during the electoral campaign. We will have to see the amount of support the existing parties receive, and we will to see whether Frelimo needs to consider it. The electoral campaign and the outcome of elections will provide indications. The party that has those responsibilities will have enough data to be able to say what will be needed to guarantee political stability in the country, what ought to be done to ensure greater national unity, and what should be done to guarantee greater participation by the people in all political, economic, and social matters. Sometimes there is the tendency to ignore all that and think that, just because election results were not accepted in Angola, things must be done artificially. Where does that leave democracy, though? What is democracy good for, then? What is the point of consulting with the people? In other words, we would be consulting with the people and saying: "Elect me but do not worry; this is just for the sake of electing, because we are all going to govern, so there is no problem!" You would have me saying in my campaign: "Give some votes to this party and some to that other one." That is not my duty. It is each party's duty to get votes, because we want to know exactly what people think. So, each party should put forward its program with sincerity, without thinking whether it will be in power or not. The people will choose some program and then whoever wins can say: "The people have chosen me, but they have these national unity leanings." There might even be the need to reconcile parts of programs and correct parts of your program. This is how I see democracy. You cannot go around misleading people, saying "you choose, but we decide who governs." That cannot be done.... [Moyana] There are those who insist on a formal signing of a multiparty preelectoral compromise on this issue. [Chissano] What does this mean in terms of democracy? Where has it ever happened in that way? That has never happened anywhere. The United States, England, and Portugal do not do so. If the Peace Accord negotiations had taken a different turn, we would have acted in another way. You will recall that in 1987-88, I was already saying that if Renamo wanted to lay down their weapons and return, we would all together study how to reorganize our society. We would adopt new forms of elections. I even went as far as researching who was who in Renamo, what rank they held, and what they could do and could not do. In fact I did not know any of them. I did this because I was very worried about the transitional phase that would permit all of us to study what changes could be made. We did not get any reply until the adoption of a new constitution in 1990 creating multipartyism. During negotiations Renamo accepted the democratic challenge. So we are now facing a democratic challenge, and after all this we are not going to act as if nothing has happened. [Moyana] It has been reported by government officials that there are conflicts about positions and prospects between the IMF, the World Bank, and the Mozambican Government. Someone in your government has even said that due to IMF and World Bank impositions, the Mozambican Government's sovereignty is no more than five percent. Is there any truth in that? [Chissano] No, that is not true. In reality our country has been able to maintain a good relationship with the IMF. We believe we still exercise most of our sovereignty, and we comply with the demands posed by international cooperation, like every country does. This is to ensure coordination in the management of funds used in monetary and financial activities, as well as foreign currency, productive activities all over the world, and transactions in general. So, there is always a part of sovereignty that one has to give away. I can even say that at present blocs are being formed and being strengthened. So, everything we do goes through negotiations. We have spent many hours and nights negotiating. If we did not respect our sovereignty, we would not take a long time negotiating. There have been a number of demands made by the World Bank and IMF that we have satisfied at once. They may seem to be correct solutions, but we, as a responsible government, have to study the consequences they will have for the country. Then we have to take daring steps wherever we feel we can withstand the impact for some time, because it is a reality that reforms are necessary. The economic recovery program is a necessary program. The IMF has its rules. The government must decide whether to follow them. We are always sovereign; we can choose. If we believed there was a better way, we would take it. We will not be prevented from doing so. In some cases we do so, as for instance in the devaluation of the currency. We have not devalued our currency as requested by the World Bank and the IMF. We were supposed to do so with greater speed, but that would have been more painful for our population. We have to administer the medicine in doses, but the impact of the resistance may lead to the deterioration of the economy, as in the case of civil servants' salaries and budget deficit; we have been allowing a comfortable deficit but have to tighten it little by little. Whenever an economic measure is announced everyone cries, but this is not an imposition by the IMF or the World Bank, but by economic laws. [Moyana] People in this country talk a great deal about the domination of the south over central and northern Mozambique. People speak of continued centralization in Maputo of all mechanisms of economic, political, and cultural decisions. As a solution, people have a number of hypotheses: federalism and elected -- rather than appointed -- governors, administrators, and mayors. I would like to know what do you think about that. [Chissano] I believe we should continue studying this issue. As you know, the Constitution left this issue open so that a study can be carried out. The study is already underway and is being supervised and financed by international bodies. A responsible study is underway because a solution cannot be found with closed eyes. A profound analysis is needed. You spoke, for instance, about governors. Who can tell whether a governor, and not any other figure, should be elected? I know countries where a region has an elected body, and a representative of the central government with specific powers; who would this representative be? A governor or administrator? Up to which level shall we have these figures? One should study all this. One should study the relationship between elected and traditional power. All this is being dealt with in the study we are carrying out. In fact we have already begun decentralizing where it seems to us obvious that we should, particularly in the economic sector. The provincial governments are already making a number of decisions, and this year we will experience a broader decentralization in the economic sector. Now on the issue of north dominating south or vice versa -- some people may choose to view it like that, but I do not see any domination. Let us be very cold; let us take, for instance, a place near the Mozambican capital such as Gaza Province, where the president of the Republic, the first Frelimo chairman, the second Frelimo chairman and first president of the Republic, come from. Is there any industry in that area? There are some cashew nuts industries, which are paralyzed, and a rice peeling industry. In Cabo Delgado, however, where there was no industry before independence, now there are textile and marble industries, and the graphite industry is already in an advanced stage, and there is already a big cotton complex in Montepuez, and there is the Pemba harbor. It is not possible now to enumerate everything accomplished by this government. We could talk of Massingir but the reconstruction of that infrastructure began in the colonial era. Gaza has nothing! I do not see anything there. In what way is the south dominating the north? I would have said the same concerning Niassa Province if the infrastructures had not been paralyzed by war. You will recall that the biggest poultry farm in the country was scheduled to be built in Niassa, and the pavilions are still there, paralyzed. The biggest livestock feed factory is scheduled to be built there. The nation's breadbasket would be in Niassa with a project of 400,000 hectares, and this was in the north. There were no 400,000 hectares in the south. There are no Morrua and Marropino mines in the south; those are in Zambezia. The gold mines are in Manica Province, and all of these are new things, developed after independence. Concerning people who are part of the government, the secretary general of the party is from Sofala Province and belongs to the Ndau tribe. The defense minister is from the north. The south is not a monolithic unit. The prime minister is from Inhambane, but he was not born in the capital of the province. He is from one of the districts, not from Maputo or Gaza. The education minister is not from the south; he is from Manica Province. His tribe is not Ndau or Sena; he is a Manica, and no one speaks of this tribe. The minister of culture is not from the south, but from the north. He is a Macua. Now, what domination are we talking about? In terms of education and health all perspectives are turning more and more toward the provinces.
