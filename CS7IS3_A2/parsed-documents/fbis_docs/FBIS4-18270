As he left Dublin airport for London on the first leg of an Easter trip to Cyprus, Mr Reynolds said Sinn Fein had a responsibility to explain itself. Responding to a statement issued by Sinn Fein's president, Gerry Adams, the Irish premier said he was unsure what points the hard-line Republican party needed clarifying. He said London and Dublin had always been at one on their approach to the Declaration and added: "If one studies their (Sinn Fein's) latest statement, it is difficult to know what they mean." The Irish premier, whose aides have stressed his close-to-anger disappointment with the IRA's limited ceasefire, also made clear once more that he did not think 72 hours was an adequate period to prompt developments toward peace. "There is a momentum for peace and three days is not sufficient, in my view, to allow something significant to happen. I would like to see the momentum continue so that the three days could be extended and something beneficial take place. ``Let's hope this small step of a three-day ceasefire can be the forerunner of many other steps that will ultimately lead to a cessation of violence,'' he said. "That is what both communities in Northern Ireland and the vast majority of Irish and British people want. The sooner we get clarification from Sinn Fein the better." Mr Reynolds' words were seen in Dublin as his sharpest criticism yet at Sinn Fein's handling of the position thrown up by the Declaration. But it was also learned tonight that Irish concern over Sinn Fein delays in responding to the joint statement of December 15 was relayed through intermediaries well ahead of last night's IRA ceasefire announcement. Mr Reynolds will be away from Dublin for a week but officials said he will be kept in constant touch with all developments surrounding the Anglo-Irish peace initiative and the IRA ceasefire.
