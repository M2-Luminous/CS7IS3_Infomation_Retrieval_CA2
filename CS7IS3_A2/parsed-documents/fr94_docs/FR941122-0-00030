ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: Title IV of the Clean Air Act, as amended by Public Law 101-549, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (the Act), authorizes the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or Agency) to establish the Acid Rain Program. On January 11, 1993, the Agency promulgated final rules under title IV. Several parties filed petitions for review of the rules. On November 18, 1993, the Agency published a notice of proposed revisions of those rules implementing sections 404(b) and (c) (substitution plans) and 408(c)(1)(B) (reduced utilization plans) of the Act. On May 4, 1994, EPA and other parties signed a settlement agreement addressing substitution and reduced utilization issues. After reviewing the record, EPA concludes that the January 11, 1993 rules can be read to give utilities an ability to use substitution and reduced utilization plans to create excess, new allowances. These allowances will authorize sulfur dioxide emissions in excess of total emissions without the plans and will result from emission reductions made, or required by federal or State law adopted, before enactment of title IV. This creation of allowances is contrary to the purposes of sections 404(b) and (c) and 408(c)(1)(B) and can compromise achievement of the emissions reductions intended under title IV. Consequently, EPA is modifying sections of part 72 of the January 11, 1993 regulations. The rule revisions will prevent the use of substitution and reduced utilization plans to create excess, new allowances and are consistent with the May 4, 1994 settlement. EFFECTIVE DATE: December 22, 1994.

Applicability of Rule Revisions to Existing Permit Applications V. Administrative Requirements A. Docket B. Executive Order 12866 C. Paperwork Reduction Act D. Regulatory Flexibility Act E. Miscellaneous I. Statutory Purposes of the Substitution and Reduced Utilization Provisions The provisions in sections 404(b) and (c) and 408(c)(1)(B) of the Act concerning substitution and reduced utilization plans have specific statutory purposes related to the achievement of the sulfur dioxide emissions reduction goals of title IV. The Agency maintains that Congress did not intend that these provisions provide utilities an ability to create excess, new allowances by bringing Phase II units into Phase I. Because the January 11, 1993 regulations implementing these provisions can be read to allow the creation of excess, new allowances in Phase I, the Agency is revising today the regulations to ensure that this does not occur. See 58 FR 60951 (defining ``excess, new allowances'').
