The new railway line will have a total length of 234 km and will be jointly constructed by Hebei and Shandong provinces and the Ministry of Railways, with a total investment of 1.53 billion yuan (about 175.86 million U.S. dollars). The construction will be carried out in two phases -- a single line for the first-phase construction and double-tracking in the second phase. When it is completed, the new railway line, the west end of which be linked to the existing coal transport railway lines to Shanxi Province, China's leading coal producer, will help transport 20 million tons of goods a year, and three pairs of passenger trains will be able to operate on the line a day.
