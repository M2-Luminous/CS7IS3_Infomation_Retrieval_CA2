Tibet Autonomous Region is one of the few regions in China where a highly centralized planned economy system still holds sway, steps of reform are more prudent because of special economic conditions. At the end of last year, the local government formally called on people of the whole region to make a concerted effort to deepen reform and to catch up with the pace of the national development toward a market economy in 1994. Enterprises in Tibet Autonomous Region used to depend wholly on the protective preferential policies of the government for their operation and management. Encouraged by the economic boom all over the country, enterprises in Tibet decided to actively participate in competition and to improve their image, as part of the effort of the whole autonomous region to adapt to the national construction of a market economy. Many things and words belonging specifically to the market economy are no longer strange to people "on the roof of the world". A broker training course held by a Sino-U.S. joint venture attracted a large number of local young people and the members of the first group of about 20-plus futures brokers completed their studies at the beginning of the new year. Futures and stocks markets are to be established this year for the first time in this land with the highest altitude. Local people have also gradually adapted to the new mentality of a market economy, during the frequent economic exchanges with other parts of the country. More and more people in state-owned enterprises and institutions have begun to do business in their spare time in the "Sunday market" and the newly-opened "festival market". Modernized commercial facilities have mushroomed in Lhasa and laid a firm foundation for its commercial prosperity. The government of the Tibetan Autonomous Region attaches much importance to the implementation of state laws and regulations on the establishment of a market economy, including the "anti-unfair competition law" and "regulations on protecting consumers' interest", in order to create a stable and positive environment for the development of the market economy in Tibet.
