It "invented" human rights, it is the only Western power which is still involved in Africa, it is the only one to have credible military resources. [passage omitted] First, a legal reason was needed. Because, for states, which are cold monsters, indignation is not enough to justify a policy. Alain Juppe reaffirmed at the United Nations that the principles inherited from the victory over Hitler impose a duty of intervention against genocide. In proportion to the French population, 500,000 victims in Rwanda over the past two months would be the equivalent of almost 4 million dead in our country. [passage omitted] Second, this intervention can only be international. On pain of being suspected of colonialist nostalgia, France cannot go in alone. Other European countries are needed and so far only Italy seems prepared to cooperate. Above all, Africans are needed: For the time being only Senegal has volunteered. Paris is accused of flying to the aid of its former ally, the Hutu government, which is also mainly responsible for the massacres. But this is to forget that, since then, the French Government has changed, and so has its policy. It is also to disregard the fact that Francois Mitterrand, an active advocate of an intervention, is less anxious to counter the Tutsis of the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] rebel movement than to ease his conscience. In reality, France is showing that, when it wishes, it can make the difference. With regard to GATT, the French were initially the only ones to reject the agricultural agreement concocted by the Brussels Commission and the United States. But [Prime Minister] Edouard Balladur and Alain Juppe finally persuaded and led their partners. Faced with the Twelve's united front, the Americans backed down. The scenario was the same in Bosnia: France played a decisive role in leading its allies, including the United States, in a firmer military attitude toward the Serbs and more realistic diplomatic statements about the Muslims. The result was a marked reduction in the intensity of the fighting on the ground. France has a duty to take the initiative on Rwanda. Now that Africa is no longer an issue between the United States and Russia, it would certainly be easier to turn a blind eye. But, abstaining now is to run the risk of being condemned to launch tomorrow into an even more costly operation. Indeed, it is clear that, without an external intervention, the problem will solve itself...by eliminating some of the factors. The advanced countries would find it difficult to be satisfied with Cain's answer: "Am I my brother's keeper?"
