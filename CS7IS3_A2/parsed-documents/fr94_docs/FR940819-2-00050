Purpose Title III of the Defense Production Act (DPA) of 1950 authorizes various forms of Government assistance to encourage expansion of production capacity and supply of industrial resources essential to national defense. The DPA Amendments of 1992 provide for the testing, qualification, and use of industrial resources manufactured or developed with assistance provided under Title III of the DPA. FAR case 93&hyph;304 requires contractors, upon the direction of the contracting office, to test Title III industrial resources for qualification, and provide the test results to the Defense Production Act Office. The interim rule expresses Government policy to pay for such testing and provides definitions, procedures, and a contract clause to implement the policy. This information is used by the Defense Production Act Office, Title III Program, to determine whether the Title III industrial resource has been provided an impartial opportunity to qualify. B. Annual Reporting Burden Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 100 hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information.
