Hagen yesterday took apart the opposition in his party. Hagen owns the Progress Party [FrP], but the party is in the process of slipping away from him. Even if he held all the power in the national conference hall, his standing in Norwegian political life is less strong. Hagen's party only had 4.3 percent of voter support in the most recent AFTENPOSTEN/Opinion poll. The purge of the liberalist-liberal wing is being described by delegates as a Stalinist trial. The forces of reaction have now devoured their own children. Now the rules are being followed, Hagen responds. The disloyalty of the "gang of four" in the Storting group will be taken as an active act of resignation from the party. But will the Bolkesjo meeting also be the beginning of the end for Hagen himself? In his ruthless attack from the speaker's rostrum, he said that there is "deep disagreement" and "division" in the FrP. Indeed, so strong is the abhorrence he has become the target of among the minority that 44 delegates abstained in the chairmanship election -- even though Hagen was the only candidate. Hagen did not appear to the delegates in the Telemark mountains to be the solid rock, but more like a man who is desperately trying to hang on close to the edge. Bolkesjo was a political disaster area where more than just Hagen could need crisis counseling. Ellen Wibe and Ellen Christine Christensen emerged as pale as corpses after their boss had had his say. They had been rendered speechless. Women are out. It is of course possible to ask whether the liberalists should not also look carefully at what course they should adopt and ask themselves whether voluntary "exit" from the party is actually logical. The liberalists say themselves that they back the party's program -- they do not represent a real and full political alternative. Carl I. Hagen has used all the means at his disposal to fight to keep his position. It has become more important for Hagen to lead the party than to engage in politics. Hagen was also the only person on whom the majority at the conference was able to unite. Policies were as good as absent. Since the party chairman's initiative on taxation in the election campaign, not even the fight against taxation is a simple matter. Nevertheless, the message from Bolkesjo is "to the right" and an appeal to the party's original voters. Only one issue succeeded in filling the conference with enthusiasm -- Hagen's passionate address directed against "Islamic fundamentalism." As psephologist Bernt Aardal has pointed out, it is well documented that FrP voters differ from other parties' voters on one point: immigration. There is a potential among the Norwegian people for anti-immigration views, but Aardal also takes the view that this is a dangerous policy area for the FrP to concentrate exclusively on. Hostility toward immigrants has its limit. When it tips over into pure, unadulterated racism decent Norwegians are repelled. Aardal sees greater scope in Hagen's radicalization of the principle of a social policy that only embraces those who are genuinely in need. Hagen says that those who only have their own choices to thank for the state of their health should be treated differently from those who fall ill through no fault of their own. The "nicotine slaves" who were massively represented at Bolkesjo did not stub out their cigarettes just because of this. And the remaining FrP members will steer clear of the EU [European Union] battle, the biggest political issue since 1972. While Bolkesjo Hotel opened up a panorama of beautiful, proud, and snow-covered mountains, the FrP withdrew into the darkness and worshiped narrow-mindedness. "A future with its roots in the past" was the title of the famous Hagen resolution that was pushed through by 94 votes against 54. The FrP is an up-and-down party and could pull itself up out of the ruins again. But the party has said good-bye to the near future.
