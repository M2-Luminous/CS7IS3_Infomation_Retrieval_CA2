The finance secretary indicated that while five years ago an amount equivalent to 18 percent of the GDP was funneled into servicing external and internal debts, only 2 percent will be used during 1994 for the same purposes. The announcement was made during a visit to the cities of Durango in the northern State of Durango, Culiacan in the northwestern State of Sinaloa, and Hermosillo in the northwestern State of Sonora. Aspe Armella reiterated that the federal government plans to continue with its policy of strict fiscal discipline, public finance equilibrium, cutting inflation, and encouraging productivity in order to accomplish 3-percent economic growth during the current year. Last year the government's objective was to achieve economic growth of not less than 2.9 percent, but according to estimates by some experts GDP growth was barely between 0.5 and 1.0 percent. At any rate, Aspe Armella indicated that the government is determined to augment productivity. Public finance equilibrium, Aspe Armella stated, will provide the government with sufficient resources to support the agriculture sector through the Direct Agriculture Support Program in order to raise agriculture productivity and encourage business through tax breaks.
