The PDC leadership, however, believes Arevalo spoke on behalf of the party and thus has reiterated its position on the upcoming presidential runoff elections. [Begin unidentified speaker recording] We have not committed our votes to Armando Calderon Sol or to Ruben Zamora. We have said that rank and file party members are free to vote for whomever they choose. Any view expressed by a member of the party must be interpreted as his personal views. [end recording] Despite this statement, and even though the newspaper that carried Arevalo's statements said he spoke on behalf of the peasant union he represents, his deputy colleagues believe he disregarded the party statutes. [Begin unidentified speaker recording] The party statutes state that party members who express to opposition parties, on television or radio programs, or to the press positions that are contrary to the party's political policy will be subject to expulsion or suspension. This man has done just that. [end recording] The PDC, as well as other parties that did not get a majority of votes during the 20 March elections, have said that their rank and file will be free to vote for the candidate of their choice during the 24 April runoff election.
