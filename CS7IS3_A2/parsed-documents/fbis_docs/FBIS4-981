The MPLA information secretary said so during a party visit to Lubango, the capital of Huila Province. [Begin recording] [Lourenco] The view is that the talks are taking much too long and that it is high time a solution is found to the conflict in this country. We believe that the Angolan people have reached the limits of their suffering, so there is every need for the government, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA], and the international community in Lusaka to make every effort to ensure that a peace accord is signed as soon as possible. [Unidentified correspondent] Do you believe that such an accord will be the solution to the Angolan conflict? [Lourenco] I think so. I believe so. It is common to say that hope is the last thing to go, so we are still keeping alive the hope that peace will be achieved in Lusaka. [Correspondent] UNITA has said that the government has asked for a deadline at the talks so that it can continue its offensive on the ground. Would you care to comment? [Lourenco] That is an absurd point of view. If we are asking for a deadline, it is because we want to achieve peace as soon as possible. In doing so, we are making it clear that we are the only ones interested in having the war end immediately and in achieving peace that will last. [end recording]
