The IDF will be capable of carrying out such an operation within one month." The source asserted that the preparations for the dismantling and evacuation of the military bases were mostly over while the preparations for the construction of alternative bases inside the blocs of settlements were at an advance stage. The senior military source added that the Southern Command and the General Staff's Logistic's Branch have been making preparations for a withdrawal over the past few months, while gearing themselves up to complete the evacuation process by mid-April 1994, as stipulated by the Document of Principles. The evacuation process was scheduled to start at the beginning of March and end in mid-April. "We can withdraw within one month and if necessary we can do it in even less time," the source said, noting that "obviously, the date will be decided by the political echelon. Therefore, one month for evacuation is sufficient time as far as we are concerned. We have carried out more difficult things before." The IDF will summon hundreds of drivers for reserve duty to help carry out the withdrawal. Some of the drivers have already received calls to report to reserve duty. These drivers will help transfer the equipment and the structures in trucks and transporters from the IDF bases inside Palestinian population centers in the Gaza Strip. "Everything that is supposed to be transferred is already marked, noted down in the catalogue, and anchored in detailed evacuation plans," the source noted. "In most cases, all we have to do is to load the equipment on the truck or transporter and start driving."
