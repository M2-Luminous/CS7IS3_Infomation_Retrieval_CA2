Could it be described as the government's party or is it indeed the government itself? If not, what is its relationship with the regime? [Al-Turabi] Observers of the dominant aspects of general political life in Sudan should talk about the Islamic trend because that trend is growing and developing in the fields of education and all walks of civilized life, including the cultural, economic, technical, and other aspects. That trend has assumed several names but not as a traditional party inheriting the same positions within the same structures. The NIF did not only end when it was officially dissolved along with all the Sudanese parties, but its own people also put an end to it because after every political development in Sudan they usually finished their political movement even when it took the form of a party or a movement with a different name and structure, fully different in its regional, class, and social structure from the previous movement. Truly, the NIF does not exist publicly or secretly, but the majority of the trend which used to be the NIF supports the current regime. But there are many waves of the Islamic trend which the salvation government upholds, and many trends from other parties which had a religious base have transformed their traditional sectarian and partisan religious character into a religious character that is now called fundamentalism abroad. [Khazim] Is there a constituent framework embodying that trend? [Al-Turabi] The current political system does not represent one political party. The NIF never believed in a one-party government because that would not be in line with Islamic principles. The political system consists of frameworks, not parties. They are frameworks for consultation and free public opinion. But if you look at the structure of the regime you would find frameworks from known parties which, although they were in disagreement in the past, are all Islamists in their general outlook, with the exception of the Christians. Even the Christians are aware of this general trend and they react to it. The truth is that the NIF does not exist but political observers always try to see a secret plot behind the apparent signs and try to attribute that to one or several individuals. A large number of the NIF leaders now play no part in the general policy. The government and the new political regime are endeavoring to present themselves as a general national Islamic trend, a trend that is more comprehensive for the south and the north than any former party. [passage omitted] [Khazim] You were the NIF's leader and now you are emphasizing that it does not exist in Sudan. How do we identify you now? [Al-Turabi] I am the secretary general of the Islamic Arab People's Congress [IAPC] but I am also known worldwide as a representative, in the general Islamic ideology, of a certain trend in all the world and not just in Sudan. I respond to the Islamic trend in Central and Southern Asia, Africa, and the Arab world and I prefer to be associated with that trend historically. [passage omitted] [Khazim] Does the IAPC seek to bring all the Islamic trends together within a particular constituent framework? [Al-Turabi] We do not want to bring them together within an organizational leadership-linked framework because every Islamic reality has its own history and its own particular and different issues, but the general Islamic trend also has a common cause with trends in other cultures now upheld in the West, for instance. There are now very close worldwide links. A human being now is not confined to a certain nationality or region. The various parts of the world are now open to one another in their media, economies, alliances, security, and other relations. That is why I want this trend to focus its vision, which is derived from Islamic values, on the world challenges and to address all the world and all its perceived historical realities. [passage omitted] We want to lay the foundation as to how this trend, as one nation, should deal with other trends, hold a dialogue with rational moderate Christianity, answer the sometimes fanatical crusade campaigns which sometimes attack Islam without knowing much about it, protect against the many tragedies Muslims are currently suffering in all continents, and defend the Muslims in these places in the media or supply them with the means of jihad in defense of their rights. We want this Islamic trend to provide defense against human injustice and address humanitarian issues in general. The trend is now developing from its old structure into these wider horizons. [Khazim] In that context does the IAPC seek to change any particular political situations? [Al-Turabi] In its endeavor to reach all Islamic peoples, the IAPC does not intend to attack any particular governments because it does not want tense relations (with these governments) that would put a barrier between it and the Islamic peoples. Often governments isolate their people and do not really represent their people. We want the Islamic peoples to be open to one another but at the same time we do not want the IAPC to have any tense relations because we do not want it to represent an opposition to any particular regime. [passage omitted] [Khazim] How does the IAPC view the recourse to violence by some Islamic groups in Egypt and other countries as a way of changing the regimes in these countries? [Al-Turabi] I do not wish to talk about any country in particular, but I know that the current Islamic awakening is throughout the Islamic world, certainly in the Arab world because the Arabs have led the Islamic movement historically and they are closer to the origins of Islam than non-Arab Muslims. That is what I notice in North Africa generally and also in other countries. The new phenomena in the course of historical change might be acceptable to some old regimes and might be given freedom, in which case they come cleanly and gradually contribute to the positive evolution of realities, and perhaps resort to dialogue about, say, the negative aspects of their views. But if they collide with advocates of old realities seeking to maintain their domination, concepts, and economic interests, pressures might push them underground into secret and private activity that would erupt in a form of jihad or something else, for a government's violence and pressure is met with counterviolence and pressure. I regret to say that most signs of mutual pressures and conflicts were started by old ruling regimes seeking to maintain their power. World events were all like that, in France, Russia, China, America, and Britain. Sometimes, however, the new movements hastily resort to violence to the advantage of nobody or are forced to use violence for lack of other means. That is a mistake. [passage omitted] [Khazim] Does the IAPC advocate dialogue in this connection? [Al-Turabi] One of the IAPC's important characteristics is that it has mostly advocated dialogue and recommended dialogue between the various Islamic countries and between various forces within Islamic countries such as Afghanistan and Yemen, and also between regimes and groups seeking change, as in Algeria. It recommended dialogue and tolerence. [passage omitted] [Khazim] Isayas Afewerki, head of the Eritrean provisional government, has accused you as NIF leader of forming the Eritrean Islamic Jihad Movement and has accused you of trying to destabilize his country. He held Sudan responsible for the infiltration of foreign gunmen across the borders to carry out military operations against his forces. What is your reply to these charges? [Al-Turabi] First, Afewerki only left Sudan a few years ago. Perhaps he was talking about the past when Sudan had parties and the NIF and before that. The Islamic trends supported the Eritrean liberation movement for dozens of years. Afewerki himself used to visit it (the NIF) and get media coverage from it. True, the NIF tried to bring together the various (Eritrean) Islamic trends and in fact did so in the Eritrean Islamic Jihad Movement at a time when the Eritreans were forming movements for the liberation of their country. [Khazim] Why does he accuse you? [Al-Turabi] Because he was talking about Sudan's old history. The NIF hadsdone him very great services, which he knows very well. I visited him in his home town after he achieved independence and he visited me more than once in my home after becoming president. Perhaps he got angry with the Jihad Movement and judged it on the basis of what he knew about Sudan. Now the Sudanese Government bans all activities of all the Eritrean movements and fronts except the ruling "Popular Front." [passage omitted]
