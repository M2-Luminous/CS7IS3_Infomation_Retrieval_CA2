Then the speaker of the Majles gave a speech in which he noted the martyrdom anniversary of Navab Safavi. We direct the attention of our esteemed readers to the detailed Majles proceedings. Majles Highlights Majles Speaker The speaker of the Majles glorified and praised the struggles of those who are devoted to Islam, especially Martyr Navab Safavi. Speeches Partovi, deputy from Saqz va Baneh, discussed the economic and welfare problems of the people of Kordestan. He said: Our faith and belief is that in the long run our demands will be achieved in the shadow of Islam. Mohammadi, deputy from Delfan, said in part of his speech: Islamic justice demands that the Plan and Budget Organization allocate most of the budget to those provinces where less work has been done. Legislation With the amendment to the Means Law for Combatant University Admissions, and if approved in the second consultation, the spouses of wounded veterans will make use of these means. Iran has become a member of the Islamic Conference Organization Research Center. The scientific, cultural and educational agreement between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the governments of Kazakhstan and Kirghizestan has been signed. Majles Speaker's Remarks At yesterday's open Majles session Mr. Nateq-Nuri offered congratulations on the birth anniversary of His Holiness Seyyed ol-Sajedin Emam Zeyn ol-Abedin (peace be upon him). Then in his speech he commemorated the memory of Martyr Navab Safavi and his loyal companions. In this regard he said: Martyr Navab Safavi and his companions (Vahedi, Tahmasebi, and other comrades-in-arms) once stood in armed struggle against the oppressor shah's regime. Few people understood these issues or had the courage to take action in an entirely oppressive period ruled by suppressors and dictatorship. This cleric and man of God had courage and faith in the true meaning of the Islam of Mohammad (peace be upon him). He began the movement, and with a comprehensive view. The speaker of the Majles then added: When we read the history of Navab Safavi, we will understand that he had a comprehensive view. For him, it was not simply a matter of struggling against a dictatorship. Just as today we and the exalted leader are concerned about the cultural invasion, in those days the late Martyr Safavi was aware of all the enemy fronts. Ultimately, he was abundantly concerned with moving towards the nation's independence and the nation's territorial, political, and economic independence and self-sufficiency. These are the underlying messages in the slogans, speeches, and cries of the late Navab and his companions. The Feda'ian of Islam began the armed struggle against despotism, imperialism, and ideological deviation before any other group, and dealt with figures who deviated ideologically or who dared to challenge the sacred position of the chaste Imams (peace be upon them). Today when Salman Rushdie has insulted the name of the sacred Prophet of God (peace be upon him), we are dealing with him. Those days that same man of God dealt with those who insulted the sacred name of Imam Sadeq (peace be upon him) and made them understand. He defended the sacred name of the Imams (peace be upon them) and he manfully stood his ground and never gave up his beliefs. Mohammad 'Ali Partovi, Deputy From Saqz va Baneh The economic problems in Kordestan can be solved with industrial development and production. The first pre-agenda speaker at yesterday's open Majles session was Partovi, deputy from Saqz. During his speech he said: One of the most important factors in the development and reconstruction of our Islamic land is public participation. Among the most important activities, which bring about public participation in each region, is cultural work, respect for nationalities and sects, and belief in the people. Observing these matters based on beliefs, Islamic and real outlooks requires comprehensive research and study. Continuing, he said: The views and commands of His Holiness the Imam (peace be upon him) with regard to the religiously legitimate rights of the Kurdish people and the principles of the Constitution in connection with the province of Kordestan must be implemented in the region to keep the enemies of Islam from misusing the situation and the realities of the regions, because without implementing those things, every measure will be temporary and without roots. If the problems in Kordestan are not solved at the roots, if they are not systematically treated and if emigrant forces do not have sufficient understanding of the culture, way of life and economy of the people, every day problems and processes will be created that will torment the people. When every aspect of the lives of our people is in commerce and border exchanges, naturally the forces combatting it with violence will cause social disorders and severe disruptions. Continuing, the speaker said: In the old days, in the historical fabric of our border-keeping people, border trade was the main way of making a living. Kordestan is deprived of a factory and a simple production center. Agriculture is done in primitive and traditional ways. Animal husbandry is not economical. Therefore the border location and the indifference of the idolaters have positioned the economic pulse in border trade. In this regard blood has been shed and lives have been lost in the course of making a living, leading to mothers and fathers in black, social disruption, and recently this issue has also caused the killing of several people, including a girl in the city of Baneh, and the wounding of a number of people, including a worker who was kicked to death in public after being hit by several bullets. Partovi said: It is never justifiable for a nation, which has always guarded the borders with nobility, bravery, and glory and is the oldest and most genuine Iranian race, to see the blood of its innocent dear ones spilled on the soil of their country for trying to make a living and fill their stomachs. We have repeatedly issued memos that the economic problems in Kordestan can be solved with industrial development and production. Of course, in answer they say that investment is not done properly at the borders, or that they should do border trade in a lawful, correct and supervised manner so that the blood of the innocent will not be repaid by the hunger of the deprived. We believe and our people believe that in the long run our demands and the true face of our aspirations will be realized in the shadow of Islam. We are hoping for a better day and for the progress of Islam and the revolution even as we mourn the blood of our innocent daughter. He then added: The point is not concealed from observers that the revolution's true heirs are mostly the oppressed and the destitute of society. Therefore, in return for their effort and sacrifice, it is incumbent upon all government leaders to coordinate all policies and political and executive positions to support them. Continuing, the deputy from Saqz discussed the question of the origins of the deprivation in Kordestan. he said: For us, the border location, the difficulty of travel because of the geography or the oppressiveness of the idolater regime are no justification for the respected minister of petroleum to say that because Saqz, Baneh and Marivan are on difficult terrain for travel, providing gas delivery to these three cities is not possible except in the Third Five-Year Plan, because the real concept of eliminating deprivation is observing the factors of deprivation. Even the idolaters could have used difficulty of passage as a pretext for making apologies and sad excuses. I therefore direct the attention to the minister of petroleum to the fact that at the meeting at the Ministry of Petroleum attended by the governor-general, the respected minister emphasized that before the Second Five-Year Plan he would extend gas delivery activity from Qarveh to Bijar, Divan-e Darreh, Saqz and Baneh. We gave hope to the deprived Muslim people of the area based on his excellency's promise, and the identity of the revolution is based on promises. If difficulty of passage is not an excuse, Mian-e Do Ab and Bukan will be in the Five-Year Plan. The 25 kilometers between Bukan and Saqz are also planned, and the route is level. In fairness, these people are truly more deserving than others. In conclusion, he directed the attention of the respected officials to the following matters: Making maximum use of committed and experienced forces in various posts to bring about maximum participation, refraining from hiring the well-off and prosperous, making use of the views and proposals and studying the criticisms of experts in Kordestan to improve the existing situation, giving serious attention to the low-income classes in planning and performance, basic planning for using Kordestan's natural and mining resources in this virgin area, investing in Kordestan's ancient sites to attract tourism and its foreign exchange revenue, creating a Sunni seminary in Kordestan and equipping it with the needed resources, and creating conditions for it to attract clerics for the growth and deepening of the rich culture of Islam. Seyyed Fazel Amir-Jahani, Deputy From Abhar The failure to control the prices of items and materials on the market brings direct and indirect economic pressure on society's vulnerable classes, especially the workers. The next speaker was Amir-Jahani, deputy from Abhar. During his speech he offered congratulations on the arrival of the blessed days of the month of Sha'ban. He said: Taking inspiration from the immortal slogan "hardship is regrettable" [unattributed Arabic quote], representing the Hezbollah nation we express our anger, hatred, and loathing for the crimes of filthy America and its agents throughout the world, especially those against the oppressed Muslims of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Palestine, Kashmir, and other places. We condemn those who use their evil pens to write of relations with America, and we warn them of the anger of the combative nation. He discussed the 15th anniversary of the triumph of the Islamic revolution and discussed the end of the First Five-Year Plan. He said: The experience gained in the First Five-Year Plan included a series of strengths in the plan, such as the start-up and the construction of basic and infrastructure projects in various sectors, which we have seen and are seeing. Along with that, however, the plan's consequences also include weak points. These include relatively severe fluctuations in the price of foreign exchange on the market, which created conditions for abuses by professional brokers. The failure to control the prices of items and materials on the market brings direct and indirect economic pressure on society's vulnerable classes, especially the workers with high school diplomas and less, lack of attention and failure to pay the necessary subsidies to farmers, the increase in the number of unemployed people, and especially the small percentage of employed people in rural society, which lacks agricultural land, livestock and stable employment. The deputy from Abhar thanked the government and noted: After the approval of the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] Budget Bill will be the best and most appropriate opportunity for the Majles to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the First Five-Year Plan based on the realities, for expert work to be done in approving the Second Five-Year Plan, for greater care to be exercised, and for minimizing the weaknesses of the past. Of course, in this regard the announced views of the exalted leader addressed to the president of the republic as the policies to prevail over the Second Five-Year Plan have completely clarified the directions the plan will take. Some of its paragraphs mention serious and lawful government and judicial support for the oppressed class, creating employment, expanding and improving the social security system, reviving the tradition of interest-free loans in the nation's banking system, avoiding foreign borrowing, and making efforts for a gradual liberation from current commitments. He added: It is hoped that the deputies will give the appropriate attention to achieving the goals of self-sufficiency in agricultural products in order to properly develop such matters as providing security to rural farmers, planning and implementing education and promoting proven and successful methods, encouraging farmers to form cooperative units for agricultural products and solve the problems of insurance and social security for the owners of production, insuring agricultural products and guaranteed purchases for agricultural products based on a price-setting mechanism that is appropriate for expenses, making arrangements and finding easy ways to export their crops, and taking measures to establish conversion industries. Amir-Jahani then issued a memo to the Ministry of Power concerning the implementation of the Law Prohibiting the Use of Underground Water, and he thanked the Ministry of Petroleum for its promise to help provide gas delivery to the area. Mohammad Mohammadi, Deputy From Delfan and Al-Shotor Islamic justice requires that most of the budget be allocated to the provinces where less work has been done. The third pre-agenda speaker at yesterday's open Majles session was Mohammadi, deputy from al-Shotor. He offered congratulations on the birth anniversary of His Holiness Imam Hoseyn (peace be upon him), His Holiness Imam Sajjad (peace be upon him) and His Holiness Abol-Fazl al-'Abbas (peace be upon him), standard-bearer of Karbala. He offered congratulations to the government of Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani for having achieved striking successes in the First Five-Year Plan with its infrastructure work in the enormous economy. He said: It is natural that there will be intermittent inflation during the transition from a subsidized economy to a sound and fundamental economy, especially after the consequences of the imposed war. However, it is requested that the beloved president of the republic make great effort and exercise the necessary supervision over prices to stop excessive price increases, the primary burden of which falls on the shoulders of the deprived. Continuing, he said: Islamic justice requires that the Plan and Budget Organization allocate most of the budget to the provinces where less work has been done. If projects are to be suspended, this should be done in the prosperous provinces, rather than by eliminating a teacher training center in the deprived region of al-Shotor and several other places in the province of Lorestan. He thanked the minister of the interior for appointing Mr. Mohammadizadeh governor-general of Lorestan and expressed the hope that the new governor-general would exercise full supervision and employ native and Hezbollah forces, who are always with the clergy, in order to be able to serve this deprived province. The speaker thanked and praised the minister of labor for traveling to the province of Lorestan to open and do the ground-breaking on factories for employment and technical and professional training, which hopefully will alleviate unemployment in our country. The deputy from al-Shotor then thanked brother Engineer Basharati, chief of the Deprived Areas Office, for his serious concern for the deprived areas. He said: Engineer Basharati, with his God-given memory, is entirely familiar with every part of the deprived areas and is trying to alleviate deprivation. It is requested of the respected Majles Plan and Budget Commission and respected colleagues that special attention be given to this office, as well as the Ministry of Labor, for in this way deprivation will be alleviated in the country. In conclusion he asked the Ministry of Energy, the Ministry of Agriculture, and the Ministry of the Reconstruction Crusade to give more attention to this deprived and ever-present on-the-scene province. Zabihollah Karimi, Deputy From Shushtar Karimi, deputy from Shushtar, was the final pre-agenda speaker. In his speech he offered congratulations on the birth of Imam Sajjad (peace be upon him) and said: 27 Dey [17 January] is the anniversary of the bloody martyrdom and the red flight of the passionate martyr 'Erfan Mohammadi, the great martyr Navab Safavi and his loyal companions. This is a good opportunity to show respect for the good spirits of the great martyrs of Islam and sacrificing martyrs of Islam. [passages omitted on Navab Safavi's life] Legislation Amendment to the Law Creating Means for Combatant University Admissions The first item on the agenda at yesterday's open Majles session was the report from the first consultation of the Culture and Higher Education Commission on the Proposed Amendment to Note 3 of the Law Amending the Law Creating Means for Combatant, Crusader, and Basiji Volunteer Admissions to Universities and Institutions of Higher Education, the general form of which was approved by the deputies. In discussing this motion, the expert from the Higher Education Commission Said: Based on Note 3, "the children of martyrs, invalids and former prisoners and their spouses and the children of injured veterans with more than 50 percent disabilities may benefit from the provisions of this law by notifying the Martyr Foundation of the Islamic Revolution, the Former Prisoners Staff and the Foundation for the Oppressed and War Veterans." In this motion it was proposed that the spouses of injured veterans be added to this note. Bill To Form Supreme National Technical Council The second item on the agenda was the report from the first consultation of the Plan and Budget Commission concerning the Bill To Form the Supreme National Technical Council, the general form of which was not approved and was rejected. In explaining this bill, the expert from the Plan and Budget Commission said: In the year 1356 [21 March 1977-20 March 1978] there was a note in the budget law for that year, which is one of the permanent notes. In this note the government is authorized to change and revise base prices, based on prices, regulations and guidelines approved by the shah's Commission. With the triumph of the Islamic revolution the Revolutionary Council amended Article 1. Article 1 authorized technical councils to be formed in the provinces and it specified the composition of these councils in the provinces. Among the prerogatives of the councils, they authorized the supreme technical council to adjust the base price of the ceiling figure, which is increased by the amount of each development project. That which the government has now presented is an amendment to the Revolutionary Council's Paragraph J, but the Plan and Budget Commission decided that while we are preparing the government's amendment, we should approve the Bill To Form the Supreme National Technical Council, to make this council permanent. This bill sets general limits on prerogatives and duties. Rural Development Inquiry Motion The third item on the agenda was the report from the Plan and Budget Commission concerning the motion to conduct an inquiry on the rural development mentioned in Paragraph 2, Note 55 of the 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994] National Budget Law, and the inquiry was approved. Topic of Inquiry Is what is intended by the term "rural development credits" (in Paragraph 2, Note 55 of the 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994] National Budget Law) all the development measures done by the reconstruction crusade in the rural areas, or not? Commission's View Article 1: What is meant by "credits" (rural development in Paragraph 2, Note 55 of the 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994] National Budget Law) and other credits are those activities that are provided in the law under the heading of rural development. Request To Reject 3 Bills The next item on the agenda was the request to reject three government bills: 1. The Bill To Append a Note to Article 7 of the Iran and World Tourism Industrial Development Law, enacted in 1370 [21 March 1991-20 March 1992] by the Council of Ministers, based on the note to Article 89 of the Majles Domestic Guidelines. 2. Bill on the Cultural, Scientific, and Educational Agreement between the Governments of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Republic of Azerbaijan. 3. Bill to collect the price of road maintenance services. Bill on Iran's Membership in the Islamic Conference Organization Research Center The fifth item on the agenda at yesterday's open Majles session was the report from the first consultation of the Islamic Guidance and Art Commission concerning the Bill on the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran's Membership in the Center for Islamic Historical, Artistic, and Cultural Research Affiliated with the Islamic Conference Organization, the general form of which was approved. Scientific, Cultural, and Educational Agreement Between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Governments of Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan The final item on the agenda at yesterday's open Majles session was the report from the Islamic Guidance and Art Commission concerning the Bill on the Scientific, Cultural, and Educational Agreement between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Governments of Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, and this agreement was also approved by the deputies. Majles Notes The minister of energy said in an interview with RESALAT's parliamentary correspondent: The electrical power distribution companies were nongovernment at first. Now 26 electrical power distribution companies have been formed throughout the country and are managed by the private sector. After privatization the efficiency of these companies increased. Continuing, he discussed economizing on electrical power consumption. He said: The Ministry of Commerce must be given the authority to control the labor hours of guilds in view of the nature of the work, as is done in other countries, because it is not necessary for some guilds to remain at the work site until late at night. The minister of energy said: In studying rate increases, the Majles should make policy in such a way that those who consume less will have more subsidies and exemptions. In conclusion, he said: The government pays a total of about 540 billion tomans per year in subsidies.
