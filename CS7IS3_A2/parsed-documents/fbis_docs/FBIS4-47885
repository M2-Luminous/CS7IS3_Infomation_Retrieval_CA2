FBIS4-47885 "drafr087_c_94038" FBIS-AFR-94-087 Daily Report 5 May 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 5 May South African Press Review for 5 May MB0505134694 MB0505134694 BFN [Editorial Report] THE STAR Possible Viljoen Ministerial Portfolio Viewed -- "Constand Viljoen, Minister of Defence?" asks the Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 5 May in a page-12 editorial. "On one level that is an outlandish notion, requiring both an other-worldly degree of ANC magnanimity and a somersault from the Freedom Front. Almost impossible. But now that South Africa is in the business of pulling off the impossible, here's one to consider closely." THE STAR urges that the ANC keep 2 points in mind: Viljoen's "3 percent looks microscopic on the bar charts, but translated into a proportion of the men in tank cockpits and airport control towers it assumes a new magnitude altogether." Secondly, the editorial questions whether "there are other hands better able to carry through 'effective' affirmative action". "Superficially a Viljoen appointment would fly in the face of both parties policies. Deeply examined it might serve both, and the nation," concludes the THE STAR. BUSINESS DAY Need for Principled Finance Minister -- "The Finance Ministry will arguably be the most important department in the new government," declares the Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 5 May in a page-12 editorial. "It is also likely to be the most unpopular, as the principal function of Nelson Mandela's first finance minister will be to say no. President Mandela will rule a country of expectations which cannot be realised, of promises which cannot all be met, certainly not in the short term." As disappointed as the business community may be if Derek Keys is not allowed to continue in his job, Keys may not be the "right person to turn down" the "flood of requests for money." "There is a strong argument to be made that keeping Cabinet colleagues to their spending limits will take more than Keys's determination and understanding of the economy; it will require someone with deep ANC roots and party authority to have those limitations accepted in the Cabinet and by an expectant populace." SOWETAN IEC Running of Election Viewed -- "Let us start by complimenting the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] for accomplishing the impossible," begins the Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 5 May in a page-8 editorial. "It is, however, with some regret that we have to record some shocking mistakes that could have sent us back to square one. The halt in the counting of the results is just not good enough." The editorial criticizes the postponement of the formal induction of Mandela, the sitting of the regional legislatures, and celebrations. "Having said all that we must be generous in our thanks that things have come to this point without too much distress and hardly any violence." RAPPORT Local Skills Must Be Used -- Johannesburg RAPPORT in Afrikaans on 1 May says in a page-14 editorial: "Events around the past week's general election identified two important guidelines for the future, which were indicated long before a start was made at counting the votes: how the country could be governed to prosperity in the future, and how it should not be done. The IEC, no doubt with the best intentions in the world, demonstrated how things should not be done. Despite the greatest plans and funding, which ran into the better part of a billion rands, members of the commission and their extended but untested staff proved that theory and practice are far from being the same thing." "The IEC, starry-eyed and mesmerized by affirmative action, decided to keep the Department of Home Affairs at arm's length, and did the same to the local printing industry, and even the security forces, all of which had to be eventually drawn into the printing and delivery of ballot papers." "This country is blessed with a wealth of people who are not only ready to help build a new dispensation, but are also of inestimable value for the development of future skills. After all, practical skills and their application are the real capital of the new era, never mind how much money is or is not available. The same applies to the government. There are many businessmen who managed to keep the wheels of state turning under difficult circumstances -- sanctions, boycotts, and a shrinking world economy." The country will need them, says RAPPORT, "because in the final analysis it is the people who will make this country succeed, with a little bit of give and take." Need To Handle Far-Right With Sympathy -- In an article on page 14 of RAPPORT, Z.B. du Toit notes: "The word `reconciliation' is high on the list of the new government of national unity which was elected this week. But there is a significant group, generally referred to in the media as `far-right', who show little inclination towards that. A group of journalists experienced this at first hand on Thursday when they faced the hatred and venom of about 250 AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] supporters at a rally at Boekenhoutfontein," where the journalists became "the target of an eruption of bitterness by people who reject the new order with astonishing intensity. From statements it was clear that it was not only the coming to power of a new government that was unacceptable, but also that such an event was seen as a triumph of evil over good." "The AWB rally was only a small sample of the deep feeling of rejection and estrangement by the far-right." Du Toit continues: "Yet even at the root of the far-right's estrangement there must be a deep awareness that their leaders could not stem the new South Africa; that right-wing resistance politics has failed for the past two decades. For understandable reasons the blame is placed not on their own leaders who tried during this time to entrench a white minority government... No, the principles of the democratic wave with the vote for all is simply ignored." "If reconciliation between white and black is a real challenge in the new dispensation, it will be a much greater task to bind the far-right back into society. At this point such a possibility looks remote," but "a new government, in addition to all its other tasks, will have to try to understand the roots of the far-right estrangement and handle it with sympathy. In this, the Afrikaners in the new government and Parliament will have to actively assist. Otherwise the nice young boys and girls cutely dressed in khaki at the AWB rally will grow up quite normally as a new estranged generation. Estranged, and with a growing resentment, and therefore increasingly dangerous. That must be prevented, because it is totally unnecessary."
