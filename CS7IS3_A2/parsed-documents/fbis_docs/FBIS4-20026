The warning came as ministers and senior officials this week prepared to draw up final recommendations for spending reductions in a bid to find 2.3 billion pounds sterling savings in line with Treasury demands. Mr Rifkind set out his stall in the annual Defence White Paper, which officials admitted was necessarily "bland" because the Front Line First review would not be completed until July. "Our Armed Forces are widely regarded -- and rightly -- as a valuable and prestigious national asset," the White Paper said. "The possession of such an asset is not a luxury; and it is not something we could surrender without grave injury to the security and reputation of this country." Strong Armed Forces were essential so long as Britain wanted to play an active part in international affairs. Although the end of the Cold War was welcomed, nationalism and extremism were "sadly" on the march. It would be many years before it became clear whether Russia -- with its huge arsenal of weapons -- would be able to develop into a permanent friend of the West and a stable democracy. "We do not intend to take risks with our security," said the White Paper. "The penalties for misjudgment would be too severe." Yet the Front Line First review -- also known as the Defence Cost Studies -- is expected to slash thousands of military and civilian jobs in the support areas and axe hundreds of buildings and centres. Armed Forces Minister Jeremy Hanley, Defence Procurement Minister Jonathan Aitken and Junior Defence Minister Lord Cranbourne meet the Front Line First's so-called executive group on Thursday to discuss recommendations. Since December, 33 studies have been carried out into the entire support sector in a bid to find the necessary savings. These studies -- apart from two -- are now complete and will be discussed by the ministerial/executive group, which includes Christopher Littmoden from Marks & Spencer. A final package of recommendations will be put together from the various studies and presented to Mr Rifkind in the middle of next month. But the key proposals include a 20,000 cut in civilian and military manpower, with the RAF [Royal Air Force] particularly targeted. One aim is to cut the billions of pounds worth of spares and stocks held by the military by by well over half. The RAF stockholders are almost entirely in uniform, whereas the Army's are half military and half civilian employees. Ministers are determined that the job should be almost entirely privatised, as civilian workers cost about half as much as a serviceman. Thus, RAF manpower will tumble to well below the 70,000 ceiling it will reach next April under the Options for Change cuts. The MoD [Ministry of Defense] headquarters in London is another prime target with more than 3,000 posts likely to be axed, together with a cut of a fifth in the 11,000-strong Procurement Executive, which oversees the purchase of all new equipment. The number of senior military officers from the rank of brigadier -- and their civilian equivalents -- upwards will be cut by at least 20 percent. Large numbers of expensive-to-run buildings such as the staff colleges of the Royal Navy at historic Greenwich, south London, and the RAF at Bracknell, Berkshire, are likely to be shut, with joint tri-service courses being run at the Army's equivalent at Camberley, Surrey. One of the most politically contentious issues is the naval base at Rosyth in Fife, which the Royal Navy has recommended for closure with warships moved to Portsmouth. Labour has alredy warned that the proposals threaten the entire structure of Britain's security, and party leader John Smith has called for a full defence review, warning there were too many "piecemeal cuts." Liberal Democrat defence spokesman Menzies Campbell said the White Paper was "substantially undermined" by the Front Line First review.
