The Macedonian Government does not intend to interfere in the internal affairs of any country, and in this case Australia, but it feels the need to emphasize that by such an act the Australian Government is violating the basic human rights of loyal Australian citizens of Macedonian origin. By that act, with the force of law, solutions are being imposed that are the opposite of the generally accepted and successfully implemented multinational policy of Australia, thus directly transferring the misunderstandings and conflicts from the Balkans to the decades-long peaceful multicultural milieu of Australia. It is hard to understand that, with an legal act of the Australian Government, the positive practice of Australia in this field is being violated. That practice was, with its results, an example of solving the multinational questions not only on the Australian continent, but at large. Those positive experiences have been studied and supported with great sympathy by the Republic of Macedonia. After the recent violent terrorist acts against the buildings of the Macedonian Orthodox Church and the Macedonian community in Australia, which caught the attention of the world's public, the Macedonian Foreign Ministry officially drew the Australian side's attention to the unacceptable reasons for such terrorist activities and the possible consequences, and requested urgent action by the Australian state in detecting and punishing those who endanger the order and peace of the prosperous multicultural Australian society. [Box, p 1] Protest of the Macedonians in Australia Sydney, 13 March--According to the announcements of the SBS Radio Broadcast in the Macedonian language, the Federal Government has ordered all its institutions to refer to the Macedonians as Slav Macedonians in the future. The Macedonian community reacted strongly to this decision, and Chris Popov, Goce Stefanovski, as well as some other influential personalities in television stated that "if Australia does not change this incomprehensible decision, the Macedonians will embark on mass demonstrations...." -- T.B.
