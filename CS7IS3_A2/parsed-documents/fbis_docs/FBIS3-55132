Elected to the parliament in the 114th single-seat constituency in Shchelkovo, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy was today approved by members of the district election commission as deputy, and the local adminstration congratulated him. The commission's chairman assured those assembled that although some people questioned the results of the elections, there are no grounds to speak about abuse during the elections. According to him, for instance, a suit had been filed with judicial bodies to declare the results of the elections in the 114th district invalid. As usual, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy vigorously "beat off" Russian and foreign journalists who were still interested in the problem of financing the LDPR's election campaign and the results of his foreign tour. "Nobody gave us anything, it is all lies," he said and added that the campaign was conducted at the expense of "money orders from Russian citizens." "Not a single mafia grouping, economic structure, bank, or political organization gave us a kopeck," the LDPR leader claimed. At the same time, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy did not deny that he accepts foreign currency from foreign journalists for his interviews. "There is a long line and those who want to jump it have to pay," he said. He tried to play down the consequences of the scandal caused by his pronouncements in Bulgaria and Germany's refusal to grant him an entry visa. "[Bulgarian President] Zhelyu Zhelev was frightened by something, but all is now sorted out." According to him there was "an outburst of conflicting opinions in Germany," but now "everything has calmed down too, and the minister of foreign affairs is prepared to receive me." According to Zhirinovskiy, he is being invited "to Austria, Spain, France, and Norway." Questions regarding U.S. President Bill Clinton's refusal to meet the leader of the victorious party during his forthcoming visit to Moscow brought an especially emotional response. "I am ready, but he is scared -- and so much the worse for him," Vladimir Zhirinovskiy stated. "Shame on such a president, let him go on playing his saxophone at home and not come here at all." "You in the west are all scared of the new, honest, and brave politician emerging in Russia," the LDPR leader added. Answering the ITAR-TASS correspondent's question, Zhirinovskiy reported that leaders of the four largest factions in parliament have reached an agreement in principle on the candidature of the future speaker . "He will be a representative of a small neutral faction and his four deputies will be representatives of the four largest factions," Zhirinovskiy specified.
