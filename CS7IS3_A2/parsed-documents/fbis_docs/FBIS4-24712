At a hearing hosted by Kuomintang legislator Wang Shih-hsiung, Prof. Kao Cheng-yen of National Taiwan University said that Taipower's decision to increase the generating capacity of the King- liao plant from the originally proposed 1 million kilowatts to 1.3 million kilowatts without notifying the government and the public was a violation of the law that allows the building and budgeting of only a 1 million-kilowatt nuclear facility. Prof. Wang Tu-fa of National Chunghsing University added that Taipower failed to present an environmental-impact assessment before it decided to enlarge the plant's generating capacity. [word indistinct] Yung-jen, an official with the Department of Health, said an environmental-impact assessment report is vital because the 1 million kilowatt plant will increase the temperature of seawater near the Kung-liao plant by only 2.8 degrees centigrade, but if the generating capacity of the plant is increased to 1.3 million kilowatts, the seawater temperature will rise by 3.16 degrees, which he said would be a costly blow to the coastal area's ecological system. The greater generating capacity would also mean larger governmental expenditures and greater social costs, Ko Cheng-yen, the vice chairman of the Taiwan Environmental Protection Union, said. In response to the criticism, Taipower Chairman Chang Chung-chien said the 1.3 million-kilowatt reactor is less prone to accidents than the 1 million-kilowatt reactor, and produces a lower level of radiation and less nuclear waste. Vice Economics Minister Yang Shih-chien, who was also present at the hearing, disagreed that Taipower's increased capacity plan is illegal, saying that the original proposal for the fourth nuclear power plant had a capacity "ranging from 900,000 kilowatts to 1.35- million kilowatts.
