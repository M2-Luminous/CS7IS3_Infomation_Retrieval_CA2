FBIS4-13693 "drnes078_o_94004" FBIS-NES-94-078 Daily Report 19 Apr 1994 Syria Daily Urges Arabs To Stop Israeli `Infiltration' Daily Urges Arabs To Stop Israeli `Infiltration' JN1904075794 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network in Arabic 0445 GMT 19 Apr 94 JN1904075794 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network Arabic BFN [From the press review] [Text] Under the headline "Israel's Ambitions Target All", AL-BA'TH comments: Dennis Ross, overall U.S. coordinator of the Middle East peace talks, will reportedly come to the region shortly to set the stage for a tour by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. According to some news reports, Christopher will try to work out with the parties a date for resuming the stalled talks. The Americans had said that, as far as the peace talks were concerned, they had nothing new to offer. Arab and foreign media have noted that the Americans are backtracking on previous positions and even gradually adopting the Israeli line and extending financial and military backing to Tel Aviv. Observers around the world observe that the U.S. Administration is now pushing Israel in the direction of war rather than peace. The paper urges the United States to take a clear-cut position on the mechanism of the peace process. Washington, AL-BA'TH adds, is aware that while the Arabs have done all they could to help the peace process along Israel continues to maneuver and temporize. In the overall pan-Arab interests and given that the Arabs cannot afford further breaches as the Oslo accord and what is taking place in Muscat and what will take place in Doha, Arab parties involved in the peace process should commit themselves to whatever their coming coordination session recommends. If the Arabs really care about their interests and future, the gaps through which Israel is infiltrating the Arab world should be sealed, AL-BA'TH asserts. We are right to urge all Arabs to sharpen their awareness of what is going on around them and be more alert to what is being planned against all of us without exception. It is not as if a just and comprehensive peace has been attained; indeed, Israel's rejectionist disposition diminishes the chances for such peace, AL-BA'TH concludes.
