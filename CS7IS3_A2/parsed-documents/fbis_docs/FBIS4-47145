Maevskyy; place and date not given: "We Now Have a Holding Company!"] [Text] A regulation was recently adopted on joint-stock holding companies, and, on 16 May, Anatoliy Volkovskyy was appointed chairman of the board of Ukrresoursy State Holding Company. A PRAVDA UKRAINY correspondent met with the new executive and first of all asked: [Maevskyy] Anatoliy Filippovich, you will have to pardon us but neither the masses of workers nor I know what a holding company is. [Volkovskyy] A holding company is an association of joint-stock companies that owns a controlling package of stock in each member of that association. Let us say the ministry is a purely state organization, while a state holding company includes not only state enterprises, but also joint-stock and leased ones. Reformation of state property in accordance with the privatization program led to the existence of enterprises with various forms of ownership. This, in turn, brought about a loss of state control over branches of national economy; loss of control over utilization of property and direction followed in enterprise activity. This likewise occurred in the material-technical supply field, where there is practically no government management at all, and there are no new forms reflecting the market relations yet, even though they are needed. As a result, mutual ties are lost, organizational unity is disrupted, volumes of wholesale trade in production-technical types of products has decreased, and the property of warehousing complexes, which were built over a long period of time and were designed for organizing product delivery, has been dispersed. Wholesale purchases today are not what they used to be. The state does not subsidize them, turnover is not fulfilled, and the enterprise itself selects where it is to buy what it needs and who to work with. There is no one to control that, and vertical management has been disrupted. Enterprises have now, on the average, cut their production by half. While, in state management, nothing has changed. At the ministry or in the committee, workers are on a budget. You come to the office, there is a chair for you, a table, a fountain pen, and you get paid your wages. This in no way depends on the lamentable situation at the enterprises. These enterprises, already incorporated, leased, or private, are all those that formed a part of the former Gossnab [State Committee for Material and Technical Supply], and it cannot control them. What happened is not just a detachment of enterprises from the state, but a direct break. As a result, a new management organ was created--the state joint-stock holding company. [Maevskyy] If I understand it correctly, we do not have bankruptcies, and a poorly operating enterprise still gets a subsidy from the government. [Volkovskyy] There is a concept called clearing up. That is aid for enterprises. You work for a newspaper and know the situation with newsprint. At the same time, we have an enterprise in Zhidachov capable of producing such newsprint. But, since the coupon today is not convertible, the enterprise is unable to purchase pulp for itself, and, without that, no newsprint can be produced. The enterprise is heading toward bankruptcy not because of its own fault. Who would want it to close? The newest equipment is available, there are personnel, and there is a need for newsprint. But, our monetary system and monetary relations with Russia disrupt everything. [Maevskyy] They could really provide Ukraine with newsprint? [Volkovskyy] There are decisions of the Supreme Council and decrees of the Cabinet of Ministers, but, with our current situation, all we can do is darn the various holes. Zhidachov needs a million dollars to replace machinery, the building already exists, and then start newsprint production. They could produce 40,000 tonnes. Last year, Ukraine imported 20,000 tonnes through state deliveries. At present the editorial offices of many newspapers make direct purchases on their own. Some 80,000 tonnes were consumed. [Maevskyy] Well, we found out something about the holding company, now tell us about yourself. [Volkovskyy] I progressed through life step by step. I was born in 1938, have a wife and two sons. Served in the army, worked at construction projects, graduated first from a construction technical school and then the economics department at the university. Worked with the oblast planning committee, then transferred to the oblast supply and sales organization that was part of the Gossnab system. Later, during reorganization of that service, I was transferred to Kiev as head of the main directorate. I assumed my present post after leaving the position of first deputy chairman of the State Committee for Material Resources. [Maevskyy] By any chance, do you engage in sports? [Volkovskyy] I used to be very interested in skiing during the winter in Ukraine and when I served in Podmoskovye. I participated in the All-Union army competitions. At present, I have no time for sports. My Saturdays and Sundays are busy. It is necessary to learn to think in a new way, and a new organization of labor is required. I would like to do everything possible in order to improve the social sphere. After all, it makes no difference to the commercial structures who they sell to, the same markup is made for enterprises, for kindergartens, and for hospitals, which today have nothing at all--no sheets, no garments... [Maevskyy] Or medicines, alas. [Volkovskyy] Medicines are the concern of the Ministry of Public Health. In general, the government should take supply upon itself. I believe that euphoria from the Snickers and Mars candy shall pass, since our own confectionery products and sausage have always been better than those from abroad. It is merely necessary to contribute less to the economics of political struggle. It is important not to break all ties for political reasons. No matter who is shouting or what is shouted, Ukraine does not have pulp and apatite and never will have them, there is no rubber. We cannot and should not live in economic isolation. [Maevskyy] Thanks for the discussion.
