FR940216-0-00146 FR940216-0-00010 c. Negligible parameter values. On February 26, 1993, EPA proposed to exempt refinery streams from testing for one or more specific parameters if a stream contains negligible amounts of those parameters. The affected fuel parameters are benzene, aromatics, olefins and sulfur. EPA also proposed threshold criteria for each fuel parameter, i.e., the amount of the fuel parameter in a stream at or below which the parameter would be considered negligible. EPA has changed the values of some of the threshold criteria based on comment. Specifically, the benzene threshold value was reduced and the sulfur threshold value increased. A full discussion of these changes can be found in the RIA; the actual values are also listed in ยง80.91. Oxygen was added to the list of parameters that may be considered negligible under certain circumstances. Other than those modifications, the requirements are being promulgated as proposed. d. Test methods. Many commenters were concerned that the test methods they had used to analyze samples would be invalid because they were not the same as the required test methods being promulgated today for reformulated gasoline. EPA had proposed, on April 16, 1992, that sampling and measurement techniques used to determine baseline parameters must yield results which are equivalent to the results obtained per the techniques and methodologies specified for the reformulated gasoline program. However, because of constantly evolving test methods, in addition to the fact that the final regulations concerning reformulated gasoline test methods will only be known today, it would be inappropriate to disallow data because it was not tested according to certain methods when there were no requirements to do so. Nonetheless, EPA is concerned that the test methods used be adequate. In a modification of the proposal, EPA will accept data determined using methods other than those required under the reformulated gasoline program, upon petition and approval, as long as the methodology or technique was a standard industry-accepted measurement technique at the time the measurement was taken. If data to be used in the baseline determination was, somehow, obtained via a more accurate test method prior submission of the baseline to EPA, it may be acceptable. The baseline auditor will verify that the techniques used to determine the baseline data meet the requirements discussed above. Although not previously discussed, EPA is allowing oxygen content, as well as oxygenate volume, to be determined from oxygenate blending records. The composition of the oxygenate, with regard to the other required fuel parameters, must still be determined. 5. Baseline Fuel Parameter Determination a. Closely integrated gasoline producing facilities. Based on earlier comments, on February 26, 1993 EPA proposed to allow blending facilities (or terminal operations) to be included in a refinery's baseline determination if a closely integrated relationship could be shown between the refinery and the terminal. EPA also requested comments as to what criteria would constitute ``closely integrated''. Many commenters supported allowing a single baseline for such a situation. Requiring 60&hyph;75 percent of a blending facility's blendstocks to have come from a single refinery was suggested for defining a closely integrated refinery-terminal relationship. EPA is promulgating the proposal with the requirement that at least 75 percent of the blendstock received at the terminal in 1990 must have come from the associated refinery. EPA believes this is a reasonable number, as explained in the RIA, considering that oxygenates and butane, among others, are blended into gasoline after the refinery, while constituting much less than 20 percent of gasoline by volume. In the case of an aggregate refiner baseline, as discussed in paragraph 6.d, a terminal or terminals may be included in the aggregate baseline if each terminal received at least 75 percent of its blendstock from one or more of the aggregated refineries with which it is associated. For instance, the 75 criteria is satisfied if the terminal received 25 percent of its 1990 blendstock from refinery A and 50 percent from refinery B, refinery A and B being part of an aggregate baseline. Alternatively, it may also have received the entire 75 percent from either refinery A or B. Although not previously proposed, some comments were received regarding other types of closely integrated facility relationships. EPA is thus allowing a single individual baseline to be determined for two or more refineries (or sets of gasoline blendstock-producing units) which are geographically near each other but are not within a single refinery gate, and whose 1990 operations were significantly interconnected. The burden is placed on the refiner to show that its two facilities are ``significantly interconnected''. In this case, the two facilities will have a single set of baseline parameter values and associated emissions. Some commenters suggested that U.S. refiners with import operations also be allowed to develop a single baseline covering their refining and importing operations. EPA rejected this suggestion because it would be difficult for EPA to track a fuel's production location before the fuel is or was imported, particularly when considering 1990 production. Also, allowing such a situation would amount to trading between foreign and domestic refineries, which was not mandated nor intended by Congress. b. Seasonal weighting. In the February 26, 1993 proposal, EPA proposed that a refinery's own production volumes of summer and winter gasoline (based on RVP) be used in the weighting of data on a summer and winter basis. This change from the previous proposal received a lot of support, and is being promulgated as proposed on February 26, 1993. As discussed in paragraph 6.a, the 1990 annual baseline volume is the larger of the gasoline volume produced in or shipped from the refinery in 1990. Thus, a refinery's own baseline volumes of summer and winter gasoline (either on a produced or shipped basis) shall be used for weighting the summer and winter anti-dumping emissions and sulfur, olefins and T90 values. As proposed, all volume which is not summer volume is considered winter volume.
