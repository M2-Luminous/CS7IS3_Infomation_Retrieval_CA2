The cause of this is the presence of several gangs of armed hooligans who haunt downtown attacking and robbing young women, mothers, and even fathers with families. Annaba--It is a practice that has become widespread and is encouraged by passivity, indeed by the cowardliness of some who under other circumstances would become conscientious objectors. So at a time when some people wallow in unchecked carelessness and slovenliness and take home a salary for work that they no longer do, some crazies organize themselves into gangs to produce a reign of terror on sidewalks, streets, and within our government institutions. Annaba has now regained its 1980's title as the most rotten city in Algeria, literally and figuratively. It is a city in which vagrants, speculators, swindlers, traffickers, influence peddlers, racketeers, housebreakers, and pickpockets fight over workers' salaries. Jostled, indifferent, and discouraged by so many disappointments, these workers get drawn into a feeling that everything is sinister and catastrophic and still try to keep the words fatherland and patriotism in their vocabularies. The gangs of pickpockets get organized, and so do the prostitutes and young homosexuals. These veritable carriers of viruses and other veneral diseases, veiled or not and even wearing the hijab, and in the company of young toughs, can be found near the Law School campus, at Sunrise Beach, and on Revolution Avenue soliciting customers or discussing "the price" with drivers, most of whom are farmers in high spirits after the breaking of the fast. If as regards security [text illegible] the darkest period of its existence, on that of business and prices, it is a massacre. It isn't only speculators who do it, it is practically all young people who have begun to engage in speculation, particularly with products subsidized by the state. At the El-Hatab Market, at the marketplace, everywhere private business is established, the price checking service has died. It is the big department stores that pay the piper or justify our "brave" checkers coming out. There is the El-Hadjar EDGA, the only store out of 31 others located in five wilayas, that has miraculously saved the store's credibility by putting products within reach of modest pocketbooks and by making a constant effort to supply the population of El-Hadjar and elsewhere; it is the only store to have dealt with most of its bank overdraft and saved 85 jobs; it has just been the victim of a genuine scene entitled "hoarding food." Now from a survey conducted among a large number of El-Hadjar's citizens it appears that ever since the arrival of the store's new director, the people of El-Hadjar have somewhat forgotten the word shortage in the sense that with respect to [text illegible] and that the sale of goods in an atmosphere of tension occurs under the eye of the daira's security services. The various people surveyed reported that there was manipulation by the speculators' lobby, which the activity and the efforts made by the El-Hadjar EDGA were disrupting. Workers in the store also unanimously agreed that the case had been fabricated and that they wholeheartedly supported the director of their store. In fact, if there is hoarding, you need to look for it closer to El-Hatab, the marketplace, in the big department stores. Where semolina and flour are concerned, certain shopkeepers, particularly those in Oued Eddeheb, no longer worry about selling their products since they are already sold well before they get there, but not to neighborhood consumers. Unlivable by day, Annaba is also unlivable after the breaking of the fast. Although they have been closed for several hours, the cafes, cafeterias, and drugstores are dirty and repellant. Prices for food have doubled. If you want to buy a few grams of kalb ellouz, baklava, or hrissa, you need to spend several dozen dinars.
