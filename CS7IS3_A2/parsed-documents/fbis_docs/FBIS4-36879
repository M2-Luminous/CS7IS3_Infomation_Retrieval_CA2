Major General Sabir al-Duri, director of the General Intelligence, was transferred to the post of an adviser at the Presidency and replaced as director of General Intelligence by al-Anbar Governor Mani' 'Abd-al-Rashid. A reliable source arriving from Iraq said three more officials from the al-Duri tribe, which is known for its close links to the regime, were dismissed from their posts. These are Khadr al-Duri, member of the Regional Command of the ruling Ba'th Party; 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Duri; and 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Duri, who is said to have fled to Syria. The Iraqi source said Maj. Gen. al-Duri was dismissed from his post as intelligence chief probably after it was discovered that the Iraqi intelligence service was involved in the assassination of the Iraqi opposition figure Shaykh Talib Suhayl in Beirut and the assassination of a German journalist named Lisi Schmidt [name as published]. An officer named Safi al-Tikriti was in charge of the two operations. [passage omitted]
