The Riigikogu's plenary session is working this afternoon and has adopted the law on political parties. Gunnar Paal reports. [Begin recording] [Paal] According to the law on political parties that has just been adopted, a party must have at least 1,000 members. This is the decision taken today by the Riigikogu, with 65 votes in favor, four against, and three abstentions, as it adopted the law on political parties in its entirety. Constitutional Commission Chairman Mart Nutt: Will the law on political parties cast doubt on the future of a whole string of small parties? [Nutt] Not at all. As is known, the parties that are already operating do not have to reregister according to this law on parties. All they must do is bring their constitutions and programs in line with the requirements of the new law. This means that if they are below the 1,000 member limit, this will not serve as a basis for them to wind up their activity. Also, the parties that will be set up before the next Riigikogu elections will do so according to the previous principle, which means the requirement is 200 members. The new requirement of 1,000 members will come into force only after the next Riigikogu elections. It is aimed at strengthening parties. The parties operating now will drop out of the party register only if they fail to get any of their candidates into the Riigikogu during the next two elections. This is a logical path to follow because those parties who fail to make their mark on the political map, those parties have no point. [passage omitted]
