The secretary of state said: I want to affirm our wish to complete this stage so that we can embark on implementing the agreement and then administer daily affairs in Gaza and Jericho for the first time. This can be compared with what is happening in South Africa. These remarks came during a joint news conference Christopher and Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat held following their meeting with Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa today. Christopher stated that those who wanted to hamper and ruin the peace march had no better alternatives. During my meeting with Chairman 'Arafat, I found common ground for moving ahead, he said. Noting the talks' progress, Christopher said that this was manifested with the arrival of the first group of vehicles donated by his country to the Palestinian police force. He pointed out that this is only part of what the donor states have promised to offer. I congratulate Chairman 'Arafat and the negotiating Palestinian delegation on what they have achieved on the basic points. This demonstrates their determination to get over the tragic incidents and shows the need to implement the agreement, Christopher said. He added: We want to emphasize again the need to move ahead. The reports I have received from the concerned parties over the past six months have encouraged me. Christopher reiterated the U.S. determination to encourage the parties to proceed to the next stage. We want to be here and to do what we can to get closer to the implementation stage, he said. Speaking at the news conference, 'Arafat expressed the hope of reaching an agreement within the framework of the comprehensive settlement of the Middle East crisis on the various tracks. We hope we will overcome the obstacles that still hinder a Palestinian-Israeli agreement, 'Arafat said. 'Arafat expressed his appreciation of the role President Mubarak and Egypt played to support the peace process. He also thanked U.S. President Bill Clinton for assisting in the implementation of the Declaration of Principles and aiding the Palestinian police. At the end of the joint news conference, 'Arafat affirmed that the Palestinians will be fully prepared to sign an agreement on implementing the Gaza-Jericho Agreement once the obstacles hindering it are eliminated. He added that it is the other side that is responsible for placing these obstacles.
