FBIS4-27959 "dreas109_d_94008" FBIS-EAS-94-109 Daily Report 7 Jun 1994 South Korea DLP Seeks DP Support for Consensus on DPRK DLP Seeks DP Support for Consensus on DPRK SK0706090094 Seoul YONHAP in English 0833 GMT 7 Jun 94 SK0706090094 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, June 7 (YONHAP) -- The ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) will ask the opposition camp to cooperate in building a national consensus on dealing with the North Korean nuclear issue, it was learned Tuesday. At the same time, the ruling party will devise proper follow-up measures on its own to back up the results of President Kim Yong-sam's summit meetings in Russia. The party measures will be crafted through a series of meetings with concerned cabinet ministers who accompanied the president on his trip. At a meeting of top postholders presided over by DLP Chairman Kim Chong-pil at party headquarters in Yoido, the ruling party decided to seek the opposition camp's cooperation in supporting sanctions against Pyongyang through individual contacts by key postholders. President Kim will likely emphasize the need for a national consensus to settle the nuclear problem by maintaining a joint international stance when he explains the results of his Russian trip. Wednesday's meeting at Chongwadae will be attended by the heads of the three government branches -- administration, legislature and judiciary -- as well as the DLP and main opposition Democratic Party chairmen. The ruling party will hold a meeting with main postholders from the opposition camp as soon as Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and nuclear affairs ambassador Kim Sam-hun return home to give briefings on future measures and their consultations with the United States and Japan. In a separate move, the ruling party will convene the National Assembly Foreign Affairs and National Unification Committee this week to press for joint parliamentary measures, including the adoption of a resolution urging North Korean acceptance of nuclear inspections. At Tuesday's meeting, chief DLP policy-maker Yi Se-ki said, "despite the government's position that sanctions against North Korea are inevitable, there is some domestic opinion against the sanctions in fear of the possibility of war on the Korean peninsula. This (opinion) is feared to dissolve the prevailing public opinion and will be a stumbling block to the international mood against North Korea's nuclear adventures."
