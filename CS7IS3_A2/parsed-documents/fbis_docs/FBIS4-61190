Street traders, who have become a kind of symbol of the new times and new mores, are being driven from their trading pitches selected over the past few years. The strict decree prescribes the complete cessation of any unorganized trading from hand to hand and from stands, carts, or vehicles. Mindful of the fact that a similar merciless decree was also adopted by the city leadership of St. Petersburg last month, it is possible to speak of the end of the mass venture into the trading business by the working masses and pensioners. Grandmothers with packets of cigarette, loaves of bread, and mayonnaise are ending their labor exploit and returning to their grandchildren, to benches outside their entrances, and to [live on] their wretched pensions. It is possible to understand the authorities. They are pretty fed up with being accused of turning the squares and streets entrusted to them into speculators' "bazaars" which do little to embellish the city. At the same time unorganized trade has produced no income for the city budgets. On the other hand, there has been an easing of pressure from the street market "kings," who have had time to accumulate proper capital, to gain respectability, and to lose interest in the business in which they themselves started. What is proposed in exchange? Small-scale trade is being driven into commercial kiosks and stalls, a sharp reduction in the numbers of which has, nevertheless, been prescribed. The kiosks that remain will be permitted to trade only in the traditional "Soviet" range of goods -- tobacco, nonalcoholic beverages, flowers, souvenirs, newspapers. Industrial commodities and food will be prohibited. An exception has been made only for fruit. So pineapples will stay. But no hazel hens. Everything else must without fail be shifted in the direction of flea markets. The 70 Moscow municipal markets that already exist will be added to by a further eight this year. There will be free entry to the markets for customers. Anyone who pays will be permitted to trade. Commercial bus routes will be organized for traders. The lease periods for plots of land for flea markets will be increased. Prohibitions cover trade in weapons, military commodities, precious metals, animals, plants, children's goods, currency, and securities. We will still have to experience some inconveniences. You will no longer be able to buy the commodity you need right next to your apartment block. But this can be endured for the sake of cleanliness and order. Things will be appreciably worse only for the grandmothers, but they, who have not yet forgotten Soviet reality, cannot get into the habit.
