However, everything was quiet at the Hengsheng township, Guangan county, which was several kilometers away from Chengdu. Guangan is a famous granary in northern Sichuan. Our reporter visited the Guozi village of the township. Along the road, what he saw were plots of paddy fields. Peasants had stored water for winter a long time ago. They only wish to grow one season of grain crops next year. Just like in any hilly district in northern Sichuan, 90 percent of the young people in Guozi village left the village to work somewhere else. The average age of those left behind was 51 years old. Liu Benren, Secretary of the village's party branch, said: "People always wish to live a better life, while water always flows downward. Who can tie up their feet?" He has four sons and two daughter-in-laws working in other provinces. He himself stays behind to do farming for eight persons. "I was really upset during the busy farming season. I plan to call one daughter-in-law back next year. However, which one should I call? That is a good question," he said. In that village, calling a young worker back means a considerable loss of income. In many areas of northern Sichuan, traditional farming (particularly grain production) has become a "sideline production" aimed at providing basic grain for peasants' own consumption, fulfilling the task in grain production and making payments for agricultural tax and public welfare funds and other expenses. He calculated as follows: On the presumption that he reaps two harvests of crops a year. The per-mu yield of paddy rice is 1,000 jin and that of wheat 300 jin. He would receive about 480 yuan for each mu of farm produce. Only 180 yuan is left after he deducts 240 yuan of production costs, 60 yuan for tax (not including miscellaneous expenses). "That is why peasants say that farming would only give peasants rice crusts instead of rice," he added. Our reporter visited the Hengsheng post office and found out that the average per capita annual income of a villager working outside is approximately 2,500 yuan. It seems that Heaven itself makes special arrangements for the Guozi village to engage in farming. The gray, brown and purple soil in its Shaqimiao area is extremely fertile and good in retaining moisture and fertility. The climate is mild around the village with an annual precipitation of 1,050 ml, 1,246 hours of sunshine time and 320 days free of frost. There was a saying in history about "gold Guangan and silver Yuechi" (which means the local bumper harvest of millet and paddy rice). Thus, the saying that "grain and hogs can keep peace on land under heaven" has always been a local creed that make people sincerely convinced. Nevertheless, this creed is no longer useful. For the past 40 years since liberation, particularly since the implementation of the system of production contracted to the household in 1981, peasants in the Guozi village have greatly emancipated the productive forces by carrying out farming with a scientific approach. The per-unit yield of grain (paddy rice) in 1985 registered a five-fold increase over 1949. The fact that increases in production, but not income, has made peasants worriless about food and clothing, but they can hardly become rich. Prior to the exodus of a large number of labor force, the per capita income of villagers in the Guozi village was wavering, for eight years, around 400 yuan which is just enough to cover food and clothing only. Slack farming season is a good time for building new houses. About 20 percent of the families in the village have built new houses since 1989. The majority of the families have people working outside. On one occasion, our reporter met Xiao Guanghe who just came back from Guanddong. He worked as a small contractor with a net monthly income of 2,000 yuan (He does not have work to do every month.) Right now, he is planning to build a 30,000-yuan new house. According to the local customs, men have to leave their family and live separately after reaching adulthood. Therefore, they often leave their hometown to start their new life. Their parents often cannot afford to support them from their meager farming income. It was under this condition that Xiao Guanghe left the village with a 400 yuan debt from his marriage. He paid back what he owed in the first year right after he started working outside. The loss of creditability of the grain-hog creed is even more clear on the issue of land. In the past, there were always disputes among peasants on the uneven distribution of responsibility fields. Now nobody is willing to accept any farming assignment. In order to avoid any penalty for leaving the farmland idle, old people and women often take over the responsibility for farming. Anyone who wishes to sub-contract a mu of farmland for farming, he or she has to pay 50 yuan per mu of farmland to the one who accepts the responsibility for farming. Someone pointed at a plot of dry land which was lying idle to our reporter, saying that the person supposed to till this piece of land is an orphan. He left the village and worked outside for many years now. No one is paying any tax so far. Liu Huaifu left the village and worked outside a year ago. He is now the deputy manager of the engineering command of the Chuanhui Group in Guangdong. Perhaps because he is educated, he can do a better job in doing calculation. In 1993, he straightforwardly bought grain from a supply and marketing cooperative and turned it over the state and considered his obligation to till his responsibility farmland as completely fulfilled. A String Cannot Hold--by reporter Sun Kai [1327 0418] The first person our reporter visited in the Xinzhuang village was Huang Junfang, who ranked quite low in the Huang clan in terms of seniority. From her outward appearance, Huang Junfang was entirely different from the village girls that our reporter met in the village. She wore a pair of ankle boots, a pair of jeans and a fashionable coat and had a fine hair style. In the Xinzhuang village, Gangu county, this 20-year old girl spoke Mandarin with a mixture of Guangdong and Gansu accents. She said: "What I cannot stand here is the lack of changes. Everything here remains the same as when I was a child." After graduating from a junior middle school three years ago, Huang Junfang went to Dongguan, Guangdong Province, and worked in a woolen textile mill. She just returned home to spend her new year here. Our reporter talked to many young people in the village. They shared Huang Junfang's views. People did farming scores of years ago just like their grandparents and parents. They still carry out farming in the same way. Dozens of years ago, the narrow streets in the village were full of mud on rainy days. They are still full of mud on rainy days today. Scores of years ago, the toilet in their house was concurrently used as a pig sty. It was so dirty that one could hardly put one's feet down. It is still the same way now. Naturally, now they have enough to eat, and they can eat white bread and meat regularly. Many people can also watch television. However, as far as the young people are concerned, they are not satisfied. After graduating from a junior or senior middle school, what can they do at home? Tilling a small plot of farmland is no fun either. Therefore, they just loved to loaf around. Fortunately there is the billiard. They spend a great deal of time in the billiard room. The millionaires in the developed countries will be shocked if they visit the most backward countryside in China, because they would discover that this kind of gentlemen's game is everywhere in China's rural areas. They would perhaps see an unkempt peasant using a cue to hit the balls just as dexterously as those bigshots in a television program. However, young people still seek to leave the village! The per capita 0.3 mu of farmland to each person is a harsh reality which pushes the young people out of the village to look for a new and better life somewhere else. Huang Junfang said: "It is only when I am outside that I realize that what kind of a poor life did I live before. It is just like what the song describes -- the world outside is wonderful. Right now I earn more than 1,000 yuan a month in Dongguan. In addition to what I give to my family, I can still buy clothing and other things for myself." "I already have many friends in Dongguan. They teach me to speak Cantonese. Sometimes we went out to sing Karaoke. I feel that my life there is very happy. Right now, each time I come home to spend the new year, I feel uncomfortable. Everything is not right. I am no longer accustomed to this kind of environment," she added. "There was a girl in the neighboring village. She is a senior middle school graduate. She is good in English. When she went to Dongguan, she worked as a temporary English teacher in a school. Later, she stopped teaching because of her heavy Gansu accent. However, she met another teacher in the same school and married him. Now she has a son, leading a happy life. Once she visited us, and all of us admire her immensely," she continued. Looking at Huang Junfang, our reporter asked her: "Would you like to settle down there and never come back again?" "I like to do so, but whether or not I can achieve this goal is another question," she replied. One Cannot Afford To Build a House If One Needs To Feed Oneself by Farming -- by reporter Liu Jian [0491 0256] Moving, an immigrant's aspiration, seems to have been instilled into the gene of Liu's offsprings. Even during the 30 odd years in which the system of household registration was mostly strictly implemented in China's history, villagers of the Liujiaguanfang Village had persistently left the village and moved to other localities. Gradually less people moved out of the village after land division in 1981 until the mid-1980s, because there were high yields of crops several years running, the price of grain was higher than that of industrial products, and peasants earned more money by growing crops. In addition, there was neither fund-raising nor fund retention for other miscellaneous expenses. Nor was there any "movement." Another peak of labor force exodus took place between 1986 and 1987, because the pressure for subsistence had once again increased. In the vicinity of the Liujiaguanfang Village, peasants generally grow one season of wheat and one season of peanuts. A village cadre calculated in such a way. Suppose a mu of farmland yields 200 kg of peanuts a year (this output is already fairly high) and the net income from this will be 700 yuan. Peasants need to invest a minimum of 70 yuan for chemical fertilizer, 20 yuan for insecticide, 20 yuan for plastic film, 60 yuan for seeds and 20 yuan for tractor plowing. Again suppose the per-mu yield of wheat is 175 kg (this output is already fairly high) and the net income of this will be 140 yuan. Peasants need to spend 10 yuan for tractor plowing, 20 yuan for seeds, 10 yuan for sowing, 55 yuan for chemical fertilizer and 10 yuan for insecticide. By adding and subtracting the aforementioned income and expenses and deducting 6.5 yuan for land tax and 200 yuan for the grain which peasants need to consume themselves, the net income will be approximately 340 yuan. After the mid-80s, a "two fields system" was introduced. The per-capita 1.5 mu of farmland was split into 0.8 mu of farmland planted with grain for peasants' own consumption and 0.7 mu of high-priced farmland which was taxed 100 yuan per mu. If these expenses were deducted and funds were retained for miscellaneous expenses, the annual net income from each mu of farmland would be less than 200 yuan. This was entirely unthinkable ten years ago. An old man recalled that a bag of compound fertilizer which he paid 70 yuan now only cost 18 yuan at that time. A bag of ammonium bicarbonate made in the United States which he paid more than 90 yuan now only cost 36 yuan at that time. There was no high-priced farmland which we need to pay 100 yuan per mu as land money. Peasants only needed to pay land tax no matter what kind of land it was. The prices for insecticide, and electricity are up. So is the amount of retention for public welfare funds and miscellaneous expenses. The highest price increase is wedding. The old custom of having a family of three or four different generations living under the same roof is already smashed to pieces. No girl is going to marry someone who cannot afford independent housing. Even matchmakers would find all doors shut if the prospective bridegroom has no house of his own. Straw huts with earth-filled walls are out of fashion long time ago. Only bridegrooms with houses built of tiles and bricks and with glass windows will be considered. No matter how poor a bridegroom is, he must have a house of high standards, otherwise he would remain a bachelor for a long time. Several years ago, one must pay 5,000 yuan for a good house. Now standards are becoming higher and higher, and the building materials are becoming more and more expensive. Now it would cost at least 10,000 yuan to build a house. Another 10,000 yuan are needed to pay for the wedding expenses. If the young people in the village were not hard pressed by the 20,000 yuan they need to get married, there would be less young people leaving. College and military service are the two ways for young people to distinguish themselves. During the 13 years between 1981 and 1993, 12 young people from the Liujiaguanfang Village passed examinations and entered colleges and graduate schools. More than 100 years before, the most educated person in the Liujiaguanfang was Liu Songsheng, sometimes called Yuezhong or Junfeng, who was a candidate for the lowest degree under the former civil service examination in 1851 during the Qing Dynasty. The only goal to study is to enter a college. (People in Liujiaguanfang regard postgraduate, undergraduate and polytechnic school students as "college students.") All of them belong to a higher class. As for those children who are not so bright and whose academic standards are low, parents usually dragged them to do farming as soon as they finish their primary school education. If they have the slight hope to pass the college examination, the parents would economize on food and clothing to let them continue to study. When they fail one examination, they would attend revision classes for another year. If they failed again, they would attend revision class for another year.... Among the 12 college students, only one of them got into college as soon as he graduated from the senior middle school. All others had to repeat classes or attended revision classes from one to five years before they passed the college entrance examination. That means they had to attend the college entrance examination from two to six times. One of them had to transfer his household registration to Qihetai in Heilongjiang Province, because the standard is much lower there and he had a better chance to pass the college entrance examination. Many of the young people in the Liujiaguanfang village serve in the army, but few of them ever came back to resume farming again. They often worked hard to distinguish themselves after joining the army. Even if they do not become cadres, they would work hard to win the title of "volunteers." In short, they try one thousand and one ways to change their rural residence registration to a city or other non-rural resident registration. Between 1992 and 1993, city or "other nonrural resident registration" is on sale everywhere in the village. A Linyi resident registration was worth 5,000 yuan, and that of Junan resident registration 3,000 yuan. In 1993, five villagers of the Liuchiaguanfang village used this simple but quick way to move to the city. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table (II) (By village) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Item |Liujiaguanf-|Xinzhuang V-|Huxia Villa-|Guozi Villa-|Dagang Vill-| | |ang Village,|illage, Gan-|ge, Jiangxi |ge, Sichuan |age, Jiangs-| | | Shandong P-|su Province | |Province |u Province | | |rovince | | | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |population |1,115 |1,406 |1,065 |1,119 |1,768 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |per capita |1.5 mu |0.32 mu |1.76 mu |0.87 mu |1.1 mu | |farmland | | | | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Degree of M-|24 tractors |0 |3 small tru-|power equip-|315 kw | |echanization| | |cks |ment for fa-| | | | | | |rming 170 h-| | | | | | |orse power | | | | | | |and irrigat-| | | | | | |ion power e-| | | | | | |quipment | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Total Manpo-|400 |350 |633 |771 |980 | |wer | | | | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Floating Ma-|210 |over 300 |35 |310 |200 | |npower | | | | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Family of a Runaway From Marriage--by Lu Yaogang [4141 6460 0474] I finally met Zou Binzi. When I hurriedly entered the old, shabby waiting room at the Nanchang Railway Station on 4 January this year, it was already 2000 hours in the evening. I saw this dark and lean young man sitting there and reading a READERS magazine. He was just like a needle in the haystack which I just picked up. Zou Benzi was born in the Huxia Village. I stayed in his house for eight days. I could see that his honest and sincere parents did not know the true reason for my visit. Nor did they know that their smart son Benzi had gone to Beijing to look for a job in order to runaway from a marriage which they had arranged for him earlier. Benzi was new in Beijing. He slept under the Jianguomen Overpass at night and looked for job during the daytime. It was a freezing early spring. Running out of cash, Benzi was in a desperate position. He was hungry and cold. He wandered around on the streets in Beijing for ten days. He was mentally on the verge of a total collapse. It was at the time that our newspaper's "Hotline for Young People" saved him on time. In rural areas, parents also do not lead an easy life. Benzi has a family of seven including two elder brothers, one younger sister and one younger brother. His two elder brothers got married and moved out. So was his sister. The next one in line for marriage is Benzi himself. However, Benzi who just left the army did not want to get married according to his parents' wish. He just ran away, although his parents had already paid 3,200 yuan as betrothal gifts to the bride-to-be. with their son disappeared and the bride-to-be family refusing to return the betrothal gifts according to a village custom, the parents poured out endless grievances. There were six villagers' groups and 253 families in the Huxia Village. All villagers were of three surnames -- Zou, Fu and He. Zou Benzi's family belongs to the lower middle class in terms of living standards. Three thousand two hundred yuan is an astronomical figure! Now the money is gone forever. Price changes every year for wedding. If a man does not have 10,000 yuan now, he has little chance to get married. Zou Pinzi's family has five mu of paddy rice field and three mu of upland field. In 1993, a natural calamity hit the farmland sown with early rice. The family only harvested 4,500 jin of paddy rice, 400 jin of peasants, 70 jin of soybean, more than 30 jin of sesame and over 100 jin of rape seeds. When all accounts were settled, the family's net income from farming was only 1,000 yuan after all the expenses were deducted (not counting the labor cost). Although the purchasing price for 100 jin of grain changed from over 20 yuan to 40 yuan, peasants in the vicinity of the Poyang lake only have a slight surplus from their double-crop paddy rice, even if they have engaged in meticulous farming, and weather is good for the crops. More serious is the fact that no one can prevent the price of the agricultural producer goods from increasing. These price increases would cut the small amount of surplus even further. The possibility for peasants to become well-to-do is almost zero. Relying on his dexterity, Zou Benzi's father has a sideline job of gathering and selling goose feather during the slack farming season, and earns about 1,000 yuan to help the family pay bills. However, he can only save about 200 to 300 yuan after paying all the expenses and putting aside enough money for preparing farming for the next year. Then, how many years they have to work hard in order to save enough money to help Benzi get married? Under the light of a dim kerosene lamp, Benzi's mother said to our reporter with a sigh: "There is nothing our family can do to help Benzi any more in this connection. Let the brothers go out and blaze their trail." Nevertheless, Zou Benzi also clearly understands that although he has finally attained his parents' understanding and extricated himself from the prearranged wedding, he has not completely broken away from his predicament in subsistence. This is the main reason for him to leave the village and work outside. That was precisely the topic he talked about most when he made a special trip from Guangdong's Kaiping City to see me. World in Southern Jiangsu Is Wonderful--by Dai Yuanzhi [2071 5913 2388] No highway leads to the village. Nor is there any telephone in the village. One must cross the two main rivers in Southern Jiangsu -- the Tongyu River and the Chuanchang River, in order to go to the Goudun Township in Funing County where the village is. It takes 90 minutes to travel from Nanjing to Beijing by ship. However, it takes 70 minutes to ride the only private-owned passenger boat to travel from the village to the township. With an opportune chance, Chen Liang, a young man of the Jieyu villagers' group of the Dagang Village of the Goudun Township in Funing County, Jiangsu, left his home village which was surrounded by water on three sides in the spring of 1993, travelled to Southern Jiangsu, arrived in the flourishing city of Wuxi, and worked in a state-owned factory. A year ago, our reporter, under a moonlight, rode his bicycle along a narrow path and crossed two rivers and came to visit Chen Liang's family. It was a quiet night in winter in the countryside. A thick layer of frost like snow settled on the ground. We smoked, drank tea and talked informally. "Our village is always in the red. However, documents show that the 1993 per-capita net income in the village is 920 yuan. Sometimes, it is said to be over 800 yuan. (Some people said it was only 400 to 500 yuan, while others said 900 yuan.) In 1992, the village reported its per-capita net income to the high level as 750 yuan. The report failed to pass the township level. Finally, it was agreed to be 880 yuan." Villagers who surrounded the reporter calculated as follows: There are 1,950 mu of farmland, power equipment for farming totaling 170 horsepower and power pumps for water drainage totaling 315 kw in the whole village. There are 980 able-bodied peasants in the village, but only 500 peasants are needed for farming. There is a surplus labor of 480 people. A villager said: "A person who works outside can earn 1,000 to 2,000 yuan a month. Most of the young people like to work outside and earn more money." Chen Liang's family of six (including the grandmother they support) takes care of 10.6 mu of farmland. It raises some hogs and chickens. It also has a hand-driver tractor, a boat with a 12-horsepower motor and a rice mill. The family is considered as doing well in the village. However, Chen Liang's father said, I would have left the village long ago, if I have no facilities like these. I am someone who looks good in appearance, but lacks cash at home. My net income is several thousand yuan, but the money is never in my hands. People owe me money, and there is nothing I can do about it. When I went to the southern part of the Yangtze River last year, I really wanted to leave the village. If I work hard outside for a year, I would have cash on hand. He said that right now, Chen Liang and his sister are working in Lucun, Wuxi. One works as a "peasant-turned contract worker" at the state-run Xinsu Machinery Plant, while the other works as a "contract worker" at a workshop in the Textile Varieties Research Institute. After the Spring Festival Chen Liang is going to send his younger sister to Wuxi. If there are suitable jobs and a place to live, he (Chen Liang's father) and his wife also plan to leave the village and work outside, and let the grandparents take care of their home. Driven by the financial benefits, over 200 of the 480 surplus men and women are working in other provinces, and more than 100 of them are working as temporary workers outside. With the development of the market economy today, the manpower is being used in close connection with tools of production [sheng chan gong ju 3932 3934 1562 0367) and objects of labor [lao dong dui xiang 0525 0520 1417 6272] according to the principle of market allocation. The export of labor force is perhaps one of the ways to help a less developed area become well-to-do.
