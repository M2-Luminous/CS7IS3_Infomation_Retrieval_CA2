The explanations are needed because of the highly complicated structure of the budget plan, Platais said. In addition, the representation of some spendings in state and local budgets has changed, he added. Platais downplayed criticism, voiced Monday by MP [member of parliament] Ludmila Kuprijanova, that the government failed to budget for the social sphere. The increased pensions are not reflected in the state budget because the government ties the increase of pensions with the increase of wages in 1994, and the subsequent raise of social tax payments, Platais said. The government also does not intend to cut maternity allowances, as suggested by Kuprijanova, said Platais, but parents of minor children will have choose between an allowance or an income tax waiver. The budget plan should be pushed through the parliament soon to start funding the projected reforms, the minister concluded.
