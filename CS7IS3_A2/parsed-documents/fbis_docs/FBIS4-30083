"The law is in line with the economic and social reality of Japan and is also well balanced internationally," Hata said in a statement. The product liability bill was passed into law Wednesday by the House of Councillors after the second chamber's plenary session voted unanimously in favor of the bill. The more powerful House of Representatives already passed the bill June 15. Hata said his ministry will take adequate steps before the law goes into effect in one year, including dissemination of the law among concerned industries. The product liability law will require consumers seeking compensation to simply prove that a product was faulty, rather than the present system whereby consumers must prove negligence by the maker. But the law does not incorporate a provision holding makers liable for damages or injury through assumption of a link between the damage or injury and a defective product. It took almost 20 years for the bill to be enacted since the Social Policy Council, an advisory body to the prime minister, began debate on better consumer protection from defective products in 1975.
