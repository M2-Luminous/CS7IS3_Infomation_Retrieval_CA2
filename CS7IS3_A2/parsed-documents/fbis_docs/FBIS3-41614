In the words of Gossanepidnadzor Chairman Yevgeniy Belyayev, in the first nine months of this year the number of cases of measles in Russia has increased by 320 percent in comparison with the same period of last year, cases of whooping cough by 29 percent, and cases of epidemic parotitis by 31 percent. There were 10 outbreaks of dysentry, abdominal typhoid, hepatitis, and salmonella recorded in the country in 1993, as a result of which around 7,000 people fell ill. Diphtheria has reached epidemic proportions: The number of people suffering from this infection has reached 5,000; around 300 have died, including 50 children. This situation, in Yevgeniy Belyayev's opinion, has been brought about by the unsatisfactory state of the environment, a reduction in the immunity levels of Russians, the low level of inoculation among adults and children, and a shortage of vitamins and preventive medicines. According to the information of the ``Kedr'' constructive ecological movement, which actively cooperates with the country's sanitary and epidemiological services, around 60 million Russian citizens today live in conditions permanently exceeding the maximum permissible concentrations of noxious substances. Levels of atmospheric pollution exceeding the maximum permissible concentrations by a factor of 10 are periodically registered in more than 80 cities and industrial centers. Around 28 cubic km of contaminated effluent are discharged into Russia's water reservoirs each year, of which 8.4 cubic km have not been purified. Highly toxic organic compounds, heavy metal salts, phenols, and petroleum products are discovered in water sources. In the words of Anatoliy Panfilov, chairman of the ``Kedr'' movement, the threat to the health of the population, above all to children, has prompted the movement's members to put forward an initiative on purchasing abroad a large quantity of medical preparations to boost immunity, as well as equipment to produce them in Russia. After acquiring the necessary medicines, the Gossanepidnadzor specialists, in conjunction with activists of the ``Kedr'' movement, will deliver them to citizens most in need of them in the unfortunate regions.
