Raja Mohan: "U.S. Questions Kashmir's Status as Part of India"; italicized words as published] [Text] Washington, Oct. 29. The entire State of Jammu and Kashmir is a "disputed" territory and Washington does not recognise that the State's accession to India in 1947 as meaning that "Kashmir is forevermore an integral part of India," says a high level official of the Clinton Administration. The official was briefing, on background, reporters from the sub-continent here late on Thursday. In a series of troubling remarks on Kashmir, the official, a key decision-maker in the administration on South Asian policy, declared that the Shimla agreement signed by India and Pakistan in 1972 may no longer be an effective instrument for resolving the Kashmir dispute: "It is 21 years old and there have been very few discussions, if any, under that accord in terms of resolving the Kashmir dispute." The official argued that "by definition, ipso facto, it has not been very effective." The remarks of the Clinton administration official now complete the comprehensive reversal of the more even-handed approach on Kashmir outlined by the Bush administration in 1990. In a Congressional hearing in 1990, the Bush administration declared that the Shimla Agreement had superceded the United Nations resolutions on Kashmir. Responding to the popular concerns in India about the remarks of Mr. Clinton on Kashmir last month at the United Nations, the official said that "it was not a signal to suggest there is a secret U.S. diplomatic strategy to insert itself as a mediator in the Kashmir dispute." Saying that Kashmir is on the American radar screen along with Yugoslavia, Somalia and the former Soviet Union, the official pointed out that it is not easy to overlook the Kashmir problem. Ready to Mediate On the question of American role in Kashmir, the official said although the Clinton Administration is not now putting itself forward as a mediator, it is willing to do so, "if all the parties to the dispute want it." The official left the reporters in no doubt that Washington considers the Kashmiris an indispensable element of any settlement of the Kashmir dispute. "There is no way any resolution can be stable and lasting unless agreed to by the people of Kashmir," said the official. Confirming the Indian suspicions that Washington is not averse to internationalising the Kashmir dispute, the official said the United States is now set to engage Russia in a formal consultation on South Asia. The senior administration official, who is visiting Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan next week, is also travelling to Moscow to consider the development of joint initiatives with Russia on conflict resolution in South Asia. On the question of Pakistani support for terrorism in Kashmir, Washington had put a lot of pressure on Islamabad to end such activity, according to the official. "Our view is that there seems to be less of that going on now." Whatever, the external support to militancy in Kashmir, according to the official "there are very strong indigenous elements to that insurgency." The official also declared the apparently new American assessment of the insurgency in Kashmir, that it is "really self-sustaining." The remarks of the American official suggest that the recent Indian initiatives to set up a Human Rights Commission and the offer of the Indian Prime Minister to open a dialogue with Pakistan on Kashmir have been the result of sustained American prodding. Washington has pushed the government of India "very hard to clean up their act." Washington has demanded that the Government of India needs to "make the security forces accountable for their own behaviour." "Making people disappear, encountered killings, extra-judicial executions, death in custody, all this stuff, frankly, there is no excuse for it. Insurgency is not an excuse for that kind of activity and behaviour on the part of security forces." On India's offer to discuss issues related to Kashmir with Pakistan, the official pointed out that Washington had been encouraging India and Pakistan to engage in a serious discussion on Kashmir. The administration official revealed that the United States was "pushing diplomatically" in the run up to the elections in Pakistan that India "must turn over a new leaf" when a new Government takes over in Pakistan. The official regretted that the stand-off at Hazratbal has come as an unexpected impediment to the renewal of Indo-Pakistan dialogue on Kashmir. Urging restraint on all sides, the official said the United States is encouraged by the Indian decision not to storm the shrine, and called on Pakistan not to exacerbate the situation by making provocative statements. Responding to a question on the growing anger in the Indian public opinion on the American intervention in Kashmir, the official stated that such public perceptions do not negate the broadening and deepening of the Indo-U.S. relationship. She pointed out that "the Indian Government and Parliament have come to recognise that their own perceptions of the standard of human rights was not being met" in Kashmir. Solarz's Remarks In a related development, the remarks on Kashmir by Mr. Steven Solarz, the nominee of President Clinton to be the new Ambassador to India are likely to cause some anguish in India. At a meeting with a group of Indian parliamentarians organised by a Washington think-tank, Mr. Solarz raised the hypothetical question of the impact on India's stability in the event Kashmir were allowed to secede. He referred to the two alternative views, one stressing the damaging consequences to Indian unity, and the other suggesting Kashmir is a unique problem, the separation of which is unlikely to affect the unity of India. Although posed in the form of an academic question, it may provide some clues to the emerging mindset in the Clinton administration on Kashmir. The rather sharp presentation of its views on Kashmir by the Clinton administration leaves no room for fudging and finessing in New Delhi. New Delhi's belief that incremental concessions to the United States on key issues could buy a more cooperative attitude from the Clinton Administration has been, clearly, a dangerous illusion. India is on its own in Kashmir. The Government in New Delhi needs to demonstrate that it has the determination and tenacity to defend India's basic national interests.
