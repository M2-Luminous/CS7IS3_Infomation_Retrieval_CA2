Jovanovski; date and place not given: "Social Endurance Like the Sword of Damocles"] [Text] It seems that there is a tendency her for us to get used to the deficit in public spending; any effort to find a solution for getting out of the crisis, if it is realistically weighed, should be accepted; we do not have any institutions for measuring social endurance. These days the Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia --FYROM] Government's stabilization program is a frequent topic of discussion, both in the Assembly where it was adopted, and outside the parliament, at professional or less professional meetings. A large number of economists have also expressed their own opinion of it; they have evaluated the solutions envisioned for various sections of the program, each from his own standpoint. In several reviews, however, it seems to have been forgotten that we already have experience in creating our own program. This has to do with the Anti-Inflation Program, as it was officially called, or the "Easter" Program, as the people later called it. We talked about stabilization in 1994, but also about other things, with one of the creators of the "Easter" Program, and at that time the head of the expert government--Academician Nikola Kljusev. [Jovanovski] Mr. Kljusev, we are at the end of 1993, when results in various fields are being summed up. How do you assess the past year, viewed in economic terms? [Kljusev] This year was also a very critical one, both in terms of events in Macedonia in the area of interethnic relations, and on the economic level. From the economic standpoint, several qualitative changes occurred in the economy and in general in the standard of living. The assessment is that we are still sinking toward the bottom of the crisis. On the other hand, several significant economic indicators are showing negative tendencies--the social product and employment are declining, there are no investments.... The losses are much larger than the modest capital formation. In spite of that, consumption is growing. Personal consumption has grown by about 26 percent, and public spending is showing an enormous deficit. We also appear to be getting used to that deficit. If public spending is swallowing up 10 percent of the social product, the fact that it will fall to 6 percent in 1994 cannot make us happy. [Jovanovski] The deficit will be covered from foreign sources, however. [Kljusev] Those indicators are bad signals, because we do not have resources of our own to cover the deficit. It is an extremely complex problem. Thus, the economy is showing a structural atrophy, as well as declining trends--by 15 percent in industry, by 20 percent in agriculture (with the drought also having an effect), but also in other sectors. All of this induces caution, with the aim of opposing those trends and stopping consumption. The intentions of neutralizing the unfavorable effects of the declining trends are therefore noble ones. [Jovanovski] In your opinion, what are the stabilization program's chances of success? [Kljusev] Basically, any effort to find a solution for getting out of the crisis, if it is realistically weighed, should be accepted, if it is not based on illusory and exaggerated optimism. In that regard, it can be said that the program, as an effort to get out of the unfavorable situation, undoubtedly constitutes an expression of positive aspirations. If one studies it thoroughly and looks at its anatomy, however--the pillars on which it is based--one will see that its goals and ambitions are in conflict with the center of gravity that it does not have. It is simply not catching up. [Jovanovski] What center of gravity do you have in mind? [Kljusev] The center of gravity here is not the real economy and its potential; it is not the productivity and capital formation capacity of the national economy; instead, it has to be financial support from abroad. [Jovanovski] What are the similarities and differences between the stabilization program and your Anti-Inflation Program? [Kljusev] The theoretical postulates are the same. At that time we did not have a chance of expecting financial aid, since relations with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank had not been settled, but the anchors were clearly emphasized: the foreign exchange rate, wages and the freeze on them, and prices and the monetary sphere, in which we established discipline. The "Easter" Program, however, fell precisely over what this program is going back to, namely the regulation of relationships in consumption. At that time, however, several frivolous deputies proposed a law on wages that the government did not support. The president of the Assembly also raised his hand in accepting such an idea. [Jovanovski] In your opinion, what was the real reason for the adoption of the law on wages? [Kljusev] There were probably manipulations by several parties that wanted to come to power. We reduced inflation of 74 percent a month to 6 percent in August. The program fell, however, and so did the government. Let's not go into that. The essential thing is that those who voted against the program then have sobered up. They are beginning to realize that relationships in public and private consumption should be settled, and that a justifiably restrictive approach should be established. Under the Conductor's Baton [Jovanovski] Will the people be able to endure that restrictive approach? [Kljusev] Well, that is the key question. Actually, the program was worked out under the conductor's baton of the IMF and the World Bank. It is not our invention. How much it is our wish is even questionable. We are in debt to these institutions, but also to commercial banks. The IMF, however, has strict criteria regarding the repayment of loans, it does not allow rescheduling, but the IMF gives the green light for financial relations with the rest of the world. We are undoubtedly under a strict conductor's baton. The IMF's criteria are aimed at creating the conditions for repaying of the debt to the World Bank, and so actually a bridge arrangement is being established, a bypass arrangement to settle the obligations to these financial institutions, in the amount of $137 million. We are also prisoners in that respect. [Jovanovski] We will have to face repayment of the debt at some point. Now we will have to repay the old debt, but we will receive new loans. What is the best thing to do in this situation? [Kljusev] We should utilize the situation rationally. We should achieve creditworthiness abroad and initiate our projects that will be attractive to world financial institutions and the world industrial sector. We have to focus on joint investments, and not establish ties only with financial institutions on a credit basis. That would be fatal. [Jovanovski] The loan approved by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development for our Electrical Industry is a good sign, of course? [Kljusev] It is a good chance. We have to make sure that all that money is utilized efficiently and fully in the economy. Not one dollar should go into consumption. [Jovanovski] Let's go back to the stabilization program. How much can the completely unachieved but sought-after consensus affect implementation of the program? [Kljusev] In this case we have to have a realistic attitude in assessing the partners. It has to do with the relationship among all the partners--the government, employers (i.e., the chamber), and the trade union. All three partners are not clear representatives in the role that they are supposed to play. The government, through the parliament, is not expressing the will of all the deputies, and, one might say, of the people as a whole. That is indicative, as the criticisms being made of the program and the criticisms being made of its adoption are refuted. Employers are unknown. Traditionally they are owners, but in our country a quasi-role is played by the chamber, reluctantly. The trade union likewise does not fully represent the working class, in conditions in which other independent trade unions exist. It does represent the lion's share of employees, however, and they should have been prepared for the price of depriving the working class of its subsistence. That price was recognized after the fact. That lack of preparation is making employees into potential opponents of the program. If the government wanted the program to be a national one or a state one, then all the entities should have been prepared while it was being coordinated. Exaggerated Optimism [Jovanovski] But you have also developed your own program? [Kljusev] We drafted it only because of the fact that along with the anti-inflation program, we also introduced our own currency. That is the biggest secret. The journalists' prior announcement of the introduction of the denar resulted in damages of several million marks, in just two or three days. [Jovanovski] At the beginning you mentioned a term--exaggerated optimism. What do you mean by that? [Kljusev] I mentioned it because significant areas have not been regulated here. In the first place, a systemic approach has not been completed in economics and in the economy. It is sufficient to mention the lack of a law on firms, i.e., enterprises. With respect to the development of the tax system, however, I agree on this. In this case the state should demonstrate its honor, its dignity, and its responsibility. If it gives in on taxes, then it cannot be a law-governed state, since in the West, the basic attitude of the citizen toward the state is viewed in terms of taxes. [Jovanovski] Yes, but here the state has bought social peace by not collecting taxes. [Kljusev] Well, it is an extremely significant issue. Why did we have that much of an increase in wages, 26 percent? Why do we have an enormous deficit in the public sector? Isn't that an answer to your question, that social peace is being bought? If that spiral continues, nothing will be left of this program. [Jovanovski] The program provides for a real reduction in wages. How far can social endurance be stretched? [Kljusev] I don't know how much the program is interfering with social endurance. Won't it collapse through several unwanted incidents? It is like a sword of Damocles hanging over the program. Who is studying social endurance in our country? There are institutions in the world that research it. All of the shifts and conflicts are giving signals that the government measures are being modified. There are also many other unresolved issues, however--political tolerance, slow privatization, rehabilitation of the banking sector, which is of exceptional significance and should be carried out as quickly as possible.... [Box, p 3] Clearing Up Banks' Bad Debts It is very important to reexamine the entire banking system, which is perhaps the most problematic aspect now. It is sinking in various bad debts which are carried over from year to year, and if that trend continues, it will affect the entire economy. The government assumed a big obligation by specifying that the rehabilitation would begin in four months. The unrehabilitated banks can be a weak point in controlling financial flows and financial services provided by the banking system to the economy and the populace. I am not completely certain whether a Bank Rehabilitation Agency should be formed or whether they should be rehabilitated bank by bank. If, for example, Komercijalna Banka has carried out some sort of rehabilitation itself, for which it has received certification by an international institution, it should be allowed to operate. One or two healthy operational branches should be taken away from Stopanska Banka and the headquarters and the rest of the branches, for example, should be rehabilitated. It is a difficult process that will require both time and money, and personnel changes at the banks. [Box, p 3] Limiting Factors [Jovanovski] What factors can have a limiting effect on successful implementation of the stabilization program? [Kljusev] In addition to the uncompleted economic system and social endurance, disruptions may also occur because only the social sector is being taken into account in personal consumption. But how much does the private sector share in that consumption, and how much does the gray economy? The latter is distorting the scale of the so-called effective consumer. There are people with uncontrolled sources of income who are exerting pressure on that sphere. There is nothing on them if they buy a modern type of automobile, and so forth. And an enormous part of the population is below the poverty line, on the brink of subsistence. The program did not take into account how much of total consumption consists of uncontrolled income from the gray economy. Balance-sheets should have been prepared for that, just as balance-sheets should have been prepared for all the debts and for all the obligations, both those abroad and the domestic debts, and then it should be stated what relationships will be like in the economic consumption sector, in public consumption, and in personal consumption. That leads into the issue of social endurance. We are also very vulnerable in the area of political tolerance. To what extent does it exist? A consensus has not been reached on issues that should naturally link us. Next, there is the slow transformation of ownership. Is there any insight into the positive and negative effects of the slow transformation model? In addition to those internal factors, there are also several external ones, which primarily have to do with our surroundings.
