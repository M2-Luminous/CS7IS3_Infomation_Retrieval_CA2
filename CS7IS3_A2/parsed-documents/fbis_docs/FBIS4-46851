Killer. First They Are Hired for `Hit Jobs'; Then They Are Invariably `Eliminated' as Undesirable Witnesses"] [Text] About seven years ago journalists using the English word "killer" had to explain what it meant in Russian. These days it is one of the most popular words in our newspapers. And here is why. According to the information of the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs], last year almost 30,000 people died at the hands of their own criminal compatriots. Among them were a large number who were murdered by contract. However, it is virtually impossible to cite the exact number of contract killings: Investigations into such crimes are difficult, and, indeed, no such concept yet exists in the criminal code. A contract killing costs money, and a lot of it. It is rare for one vagrant to hire another to kill a third. More often it is business rivals who are killed. Or businessmen refusing to pay their dues. Or criminal kingpins from rival gangs. According to the preliminary data of the Russian MVD Main Administration for Combating Organized Crime, last year a contract character was officially established to 237 murder cases. True, as far as exposing the criminals and bringing them to justice is concerned, results were more modest -- only 65 murder cases were thus solved. In effect, Dmitriy Medvedev, chief of a department of this administration says, there are significantly more contract killings, but it is sometimes simply impossible to prove it. Often a murder has all the hallmarks of a "contract job," but there were apparently no reasons for such a grave outcome for the victim. Professionals involved in investigating these terrible crimes confidently state that around 80 percent of those who fall within a killer's sights either themselves belonged to the criminal world formerly, or were in close contact with it. The remaining 20 percent were victims of their own intractability and refusal to pay their dues.... As a rule, the whole thing revolves around very large sums of money. The tradition has arisen among respectable businessmen of surrounding themselves with bodyguards. As practice shows, this is no obstacle for a professional killer. All that happens is that collateral victims are added to the main target. The murder of the well-known St. Petersburg businessmen Vagin may serve as an illustration of this conclusion: In addition to Vagin himself, the militia found a further three corpses at the scene of the crime. Bodyguards. The most sensational contract killing of recent times in Moscow was the murder of Otari Kvantrishvili. Neither a host of bodyguards, nor a colossal network of connections saved him from the fateful shot. The murderer has not been found to this day, and no serious breakthroughs in the investigation are evidently to be expected in the near future. Initially, one version was that the killer was not a professional -- the bullet was fired from a small caliber rifle ("Couldn't they get hold of a more reputable weapon?") Experienced officers from the Main Administration for Combating Organized Crime hold the opposite opinion: A small caliber rifle is the idle murder weapon, but only in the hands of a professional. When a shot is fired to the head, the bullet pierces one wall of the skull; it does not have the velocity to pierce the second, and begins to richochet wildly in the head, turning the brains to jelly. The success rate is 100 percent. The investigations into the deaths of Nikolay Likhachev, chairman of the board of "Rosselkhozbank," Sergey Dubov, president of the "Novoye Vremya" publishing house, Valeriy Vlasov, director of "Valeriy's" casino, and many others, have all fallen flat. In recent times (and extremely unexpectedly) yet another category of victims has emerged -- major gangland kingpins and godfathers. There is even talk that the MVD has set up a special hit squad. Colonel Medvedev's comment on these rumors was categorical: Rubbish! As a class of professionals, hitmen have appeared in our society comparatively recently: Supply has arisen to meet the demand. Former heroes of the Afghan campaign, special purpose troops, separated KGB officers -- they have already been taught to kill professionally. Or to defend: A killer with the sobriquet Andron somehow fell into the hands of operatives. It turned out that he had previously served as a personal bodyguard to Boris Pugo, the former USSR interior minister. Dmitriy Medvedev relates that the departments engaged in the battle with organized crime have not only tried to set up a data bank on "working" killers, but have even begun preventive work with those inclined to choose this profession. The Main Administration for Combating Organized Crime has already gathered information on 37 hitmen. This already represents a great deal of work -- after all, it takes the work of hundreds of officers to expose each one of these "figures." Certain conclusions and generalizations have also been made. There are two categories in the professional hitmen's "guild" -- lone gunmen and squads. Neither are long-lived. A lone gunman who gives a poor account of himself is "rubbed out" by the contractors themselves after two or three jobs. In the squads, if the gunmen see one of their comrades on the brink of getting busted (if he lands up in the station, he will drop everyone in it), he is also "rubbed out" -- the collective survival instinct operates. Sometimes you meet with "specialists" with several dozen corpses to their name -- they are highly valued and well paid in the criminal world; they even manage to occupy a certain niche in the criminal hierarchy. But in the end, even these are rubbed out: They know too much about too many people, and become dangerous. The case of one Bakulev from Izhevsk is extremely typical. He had more than 30 murders to his name. The militia followed his trail (more accurately, followed the corpses in his trail), but at the last moment, he mysteriously vanished. Finally Bakulev was found. Murdered. His own kind settled accounts with him. Squads of hitmen are more of a problem -- you cannot wipe out the whole gang overnight. And if they fall into the hands of the militia, their friends on the outside do not spare money in hiring the best lawyers. The "activity" of the squads usually has an itinerant character -- "first aid" in reverse. One such squad is now in a detention center; more detailed information about it cannot be given at the present time. Everyone is always interested to know how much it costs to have somebody murdered. There are no hard-and-fast tariffs here. For instance, a gang of five hitmen in Kandalashka asked the extortionate price of 20 "lemons" [million rubles] for the murder of a prestigious person. And in Moscow there is information that hitmen get hundreds of thousands of dollars for prominent personalities. For conspiratorial reasons hitmen are frequently hired through third, fourth, and fifth persons, and these "contractors" and "subcontractors," as in any normal deal, also add on their "trade surcharge" -- as a result the price for fulfilling the contract increases appreciably. Operatives who regularly take part in the investigation of such crimes note one detail: Today any weapon is put in the hand of the hired killer, even including weapons of which the American and European special services, for instance, have themselves only a single example in their arsenals. Neither cost nor transport across any borders is any object. And although there are reports of contract killings almost every day, as far as is known, not one criminal case has been brought to court in which a well-known hitman has been in the dock. It just so happens that he does not live to face trial, even given robust health. And this is understandable: Who needs sensational exposures? Only the press. This is how the analysts in militia uniform are inclined to assess the situation as regards contract killers today. But what about the state? What new rights has it given to the militia so that it can react properly to an attack by hired killers? Just imagine, the operational workers say: Is it possible to solve a murder and collect sufficient irrefutable evidence on a suspect within 72 hours of initial detention? What planet do our legislators live on, if they stubbornly refuse to recognize even the following fact: In just six years, murders have become eight times more frequent in our capital. Anatoliy Yashkin, deputy chief of the Russian MVD Main Administration for Combating Organized Crime, admitted that law-enforcement organs have themselves probably been insufficiently forceful in their demands on legislators. And indeed: It is possible to institute criminal proceedings against a suspected hired killer, and even gather the necessary evidence. But as for getting to the client who hired his services... The practice of the best foreign law-enforcement systems testifies that it is possible to get somewhere only when the organizer of the murder receives a sterner penalty than the actual killer. There is no other way of fighting the mafia. But here people believe that there is and say: Hey, guys, don't be yellow. But the guys are not yellow. They become hitmen -- the pay is good, and they are in the news every day.
