A basic condition for the functioning of political parties is freedom of speech and the press. These play a basic role in linking party administrative organs and party members through mass information. Beginning in 1993 the ERK Party was forbidden from publishing its own newspaper. The party chairman and other members of the leadership operated under pressure and persecution. Despite this the ERK Democratic Party was able to communicate its own position to the Uzbek people through the foreign press, and in this way attempted to preserve the connection between the party leadership and party members. The 4th Congress of the ERK Democratic Party took place under difficult conditions for the party. The appeal to the government made at the 16 May 1993 meeting of the party central council remained unanswered. This demonstrated once again that no compromise is possible between the government and the opposition. It must be said that the difficult conditions for the party caused a state of depression among some party members. Their lack of will and weakened beliefs caused a deviation from the basic principles stated in the party statutes and led them to seek a way of uniting with the present government which is attempting to maintain the old order. I want to dwell on this question in detail: the government, making use of the political inconsistency of the likes of Shodi Karimov and Sodiqjon Yigitaliyev, is acting to blacken the reputation of the ERK party and give it a bad name among the people. The persons mentioned above have accused ERK of an unwillingness to compromise. Fine, in what way could there be compromise between the government and the opposition? Specifically, what are the conditions for compromise between the ERK Democratic Party and the present government? For a compromise to be reached between the government and the opposition their codes in the sectors of politics, economics, and social issues would be in conformity and the government has to consider the opposition code as a variant of its own code. This is a normal situation in democratic countries. As for our critics, they are ultimately thinking of compromise in a primitive manner and see compromise in the form of personal interest. For example, it was suggested by the president that Muhammad Solih, chairman of the ERK Democratic Party, be given high rank. The entrance of an opposition leader into the government -- if it were possible to accommodate the code of the opposition -- would make it possible to excuse him. On the other hand, it is possible that an opposition leader entering the government would be turned into one of today's shadow cadres. Muhammad Solih did not accept the "high rank" because he does not accept the government's policy of arbitrary action and terror. As for Sh. Karimov and S. Yigitaliyev, they have begun to follow a path of rapprochement with the government. Undoubtedly, their personal interests have caused this. Had Muhammad Solih left the party ranks and they themselves became the leaders, they would have accepted the "high rank" because, unlike Muhammad Solih, they would not have the courage to reject rank for belief. The historian Sh. Karimov must have planned entering history this way all of a sudden. I have sound reasons for saying this. Events I witnessed personally before and after the Congress can prove it.. II. It was the beginning of September 1993. I was called to the office of the chief physician; he said that presidential advisor Mavlon Umrzokov was coming to Termez and said he wanted to meet with me. I went to the offices of the viloyat administration at the appointed time. Professor Sh. Karimov was waiting for me here. He said "we came with Mavlon Umrzakov," and stressed the word "Umrzakov." We went into a separate room and conversed. Sh. Karimov talked about the situation which had manifested itself in the party, and began to heap all the party's sins on Muhammad Solih. "We have to massage the president and the governors, and act on our own policy," said Sh. Karimov. "We have to examine this issue at the party congress and reelect the leadership." I understood Sh. Karimov's goal but kept my own council. If I had protested to him or expressed my ideas openly, it would have become known to those in this government and endangered my participation in the congress... "The congress will resolve everything," I said to Sh. Karimov. Our talk did not last long "Mavlon has to hold a meeting," said Karimov. "Let us go and join them..." We went outside and ran into one of the viloyat leaders. "We can talk about everything with Namoz," said Sh. Karimov. "If God wishes, our congress will go well." I was surprised at this talk because the date of the congress had still not been announced. Above all, what was the connection of the viloyat head with our congress? We went with Sh. Karimov to the reception room of the viloyat governor's office where he had to meet with M. Umrzokov. We sat down in the room. Whenever we heard a voice, Sh. Karimov rushed outside. He would come back in and say "Mavlon still has not arrived." This happened a number of times. Finally, they said that M. Umrzokov had arrived. I kept sitting in my place. As for Sh. Karimov, he said "I am ready" and hurried to the meeting with another person. But he quickly returned and said "They said that Mavlon is in a hurry and cannot meet with us." Sh. Karimov and M. Umrzokov returned to Tashkent together. The fact that the presidential advisor and Sh. Karimov traveled on the same road together has symbolic meaning because the roads we select and the road the present government selects are completely different... I found out later that during Sh. Karimov's "trip" to Kashkadaryo the "Erkists" claimed that Samad Murod did not agree to his proposal. At this, Sh. Karimov said "if he does not agree, we will beat him up." Sh. Karimov kept his word. After the Congress Samad Murod was brutally beaten. This is the true face of Professor Sh. Karimov! "Professor"-terrorist! This event is clear proof that he is working together with the security organs to destroy Erk as an opposition party. In this way Sh. Karimov also wrote a report to the Ministry of Internal Affairs about recognizing ERK member Safar Bekjon, who is now sitting in prison, from Ellikkala, and stated this himself at a meeting of the Khorazm Viloyat chapter of the ERK DP. Now "professors" like him have organized a new party. We have no doubt that it is an organization of KGB agents... Before we went to the congress Jovburi Abdulhakimov, first deputy governor of the viloyat, summoned me to his office. Because this person had only recently been appointed to his position we were unacquainted. "The ERK Congress should be held soon, do you know anything about it?" he asked. I said I did have information about it. J. Abdulhakimov talked a long time about the president's policy. Finally, he said: "Now the president is God, no one can stand against him...Your leaders are insignificant next to him. Thus, my advice to you is to think about what you do at the Congress... Recently an ERKist professor came to Termez (he meant Sh. Karimov). If you were to elect such a man as that to the leadership, it would be acceptable." The deputy governor repeatedly ordered me not to stare at him sullenly or look to the viloyat leaders. Naturally, I could not protest strongly to J. Abdulhakimov. Had I done that, I would have been imprisoned on the spot and could not have taken part in the congress. It is true, however, that I read the letter of party leader Muhammad Solih at the congress and bothered the deputy governor thusly. III I do not conceal the fact that, when I went to Tashkent to take part in the congress. it was with a feeling of trepidation that something would happen there. When Sh. Karimov and S. Yigitaliyev had reached an arrangement with the government, I know that they had traveled through all the viloyats. As it became known later, none of the ERKists went to speak to them. Talks I held with Hamidullah Nurmuhammad, secretary of the ERK Party's Central Council, Nasrullo Said, secretary of the Bukhara viloyat's central council, Samad Murod, secretary of the Kashkadaryo viloyat council, and Sulaymon Murod, secretary of the Samarkand viloyat council confirmed this. A day before the congress a meeting of the party executive committee was held at which Central Council secretaries and party viloyat secretaries attended. Sh. Karimov and S. Yigitaliyev also took part in the committee meeting. We went over the planned organization and daily agenda. The Central Council committee decided that Council Secretary Otanazar Oripov would open the congress and I would read the letter of the party leader. In an article in KHALK SOZI S. Yigitaliyev sid: "Despite the sentence passed against Otanazar Oripov, he opened the party congress. Is this respect for the law?" First, Professor Otanazar Oripov was judged by lies. And then, the Central Council committee told him to chair the congress meeting. And S. Yigitaliyev voiced no protest over this at the committee meeting... The congress was opened at 10 a.m. on 25 September, 1993 at the Railroad Workers Palace of Culture in Tashkent. The executive committee, mandate commission, and other commissions were elected. The daily agenda was confirmed. Central Council Secretary and Chairman Professor Otanazar Oripov read congratulatory telegrams from leaders of political parties in foreign countries and introduced the congress guests to the delegates. Among the guests were Kirgizboyev of the presidential office and representatives from the Tashkent city governate and representatives from political parties and movements as well as the well known poet Dadakhon Hasan and Shukhrat Ismatullayev, cochairman of the BIRLIK people's movement. Correspondents from the republic and foreign press came to cover the congress. The meeting was turned over to me to read the party leader's letter. The sociopolitical situation in the republic was briefly analyzed in the letter, repressions directed against the opposition were criticized, and the fact that the ERK Party will not deviate from the road to freedom was reconfirmed. Congress delegates listened to the letter attentively. I have to say that the letter added spirit to the delegates' spirit and strength to their strength. I should add that the discussions which began after the letter was read continued in this spirit. All viloyat delegates, including S. Yigitaliyev, took part in the discussions. The cochairman of the BIRLIK People's Movement Shukhrat Ismatullayev spoke. Kirgizboyev, the responsible official from the presidential office, gave a report for half an hour. This is clear proof that the congress was held in a democratic manner. Sh. Karimov's words were repudiated by the delegates, and he was driven from the podium by prolonged clapping and catcalls because he renounced his party principles to the congress, found common language with the government for his own personal interests, and had gone down the path of open betrayal. After a recess congress delegates discussed questions of making changes in the party statutes. S. Yigitaliyev participated in this actively. The powers of the party leader were abbreviated in the statutes. The last question was reelections to the party Central Council. Three party members from every viloyat were elected to the Central Council. After this the congress delegates passed on to the question of electing the party leader. Muhammad Solih's candidacy was endorsed unanimously and welcomed with applause. Both Sh. Karimov and S. Yigitaliyev was taken aback by this endorsement of Muhammad Solih. When the congress chairman asked: "Any against or abstaining?" No one raised their hand. Why did party members support Muhammad Solih to this extent? Because he is the true leader of Uzbekistan's democrats. When it comes to the question of leadership, there are many who want the job, but few true leaders. Leaders manifest themselves not through their own person, but through the people. The leader does not vote for himself, the people vote for him. Sh. Karimov and S. Yigitaliyev wanted to be leaders themselves; they came to the ERK congress and were thrown into confusion. After this they have tried to besmirch Muhammad Solih and the ERK Party. If the ERK Party leader did not recognize himself in the leadership, the people did and followed him, and no one else. Even before Uzbekistan entered its "reconstruction" Muhammad Solih was recognized by the people through his poems and articles on the national struggle. If he was on Central Committee Ideology Secretary R. Abdullayeva's "blacklist" during the time of I. Osmankhojayev, and on Central Committee Secretary Anishchev's "blacklist during the time of R. Nishanov, so is he now on I. Karimov's "blacklist." As Sh. Karimov has written, after Muhammad Solih's talent and activities became known he organized ERK. ...The last question at the congress was electing a general secretary of the party's Central Council. A number of party members put forward their candidacy for the general secretaryship. Among them were Otanazar Oripov, Ibrohim Hakkul, Shodi Karimov, Sodikjon Yigitaliyev, Samad Murod, and myself. Everybody but Samad Murod withdrew their candidacy and he was elected general secretary. Why did not Sh. Karimov and S. Yigitaliyev put up a fight for the position of general secretary? There are a number of reasons for this. First, they were burdened by the government with the duty of distancing Muhammad Solih from the party leadership. They were unable to do this at the congress. Second, had they put up their names for the general secretaryship, they only would have received two votes; i.e., S. Yigitaliyev would have voted for Sh. Karimov and Sh. Karimov would have voted for S. Yigitaliyev. The congress delegates are men of high principle and spiritual purity. A vote by them for hypocrisy is unthinkable. When we come to Samad Murod, who was elected general secretary of the ERK DP, he is one of the inspired sons of the nation who has struggle for the independence of the fatherland and democracy. Samad Murod was put under pressure for his views and imprisoned. After having been elected general secretary of the party, they beat him mercilessly. Despite this, he continues to fulfill his duties. IV The last decisions of the congress were ratified. On the day after the end of the congress, I returned to Termez. It was Sunday, the 26th of September. Later, there was a loud knocking on my door. I opened it, and a policeman stood there. "I am Officer Berdiyev," he said. "You are to go with me to the court." I said: "I am not going anywhere" and sent the policeman on his way. An hour later the chief of police accompanied by some of his officers came and took me to the viloyat internal affairs offices. Viloyat Chief of Internal Affairs Colonel Sharipov and viloyat department chief of the National Security Service Bozorov began to ask me questions. I refused to answer their questions and demanded to meet with the viloyat Governor Jora Noraliyev. The next morning more police came and took me to Sharipov's office. I expressed my wish to meet face to face with the governor. Viloyat Governor J. Horaliyev sent Colonel Sharipov out of his office and we began to talk. As we were talking First Deputy Governor Jovburi Abdulhakimov came in. He had an angry face and was obviously incensed. He did not sit down but came over to me and asked, "You confuse me. Who gave you permission to read Muhammad Solih's report?" I said to Governor Noraliyev "if this person does not change his tone of voice, nothing will come out of our talk." The deputy became even angrier: "What are you? You are the son of a peasant. Why do you keep silent about what you are doing?" Without saying good-bye, I left the governor's office. The next day national security officials paid a visit to the Termez offices of the ERK Party and removed all our papers. They sealed the door of our offices. A few days later a trusted friend who works in the government came to me, sayingthat they were opening a criminal case against me and that, if I did not leave the viloyat, I was in danger of being thrown in prison...On 10 October I left Termez secretly.
