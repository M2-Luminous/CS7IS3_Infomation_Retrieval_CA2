The journalists were interested in why ratification of START I by the Ukrainian parliament is being rejected by the participants of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council [NACC] or why it is being criticized. The minister of foreign affairs of Ukraine noted: Now one should consider that opinion is changing since a Ukrainian proposal for the formula was adopted in the joint communique. The word -- unreservedly -- was removed from the draft [which said] -- Ukraine should ratify START I unreservedly and fully. So this means that ratification of START I by Ukraine is a fact. In his replies Anatoliy Zlenko found quite a successful comparison concerning the unreserved ratification of START I and said that Ukraine had received a terrible gift from the USSR -- the Chernobyl plant and the accident there. Ukraine has been left alone with this tragedy. It spends 15 percent of the state budget on eliminating the aftermath of the accident. And so Ukraine has learned from misfortune, and that is why it is demanding compensation for nuclear weapons. Therefore, if our state hands over the whole nuclear arsenal to Russia, it will be left alone with its problems and the world community will forget about Ukraine. Another paradoxical fact ensues -- Ukraine needs nuclear materials for its electric power stations and buys them from Russia. It pays vast amounts of money for this, and it has not received a cent for that nuclear arsenal, which it handed over to Russia.
