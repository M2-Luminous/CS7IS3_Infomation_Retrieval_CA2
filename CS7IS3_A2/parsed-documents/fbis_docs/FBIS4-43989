President Yeltsin, with the political statement signed in Brussels on 9 December 1993, the EU [European Union] and Russia agreed on the principles and directives on which the partnership and cooperation agreement should be based. I am particularly happy because one of the important EU actions under the Greek Presidency is the signing of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with your country. Today's ceremony clearly shows the great importance the EU attaches to its relations with Russia. It confirms the EU's continued support for Russia's democratic development and reflects the great value for the EU of Russia's constructive participation in international and regional affairs, always in accordance with the principles of the United Nations and CSCE, which we have both signed. We know of Russia's interest in accession to the international and European organizations and welcome recent developments. The agreement we will sign constitutes the base for our cooperation across a broad spectrum of issues. The agreement provides the legal framework and reinforces the political dialogue between the EU and Russia. We sincerely hope that it will lead to mutual understanding and fruitful political cooperation that will contribute to the stability and security of all Europe. The agreement should give a big boost to our economic relations. It considers the intricacies of the economic, fiscal, and structural processes in Russia. It provides our economic bodies with the necessary framework and the guarantees to move forward. Ultimately, the agreement includes the possibility of expanding into a free trade zone. This agreement will also contribute to the success of our common goal, which aims at consolidating a new and democratic Europe and political and economic progress in our continent. I am convinced that our new partnership will contribute to safeguarding the peace and prosperity that our people desire so much. I thank you.
