FBIS4-32810 "drlat104_a_94003" FBIS-LAT-94-104 Daily Report 29 May 1994 CARIBBEAN Cuba Press Release on Occupation Press Release on Occupation FL2905212694 Havana Tele Rebelde and Cuba Vision Networks in Spanish 1700 GMT 29 May 94 FL2905212694 Havana Tele Rebelde and Cuba Vision Networks Spanish BFN [From the "Sunday Supplemental NTV" newscast] [Text] It has been reported in a press release that a group of people illegally entered the residence of His Excellency Paul Vermeirsch, the Belgian ambassador to Cuba, on the morning of 28 May in an attempt to push for their departure from Cuba. This new incident is another consequence of the calls to illegality made by counterrevolutionary stations broadcasting from Miami and, basically, the result of the restrictive policies implemented by U.S. immigration authorities who continue to block legal procedures for people wanting to emigrate to the United States. These people resort to illegal and even violent means to depart the country after repeatedly failing to obtain visas. The revolutionary government, which does not obstruct those who comply with the legal procedures for departing Cuba, has reiterated, on several occasions, its commitment to not allowing the use of illegal break-ins into diplomatic missions in Cuba as a mean of leaving the country.
