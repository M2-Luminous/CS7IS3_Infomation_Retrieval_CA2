The activities of the aggressor have significantly diminished compared to this afternoon and the early hours of this evening, but tank and howitzer shells are from time to time landing on the town. Firing from infantry weapons has also diminished in intensity compared to what it was an hour or so ago. However, there are no indications that the aggressor is withdrawing, something that is demanded by the NATO ultimatum. But there is evidence that attacks on the Rogatica and Pale areas of the battlefield are intensifying. Fresh and stormy events are probably in store in this area.
