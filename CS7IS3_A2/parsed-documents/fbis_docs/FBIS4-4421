They have lost their self-confidence, and its loss has come too abruptly. It is important, however, for them to humbly verify how the U.S. economy has recovered and to learn from the recovery to revitalize Japan's economy. The U.S. economy has shown a remarkable recovery by registering a high, 7.5-percent growth rate during the October-December quarter. During the same quarter, the Japanese economy posted negative growth of 2.2 percent, thus demonstrating a large gap in the growth rates between the Japanese and U.S. economies. The Federal Reserve Board (FRB), which had stuck to a monetary policy of keeping real interest rates low, has returned to a tight monetary policy by twice raising the interest rates for federal funds (FF). The Clinton administration's macroeconomic policy basically aims to spur the U.S. economy by keeping interest rates low through cuts in the federal budget deficit. Plants' rate of production soared to 83 percent of capacity, and this has caused concerns that the U.S. economy could become overheated and be a bubble economy. It is a matter of course for the FRB to shift to a tight monetary policy. The Clinton administration, which sought a low-interest-rate policy, has no choice but to accept the FRB's shift. Looking at the world economy, the so-called "English-speaking economic group" of the United States, Britain, Canada, and Australia was in the grip of a serious recession shortly after the end of the cold war. FRB Chairman Greenspan once revealed a sense of crisis, saying, "The U.S. economy is about to face unprecedented difficulties." Meanwhile, the economies of a united Germany, the European nations, and Japan remained notably robust. Structural Shift Through Revitalization of Market Function The English-speaking economic group is now enjoying a booming economy after coming out of a recession, thus throwing cold water on Japan and Germany, which are still mired in recession. This phenomenon of a reversal cannot be explained simply by a time lag in the economic cycle. The recovery of the English-speaking economic group, especially the United States, has occurred after it made its economic system, which emphasizes the market, function smoothly, and it has accomplished a shift in its economic structures during a recession in a relatively short period. Major U.S. industries, including the automobile industry, have studied the management strategy of Japanese enterprises from various angles. They have thoroughly restructured themselves to improve productivity and to bolster competitiveness with the aim of outstripping Japanese enterprises. General Electric Chairman Jack Welch once said, "I intend to `imbue the spirit of a small corporation' in order to revitalize our bloated organization." In this way, U.S. corporations have streamlined their management. Major U.S. banks, like their Japanese counterparts, were saddled with bad loans because of the financial and real-estate recession, but their performance is now improving after writing off these bad loans. Bank loans have become more available than ever, thus smoothing the flow of money. The market has given high marks to U.S. corporations' cuts in dividends and their paying off of debts as part of their efforts to streamline management, and this has made it possible for them to speedily write off their bad loans. Citicorp Chairman John Reed and other many other U.S. bank executives have been highly praised for fulfilling their management responsibilities rather than being blamed for writing off their bad loans to streamline their banks' management. U.S. corporations and banks have been able to thoroughly restructure themselves because deregulation has kept open the opportunities for new businesses. In the information and telecommunications sector, which is said to have the potential of generating explosive demand, deregulation has removed the fence between telephone firms and cable television firms. Vice President Gore has announced plans to build an information superhighway. New plans, which can be assessed as being a little overoptimistic, have been announced. Unlike the Republican administration, which despised industrial policy as a "filthy term," the Clinton administration, which has handled the economy as a priority policy task, has begun implementing its industrial policy centering on basic industrial technology. The administration recently announced a new program of private-public sector cooperation to develop the next-generation semiconductor. A shift in the structure of the U.S. economy has begun taking effect in concert with restructuring efforts by corporations and banks and with the Clinton administration's strategy. The change in the economic structure has resulted in high unemployment. The jobless rate has soared to 6.5 percent, and the United States has yet to escape its jobless growth. Labor Secretary Reich once attacked corporations for sharply cutting their work forces, saying, "U.S. corporations have cut too deeply into their hearts." U.S. manufacturing industry, which is eager to improve its productivity, is trying to reduce its work force as much as possible. The absorption of workers by the service sector still remains weak. Even if jobless persons who used to serve in the military or work in high-tech industries find service-sector jobs, they complain about low wages and consider service-sector work to be not worthwhile. They are highly depressed mentally. Japan Urged To Create New Businesses Through Deregulation What should Japan learn from the recovery of the U.S. economy? The blind introduction of the U.S. method of cutting the work force would cost society too dearly. Japan has no choice but to grope for its own coordinated method of employment. Strengthening the market function through deregulation and creating new demand would be the way to rid Japan of its recession. It can be said that excessive regulations are keeping both Japan and Germany from escaping their recessions. Deregulation is a policy goal of the Hosokawa government, which is seeking economic reform. In fact, however, deregulation has made little headway because the government has only named the sectors to be deregulated. Deregulation will be incorporated in a package of measures that the government will formulate in late March to open the Japanese market. If each ministry and agency makes a piecemeal deregulation proposal in order to share the pain, deregulation thus would be meaningless. It would be more effective for the government to set policy goals for sectors, as was done for the information-telecommunications sector in the United States, and to announce steps to relax the current regulations governing such sectors. It is important for the government to consider relaxing the regulations with specific purposes in mind instead of stressing aimless deregulation. Industrial policy should be reviewed sweepingly. It is necessary for this policy to stop taking measures for enterprises which could lead to managed trade, and it is necessary that it emphasizes assistance to the research and development of basic industrial technology. In the present world economy, developing countries in Latin America and Asia are now equal with the industrialized nations in the manufacturing area. To raise the level of technology, which is the foundation of Japan's economy, both the government and private sector need to rebuild the current research and development system. In the post-cold war world economy, there is no dominant economic superpower as the United States was in the past. Just as U.S. corporations have learned from Japanese enterprises' management, Japanese enterprises should embrace the merits of U.S. corporations' management and cost consciousness. Both Japanese and U.S. enterprises have entered an age in which they learn from each other and give an impetus to each other.
