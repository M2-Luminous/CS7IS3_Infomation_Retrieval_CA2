In the minister's opinion, local governments should come up with money to install locks in the outer doors of big apartment houses, improve street lighting, and create systems to combat car stealing. "This would certainly do a lot more good in the future than offering easy money to the police," Arike claimed. The minister said his ministry is working out a national safety program. "I don't think it is realistic to place hope in a pattern of a police state where strong police forces guarantee national security," Arike noted. "To achieve security, local governments, the police and all citizens must work closely together."
