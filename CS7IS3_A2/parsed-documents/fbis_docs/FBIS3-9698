The party chairman, Vaclav Klaus, told Czech radio about the meeting: [Begin Klaus recording] Today's meeting discussed the outcome of the talks of the Coalition Four held yesterday and confirmed, more or less, our basic positions. As far as election laws are concerned, we have still not managed to reach a compromise, or what could be termed its essence. We repeat that our current positions on this issue are still valid. These positions have been voiced on many occasions, and, as far as this case is concerned, they happen to be identical with those contained in the government's proposal, which is already in parliament. To pursue any further talks in this respect, our party's political committee has authorized the chairman to negotiate possible compromises with the coalition partners. That is one thing. As for the other topics, a consultation on the next course of action to be taken with regard to Jewish property is to take place later today. Several of our ministers will attend. I think these are the main matters we are currently interested in. [end recording]
