He said that 113 people had already arrived by plane in Moscow from Djibouti, which borders on Yemen, after being brought there on the French warship, Jules Verne. The Russian Foreign Ministry, says the Russian diplomat, is in constant contact with its colleagues from France. Should the situation worsen in Aden in the south of the country, we have obtained the agreement of Paris to bring out as many Russians as possible from there on a warship which is due to approach the port of Aden in the near future. Our consul general in the town has been given exhaustive instructions in this regard. As for the country's capital, Sanaa, we have plans to bring Russians out overland to the port of Al Hudaydah where our ship the Khudozhnik Kustodiyev is waiting. Although Sanaa airport is, according to our information, besieged and the situation there is unsafe, the Russian leadership has allocated two passenger planes which are ready to fly out there for our people if the situation is permits.
