In a letter sent to that ecumenical organization, the terrorists say any person who visits Cuba, holds talks, or supports its authorities directly or indirectly will be declared a military target, regardless of his nationality or nature [as heard] and will suffer the consequences inside or outside of Cuba. Referring to the warnings by the U.S. Government to those individuals or groups preparing terrorist actions against third countries from within U.S. territories, Alpha 66's letter adds it will stop at nothing and will confront the consequences. Meanwhile, the coordinators of the Friendship Caravan have reported the caravan of 70 vehicles traveling through 140 U.S. cities continues to advance satisfactorily. During the travels group leaders give lectures, visit churches, and collect donations. According to plans, the volunteers will reach Laredo, Texas, on 6 March, and three days later they will cross the border into Mexico; they will then take the goods to a ship that will sail to Cuba from the Port of Tampico.
