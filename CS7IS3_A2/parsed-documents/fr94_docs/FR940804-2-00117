FR940804-2-00117 FR940804-2-00068 (2) The impact of entry of such judgment upon the public generally and individuals alleging specific injury from the violations set forth in the complaint including consideration of the public benefit, if any, to be derived from a determination of the issues at trial. 15 U.S.C. 16(e) (emphasis added). The courts have recognized that the term ``public interest'' ``take[s] meaning from the purposes of the regulatory legislation.'' NAACP v Federal Power Comm'n, 425 U.S. 662, 669 (1976); United States v American Cyanamid Co., 719 F.2d 558, 565 (2d Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1101 (1984). Since the purpose of the antitrust laws is to ``preserv[e] free and unfettered competition as the rule of trade,'' Northern Pacific Railway Co. v United States, 356 U.S. 1, 4 (1958), the focus of the ``public interest'' inquiry under the Tunney Act is whether the proposed final judgment would serve the public interest in free and unfettered competition. United States v Waste Management, Inc., 1985&hyph;2 Trade Cas. ¶66,651, at 63,046 (D.D.C. 1985). In conducting this inquiry, ``the Court is nowhere compelled to go to trial or to engage in extended proceedings which might have the effect of vitiating the benefits of prompt and less costly settlement through the consent decree process.'' 6 Rather, absent a showing of corrupt failure of the government to discharge its duty, the Court, in making the public interest finding, should *␣*␣* carefully consider the explanations of the government in the competitive impact statement and its responses to comments in order to determine whether those explanations are reasonable under the circumstances. 6 119 Cong. Rec. 24598 (1973). See United States v Gillette Co., 406 F. Supp. 713, 715 (D. Mass. 1975). A ``public interest'' determination can be made properly on the basis of the Competitive Impact Statement and Response to Comments filed pursuant to the APPA. Although the APPA authorizes the use of additional procedures, 15 U.S.C. 16(f), those procedures are discretionary. A court need not invoke any of them unless it believes that the comments have raised significant issues and that further proceedings would aid the court in resolving those issues. See H.R. Rep. 93&hyph;1463, 93rd Cong. 2d Sess. 8&hyph;9, reprinted in (1974) U.S. Code Cong. & Ad. News 6536, 6538. United States v Mid-America Dairymen, Inc., 1977&hyph;1 Trade Cas. ¶61,508, at 71,980 (W.D. Mo. 1977). It is also unnecessary for the district court to ``engage in an unrestricted evaluation of what relief would best serve the public.'' United States v Bechtel Corp., 648 F.2d 660, 666 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1083 (1981). Precedent requires that [t]he balancing of competing social and political interests affected by a proposed antitrust consent decree must be left, in the first instance, to the discretion of the Attorney General. The court's role in protecting the public interest is one of insuring that the government has not breached its duty to the public in consenting to the decree. The court is required to determine not whether particular decree is the one that will best serve society, but whether the settlement is ``within the reaches of the public interest.'' More elaborate requirements might undermine the effectiveness of antitrust enforcement by consent decree. 7 7 United States v Bechtel, 648 F.2d at 666 (quoting United States v Gillette Co., 406 F. Supp. at 716). See United States v BNS, Inc., 858 F.2d 456, 463 (9th Cir. 1988); United States v National Broadcasting Co., 449 F. Supp. 1127, 1143 (C.D. Cal. 1978); see also United States v American Cyanamid Co., 719 F.2d at 565
