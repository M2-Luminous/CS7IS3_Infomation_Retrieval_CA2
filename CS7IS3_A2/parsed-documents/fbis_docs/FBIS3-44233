The Allied Forces in the name of the best interest of the nation, simply withdrew the candidates to the presidency of the parliament to make way for the old bureau led by the Sacred Union of the Radical Opposition. [Unidentified reporter] At 2200 at the People's Palace, the moment was marked by the end of despair and emotion sustained by the USORAL for 48 hours following a disagreement over the members of this political group that should be members of the bureau. After a very tense moment exacerbated by strongly termed statements and after a four-hour interruption that enabled the two sides to organize a vote to come to an agreement, Mr. (Joseph Singawuju) took the floor to withdraw the candidates of the Allied Forces -- (Ninda Kabika) and Dr. (Bwasa) -- deciding that there should not be a win-or-lose attitude. An immense joy erupted in the conference room. People embraced one another. There was applause to mark the end of the conflict that almost led the deliberations into an impasse. (Ange Luni Bembe), (Kaben Bingo), Nguyi Nduba, and Vangu Mambwene will from now on -- and until the next legislative elections -- be the close aides of Monsignor Monsengwo. On the other hand, the former bureau led by the USORAL, including Joseph Ileo, Christophe Lutumbula, (Kinkela Vinkanci) and Valentin Mubaka, will continue to hold office in the new legislative body. Called to take the floor, the leader of the bureau, Valentin Mubaka, could not find the words to express his joy and expressed his gratitude to his colleagues for showing the necessary political will to put an end to the dual institutions. The new bureau will be officially and solemnly presented today as of 1400 in the presence of the diplomatic corps invited at the People's Palace to attend the ceremony.
