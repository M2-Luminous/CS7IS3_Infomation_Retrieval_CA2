FBIS4-8449 "dreeu072__a94021" FBIS-EEU-94-072-A Daily Report 13 Apr 1994 ANNEX Czech Republic Reconsideration of Temelin Not Ruled Out Reconsideration of Temelin Not Ruled Out AU1304145694 Prague CTK in English 1139 GMT 13 Apr 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU1304145694 Prague CTK English BFN [Text] Prague, April 13 (CTK) -- The State Office for Atomic Safety (SUJB) is not ruling out a new round of talks on construction authorization for the Temelin nuclear power plant in south Bohemia, because it does not expect the necessary documents on a new security system to arrive in time, MLADA FRONTA DNES writes today. Karel Bohm from the SUJB told the paper that unless the Czech Energy Utility (CEZ) submitted documents on the effect of Westinghouse technology on nuclear safety, the SUJB would not permit the installation of the safety equipment. The construction project envisages the installation to be realized in mid-1994. "CEZ will probably not be capable of submitting the document in an acceptable form in time," Bohm says. He said that Russian-type safety equipment should be used for the Russian-type reactors in Temelin, and that the reconsideration of Temelin construction can be initiated only by the local district administration in Ceske Budejovice if the Westinghouse equipment application would substantially change the original project, Bohm says. Westinghouse has been chosen to replace the Russian technology in an effort to raise the plant's safety. Construction at Temelin started in 1986 but later was suspended. In March 1993 the Czech Government gave its final approval to the project, which has met with strong criticism from some officials and environmentalists both at home and in neighboring Austria, which is strongly anti-nuclear. The first Temelin reactor is to be operating at full capacity by mid-1995 and the second in 1996. The completed plant is expected to generate 2,000 MW. Czech Environment Minister Frantisek Benda has also mentioned the possibility of reconsidering the Temelin project. On Monday [11 April] he warned he would not allow the plant to go into operation unless the planned "nuclear law" was adopted. The law is to define the responsibilities of the plant's operator and deal with ways of storing burnt-out fuel. Benda's criticism of Temelin led Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitzky to note yesterday that debate about bringing the plant into operation was far from over even in the Czech Republic. Once again he repeated Austria's offer to cooperate with Prague in the development of alternative power sources.
