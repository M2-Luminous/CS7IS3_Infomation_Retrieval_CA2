Why are these reforms being made? How will you overcome the democratic deficit, given that the single party system only offers Cuban voters one option? [Robaina] I don't think one can analyze these issues outside the context in which the people live, work, and develop. I am not saying our democracy is perfect, but we do have our own special democratic system. No one has been able to show me that any other model is perfect. In some countries, 70 percent of the eligible voters stay away from the polls out of indifference. I respect all versions of democracy and only ask that people respect ours. We will see how many things can be discussed regarding models and modes of popular participation as soon as my country is out from under the foreign threat hanging over us. Our form of democracy is not what it was five years ago, and it will surely be different five years from today. We are currently working on ideological pluralism. It is more a pluralism for participation than a pluralism of parties. [LA JORNADA] What can you tell all those sectors, including the intellectual left wing, which believe that the blockade benefits Fidel Castro inasmuch as it helps him when it is time to fall in line and defend the revolution against foreign threats? [Robaina] If lifting the blockade means overthrowing Fidel (Castro), as many so absurdly propose, the blockade would have been lifted by now. One cannot associate the existence of a political system with the blockade. The blockade is against an entire population that has been sentenced to die of hunger and disease. [LA JORNADA] Has there been any kind of progress to indicate that the tension between Cuba and the United States is weakening, opening the way to normal relations? [Robaina] There is no reason for excessive enthusiasm. We have publicly stated that this (U.S.) Administration does not display the constant aggression of past administrations. That in and of itself means very little, but it could create a certain atmosphere. Although the aggression is absent, there are other things indicative of a certain stagnation, such as the tightening of the blockade by the Torricelli Bill and the failed U.S. attempt to prevent the United Nations from discussing this issue. We see no indications that relations are heading toward a major change. I think this administration was highly committed when it came to office. I do not think it is a matter of what they want to do but a matter of what they really can do. [LA JORNADA] From a distance, the economic reforms you are implementing have a certain smell of neoliberalism; shock measures. Don't you think this new direction could shatter the consensus you seem to enjoy among the people? [Robaina] To say that the people are adjusting easily to these measures would be untrue. We are conducting a persuasion campaign, explaining the reasons behind the changes neighborhood by neighborhood. There are already some measures in effect that have a high social and political cost. A large portion of the population did not welcome the decision to legalize foreign currency after 30 years of working in the opposite direction because they were taught a different way of thinking. That measure is just another way of keeping our feet on the ground, as there are more and more people with a working relationship with foreign investment every day. We concluded that if 10 million people are unable to solve the situation we are facing but 5 million are able to do it, then we must decide to make a sacrifice and somehow create the social differences to which we are unaccustomed. [LA JORNADA] What guarantees will foreign investors have that their properties will not be seized by the state? [Robaina] We have given foreign investment constitutional support through regulations that are flexible enough to include everyone and every circumstance. In addition, we are not interested in meddling in any area, especially the economic one. Under no circumstances will we risk foreign investment. Some even wonder what would happen if Cuba returned to capitalism. Even if that happened it wouldn't entail any shocks for businessmen because they would be in their element. [LA JORNADA] Is a return to capitalism possible? [Robaina] I don't think so. [LA JORNADA] What then would be the middle ground between an unsuccessful socialist system and the capitalism you seem to dislike? [Robaina] Cuba does not believe that there is any reason to turn back from what has been done. We want the Cuban project, as we have been planning and implementing it, to be viable. [LA JORNADA] You are planning a meeting in Havana next year with a large segment of the Cuban exile community. Why now, after so many years and mutual ill will, is this meeting, which in some ways implies a national reconciliation, taking place? [Robaina] The time is right whenever Cuban exiles overseas -- not just in the United States -- want to talk to us and meet with us in Cuba. It is very likely that a delegation from a group in that exile community will hold a positive meeting with us. The aforementioned group follows a moderate position, as opposed to the hostile attitude held by some toward Cubans who defend projects on the island. [LA JORNADA] Do you mean that if prominent exiles such as Jorge Mas Canosa and Carlos Montaner changed their positions vis-a-vis the revolution, they could participate in this incipient dialogue? [Robaina] Our prospects for dialogue do not depend on individuals but on positions. Anyway, we have so many relationships with people, groups, and sectors which have positions different from those advocated by Mas Canosa and Montaner that we do not need to consider talking to them. At any rate, I do not believe they are thinking of changing their position toward Cuba. Therefore, meeting with them doesn't make any sense.
