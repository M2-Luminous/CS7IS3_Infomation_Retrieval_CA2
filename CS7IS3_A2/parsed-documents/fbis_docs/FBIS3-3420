Their boats are to be named in accordance with a nationally standardized code system beginning with "Public Security Border XYZ" and will be issued a forgery-proof "marine patrol duty pass" by the Ministry of Public Security. Duty personnel on board will all wear a uniform arm band for identification purposes. Li Huan, deputy director of the MPS Frontier Guard Bureau, said at a coastal border guard seminar opening today that the standardization of boat names and codes and the requirement for duty personnel to wear uniform bands have been prompted by the need to rectify the marine situation and maintain order, and are part of the public security border units' effort to regularize their forces. A new and uniform identification system will help prevent other boats from going out to sea to hunt for smugglers while masquerading as public security border units. Domestic and foreign ships and the personnel on board can refuse [ke yi ju jue jie shou 0668 0110 2147 4815 2234 2392] to be inspected when a boat in violation of the above-mentioned regulation demands a provisional [lin shi 5259 2514] inspection.
