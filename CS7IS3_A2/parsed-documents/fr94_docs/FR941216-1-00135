FR941216-1-00135 FR941216-1-00012 Subpart M_Safety Requirements for Specific Explosive Materials and Operations §184.164 General. This subpart provides the minimum safety requirements necessary for the prevention of mishaps involving specific explosives materials and operations that, unless properly controlled, make casualties to personnel, material, equipment, and facilities highly probable. They apply to similar operations and equipment, specifically addressed or not. These requirements, to be used as a basis for developing local program requirements, are in no way comprehensive. The contractor is responsible for analyzing each operation and developing procedures to control or eliminate actual or potential hazards. §184.165 Properties of explosives. Knowledge of properties of specific types of explosives is critical to the establishment of proper hazard controls. (a) Properties of initiating explosives. Initiating explosives include lead azide, mercury fulminate, lead styphnate, and tetracene. They manifest extreme sensitivity to friction, heat and impact. When involved in a fire, they can be expected to detonate without burning. In storage, initiating explosives shall be kept wet with water or water/alcohol mixtures. Every effort shall be made to prevent the liquid from freezing; frozen explosives material shall not be handled. Emphasis shall be placed upon cleanliness and general housekeeping since contamination of these explosives with foreign, particularly gritty, material markedly increases their sensitivity. Water used for storage shall be free of bacteria-forming impurities which could react to form gases. Lead azide shall not be allowed contact with copper, zinc, or alloys containing any concentration of such metals because of the likely formation of other azides that are more sensitive than the original lead azide. Likewise, mercury fulminate shall not be allowed contact with aluminum, magnesium, zinc, brass, or bronze. (b) Properties of boostering explosives. Explosives used for this purpose include tetryl, RDX, PETN, and RDX with added ingredients. These explosives have sensitivities between initiating explosives and those of explosives used as bursting charges such as TNT. They may be ignited by heat, friction, or impact and may detonate when burned in large quantities or at too great a depth. Some of these materials are toxic when taken internally or by skin contact and special precautions are necessary to protect personnel. Local exhaust ventilation, enclosed process systems, automatic handling systems, etc., should be used to minimize dust in the employee's breathing zone. (c) Properties of bursting explosives. Bursting explosives include explosive D (ammonium picrate), amatol, picric acid, TNT, tritonal, RDX compositions, HMX compositions, torpex, DBX, and HBX. In general, these materials are less sensitive than initiating or boostering explosives. Alkaline cleaning agents or other alkaline products should not be permitted in buildings where large quantities of these explosives are handled. Amatol forms sensitive compounds with copper and brass. Where explosive D is processed, lead fusible links and solder-type sprinkler heads should not be used. DBX is an aluminized explosive that is somewhat hygroscopic and reacts with metals in the same manner as amatol. HBX is also an aluminized explosive that outgasses when exposed to water and may create internal pressure when loaded into ammunition. HMX compositions usually result in a very powerful explosive with a high degree of thermal stability. Pentolite tends to separate into its ingredients (PETN and TNT) and should, therefore, be handled as carefully as PETN. Picratol is a mixture of TNT and explosive D; the precautions necessary when handling either shall be observed. Picric acid is highly acidic, corrosive, and toxic; it shall be isolated from lead and lead compounds. Tetrytol is a mixture of tetryl and TNT which is stable in storage but exudes at 149 ○F. Dry tetrytol slightly corrodes magnesium and aluminum alloys, and wet tetrytol slightly corrodes a copper, brass, aluminum, magnesium, mild steel, and cadmium-plated mild steel. TNT is stable and does not form sensitive compounds with metals. It shall, however, form sensitive compounds in the presence of alkalies. It also exhibits well-recognized toxic properties. Torpex is an aluminized explosive used mainly in underwater ordnance. Non-hygroscopic and noncorrosive, it is stable in storage but may outgas (hydrogen) and produce internal pressure when loaded into ammunition. Tritonal is a mixture of TNT and aluminum powder and is more sensitive to impact than TNT. Tritonal shall not be exposed to water. Plastic bonded explosives are conventional high explosives with plastic binders such as polystyrene, viton, estane, etc. Their sensitivity varies with the composition. The series most frequently encountered are identified by prefix PBX or LX and a number. (d) Properties of other explosives. Other military explosives frequently encountered include black powder and nitroglycerin. Black powder is a mixture of potassium or sodium nitrate, charcoal, and sulfur, highly sensitive to friction, heat, and impact. It deteriorates rapidly on absorption of moisture but retains its explosive properties indefinitely if kept dry. Nitroglycerin's extreme sensitivity to impact and friction is such that it is manufactured only as needed. Frozen nitroglycerin, while less sensitive than liquid, may undergo internal changes upon thawing and, if enough heat is generated, may detonate. (e) Research of additional properties. The foregoing does not comprehensively catalog explosives and properties, but indicates how significantly they can differ. For this reason, it is imperative that contractors investigate pertinent properties before handling these or other explosive materials. Contractors are responsible for understanding all aspects of ammunition and explosives needed to fulfill contractual obligations. §184.166 Handling low-energy initiators. Typical precautions, such as shielding and safety glasses, shall be supplemented by the following measures, as appropriate, when manufacturing, processing, using, or testing low-energy initiators (initiated by 0.1 joule of energy or less). (a) All metal parts of equipment shall be electrically bonded together and grounded. (b) Personnel shall wear clothing that prevents generation of static electricity. Conductive shoes shall be tested with a resistance meter before an operator enters an area where low-energy initiators are being processed. (c) When low-energy initiators are being handled, personnel shall be directly grounded by wrist straps. The resistance reading, taken once daily when the operator is wearing the strap, shall be between 250,000 and one million ohms when measured from opposite hand to ground. Special contact creams may be used to decrease the resistance to the required value.
