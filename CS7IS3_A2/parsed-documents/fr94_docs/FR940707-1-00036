FR940707-1-00036 FR940707-1-00011 Appendix A to Subpart E_Guidance on Defining Significant Facilities and Services The guidance set out in this Appendix represents the Department's interpretation of the principles and requirements of the Fair Housing Act that require, in order for housing to qualify as housing for persons 55 years of age or older, that there must exist ``significant facilities and services specifically designed to meet the physical or social needs of older persons.'' The Department intends for the Appendix to serve as a resource document for housing providers and others in determining whether housing qualifies for the ``housing for older persons'' exemption. The Appendix illustrates the application of the factors that the Department will consider in making its determination. The Department will refer to the interpretive guidance in the Appendix when considering whether there is reasonable cause to believe that a discriminatory practice has occurred or is about to occur. It should be clearly understood, however, that the examples provided in this Appendix are illustrative and presented in summary form. The examples are not intended to predetermine the Department's disposition on any actual case since more detailed facts and circumstances would have to be considered. Therefore, a claim from a housing provider that the operation of a particular housing development is an exact replica of one of the examples presented in this Appendix will not preclude the Department from commencing an investigation under the Fair Housing Act of an alleged discriminatory housing practice directed against an aggrieved person with familial status; nor will it preclude the Secretary from issuing a determination based upon the evidence obtained through such an investigation. The Department may, from time-to-time, publish in the Federal Register additional or revised interpretive guidance which will be included in this Appendix.
