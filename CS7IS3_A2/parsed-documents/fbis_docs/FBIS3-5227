The program, disclosed by Kim and adopted by the Workers' (Communist) Party at its Central Committee meeting on Feb. 25, 1964, provided several approaches to rural woes, which were classified as agricultural problems in one group and farmers' problems in the other. Under a resolution adopted by the Workers' Party at its Politburo meeting in October last year, North Korea held meetings, ceremonies and other functions late last month to observe the 30th anniversary of Kim's socialist agriculture program. A national meeting of farmers was held in Pyongyang from Feb. 25-28, along with film shows and discussion meetings across the country. In addition, commemorative stamps and postcards were issued and cooperative farms with excellent production records honored. On Feb. 23, Haksan cooperative farm in Pyongyang dedicated a monument to the program's 30th anniversary. Attending the opening session of the four-day national meeting of 10,500 farmers were President Kim Il-song, People's Armed Forces Minister O Chin-u, Premier Kang Song-san, Vice Presidents Yi Chong-ok and Pak Song-chol, and Party Secretaries Kye Ung-tae, Han Song-yong and Choe Tae-pok. But Kim Chong-il, son and heir-apparent of the senior Kim, did not show up. In a report lasting one hour and 20 minutes, Premier Kang called on all cooperative farm workers to pursue reforms and agricultural advances, while upholding the party's agriculture-first policy. "We must make an uninterrupted movement forward along the revolutionary path" charted in President Kim's socialist agriculture program, Kang exhorted. Kim Il-song, in a letter to the meeting, called for intensified ideological reform among farmers, a switch from cooperative ownership of farmland to a popular ownership system and increased farm production, while stressing the need to industrialize farming and incorporate farmers into the proletariat. Participants in the meeting spent three days discussing the tasks laid out by Kim in his letter and resolved to carry them out. At the closing session on Feb. 28, they pledged their loyalty to Kim Il-song and his son, Chong-il. North Korea's media, both print and electronic, played up the functions celebrating the 30th anniversary of the senior Kim's socialist farm program and the agricultural achievements of both Kims. In a commentary aired on Feb. 25, Radio Pyongyang attributed the North's agricultural development in the past 30 years to Kim's socialist farm program and said it had been carried out successfully thanks to Kim Chong-il's "ideological and theoretical activities and sagacious leadership." The Workers' Party newspaper, NODONG SINMUN, praised the Kims for their "solution of basic rural problems," while calling on farmers to perform the tasks President Kim mentioned in his letter to the national meeting of farmers. In 1974 North Korea started holding an annual meeting of farmers in the off-season, which was changed to a meeting every five years in 1985. The 1995 meeting was moved up to this year to coincide with the 30th anniversary of Kim's agriculture program announcement. Kim senior and junior were acclaimed during functions held at the turn of the month, as with past events in North Korea. No measures to develop the North's backward agriculture were mentioned, though farmers were urged to uphold the agricultural development concepts presented by Kim Il-song. In spite of chronic food shortages due to several lean crop years, North Korea failed to present a realistic and effective farm development policy on the 30th anniversary of Kim's socialist agriculture program, instead sticking to past policies which have proven a dismal failure over the past 30 years. While celebrating the 30th anniversary of the program, North Korea failed to draw up effective measures to increase farm production. Rather, farmers were simply exhorted to follow blindly the policy Kim launched three decades ago.
