The residents demanded redressing their living conditions and daily suffering, noting that they have not received food supplies for months. In addition, electricity and other basic services are absent. Another demonstration was staged at the Shawrash complex in Chamchamal District, during which demonstrators demanded ensuring food supplies to them. An exchange of fire ensued with the demonstrators, prompting the sabotage cliques to close the Chamchamal-al-Sulaymaniyah road. Agent and sabotage cliques receive food supplies and then sell them on the black market. They are also stealing electric wires and transformers and smuggling them across the border, thus causing a blanket power cutoff in the region.
