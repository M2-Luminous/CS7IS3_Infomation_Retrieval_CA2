FBIS4-61021 "drsov085_v_94001" FBIS-SOV-94-085 Daily Report 2 May 1994 Lithuania Seimas Chairman Welcomes Results of Summit Seimas Chairman Welcomes Results of Summit LD0205145894 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1321 GMT 2 May 94 LD0205145894 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [Text] The head of Lithuania's parliament, Ceslovas Jursenas, has expressed approval of the results of an 30 April meeting between the presidents of Russia and Latvia, Boris Yeltsin and Guntis Ulmanis. In an interview with INTERFAX, Jursenas described an agreement on a deadline for Russian troop withdrawal from Latvia as "the most important achievement" of the meeting. He said the accords signed by the two presidents were "undoubtedly significant" not only for Russia and Latvia but for the entire Baltic region. Thus, they could help negotiate a deadline for Russian troop withdrawal from Estonia, he said. Commenting on last week's reception by Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas of a letter from Yeltsin, Jursenas expressed the hope that the two presidents' exchange of letters "will help eliminate moot points and problems in the relations between our two countries." But he said he could not understand why Russia unilaterally suspended agreements that had already been reached. He said Lithuania takes the position that signed agreements must be carried out and that other problems, such as that of Russia's exclave Kaliningrad Region, must be negotiated after or simultaneously with that. "We understand the interests of Russia, but Russia must also understand and respect our interests," he said.
