FR940812-0-00003 FR940812-0-00001 AMS regularly reviews its programs to determine if fees are adequate. Employee salary and fringe benefits are major program costs that account for approximately 85 percent of the total operating budget. Two salary increases for Federal employees, a 3.7 percent pay increase effective January 10, 1993, and a locality pay increase, ranging from 3.09 to 6.52 percent depending upon locality, effective January 8, 1994, have materially affected program costs. Unemployment insurance, FTS 2000 telecommunications, General Services Administration rent, and other administrative, supervisory, and program costs have also increased. In addition, the Agricultural Appropriation Bill for fiscal year 1994 directed AMS to establish a user fee program to recover the costs associated with agricultural commodities quality standards. In response, the service has implemented cost-cutting actions (reorganization and/or downsizing of field offices and technical support services) which reduced obligations by $569,175 from FY&hyph;92 to FY&hyph;93. Nonetheless, despite these measures, the Agency has determined that due to the increases in program operating costs, an increase in fees is necessary to meet rising costs and prevent financial losses. A notice of proposed rulemaking was published in the Federal Register (59 FR 26762) on May 24, 1994 with a thirty day comment period. The comment period closed on June 24, 1994. Interested persons were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal to the Agricultural Marketing Service. No comments were received regarding this proposed rule. Pursuant to 5 USC 553, it is found and determined that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date until thirty days after the publication in the Federal Register because: (1) these programs have incurred a loss in fiscal year 1994; (2) this action should be made effective upon publication in the Federal Register so that fees will reflect the costs of services rendered as soon as possible and; (3) interested persons were afforded a thirty day comment period and no comments were received.
