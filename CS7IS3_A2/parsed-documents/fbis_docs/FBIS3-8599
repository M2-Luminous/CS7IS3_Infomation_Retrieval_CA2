In a way, I would say that this is the development of paramount importance in Slovakia's recent history. [Havel] It seems to be the culmination of a crisis that has been continuing on the Slovak political scene for some time now. It is difficult to know how it will develop. However, it is probable that early elections will take place, and, until then, it is to be hoped that some kind of lower profile but efficient government should be formed rather soon. I imagine this would be a semicaretaker government, one that would span the transitional period and contribute to calming the situation. This is in the interest of the Slovak citizens as well as of all of us who are not indifferent to developments in Slovakia. [passage omitted] On the whole, let us hope that the situation in Slovakia will stabilize after the elections, which are evidently going to go ahead. Let us hope it will calm down and that Slovakia will embark on a true path of building a democratic political system and market economy. [passage omitted] [Hulkova] Mr. President, I always thought that Slovak President Michal Kovac was unlikely to make a strong imprint on his country's history. But now I feel that his moment has come. After all, it is he who controls a lot of things. [Havel] It should be said that I personally began to respect President Kovac because we often met and discussed in a very businesslike and frank manner various issues of interest. It should be said that President Kovac has developed into an outstanding and independent politician who acted when he felt it was his duty to act. What he did was very courageous and risky. What he did was not commonplace. No matter what the given constitutional system is, it is not usual that the head of state should enter into such open confrontation with the prime minister or the government. Nevertheless, Mr. President Kovac probably knew what he was doing, and he knew why he was doing it. [Hulkova] I have always been under the impression that speculation about further developments in Slovakia is at this time evidently premature. However, I would like to ask one question: Do you think that whatever happens next will be less clear than what happened in the past? Although we often disagreed with these developments, we knew what was taking place. [Havel] It is true that Prime Minister Meciar, whom I know very well from the time of the [Czechoslovak] federation, is a very self-styled, original person with a special method of ruling. It is true to say that, if a modus vivendi or a contact is established with him, he is a politician who can be to a certain extent understood. Having said that, I do not claim he is the best possible politician. It is possible that the situation will become less transparent now because several new political groupings have been formed. The political stage became fragmented in a certain way. [passage omitted] Much will depend on whether these new parties will manage to unite before the elections and create some kind of a wider formation with a clear policy or whether they will fight each other. Policy fragmentation is a great misfortune in political life. [Hulkova] And one final question on Slovakia: In your opinion, is a third comeback of Vladimir Meciar possible? [Havel] I would not like to make any prognosis in this matter. Really, I do not know, but anything is possible in these fledgling democracies. [Hulkova] Mr. President, let us now recall your trip to the Vatican and Strasbourg at the beginning of this week. Deputy Foreign Minister Bratinka said it could not have been more successful. I would like to hear your personal view, if you care tell me, of the impressions you had. [Havel] I find it difficult to answer this question, but, because you have asked, I have no choice but to say that in my view it was successful. I thought the second leg of the trip, the Strasbourg one, was particularly successful. [passage omitted] As for my trip to the Vatican, my hour-long conversation with the pope was, as usual, very valuable for me because I have good rapport with the pope. The pope radiates a special sort of kindness and understanding, and one draws strength from this kind of conversation. But this would be a small reason for my going on a state visit there. The main thing is that the visit boosts our good relations with the Vatican. [passage omitted] [Hulkova] Mr. President, you have already mentioned how much you valued the outcome of the Strasbourg leg of your trip. I would like to know whether you were at all worried about the reception of some passages of your speech by the deputies of the European Parliament? [Havel] I was completely surprised at how favorable the reception of my address was. Afterwards, during various discussions and chats with deputies, including the gala lunch and so on, many chairmen or vice chairmen of the individual groups or committees told me that they were so swamped by the everyday technical and administrative duties they had to tackle that a certain overview and awarness of a deeper meaning of European integration and European union escaped them. They said they were very grateful to me for voicing this and for bringing up these points. They told me directly that they needed it. This pleased me, of course. [passage omitted]
