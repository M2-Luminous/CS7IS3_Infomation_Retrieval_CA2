The protocol annulled a 1923 agreement on trade and navigation and a reciprocal agreement on exempting automobiles and other motor vehicles from road taxes, the Lithuanian Ministry said. The two pre-war agreements were replaced by a free trade agreement and an agreement on international transportation by road. A ministry official said the protocol eliminated certain legal problems because both pre-war and newly signed agreements were considered effective.
