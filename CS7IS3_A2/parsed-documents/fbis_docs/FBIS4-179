This calm follows weeks of a split and fighting between the Mandingos loyal to the leader, Alhaji Koromah, and the Krahns who support the ULIMO military head, Roosevelt Johnson. The two men went to neighboring Sierra Leone last week to talk peace and at the end of it they issued a communique saying they have patched up their differences, and now the West African force, ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African Cease-Fire Monitoring Group], have begun deploying troops in the ULIMO town of Tubmanburg. Jonathan Pay Laile, who normally reports for us from Gbarnga, was taken to Tubmanburg today. He sent this report: Tension is easing in Tubmanburg following the deployment of ECOMOG troops last Thursday [31 March]. Some 200 ECOMOG troops have arrived in the town. However, armed soldiers loyal to Alhaji Koromah, are patrolling the streets 24 hours a day. Some civilians are slowly beginning to return to the town. Most had fled following fighting between competing factions within the ULIMO. This afternoon, a senior ECOMOG soldier told me in Tubmanburg that the deployment of ECOMOG troops will be completed by tomorrow. He said since the arrival of the troops there has been no fighting. A chief operations officer with the UN force, UNOMIL [UN Observer Mission in Liberia], also confirmed that the town has been calm for some days now. He also said that troops loyal to Roosevelt Johnson attacked Bomi last week but were pushed back by fighters loyal to Alhaji Koromah. The town of Congo on the Sierra Leone-Liberia border, he said changed hands three times last week before ECOMOG troops were deployed there. As I returned to Monrovia this afternoon, I passed several trucks carrying ECOMOG soldiers into Cape Mount County.
