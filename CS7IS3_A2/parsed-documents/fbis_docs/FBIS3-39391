It is a question of our taking the initiative." Professor Risto Orava, head of the Research Institute of High-Energy Physics at the Helsinki University (SEFT) admits that the skeptics are mainly to be found within the scientific community. "Experts are divided into two schools of thought: those who have no faith in the project, and those who believe that the linear accelerator will pull Finland out of the depression." The accelerator project was first debated in 1991 at a conference of experts in Saariselk. This is where key international people from the World Particle Physics Laboratory are to meet next fall. The final decision on the construction will be made between 1995 and 1997. Risto Orava explains that the decision will be made on the basis of a feasibility study. Japan and the United States, who have competed with Finland, have in practice lost out, due to the earthquake sensitivity of their regions. "The particle accelerator at Stanford University in California broke in two in a tremor that preceded the major earthquake this week. It is unlikely that the Americans would again invest millions just to ensure that the institute is installed in their own country. "Finland's strong points are its solid bedrock, technical infrastructure, and stable political situation. The World Laboratory of Particle Physics, which may be ready as early as 2005, will be dedicated to basic physical research and the study of elementary particles. The world's sixth largest particle laboratory, which is to be financed by the international community, will cost 40 billion Finnish markkas [FMk]. Finland's share of the investment is in the order of 1 percent, i.e., we are in practice only expected to contribute with the required land area. "The laboratory's operating costs will be about FMk1 billion per year. The research institute will employ thousands of researchers and technical experts, in total about 10,000 people including families. The 40-km-long accelerator will be built at a depth of 100 mt under the ground. The worldwide annual cost for the prestudy of the linear accelerator is at the present FMk300 to 500 million. In order to establish its credibility as host country, Finland is expected to contribute about FMk4 to 5 billion." Risto Orava maintains that Finnish research in particle physics is on a high international level. "We are members of CERN [European Center for Nuclear Research], where we rank third after Switzerland and France in terms of our ability to exploit the results of the work carried out. Finland has several ongoing R&D projects related to the construction of a linear accelerator. Research institutes and industries take part in these projects. "The potential benefit from the design, development, and construction of the components is enormous. The electron source, the positron source, the damper ring, the particle bundler, the preaccelerator, the main accelerator, the focusing system, and the test station offer work opportunities for researchers and the industry."
