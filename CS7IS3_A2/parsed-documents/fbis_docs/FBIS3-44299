[Qian] How are you? [Reporter] On behalf of our listeners, I would like to first express our thanks to you for agreeing to this interview in spite of your busy schedule. [Qian] I am also very glad to be interviewed by the Central People's Broadcasting Network. I would like to take this opportunity to send my regards to listeners across the country. [Reporter] Thank you. Vice Premier Qian, 1993 is coming to an end. We would like to ask you to briefly review the international situation over the past year in your capacity as foreign minister. [Qian] The past year has been unusual. The international community has witnessed many significant events. There have been both inspiring developments and worrisome issues. The civil war in Cambodia, which had dragged on for more than 10 years, was eventually brought to an end. Palestine and Israel accorded each other recognition, fueling hope for a solution to the Middle East issue. After eight years of difficult negotiations, the Uruguay Round of trade talks eventually produced an agreement. These are all inspiring. However, the world is still far from peaceful. Regional disturbances and bloody conflicts have continued unstoppably. The global economic recession has cast a shadow over many countries. The number of unemployed people in the United States has surpassed 10 million. The unemployment rate in the EC has breached the double-digit mark, forcing 18 million people out of work, the highest total since the end of World War II. Nevertheless, the economies in the Asia-Pacific region -- especially those in East Asia -- have maintained robust growth throughout the year. According to data provided by the Asia Development Bank, the gross domestic product of the major Asian countries increased by an average of 7.1 percent in 1993, turning the region into the most economically vibrant part of the world with the world's highest growth rate. Such growth has breathed new life into the world's economic development. China is an important member of the Asia-Pacific region. Over the past two years, our country has increased its gross national product by some 13 percent annually. Its foreign trade volume in 1993 is expected to top $190 billion. The scene is one of national prosperity, peace, good administration, harmony, success, and promise. International public opinion, as well as that of the business community in various countries, is upbeat about China's prospects for economic development. In the past year, our country has achieved great success in foreign affairs under the leadership of the Jiang Zemin-led CPC Central Committee. Our country has further improved its good- neighbor and friendly relations with neighboring countries, bringing these relations into the best-ever period since the founding of New China. Our country has maintained stable and friendly relations with developing countries. Its relations with European nations and the United States have either improved markedly or developed. The heads of state and government of some Western countries have visited China. The official meeting between the heads of state of China and the United States in Seattle has enhanced mutual understanding, and this has brought about a new beginning in Sino-U.S. relations. While consolidating our gains, we will not forget the support and assistance given to us by countries and people who have upheld justice. Looking ahead, we are full of confidence. China's development cannot be divorced from the world's, and the development of the world also needs China. We are ready to work together with all countries of the world and to make greater contributions to international peace and development. [Reporter] Vice Premier Qian, today when the world economy in general is in a slump, the economies in the Asia-Pacific region are, as you just said, developing vigorously. Last April, you attended the 49th annual meeting of the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, and last November you again flew to Seattle to attend the fifth ministerial meeting of the Asia- Pacific Economic Cooperation [APEC] forum. Could you give your views on APEC's prospects for development and China's role and position in the Asia-Pacific region? [Qian] The population of the APEC member states accounts for two-fifths of the world's population. Their GNP's and volume of foreign trade represent 50 percent and 40 percent, respectively, of the world's total. In recent years, the economic growth rates of the great majority of its members far exceeded the world's average. In addition, the economies of these countries and regions are fairly complementary to each other, thus providing very favorable conditions and a foundation for economic cooperation. Furthermore, a major attribute of the region is its variety. The region has both developed countries and countries which are still developing, both sovereign countries and regional economies, both Oriental civilizations and Western cultures. Social systems and ideologies vary or even differ greatly from one country and region to another. This variety dictates that economic cooperation in the Asia- Pacific region can only be based on common economic interests. Only by opening themselves to each other and adopting flexible and diversified approaches in accordance with the principles of mutual respect, seeking common ground while putting aside differences, and equality and mutual benefits can economic cooperation in the region produce substantial results. The realities in this region show that the conditions for establishing an economic community for the Asia- Pacific region are not yet ripe. [Reporter] Vice Premier Qian, you have had frequent foreign visits and busy diplomatic activities at home this year. Particularly during this year's UN General Assembly, you met with the leaders of more than 60 countries. I believe that this kind of broad contacts reflects China's importance on the international stage. We would like to ask you to discuss China's position and role on the international stage. [Qian] China is the largest developing country in the world and one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council. Thus, China's obligations and influence in the world are obvious. China upholds a foreign policy of independence and peace. We stand for establishing a new order governing international relations on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. In international affairs, we are opposed to interference in the internal affairs of other countries, to hegemonism, and to power politics. At the UN forum, we uphold justice and seek to safeguard the legitimate rights of developing countries. We have made our due contributions to safeguarding international peace and security, promoting the political settlement of regional flash-point issues, and easing tensions. As China accelerates reform and opening up, its economic relations and trade with other countries of the world have continued to expand. China's market has been increasing in capacity. A huge market potential is becoming a reality. This has great appeal to Western countries for investing in China and conducting all kinds of business activities. As President Jiang said in Seattle, a stable, developed, strong, and prosperous China will not pose a threat to any country but will only make greater contributions to peace and development in Asia-Pacific region and in the world as a whole. This is the role that China should play on the international stage. [Reporter] Vice Premier Qian, China has made great progress in its foreign relations in the past year. China has established diplomatic relations with 158 countries. Could you analyze for us the characteristics of China's diplomatic activities in the past year? [Qian] China has made great progress in its foreign relations in the past year. As you just mentioned, China has established diplomatic relations with 158 countries. In the short period of only one year, more than 30 heads of states or government leaders and over 50 vice premiers, presidents, and foreign ministers visited China. Arguably, our country's foreign relations have expanded. Especially important, I think, were two events which took place in November. One was the visit by German Chancellor Kohl to China, and the other was President Jiang's official meeting with Clinton in Seattle. These two events signified that Western powers are beginning to adjust their policies toward China. In view of China's economic development, the world is taking a new look at China and is carrying out a new appraisal of it weight and the role it is capable of playing. This is a very important change. [Reporter] Vice Premier Qian, thank you for granting us this interview. Before concluding this interview, we would like to ask you to say a few words to our listeners. [Qian] Today is the last day of 1993. I would like to wish everyone a happy new year. I wish comrades and listeners success in your work and happiness in your family life, and I hope that everything goes according to your wishes. I also want to add that the "Global Information" program of the Central People's Radio Network has done a great job of providing information and improving listeners' understanding of international issues. I take this opportunity to congratulate you and express my appreciation. Thank you.
