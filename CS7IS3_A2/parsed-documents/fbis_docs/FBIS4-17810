Today they discussed the question of the crisis in the country's economy, but voted down the draft resolution on this issue. Several committees of the chamber have been instructed to generalize the proposals that were made during the rather long discussion and to submit them to the next sitting. However, an opinion was voiced that this type of document should not be adopted altogether, as "just another piece of paper" would not lead to any results. Instead of this it should be demanded that the government adopt and publish a program of anti-crisis measures. The "complete absence of any consistent and sensible policy of the national economy" in the draft resolution was named as the "main strategic error of the government." The absence of "macroeconomic planning and of a mechanism for its implementation" was also held against them.
