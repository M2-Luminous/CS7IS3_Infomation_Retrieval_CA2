FBIS3-4586 "dreas039_a_94042" FBIS-EAS-94-039 Document Type:Daily Report 28 February 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan MITI Reports Industrial Output Rises Slightly OW2802080294 Tokyo KYODO in English 0732 GMT 28 Feb 94 OW2802080294 Tokyo KYODO Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 28 KYODO -- Japan's industrial production edged up 0.9 percent in January from the previous month in a modest rebound from December's 1.9 percent decline, the trade ministry said Monday [28 February]. The seasonally adjusted production index for the mining and manufacturing sectors came to 88.6 against a base of 100 for 1990, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) said in a preliminary report. But despite the rise, the index was still at its third-lowest -- after December's 87.8 and October's 87.6 -- since the 1990 base was introduced in May. Production continues to slump, although a production outlook index for the manufacturing sector indicates rises there in February and March, MITI said, adding that coming movements in final demand must be closely watched. Shipments rose 0.6 percent in January with the index at 89.9, compared with the 0.7 percent decrease logged in December. The inventory index dipped 0.4 percent to 107.9, adding to December's 0.9 percent decline. The ratio of inventory to sales fell 3.2 percent in January to 122.0, slipping back from the record high set in December when the ratio rose 1.6 percent. Monday's figures cap a half year of alternating ups and downs in Japan's industrial production, which saw a 2.2 percent gain in November in reaction to October's record 5.5 percent drop. That followed a 2.2 percent September gain and a 1.2 percent fall in August. On an unadjusted basis, January's industrial production was down 3.1 percent from a year before, extending a record string of year- on-year declines to 28 months. Patches of brightness are appearing, such as production and shipment of small cars, light trucks and computer equipment, but it is too early to say that the economy is bottoming out, said Koichi Yoshimoto, head of MITI's statistical analysis division. With those gains helping the electric machinery and transportation equipment sectors, "the possibility seems high" that next month's projections for manufacturing production will show a third straight gain in April, he said. But he added there is not enough data to confirm a trend. As the Bank of Japan has said in recent reports, Yoshimoto told reporters that Japan's corporate capital spending remains in a slump, while only isolated improvements are visible in personal consumption. He cited a pickup in purchases of video cameras and discs in recent months. Among production gainers in January were electric, general and transportation equipment, while precision machinery, ceramics and steel declined, the MITI report said. Reporting higher shipments were transportation and electric equipment and nonferrous metals, while shipments fell in the metal products, general machinery and steel sectors, it said. Despite its higher production and shipments, the transportation equipment sector also had higher inventories. Inventories increased for oil and coal products, but declined for most other sectors, notably electric machinery, chemicals, and plastic products.
