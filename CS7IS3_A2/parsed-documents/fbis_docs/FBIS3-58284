This is a fact. It is also a lesson of history that remains valid in the current search for new security policy concepts. We should not miss the opportunity to bear this lesson in mind without surrendering to its -- currently utopian -- implications. That is why at the NATO summit in Brussels on 10 and 11 January, the 16 members will not reproach one another for having a "Russia first" approach to security policy and for betraying the legitimate interests of NATO's East European neighbors, or for pursuing the old way of thinking and intending to isolate Russia by extending NATO to the Belarusian or Ukrainian border. Rather it is important to bring clarity into the discussion. One should not promise more than one can deliver. The NATO members, in particular the United States, are currently not ready to extend the security guarantees of the NATO treaty to new members. But this is what Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, and Lithuania mean when they ask for membership within the alliance. It would not be serious to believe that any promises to this effect could currently be enforced in the alliance. What is important in a military alliance -- if anything -- is dependability. A NATO that gives guarantees it knows it cannot implement had better dissolve itself. It is equally hypocritical of the applicant members to stress that their planned NATO membership is not directed against Russia. No matter how loquaciously and elegantly it is adorned, the East Europeans -- historically misused by Russia, Germany, and the Habsburg Empire -- are seeking protection against Russia within NATO, because no one can predict today whether Russia will be able to successfully continue its development toward an open, democratic society. That is why it is important in the present situation to do one thing, without failing to do the other thing. Just as it would be wrong to promise more than one can deliver, it would also be wrong to offer the East European neighbors less than is possible and necessary. That is why we must expect the NATO summit to define the offers of cooperation with the East Europeans, mentioned in the Partnership for Peace concept, as specifically as possible. The core and value of NATO are its military organization, its command structures, and its logistics. The task in the next few years will be to further this organization's cooperation with the military of the Eastern neighbors, ranging from the exchange of ambassadors and staffs and common military exercises, to the alignment of communications structures. It is also conceivable to make military reconnaissance facilities available to the East Europeans. All this must be regulated by agreement, while association with the Western European Union [WEU] must be pushed and membership of the East Europeans within the European Union [EU] must be kept in mind. Given this large number of concrete options, it is possible to meet the applicants' understandable wish not to get stuck in a gray zone of promises that are intended never to be fulfilled. At the same time, however, NATO also serves its own interests. In a world in which the lion will never lie down with the lamb, NATO must keep its own inner coherence in mind. Its members' military budgets and troop strengths are drastically decreasing. The alliance must cope with this and remain effective nevertheless; it must also keep the relationship between Europe and North America close and strong. Binding the East Europeans more specifically to NATO, the WEU, and the EU will strengthen the democratic processes in these countries without dragging the West, through security guarantees, into unpredictable minority conflicts and border disputes. Human rights and border guarantees in and between applicant countries must be settled prior to the enlargement of NATO. The example of Turkey and Greece has shown NATO the problems with which an alliance may otherwise be confronted. Finally, a concretely defined Partnership for Peace will also meet the criteria of a policy that keeps options toward Russia open. It can only be in the interests of NATO and the applicant countries that Russia continues to develop as a democratic, open society. It would be wrong to give the people and political forces the impression that the West wanted to isolate Russia. Russia can only isolate itself by once again getting on imperialist tracks that threaten borders and neighbors. It is right and legitimate for us to brace ourselves for such a danger. This is accomplished by closer cooperation with the East Europeans. Until such a danger emerges, however, we must not create new bogeymen, but build the European house through common effort.
