This information was granted by Felipe Tenorio Barbaran, also known as "Albino," who was arrested a few days ago in Huacho together with other SL members whose identities have still not been revealed. "Albino," according to the Dincote spokesman, also disclosed that he had belonged to that elite SL group. Tenorio Barbaran asserted that "Feliciano" is not the only leader of this unruly faction, but it has still not been determined who the other leaders of the group's so-called "collegiate presidency" are. This SL faction is against the peace agreement upheld by Abimael Guzman Reinoso. "Albino" also admitted having been a leader of the so-called North Zone Committee (Barranca-Huacho) and the intellectual author of attacks perpetrated by the SL in the zone between the years 1990-93. After being named a member of the SL Central Committee, he was invited to the capital to plan the attacks they would perpetrate. At that time, he appeared in a video, together with Guzman, dancing Zorba the Greek. Felipe Tenorio Barbaran, in his capacity as SL chief in the northern zone, shared the leadership with Daniel Angel Ramirez Martel, aka "Oscar," who was arrested last year together with another nine terrorists of the zone. Between the years 1990 and 1993, they perpetrated some 30 selective murders against mayors of different towns, policemen, civilians, an Air Force general, and three Japanese engineers. Among their victims are Air Force General Julian Olivera Angeles and the engineer Javier Puigross Planas.
