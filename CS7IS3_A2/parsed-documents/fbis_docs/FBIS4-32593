The "Chamois" (so named for their unit insignia) from Upper Carniola will not be there as a purely military force but to cooperate with the 7th Chasseur Brigade from Klagenfurt, thereby contributing to good relations between the two states. Ten privates and 22 commissioned and noncommissioned officers will take part in the 48-km long Rosenthal March. This is the first time that Slovene uniformed army personnel are participating in such an event abroad. Next week, 16 Hungarian officers will arrive at Bohinjska Bela to familiarize themselves with tactics and the use of mountain and alpine equipment in mountainous terrain. Although mountainous warfare is not especially developed in Hungary, this kind of training is a valuable form of international cooperation (in keeping with the saying "Hungary does not have a sea, however, it does have a navy"). Our excellent alpinists will take part in training, which will culminate in our Hungarian guests "capturing" Mount Triglav.
