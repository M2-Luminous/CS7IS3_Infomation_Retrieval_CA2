The President's first year in office, despite many remarkable achievements in political and social arenas, lost some of its luster because of his failure to bring about the much-hoped-for economic recovery. Even the "new economic five-year plan" ambitiously launched by Kim's administration could hardly turn the adverse economic tide at home and abroad in its first year, which ended with rather disappointing economic growth of 4.9 percent. On top of this, the recent conclusion of global free trade talks will expose domestic industry to fiercer competition than ever with foreigners. Taking the nation's economic helm at this difficult moment was Chong Chae-sok, who was sworn in as the new deputy prime minister and minister of the Economic Planning Board (EPB) in last December's cabinet reshuffle, which also affected 13 other ministers. Ever since his inauguration more than two weeks ago, the 63-year-old new EPB minister, known for both his economic expertise based on long experience and his strong personality, has been the focus of attention within the government and business circles. In a joint written interview with the EPB press Chong stresses bolder internationalization and deregulation as the keys to Korea's economic survival. Q: Korea's internationalizing strategy, though appearing quite innovative to Koreans themselves, still falls short of meeting foreigners' expectations. Can't you come up with a bolder market-opening program, including a complete lifting of bans on capital movement? A: To induce more foreign capital, we need to change our way of thinking as a whole. Numerous administrative regulations on direct foreign investments should be improved and complex procedures simplified. More fundamental problems are financial restrictions, poor infrastructure and labor problems, which combine to make the overall business environment here worse than that in industrial countries. Our internationalizing strategy should start with improving this business environment not only for foreigners but also for domestic companies. Q: Despite the continuous administrative deregulation pursued by the Kim administration, businessmen say they hardly feel the effect. Why so and how would you overcome the bureaucratic resistance to bolder deregulation? A: I have been briefed that out of the 966 targets for deregulation, 751 have been completed. The problem is that actual implementation of a new system takes some time to be felt by business people. With new approaches and resolve, the government will push ahead with deregulation. It will soon come up with a more systematic and comprehensive program, suited to the diverse functions and sectors of businesses. Q: You mentioned the need to raise prices, including public service rates, to a "realistic level," which sparked speculation among businesses that the new deputy premier had shifted the keynote of economic policy from stability to growth. What is your position? A: Stability is a must for growth, and the most important thing in economic operations is to balance these two elements. I will pursue the objective of reinvigorating the economy while working for price stabilization, a policy which will be explained in detail in this year's economic operation plan to be reported to the President next Tuesday. Q: You have often expressed an intention to rectify the distorted price structure by raising public service charges when the need arises. Is there any change in such position? A: I believe extreme caution is needed in raising public service charges in view of their enormous effect on overall commodity prices. It is true that the excessive curbing of public service rates has resulted in distorting the price structure, degrading the price structure, degrading the quality of services and weakening our competitive edge. Still, the government will keep the price of public services to a minimum level by more efficient management of state-run corporations. It also will try to ensure price stabilization of daily necessities, minimize the price raise of manufactured goods and crack down on illegal or unfair price hikes. Q: Analysts say that limiting wage increases and prevention of labor disputes will be the two biggest economic concerns this year. What do you think? A: To win in the unlimited competition in the coming era of global borderless business, we must have industrial peace and technological development. Because all of us know that wage increases in excess of productivity gains have been one of the biggest factors weakening the nation's competitive edge, I am sure that both labor and management will cooperate now. Q: What is your plan to revive the agricultural sector, hardest hit by the successful settlement of the Uruguay Round trade negotiations? A: So far, farm policy has been a defensive policy of protecting the weak sector. From now on, we will turn to a more aggressive approach by helping the domestic farm industry sharpen its competitive edge. More specifically, the government will accelerate structural adjustment, rationalize the farmland ownership system and improve the farm administration to better suit the international trends. For this purpose, the "Rural Development Tax" will be introduced as proposed earlier, and the government will, taking the views from all sectors of society into consideration, come up with a comprehensive policy package by the end of June. Q: What change have you found in the government's role between 1979, when you served as the last trade minister of the late President Pak Chong-hui, and now? A: We are now living in a democratized, deregulated and internationalized era. The government's role should also change from that of a guider to helper. Particularly, it should play the role as the fair supervisor of the economy, while supplying social infrastructure, fostering human resources and protecting the environment.
