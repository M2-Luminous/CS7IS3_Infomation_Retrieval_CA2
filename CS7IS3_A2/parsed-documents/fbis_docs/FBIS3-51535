Electric company authorities who were contacted by AFP claimed not to know the cause of the outage, which occurred at 0815 [1415 GMT], or when service will be restored. Guatemala has experienced an escalation of attacks over the past 48 hours, with bomb explosions in the Congress and in four telecommunications towers in the western region of the country, which local media have attributed to leftist guerrillas.
