He said there is a possibility that satellites will provide us and the Arabs with an early warning capability. "We suppose the Arabs have also learned a lesson from the Gulf war in all matters pertaining to defense on the home front," Gur said. According to Gur, "the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] will have to show us how to be a modern, professional, and thrifty army, and at the same time remain a people's army." He said defense needs and the numbers in recent drafts have not permitted the Army to call up all candidates for military service. Some will be sent for national service and will not be recruited to the Army. Gur said that "if we learn that the PLO leadership is incapable of controlling most of the population and leading it to real coexistence, the basic question will crop up about the justification for the autonomy." In reference to Iraq, Gur -- a former chief of staff -- said that despite the fact that the Iraqi Army was seriously beaten in the Gulf war, it still has over 30 army divisions and 400 aircraft. "Iraq also constitutes a serious nonconventional threat. There is no certainty that even after all the investigations inside Iraq we know about all they have," Gur said. He also said that the Home Front Command is prepared to transfer allocation of gas masks to a civilian firm. He said "we are now organizing for continued allocation of the masks and if it becomes possible we will do it via a civilian business firm."
