Take notice that on August 11, 1994, Boston Edison Company (Edison) filed a letter agreement between itself and thirteen Massachusetts municipal electric systems further extending the deadline for the Municipals' submission of objections to Edison's 1992 bills for services rendered under each municipal system's Pilgrim power purchase contract in 1992. On July 28, 1994, Boston Edison filed a letter agreement in Docket No. ER94&hyph;1497&hyph;000 extending that deadline from July 31, 1994, until August 15, 1994. The new letter agreement extends that deadline from August 15, 1994, until September 7, 1994. The letter agreement makes no other changes to the rates, terms and conditions of the affected Pilgrim contracts. Edison states that it has served copies of this filing upon each of the affected customers and upon the three other Pilgrim purchasers: Reading Municipal Light Department, Montaup Electric Company and Commonwealth Electric Company; as well as the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said failing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426, in accordance with Rules 211 and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211 and 18 CFR 385.214). All such motions or protests should be filed on or before September 2, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
