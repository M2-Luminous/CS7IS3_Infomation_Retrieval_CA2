President Callejas met yesterday with Discua, with whom he discussed the report, but did not give any details of the content of their discussion. Callejas stated that he has been a loyal advocate of human rights in Honduras and said that the report should help reconcile Hondurans, because it lacks legal validity to identify any culprits. Callejas said the document contains the facts, but attention must be given to the state's decisions in this regard, such as the court trials, the decisions issued, and the amnesties granted, which protect the rights of many people who have been identified as presumed culprits. Callejas reiterated that the report should not be used to generate hatred and resentment among Hondurans or divisions. He said: "Rather, it should be the basis for the unification of Hondurans." Callejas expressed his concern over certain statements that have been made in various media. According to Callejas, these statements seek to assign responsibilities based on assumptions, which is the sole responsibility of the courts. Asked about if this was going to be a "let us start anew" incident, Callejas said that above all justice must prevail, but what is important is that everything leads to a national reconciliation. Regarding the amnesties granted by his and Jose Azcona's government, Callejas clarified that they cover some of the crimes involving individuals that were included in the report. The rest will be up to the courts to decide but based on factual and concrete evidence. Although Callejas supports the idea that justice must prevail, he believes that Hondurans should not be divided and that the report should seek mainly to reunify Hondurans. Callejas believes that one cannot judge based on simple assumptions, but the courts should always have the last word. Discua Maintains Firm Position When asked whether Discua's position could be jeopardized by the developments and certain problems within the armed institution, Callejas said he is unaware of such an extreme situation, adding "there has been no action shedding doubt on the legitimacy of the current Armed Forces commander." Callejas said that it is absolutely illegal to call for Discua's temporary suspension from his post as requested by the Committee of Relatives of Missing Detainees in Honduras (Cofadeh). The president added that this organization is not even close to being a court and that the Constitution of the Republic and other laws establish the procedure that should be followed in this case. Callejas said that it is difficult for a request of this nature to prosper at the National Congress, adding that leaders of this branch of state already issued their opinions about this issue. Oversight Commission The Executive Branch Oversight Commission has yet to issue its report, because it is still investigating the huge contraband discovered in San Pedro Sula. Callejas said that the report will be revealed as soon as the investigations are concluded. The president added that he is awaiting a message in this regard from commission coordinator Israel Gonzales.
