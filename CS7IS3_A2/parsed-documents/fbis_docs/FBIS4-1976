When attending the "two sessions" in Beijing, Guangdong Governor Zhu Senlin, a deputy to the National People's Congress [NPC], responded to a reporter's question and said that there is a long-term plan of transportation construction in Guangdong. In order to coordinate with the state's relevant planning and to meet the need of Guangdong's economic development, Guangdong has decided to build a dozen expressways over a period of 15 to 20 years, which will have a total length of about 3,300 km, to penetrate to the eastern, western, and northern parts of Guangdong so as to form a network of roads converging on the state's main roads, and linking key cities, transportation hubs, and ports in the province. The above-mentioned project will require more than 100 billion yuan, and this year over 10 billion yuan will be injected to it. Zhu Senlin said that the funds for building expressways will be raised by Guangdong's own efforts, and come from accumulated capital. Some foreign funds will also be used. The expressways for which contracts have been signed with foreign firms, and on which construction has already begun or will soon begin so that they can be completed by 1996, include: The 154-km Guangzhou-Shenzhen east route, which is under construction; the 140-km Shenzhen-Shantou east route; the 66-km Huizhou-Heyuan route; the 150-km Yangjiang-Zhuhai coastal expressway; the 146-km Shenzhen-Shantou west route; and the 80-km Foshan-Kaiping expressway. Letters of intent have also been signed with foreign businessmen to build another four expressways, namely, the Guangdong section of the Beijing-Guangzhou expressway, Guangzhou-Huidong expressway, Kaiping-Yangjiang expressway, and Yangjiang-Zhanjiang expressway; according to plan, construction will begin next year and will be completed by 1998-1999. At present, Guangdong ranks first among provinces and regions in construction of roads, and this is also true in terms of road density. In the area of building transportation facilities such as railways, airports, and ports, Guangdong has also made eye-catching achievements. Zhu Senlin said that these big inputs are for enabling Guangdong to cast off the "bottleneck" restraint which has hindered Guangdong's capital construction for a long time, so that good conditions can be created for Guangdong's future development.
