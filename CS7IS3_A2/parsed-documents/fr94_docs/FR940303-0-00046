FR940303-0-00046 FR940303-0-00012 26 CFR Part 301 [TD 8524] RIN 1545&hyph;A079 Clarification of Period During Which Interest Is Allowed With Respect to Certain Overpayments AGENCY: Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Treasury. ACTION: Final regulations. SUMMARY: This document amends ยง301.6611&hyph;1 on Procedure and Administration. The amendments clarify the period during which interest is allowed on overpayments credited against a taxpayer's liability for interest and certain additions to the tax. The amendments are necessary as a result of changes to the law made by the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 and the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984. The amendments affect all taxpayers that have overpayments credited against underpayments. DATES: These regulations are effective March 3, 1994. These regulations are applicable for credits made on or after August 25, 1992. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Forest Boone of the Office of Assistant Chief Counsel (Income Tax & Accounting), Internal Revenue Service, 1111 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20224 (Attention: CC:IT&A:Br06) or telephone 202&hyph;622&hyph;4960 (not a toll- free number). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background This document amends the regulations on Procedure and Administration (26 CFR part 301) under section 6611 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) to clarify the period during which interest is allowed on overpayments that are credited against a taxpayer's liability for interest and certain additions to the tax. These amendments conform the regulations to section 344 of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA) (Pub. L. 97&hyph;248, 96 Stat. 635), and section 158 of the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 (DEFRA) (Pub. L. 98&hyph;369, 98 Stat. 696). On August 25, 1992, the IRS published in the Federal Register a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (57 FR 38457). The IRS did not receive any comment letters in response to that notice nor was a public hearing requested. The proposed regulations are adopted in this Treasury decision. Explanation of Provisions Interest on Overpayments That Are Credited Against Interest on Underpayments Section 6611(a) of the Code provides that interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment in respect of any internal revenue tax at the overpayment rate established under section 6621. Under section 6402(a), the Secretary may credit any overpayment (including any interest allowed thereon) against any liability imposed under the Code on the taxpayer. Under section 6611(b)(1), interest is allowed on an overpayment that is so credited from the date of the overpayment to the due date of the taxpayer's liability against which the overpayment is credited. For purposes of this interest computation, specific due dates are provided in ยง301.6611&hyph;1(h). Generally, section 6601(f) provides that once an overpayment is credited to satisfy a taxpayer's liability, interest no longer accrues on that liability. Section 344 of TEFRA added section 6622 of the Code, which requires interest imposed by the Code to be compounded daily. The effect of section 6601(f) on the compounding requirement of section 6622 is that once an overpayment is credited to satisfy the taxpayer's liability for interest, that credit cuts off any further compounding of that interest (i.e., interest no longer accrues on the taxpayer's interest liability against which the credit has been made). Similarly, it is appropriate that no interest liability to the taxpayer accrues on the overpayment once the overpayment is credited to satisfy the taxpayer's liability for interest. Thus, ยง301.6611&hyph;1(h)(2)(v) is amended to clarify that interest does not continue to accrue on any portion of an overpayment that is credited against the taxpayer's liability for interest.
