The power of the Finance Ministry within the Hosokawa government has grown so strong that the prime minister is now unable to control it. There are growing complaints from people around the prime minister who say "The Finance Ministry should be brought under control, by force if necessary," but it is also true that the prime minister cannot do much in the economic realm, such as stimulating the economy, without the cooperation of the Finance Ministry. The prime minister is growing increasingly irritated by this dilemma. The prime minister recently expressed his strong discontent with the Finance Ministry to one of his acquaintances, saying: "They do not bring us any ideas. Nor they want to listen to what we tell them." The recent problem arises from the Finance Ministry's persistence in combining in a package the issues of reducing income taxes and raising the consumption tax. The prime minister does not support taking care of these issues together in view of the condition of the ruling coalition parties, wherein the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] is opposed to the idea of raising the consumption tax. He thinks that the government should implement the income tax cut first and put off acting on a consumption tax increase until later. His office has asked the Finance Ministry repeatedly to come up with a plan that supports this line of thinking. For a while, the Prime Minister's Office suggested as a compromise "making a promise to carry out a cut in the consumption tax in the future but proposing to make perishable foods tax-free and to impose high tax rates on table luxuries to enable the SDPJ to accept the consumption tax increase." But the Finance Ministry is said to have rejected this suggestion and instead to have insisted that "such a tax cannot be called a consumption tax, and that is tantamount to restoring the commodity taxes." The reason why the Finance Ministry is so persistent about raising the consumption tax [while at the same time reducing income taxes] is not only because of the financial authorities' basic stand in quest of "balanced finance," but also because of the support for such stand by people like Ichiro Ozawa, general secretary of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]. On the other hand, the prime minister himself has so far kept on saying, "We cannot pump out deficit-covering bonds." He now simply cannot declare that he has decided to go ahead with the income tax cuts. Even the meeting of the Government-Ruling Parties Economic Issue Consultative Council, which the prime minister had hoped would play the role of an intermediary on the matter, broke up on 6 January, after the ruling parties revolted, saying: "When there is only one answer (that the consumption tax increase should be handled as a separate matter), the Finance Ministry persists on handling the two issues together. As long as that is the given condition, there is no use in continuing the talks." As a result, it has become very likely that the prime minister will not be able to make an announcement on economic stimulus measures in mid-January as he has publicly pledged he will do. For the prime minister, if that happens, this setback will come on the heels of the one concerning his failure to formulate the 1994 budget before the end of 1993. As such, there are emerging voices among those around the prime minister which say, "We should emulate Hiroshi Kumagai, minister of international trade and industry, and the Prime Minister's Office should show its leadership even if takes the tough step of firing some senior officials if necessary." But if the relationship between the Prime Minister's Office and the Finance Ministry deteriorates further, there can be problems in adopting emergency economic stimulus measures and in formulating the third 1993 supplementary budget and the regular 1994 budget. As for the question of how to handle the Finance Ministry, it may be said that the prime minister is now having his ability called into question.
