FR940902-2-00100 FR940902-2-00049 Federal-State Unemployment Compensation Program: Unemployment Insurance Program Letters Interpreting Federal Unemployment Insurance Law The Employment and Training Administration interprets Federal law requirements pertaining to unemployment compensation as part of its role in the administration of the Federal-State unemployment compensation program. These interpretations are issued in Unemployment Insurance Program Letters (UIPLs) to the State Employment Security Agencies (SESAs). The UIPL described below is published in the Federal Register in order to inform the public. Unemployment Insurance Program Letter No. 41&hyph;94 This UIPL advises SESAs of the actions which must be undertaken by States in order to meet the requirements of Sections 303(a)(10) and 303(j) of the Social Security Act (SSA). Compliance with the provisions of the SSA is a condition for the receipt of administration grants for the operation of the Unemployment Insurance program. Sections 303(a)(10) and 303(j) were added to the SSA by Public Law 103&hyph;152. Under Section 303(j), SSA, States are required to establish and utilize a system of profiling all new claimants for regular UC in order to identify those claimants most likely to exhaust regular UC and in need of reemployment services in order to obtain new work. Section 303(a)(10), SSA, also requires that an individual identified pursuant to the profiling system must participate in reemployment services as a condition of UC eligibility. Dated: August 26, 1994. Doug Ross, Assistant Secretary of Labor.
