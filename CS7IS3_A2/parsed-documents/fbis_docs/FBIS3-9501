[Agoston] There have been different views within the VMDK from the very beginning. VMDK Deputy Chairman Sandor Hodi's political position has been the same from the very beginning: He starts from the premise that a new settlement will take place in this part of Europe and that a border modification is a realistic possibility within this new settlement. Thus, for him, the implementation of the autonomy concept is the minimum that the Serbian leadership should give us because the organized political opposition of the Vojvodina Hungarians and the international support the Hungarians receive in this forces the Serbs to do that. Dialogue and the daily political cooperation of coexisting people are not a necessary part of that concept. It does not count on the principle of partnership based on political subjectivity; instead, it counts on the fact that, as a result of favorable international circumstances, the Serbs will get into a subordinate position. Naturally, that political philosophy only covers the block Hungarians. Given the fact that it circumvents the issue of coexistence of people living in this area -- first of all the coexistence of Serbs and Hungarians -- the concept is abstract and unrealistic. As opposed to that -- and in my opinion this political philosophy still has greater support within the VMDK -- another line emerges as more realistic. The essence of it is that in the current situation, the issue of border modification should not be included in the political activity of the VMDK. We do not want to live in subjugation, but we know that we have to live in peace with the others in this region, first of all with the Serbs. The Hungarians here must be guaranteed a constitutional and legal framework in which they can preserve their identity, survive, and remain here without a border modification. This legal framework is the autonomy concept of the VMDK. The legality and democratic support make it possible for the VMDK to act as a political partner in settling the common affairs of the Hungarians living in the Carpathina basin. Our common goal is to make sure that Hungary becomes a member of the European Union as soon as possible and that the Hungarians living beyond Hungary's borders can implement their autonomy efforts. The results achieved so far prove that there is no politically relevant alternative to that idea. On the other side, of course, there is the danger that the so-called reformer politicians who are also increasingly forced into the background within the VMDK might gain ground. The essence of their efforts is that they are ready to give up not only the independence and political legality of the VMDK but also Hungarian autonomy in exchange for Serbian concessions adequate to their individual or group interests.
