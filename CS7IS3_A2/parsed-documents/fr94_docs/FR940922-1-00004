FR940922-1-00004 FR940922-1-00002 RESOLUTION TRUST CORPORATION 12 CFR Part 1635 RIN 3205&hyph;AA24 Claims Based Upon Acts or Omissions of the Receiver agency: Resolution Trust Corporation. action: Proposed rule. summary: The Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) is proposing to adopt a rule setting forth procedures applicable to administrative claims based upon acts or omissions of the RTC as receiver. The rule is intended to inform potential claimants of the circumstances under which the RTC will consider claims based upon acts or omissions of the receiver to be timely filed and to clarify when suit may be filed on these claims. The rule will thus inform and remind potential claimants of the deadlines applicable to claims and suits based upon acts or omissions of receivers. Comments received from the public will be considered in determining the form of a final rule. dates: Comments must be received on or before October 24, 1994. addresses: Written comments concerning the proposed rule should be addressed to John M. Buckley, Jr., Secretary, Resolution Trust Corporation, 801 17th Street, NW., Washington, DC 20434&hyph;0001. Comments may be hand-delivered to Room 321 on business days between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. Comments may also be inspected in the Public Reading Room, 801 17th Street, NW., between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. on business days. (Telephone number: 202&hyph;416&hyph;6940; FAX number: 202&hyph;416&hyph;4753. These are not toll-free numbers.) for further information contact: Munsell St. Clair (Counsel), telephone 202&hyph;736&hyph;3034. supplementary information: 12 U.S.C. 1821(d)(13)(D) deprives all courts of jurisdiction over, inter alia, any claim or action seeking payment from, or a determination of rights with respect to, the assets of an insured depository institution for which the RTC has been appointed receiver and any claim relating to any act or omission of the RTC as receiver, unless the claims process described in 12 U.S.C. 1821(d) has first been complied with. The legislative history of 12 U.S.C. 1821(d) reveals that the dual purpose behind requiring exhaustion of claims before suit can be filed is: (1) To minimize costs to the receivership estate and to the legitimate claimants who share in the distributions from the estate, and (2) to minimize the burden on federal courts by avoiding needless litigation. H.R. Rep. No. 101&hyph;54(I), 101st Cong., 1st Sess. 2, reprinted in 1989 U.S. CODE CONG. & ADMIN. NEWS 215. These purposes are fulfilled by requiring that, before suit can be filed, the receivership claims process must be exhausted with respect to claims based upon acts or omissions of the RTC as receiver, since litigation and its accompanying burden on the receivership estate and the courts may be avoided if the receiver is given an initial opportunity to allow meritorious claims outside of litigation. Thus, both the literal terms of 12 U.S.C. 1821(d)(13)(D) and the purposes of the statute make it clear that no suit can be maintained against the RTC as receiver based upon any act or omission of the RTC as receiver unless and until the claims process has been pursued. As of March 31, 1994, the RTC held over 533,000 assets, such as real estate, mortgages and deeds of trust, and commercial and consumer loans. The RTC, as receiver, has entered into and will continue to enter into numerous contracts for the sale of these assets. In addition, the RTC, as receiver, enters into many other contracts relating to its operations. Further, many additional claims arise relating to the conduct of receivership affairs. Because of the number of contracts that the RTC enters into as receiver and because the RTC, as receiver, acts in a wide variety of ways, disputes necessarily arise between the RTC and other persons. In order to fulfill the purposes of the claims process set forth in 12 U.S.C. 1821(d), the RTC is promulgating this proposed rule setting forth procedures applicable to claims based upon acts or omissions of the RTC as receiver. (The proposed rule does not address claims against the RTC in its corporate capacity.) When final, this rule will replace the Interim Statement of Policy Regarding Procedures to be Used with Regard to Claims Based upon Acts or Omissions of the Receiver, 59 FR 10663 (March 7, 1994), which will be superseded in its entirety. Regulatory Flexibility Act Statement Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the RTC hereby certifies that this proposal is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required. List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 1635 Administrative practice and procedure.
