Even my democrat friends in Moscow still do not wish to understand the importance and necessity of the president of Russia's recent visit to Tbilisi. It is difficult for me to say this, but I must: Yegor Gaydar was in charge of the government during the period of the Georgian-Abkhazian war, while his cabinet provided immense financial and material aid to separatists. Boris Nikolayevich understands that normalization of our relations is in the interests of the preservation of political stability not only in Georgia but also in Russia itself. In the course of a one-on-one conversation we practically came to mutual understanding with respect to the resolution of common problems. Graphic evidence of this is the package of agreements that have been signed, including on freedom of trade, protection of borders, and many others--24 of them so far. More than 10 are still to be signed in the nearest future at the level of the prime ministers. In order to properly implement our agreements, a decision was made to create working commissions headed by Georgian Prime Minister Otar Patsatsia and First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets. Speaking at the Academy of Sciences in Tbilisi to the academic and creative intelligentsia, the president of Russia had the courage and fortitude to say that his country does not absolve itself of responsibility for what happened in Abkhazia. We discussed this problem too, of course. There are three options for settling it with the participation of the United Nations and the use of peacekeeping forces. We found mutual understanding with respect to practically all three options. The first option envisages the participation of combined UN peacekeeping forces in the conflict zone. The second also assumes the participation of this contingent with an analogous status, except that 80 percent of participants will be comprised of only Russian armed forces personnel. But in this case the point of contention is financing this process, which requires approximately $200 million, which, according to Butrus-Ghali, the United Nations currently does not have. There is also another option, which has been proposed by the UN secretary general--let Russia and Georgia come to an agreement among themselves regarding peacekeeping forces in Abkhazia. But in this case we face the same dilemma: Who will undertake the burden of financing? Intensive consultations are currently underway in all directions. I know that the American government is looking for possible sources of financing. I think that in the nearest future we will arrive at a common denominator. In parallel, work is in progress on a model of political system for Abkhazia that will take into account protection of the rights of the peoples living there, which will be reflected in the new Georgian constitution. One may ask: Why in the text of the final communique is the issue of ratification of this agreement linked to the problem of peaceful settlement of the Abkhazian problem? We have to understand that Russia also has its own difficulties in the North Caucasus. And this fact obligates both us and our neighbor to find a peaceful resolution to the existing confrontation. At the same time, Russia took it upon itself to provide organizational development for the Georgian national army. Before taking this step, I thought long and hard and consulted with many leaders of different countries. All were willing to provide aid only on the level of inspectors and consultants, but no one would undertake to provide aid in the form of armaments. Nobody except Russia is in a position today to provide tangible aid in this matter. There are currently 30,000 soldiers and officers officially listed in our army on paper, but in reality you probably will not count even a few thousand. And nobody knows where the money allocated by the government goes. Besides all these issues, many people want to know whether Georgia will join the ruble zone. I asked the president of Russia how he views this. His answer was straightforward: There is not much enthusiasm. It is an additional burden for Russia. Nevertheless, it was decided to set up a special commission, which will weigh all "pros" and "cons" and then will arrive at a concrete decision. I consider it an important point of the visit that the president of Russia has accepted my "3 + 1" model for settling the Caucasus problem as a whole--creating a permanent consultative body with the participation of heads of Transcaucasus states and Russia. Despite the opposition forces' skeptical attitude to this visit, the absolute majority of the population sees normalization of our relations as the only chance for Georgia to get out of the crisis. According to sociological surveys, 75 percent actively support our course and only 10 percent feel negative about it.
