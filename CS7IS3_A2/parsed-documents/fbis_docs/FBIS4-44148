Do you have the impression that this controversy affected the work here and, in particular, the goodwill Austria had in Europe after the success in the referendum? [Vranitzky] No, it has not had an affect. This so-called competence discussion was conducted only by a few people in Austria and was unduly exaggerated in the media. For me, this has not been a discussion. We have done our job here in Corfu, and we have done it in the interest of our country, which was our duty. This is the main subject that one should discuss. [Schmidt] In St. George's Chapel, where you signed the treaty yesterday, one could hear many friendly and positive words about Austria and about the role Austria can play in Europe in the future. What is your overall impression? Where these mainly Sunday speeches or was there more behind them? [Vranitzky] No, these were certainly not Sunday speeches. All in all, this EU [European Union] summit, in which we participated for the first time -- this time still as observers -- has yielded a most favorable result. It was not just the signing of a treaty between the Republic of Austria and the European Union and all its members, but here, for the first time, a productive meeting has been held between the EU members, including ourselves, on the one hand, and President Yeltsin, on the other. An agreement on economic cooperation, peace, and stability was signed. Second, and this refers to us Austrians, in particular, one hour ago, the basic document was accepted, which states that, for example, the major railroad construction projects -- in our case, this is the Verona- Munich line -- have been included in the list of EU projects. There was some debate on the issue, but it was finally accepted. Third -- and this is of particular importance to me -- for the first time, as far as I know, the European Union discussed the issue of Chernobyl in this form. It may not have done so in a way that is absolutely satisfactory, but at least it was indicated that something has to be done and that we must defend ourselves against these faulty power plants. One must certainly also note with satisfaction what was decided and discussed with the next Council president, our neighboring country Germany -- namely to attribute particular attention to the issues related to internal security. We will launch joint actions in the sphere of fighting international crime, narcotics smuggling, money laundering, and many other issues. [Schmidt] Mr. Chancellor, you have mentioned the Verona-Munich railroad connection, which also includes the tunnel beneath the Brenner Pass. EU projects tend to take a long time, because they involve much and profound discussion. What schedule can one expect for this project? [Vranitzky] We must do the necessary preliminary work at home, which is what we have done. On 4 May, we concluded a basic agreement at the level of the federal and Tirolean provincial government and the Austrian Federal Railways. As far as the planning is concerned, the work has already started. This is, of course, taking some time in our own country, too. Land has to be bought, the authorities must carry out the necessary licensing procedures, and then there are hearings involving affected citizens. We do not have to say that the European Union is taking a long time, because we have to do our job at home first. Besides, this applies also to the major projects in eastern Austria. I have to emphasize this again and again that the transport projects include, of course the Inn Valley, but not only. Other areas of our republic are also struggling with heavy and even heavier traffic. There, too, one has to take the necessary precautions for the future.
