Farmers feel that this gift of nature cannot be dismissed. It will be important to concentrate on local applications of complete fertilizers during the sowing of spring crops. Their effectiveness will be higher than ever, because of the extremely low content of nutrients in the soil. Last year's negative balance of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium--when the quantity of these removed from the soil with the harvest and weeds was three times as great as the quantity added to the soil in mineral and organic fertilizers. In addition to this, even the meager remaining supply of nitrogen was washed into the deepest layers of the soil by the fall rains, and winter grain crops required top dressing almost everywhere. Besides this, widespread blight and root rot are expected, and these will have to be combated with protective chemicals and with complete liquid fertilizers and phosphorus and potassium solutions. In short, mixtures of fertilizers, pesticides, and retardants will have to be applied on a broad scale, mainly by agricultural aircraft. In southern Russia this work should begin any day, but it probably will not begin because the mineral fertilizer storage bins of farms and associations of the Agricultural Chemicals Administration are empty, and no one knows where the gasoline for airplanes and helicopters will come from. The production of mineral fertilizers has been stopped or is on the verge of being stopped at the large chemical combines in Nevinnomyssk, Tolyatti, Uvarovo, Kemerovo, Dzerzhinsk, Solikamsk, Cherepovets, and Balakovo. There has been a corresponding dramatic decrease in the demand for raw materials for fertilizer produced by the Apatit, Uralkaliy, and Silvinit production associations. As a result, last December agricultural producers obtained an average of only 500 grams of nutritive substances per hectare of plowed land. In more specific terms, farms in Volgograd, Saratov, Kurgan, Orenburg, Novosibirsk, and Omsk oblasts, Altay Kray, Kalmykia, and Dagestan have two or three kilograms of mineral fertilizers per hectare for this year's harvest. Farmers in the United States use 100 kilograms per hectare, farmers in Germany use 400 kilograms, and in the Netherlands they use 800 kilograms per hectare! Last year's sad experience testified that the preferential credits and 30-percent subsidy for mineral fertilizers and pesticides in March resulted only in a sudden high demand for them in April and May--i.e., at the height of the spring sowing season, when chemical combines were unable to fill all orders in such a short time. Furthermore, the state aid to agriculture went astray in commercial banks. Is this likely to happen again? It might. Secretary O. Lobov of the Russian Federation Security Council informed the president of the disastrous state of the production and use of mineral fertilizers. On the last day of last year, B.N. Yeltsin issued the appropriate instructions to the government. Now almost a whole month has gone by. What has happened? No one is doing anything, and it appears that no one plans to do anything. After all, it will not be the first time the omnipotent Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Economics have put the brakes on such instructions. Apparently, in the words of the biblical parable, it is time to start gathering stones instead of scattering them. We see only one solution: The state should pay chemical combines directly for fertilizers, meliorative chemicals, and pesticides delivered to the storage facilities of the Agricultural Chemicals Administration. This is the only way agricultural producers will be able to conduct agrochemical and protective operations on the necessary scales and at the best possible times. This should not be viewed as aid to the rural community: Agriculture not only produces food, but also provides jobs for tens of millions of industrial workers in the chemical industry, machine building, power engineering, transportation, and other branches!
