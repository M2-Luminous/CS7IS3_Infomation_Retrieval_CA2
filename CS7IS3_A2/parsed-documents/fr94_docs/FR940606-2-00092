FR940606-2-00092 FR940606-2-00060 Further, the Commission believes that providing the PSE with an efficient method by which to increase Auto-Ex order size eligibility to match another market's increase is consistent with sections 6(b)(5) and 11A(a)(1)(C) of the Act in that it facilitates transactions in securities and promotes fair competition among options markets by enhancing the benefits available to investors of a multiple trading environment. The Commission also believes that the proposal adequately protects investors and the public interest by conditioning the increase in order size eligibility on the PSE's filing with the Commission, under section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act, of the specific terms of the increase. The Commission believes that requiring the PSE to provide it with such a filing will provide sufficient opportunity for the Commission to determine whether the PSE has adequate system and market maker capacity to accommodate the proposed increase and request appropriate modification of the increase if necessary. Finally, the Commission notes that the PSE has represented that Auto-Ex currently has adequate system and market-maker capacity to accommodate any reasonably anticipated increase in order size eligibility. 11 11 See supra note 7. Amendment No. 4 provides that orders may not be split for purposes of making the parts eligible for entry into Auto-Ex. The Commission agrees with the Exchange that this is necessary in order to assure compliance with the purpose of Auto-Ex, which is to allow for a more efficient method of executing small market and limit orders. 12 Additionally, the rule change proposed in Amendment No. 4 is consistent with CBOE Rule 6.8(a)(i), which the Commission previously approved. 13 12 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32703 (July 30, 1993), 58 FR 42117, (August 6, 1993). 13 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 28411 (September 6, 1990), 55 FR 37784 (September 13, 1990). The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment No. 4 to the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the Federal Register . 14 For the reasons stated above, the Commission believes it is consistent with section 6(b)(5) of the Act to approve Amendment No. 4 to the PSE's proposal on an accelerated basis. 14 As noted previously, Amendment No. 3 withdraws and supersedes Amendment Nos. 1, 2, and 3. See Amendment No. 4, supra note 5. Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning Amendment No. 4 to the proposed rule change. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC. Copies of such filing will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office of the Exchange. All submissions should refer to File No. SR&hyph;PSE&hyph;93&hyph;26 and should be submitted by June 27, 1994. It is therefore ordered, pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 15 that the proposed rule change (SR&hyph;PSE&hyph;93&hyph;26) is approved, as amended. 15 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1988). For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 16 16 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1993). Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
