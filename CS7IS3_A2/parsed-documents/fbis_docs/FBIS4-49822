With this task in mind, He Zhukang, secretary of the provincial party committee, conducted investigation and study in Jilin city from 25 to 29 April. Comrade He Zhukang heard an overall work report by a leading comrade of the Jilin city party committee and held discussions with the responsible persons of 30 large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises of different types at three forums, including the Jilin Chemical Fiber Limited Company, Jilin Ferroalloy Plant, Songyuan Food Industrial Company, and Jilin city company of chemicals for daily use. Directors (managers) and party secretaries of these enterprises talked freely about their methods and experiences to transform mechanisms, improve management, enhance skills, increase benefits, and strengthen party building in the new situation of establishing the socialist market economy system and, based on their specific conditions, offered views and suggestions on how to overcome the current difficulties by deepening reform and how to enable enterprises to extract themselves from the predicament, enhance their vigor, and improve economic benefits. Comrade He Zhukang also conducted field investigation at the Jilin Chemical Fiber Limited Company, Jinuoer Electric Appliance (Group) Company, Jilin Woolen Mill, and two other plants. Comrade He Zhukang spoke highly of the great amount of fruitful work carried out by the Jilin city party committee and government since the beginning of this year to develop the economy, safeguard social stability, strengthen party building, and, in particular, improve large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises. He fully affirmed the methods and experiences of some enterprises, which had deepened reform continuously, stepped up technical transformation, served the needs of the domestic and world markets, and improved economic benefits despite the many difficulties they encountered. He pointed out: Large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises constitute the core of the socialist public sector of the economy, the pillar and backbone of the national economy, and the major source of state revenue. How they are developed is not only an important economic issue but also an important political and social issue because it concerns the overall situation of reform, development, and stability and the socialist orientation of taking public ownership as the foundation. Whether large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises can be improved represents a severe test for our party and government. Party committees and governments at all levels must take this issue seriously from this perspective. Judging from the conditions of Jilin city and the entire province, they have adopted some effective measures since early this year when the provincial party committee held a work conference on improvement of large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises; some enterprises have begun to invigorate; others are still very difficult, but their bright prospects have shown; and enterprises which can find no way out are very few. This shows that not only should we improve as demanded by the situation, but also we have the methods to improve. We need to further unify our thinking, be determined, mobilize and concentrate efforts to perform work in line with the requirements of the three-year plan of the provincial party committee and government for improving large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, and improve these enterprises group after group at different times. Not only should leaders at all levels attach great importance to this issue, but also all trades and professions and all fields should achieve a common understanding, regard improvement of large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises as the most important and urgent task for the present, and muster some financial resources and create favorable conditions to invigorate them first even if this means that some fields have to tighten up their financial resources for some time. When large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises are not improved, other fields of work cannot be promoted. For this reason, all fields should provide necessary conditions and support to improve large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises. Comrade He Zhukang said: The entire industrial sector of the economy, especially large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, is in a very crucial period for development and in a very important period for change. First, it has become an irresistible development trend to change the planned economy to the market economy, and the operating mechanism for the market economy has begun to enter enterprises and property right relations and is being gradually standardized. Second, the consumption pattern in people's life has effected a significant change because they have stepped from merely having sufficient food and clothes to a moderately prosperous life. This requires adjustment of the entire economic structure, especially the structure of the industrial economy. Third, new worldwide technological revolution and the rapid development of modern science and technology have brought about increasingly intense competition in the world economy. To gain a foothold in the competition, Jilin should also accelerate its economic restructuring. Meanwhile, the change in the economic system and the structural adjustment call for the compliance of all the spheres of the superstructure and the improvement of people's quality. Such a change represents a challenge and also a new opportunity. We should have a full understanding of this, study and arrange it early, acquire a better and comprehensive understanding of this important change and crucial period for development, guide action according to circumstances, and correctly make decisions. This is an important responsibility of leading cadres and also a test for them. We should fully understand the urgency of this issue, greatly mobilize our efforts, and plunge ourselves heart and soul into reform and development. We should be aware of the crisis like a boat sailing against the current which must forge ahead or will be driven back, display the indomitable spirit, have the ability to learn and the courage to explore in the practice of reform and development, conquer difficulties, and enhance ability. Comrade He Zhukang pointed out: In the period for the historical change and in the new situation, our understanding often falls behind practice due to our lack of mental preparations, and our concepts, work ideas, and work methods are very incompatible. As far as the endeavor to improve large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises is concerned, we still need to further unify thinking and enhance the understanding of some issues so as to pool more efforts and achieve greater results. First, in the overall economic pattern of establishing the socialist market economy system, large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises will and should continue to play a key role and improve themselves without wavering. They have no other choice. Second, we should enhance confidence. Despite the many difficulties, we also have many favorable conditions and great potential for improving large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises. The key is to enhance confidence and be firm to carry out work through to the end. Third, when improving large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, we should have new concepts and new ideas instead of the old methods adopted during the period for the planned economy. Improving large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises requires support and necessary assistance from the government. Relevant government departments should actively help enterprises unload the heavy historical burden. Enterprises, however, should understand that in the condition of the market economy, they should rely on their own efforts and should march toward the market to invigorate themselves. Therefore, we should further lift control over enterprises and grant them all the decision-making power they are entitled to as stipulated in the "enterprise law," so that they will truly have the courage to adopt various effective measures to develop themselves. Meanwhile, state-owned enterprises should also further emancipate the mind, broaden their field of thinking, allow the adoption of different ownerships at state-owned enterprises, and have the ability to bring in funds from abroad to conduct technical transformation. Regarding this work, we should have the courage to seek truth from facts and be willing to allow others to gain benefits. Only when these enterprises are invigorated can they achieve development. Fourth, we should not only adopt various measures, strengthen management, and accelerate technical transformation and development of new products to improve large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises. But we should also pay close attention to the central link of reform of the property right system. We should adopt every means to make the best use of the assets available by selling or leasing them out, reorganizing them, or transplanting them to others. We should raise funds for technical transformation and construction through various channels. When buying new assets, we should make accurate selection to ensure that they create good benefits, enjoy a good market, and have bright prospects. Fifth, we should take both current and long-term work into consideration, first make current work successful, and, in the meantime, study the strategy for long-term development. We should adopt every means possible to guarantee the production of the enterprises whose products are of good quality and sell well in the market and muster efforts to support them. We should strengthen marketing, reduce stockpiles, and adopt various effective means to reduce deficits and increase profits and revenues. Sixth, establishing the social security system is a task that brooks no delay. We should actively probe into it with new ideas. Seventh, we should trust and rely on the masses. Staff members and workers are the major participators in reform and development. We should mobilize them to discuss the major affairs of enterprises and fully stimulate the enthusiasm of all fields. We should combine material incentives with spiritual encouragement and strict demands with concern and love, give full play to the role of advanced examples as models and leaders and the role of trade unions, Communist Youth League, women's federations, and other mass organizations as bridges and channels, and lead people's enthusiasm to reform and development. We should show concern for and cherish those with outstanding achievements in improving large and medium- sized state-owned enterprises, improve their material benefits, and commend them so that more such people will emerge. Comrade He Zhukang urged: In the process of improving large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, we should strengthen and improve party leadership. Party committees at all levels should take the overall situation in view to correctly handle the relations between reform, development, and stability, have the ability to observe and think over issues from a political view, continuously enhance the sense of respect for party leadership and the overall situation, coordinate well the relations between various sectors, and conscientiously implement the work principles of the party Central Committee and the work arrangements of the provincial party committee. A very important point in strengthening party leadership is to further implement the principle of democratic centralism. All important issues should be decided after collective discussions of party committees, and their implementation should be organized according to the division of work. We should place reform, development, and stability at the center of party committee's work. We should carry out the various reform measures in line with Jilin's actual conditions; often restructure the economy with new ideas and methods, improve the quality of enterprises, and maintain sustained, stable, and healthy economic development; and adhere to the principle of attaching equal importance to the two tasks and never wavering in either, strengthen ideological and political work, achieve success in punishing corruption, advocating honesty, and maintaining public order, and safeguard social stability. Leaders at all levels should improve work styles, intensify investigation and study, maintain close ties with the masses, guard against exaggeration, and oppose formalism. In view of the new situation, cadres at all levels should intensify the study of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the knowledge on the socialist market economy, the knowledge on modern science and technology, and the knowledge on laws. They should step up correct and comprehensive analysis of the situation and think over some major issues on theories and practice in line with reality to gain more foresight and initiative in work. When in Jilin city, Comrade He Zhukang also held a discussion on agriculture and rural work with the responsible comrades of relevant departments of the city party committee and government and inspected the development of the tertiary industry in the Tiannan Township of Jiaohe city. Participating in the investigation and study activities were Vice Governor Wei Minxue and responsible comrades of the general office, organization departments, and research office of the provincial party committee, the provincial commission for restructuring of the economy, provincial economic and trade commission, provincial finance department, Jilin Provincial bureau of the State Taxation Administration, provincial labor department, provincial industrial and commercial bank, and provincial trade union council.
