Aben] [Text] The Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), and the Metro Manila Authority (MMA) yesterday launched a program aimed at rehabilitating the diminishing marine resources of the Manila Bay, once considered among the richest fishing grounds in the world. DENR Secretary Angel Alcala, Quezon City Mayor and MMA Chairman Ismael Mathay Jr., and Las Pinas Mayor Gabriel Casimiro led national and local officials in signing a covenant to support the Coastal Environment Program (CEP). The project, which cover the 24-kilometer coast from Las Pinas to Navotas was launched at the Santo Nino [Holy Child] Island off the Coastal Road. The covenant noted the degradation of the natural resources at the Manila Bay, covering an area of about 180,000 hectares bounded by several coastal towns. The area was also covered with lush vegetation of mangrove species, including the "nilad," where the City of Manila derived its name. The covenant, however, stated that all major rivers leading to the Manila Bay, as well as its tributaries, are now heavily polluted and considered biologically dead. Among the major rivers leading to the bay are the Pasig River, Tullahan-Tenejeros River, and Paranaque-Zapote River. It also noted that garbage and refuse dumped by residents along these waterways and careless disposal of industrial wastes; and poor sewage treatment of industries contribute to water pollution in the area. The covenant likewise stated that the water pollution is aggravated by oil spills from gas stations, oil depots, barges, tankers, and several ships which also discharge their wastes into the bay. The DENR-National Capital Region (NCR), in an effort to put a stop to the further degradation of the bay, will extend assistance and other resources needed to the effective carrying out of activities that will protect and enhance the coastal environment of the Manila Bay. Alcala said that talisay, dapdap, agoho [local plant species], coconut and other trees will be planted to add to the biodiversity of the area surrounding the Manila Bay. "We will ring the coastline with mangroves," Alcala, an environmentalist and marine biologist, said. Mathay, for his part, said that the program has to be sustained because of the rapid development not only in Metro Manila but also in nearby regions that bound Manila Bay. Carlos C. Tomboc, DENR-NCR executive director said the program will aim to plant trees that will attract wildlife resources like bats, birds, and butterflies. Several Metro Manila residents, according to Mathay, do not recognize or have not yet seen the species of trees that they will plant. He said the long term goal of the program will be to establish a mangrove seashore park where wildlife species can survive and which will be called the "bio-diversity center" of Metro Manila.
