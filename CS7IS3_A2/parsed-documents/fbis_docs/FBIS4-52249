The newspaper quoted a senior U.S. official as saying that Kim clearly told Deng his country had neither the intention nor ability to develop nuclear arms during a visit to China in October 1991. Based on this pledge, China is continuing to respect North Korea's position until it can be proven that Pyongyang broke its promise. China notified South Korean President Kim Yong-sam, during his trip to Beijing last March, and the U.S. Government of Kim Il-song's nuclear promise. Beijing also informed the two nations that it would take decisive action if Pyongyang broke its promise, according to the paper. Senior Chinese leaders told President Kim Yong-sam that they opposed international sanctions against North Korea and asked Kim to understand their position, MAINICHI said. The newspaper said the Chinese emphasized to South Korea's president that "if things that impair the honor of China happen, then China will take decisive action." The paper noted that China also explained its basic position to Robert Gallucci, U.S. assistant secretary for political and military affairs, during his recent visit to China. The Chinese leaders told Gallucci that it was too early to prepare sanctions against North Korea.
