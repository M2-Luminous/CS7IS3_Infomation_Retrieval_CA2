The opposition leader left Libreville for Paris on 8 March -- officially, to take a rest and to contact friends -- after four days of violence in several Libreville districts from 21-24 February during which nine people, including two soldiers, were killed. The government had then held Father Paul Mba Abessole and his supporters responsible for the disturbances which broke out when workers embarked on a general strike called by the pro-opposition General Confederation of Free Labor Unions. Father Paul Mba Abessole, who was welcomed at the airport by over 100 supporters, made no statement on arrival.
