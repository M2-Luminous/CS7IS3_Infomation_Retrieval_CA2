We have had a peaceful year. We have gathered a good food harvest. We have moved forward along the path of economic reforms. It is sufficient to say that privatization has begun. A national currency -- the Moldovan lei -- has been introduced. I think that these are good grounds for optimism and a good starting point for the new year, 1994, on which we are placing great hopes. Especially because recently the meeting of heads of CIS states agreed on new ways toward economic integration and the creation of conditions for the normal functioning of the national economies. On behalf of the people of Moldova, I congratulate all the people of the world from my heart on the new year of 1994. I wish you all strong health, great happiness, peace, and prosperity. Happy New Year.
