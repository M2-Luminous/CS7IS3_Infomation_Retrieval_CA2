Voltaire issued this decision following a suit filed by the Central Bank of Haiti. This decision affects Citibank and Bank of Boston branches, which on 22 June notified the Central Bank governor of their decision to stop operations. After this measure was implemented, the two banks did not open their doors on 23 and 24 June. Many citizens went to the banks on those two days to try to withdrew money. Judge Voltaire maintained that these two banks cannot close their doors due to decisions made by the United States; they are subject to Haitian laws because they requested authorization to operate in Haiti. He also pointed out that their arguments do not have merit in Haiti; hence, they will have to reopen. It was reported that the Bank of Boston will open its doors on 27 June. Meanwhile, no Citibank spokesman could be located to respond to Judge Voltaire's decision. Political observers believe the U.S. objective of implementing financial sanctions to force the military regime to relinquish power has worked against the United States because an anti-American feeling prevails in Haiti. Meanwhile, operations at the Scotia Bank proceeded as normal, but many people went to this bank to withdraw money, fearing the bank might close its doors to the public.
