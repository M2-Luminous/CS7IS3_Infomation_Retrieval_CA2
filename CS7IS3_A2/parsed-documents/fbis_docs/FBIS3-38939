In a communique released on Sunday 6 February, former President of the Republic Valery Giscard d'Estaing states the following: "We are horrified and revolted by the massacre on Sarajevo's marketplace. Any further talk is now futile. Now is the time for decisions to be made. Resolution 836 of the UN Security Council dated 4 June 1993 provides us with legal means of action. We now await the urgent implementation of these decisions, consisting in an air strike against the batteries of artillery which fired on Sarajevo's marketplace." -- Mr. Longuet wants "reprisals." Republican Party President and Industry Minister Gerard Longuet on Sunday on RMC [radio station] expressed his hope that "the United Nations will authorize NATO forces to perform retaliatory strikes in order to end the massacre" in Bosnia. He added: "We cannot send troops, we cannot be present in the field and at the same time appear to condone ever-increasing displays of violence." -- Mr. Kouchner, former humanitarian action minister, regretted on Sunday at the "maison de la chimie" [convention hall], where he was attending a convention on social change, that France "should believe the blame can be evenly apportioned among everyone, as if there was not one person who is hit by a bomb and another who throws it, as if there was not on the one hand people who are dying and on the other people who are killing them. This is biased diplomacy." -- Socialist Party Leader Michel Rocard said on Sunday 6 February on 20:00 news on TF1 [television network] that it was "now absolutely necessary for our countries to call on their governments to force a ceasefire" upon the belligerents, which requires "the support of air strikes." -- The Communist Party leader Robert Hue announced on Sunday on France 2 [television network] during the "Heure de verite" ["Hour of Truth"] that his party was calling for a "large rally" in Paris on 10 February at "place de l'Opera" to call for peace in Bosnia. He added that a negotiated settlement must be found as a military solution would be "disastrous."
