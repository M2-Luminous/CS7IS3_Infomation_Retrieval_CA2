SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Pursuant to the Bureau's authorizing legislation, projects must maintain a non-political character and should be balanced and representative of the diversity of American political, social, and cultural life. ``Diversity'' should be interpreted in the broadest sense and encompass differences including but not limited to race, gender, religion, geographic location, socio-economic status, and physical challenges. Applicants are strongly encouraged to adhere to the advancement of this principle. Overview USIA is interested in proposals that further the development of federalism in Russia at the regional level through the establishment of long-term, comprehensive relationships between regional organizations/institutions in the United States and their regional counterparts in Russia. Projects should examine the roles of national and regional governments that exist in a federated system of government and focus on the tasks, responsibilities, and obligations charged to each. General program content will vary depending on the regions involved. Issues of interest might include but are not limited to: The balance of power between federal and regional governments; communication and coordination between regional and federal governments; regional economic development and management; and regional resource management and environmental policy. Projects should reflect the issues shared by the American and Russian regions. Priority will be given to projects that produce tangible, manageable results, i.e. a federalism curriculum for a Russian institute/university, development of a regional association, development of a center/institute within an existing Russian institution to study regional issues, development of Russian and American business/commercial links, etc. The Office of Citizen Exchanges is not interested in projects that are largely academic in nature (classroom lectures, structured course work, participation in existing academic courses, etc.). USIA encourages applicants to design creative projects involving non-English speaking Russians for both in-country and U.S.-based training. USIA is interested in proposals whose designs take into account the need for the continued sharing of information and ongoing training. Priority will be given to those projects which include a resident American in Russia for a duration of at least three months. Proposals that include U.S. specialists with background in Russia and some language will be given priority. Priority will also be given to those projects which demonstrate concrete results at the end of program activity (conference reports, ongoing exchanges, continued involvement of grantee organization in Russia, etc.). The goal of the program is to create working relationships between Russian and American officials in areas of mutual interest in order to form permanent professional and political partnerships between regional leaders and their respective institutions.
