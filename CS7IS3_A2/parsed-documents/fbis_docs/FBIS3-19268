To us, of course. [National Alliance leader] Gianfranco Fini is so sure of crushing his opponents from Rome that these days he is scouring the far north in an attempt to eat into the votes of Bossi, "the Attila of national politics." He makes no secret of the reason for this: If the League ends up being a minority in the center-right line up, Fini will be the one to lay down the conditions for governing. With [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi, of course, with whom he seems to be in full agreement even though he did not manifest a great deal of solidarity in the Publitalia affair. It is a victorious Fini who is speaking. You people should not be splitting hairs over the fact that there are already too many shouts of victory during these last phases of the election campaign. Yesterday the National Alliance leader was in Udine and Gorizia. As usual he laid the blame on [Northern League Secretary] Bossi, [Pact for Italy leader] Segni, and [Italian Popular Party Secretary] Martinazzoli. Then, perhaps because of the proximity of the border, he relaunched an attack on Italy's shattered rights in Istria. Japan, which is a democratic country like ours can try to get the Kuril Islands back from Russia "solely by diplomatic means," of course. Whereas Italy should not even worry about compensation for all those who were obliged to abandon Istria at the end of the war. [Pennacchi] Fini, you really do not want to let go on Italian Istria? [Fini] It is a matter of principle that must be assessed as such and that does not bring any immediate consequences. I have been thinking a great deal about his: We must look to Japan as an example. I am asking to open diplomatic talks, not war. [Pennacchi] Are you not afraid that raising the Istrian issue again could create problems with Berlusconi? [Fini] I do not think so. Even so, I could not care less if the things in which I believe create problems. This matter is entirely free of consequences, except for those who are totally in bad faith. I am laying down the problem as a whole, so that matters that can be resolved are discussed in concrete terms: the problem of the goods that were expropriated, that of safeguarding the Italian language, of maintaining cultural institutions that have been eradicated. [Pennacchi] "Attila" Bossi you said yesterday. If you continue in this way, and even if the progressives lose, you will end up being unable to govern because of too many exchanges of insults. [Fini] I have never declared war, neither am I waging one. I only feel the need to explain why an agreement was not possible in the north. [Pennacchi] Okay, but let us face it. If you win, you will have to govern together. [Fini] Everything depends on the voters, they are the ones who will establish the power relationship. If a power relationship is balanced out with the League, which is the easiest of the three, Bossi will clearly have to come off his high horse. [Pennacchi] To do this you will have to double your victory in the south. [Fini] We will have an extremely good result in the south. But even the north will give us some nice satisfaction. I went to a meeting in Arezzo where there were 5,000 people, more than Fanfani attracted in 1948. There is a revolt against the old system. National Alliance is a credible alternative. [Pennacchi] What relationship do you foresee between yourself and Berlusconi for those elected in the center-south? [Fini] Unlike the others, when I sign an accord I respect it. Therefore, I am not concerned about whether Forza Italia or National Alliance will take the lion's share. The important thing is that the pole does its utmost. [Pennacchi] Are you convinced that you will be the strongest in the south? [Fini] Yes, certainly. [Pennacchi] Your accord with Berlusconi seems perfect but you left him alone with little or no solidarity in the clash with Judge Colombo [on Fininvest investigations]. [Fini] I never generalize, I do not consider it right to say "the judicial authorities...." The magistrates are all the same. However, there are undoubtedly shortsighted magistrates who see very little when they must investigate to the left and are quite farsighted when they investigate in other directions. [Pennacchi] And as far as separating careers in the magistracy is concerned? [Fini] This is sacrosanct. There are three fundamental aspects of reform: freeing the Higher Council of the Magistracy from political party influence; abolishing automatic career advancements; and separating the careers of the judges from the public prosecutors. [Pennacchi] What will happen after the elections? [Fini] The winner will govern. Not any hypothetical body of married institutions, therefore the voters must be careful: Any vote for Segni or Martinazzoli is the photocopy of a vote for Occhetto [secretary of the Democratic Party of the Left]. [Pennacchi] So, let us return to Bossi. If you win, will you succeed in staying together? [Fini] The voters must decide who will have more power in the pole of freedoms. The ones with more power will lay down the rules for the government. And since I am convinced that it will not be Bossi, I am very, very calm.
