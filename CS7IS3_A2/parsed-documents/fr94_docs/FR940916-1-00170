FR940916-1-00170 FR940916-1-00017 §25.427 Unsymmetrical loads. (a) In designing the airplane for lateral gust, yaw maneuver and roll maneuver conditions, account must be taken of unsymmetrical loads on the empennage arising from effects such as slipstream and aerodynamic interference with the wing, vertical fin and other aerodynamic surfaces. (b) The horizontal tail must be assumed to be subjected to unsymmetrical loading conditions determined as follows: (1) 100 percent of the maximum loading from the symmetrical maneuver conditions of §25.331 and the vertical gust conditions of §25.341(a) acting separately on the surface on one side of the plane of symmetry; and (2) 80 percent of these loadings acting on the other side. (c) For empennage arrangements where the horizontal tail surfaces have dihedral angles greater than plus or minus 10 degrees, or are supported by the vertical tail surfaces, the surfaces and the supporting structure must be designed for gust velocities specified in §25.341(a) acting in any orientation at right angles to the flight path. (d) Unsymmetrical loading on the empennage arising from buffet conditions of §25.305(e) must be taken into account. 16. By amending §25.445 by changing the title and revising paragraph (a) to read as follows: §25.445 Auxiliary aerodynamic surfaces. (a) When significant, the aerodynamic influence between auxiliary aerodynamic surfaces, such as outboard fins and winglets, and their supporting aerodynamic surfaces, must be taken into account for all loading conditions including pitch, roll, and yaw maneuvers, and gusts as specified in §25.341(a) acting at any orientation at right angles to the flight path. * * * * * 17. By amending §25.571 by revising paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) to read as follows: §25.571 Damage-tolerance and fatigue evaluation of structure. * * * * * (b) *␣*␣* (2) The limit gust conditions specified in §25.341 at the specified speeds up to V C and in §25.345. (3) The limit rolling conditions specified in §25.349 and the limit unsymmetrical conditions specified in §§25.367 and 25.427 (a) through (c), at speeds up to V C . * * * * * 18. By adding a new §25.1517 to read as follows: §25.1517 Rough air speed, V RA . A rough air speed, V RA , for use as the recommended turbulence penetration airspeed in §25.1585(a)(8), must be established, which_ (1) is not greater than the design airspeed for maximum gust intensity, selected for V B ; and (2) is not less than the minimum value of V B specified in §25.335(d); and (3) is sufficiently less than V MO to ensure that likely speed variation during rough air encounters will not cause the overspeed warning to operate too frequently. In the absence of a rational investigation substantiating the use of other values, V RA must be less than V MO _35 knots (TAS). Issued in Washington, DC, on September 8, 1994. Thomas E.
