FR940426-0-00070 FR940426-0-00015 LEGAL SERVICES CORPORATION 45 CFR Part 1601 Bylaws of the Legal Services Corporation AGENCY: Legal Services Corporation. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This final rule removes the bylaws of the Legal Services Corporation (LSC or Corporation) from the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), because the bylaws are purely internal procedural rules that do not affect the rights and interests of parties outside the Corporation. EFFECTIVE DATE: April 26, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Victor M. Fortuno, General Counsel, Legal Services Corporation, 202&hyph;336&hyph;8810. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The bylaws of the Corporation were published as final at 49 FR 23050 (June 4, 1984) and amended at 50 30711 (July 29, 1985). At its meeting on April 16, 1994, the Corporation's Board of Directors (Board) determined that the Corporation's bylaws, which appear at 45 CFR part 1601, are purely internal procedural rules of the Corporation not subject to the notice and comment and/or publication requirement of the LSC Act, 42 U.S.C. 2996g(e). As the bylaws do not affect the rights and interests of parties outside the Corporation and are not regulations of the Corporation, they should not be included in the CFR. Therefore, the Board directed that the bylaws be withdrawn from the CFR. List of Subjects in 45 CFR Part 1601 Organization and functions, Seals and insignia.
