Korinek, TA SR correspondent in Washington: "Partnership for Peace a Priority; Prior to Strobe Talbott's Visit to Bratislava"] [Text] Strobe Talbott, U.S. deputy secretary of state, is the thus-far highest U.S. representative to visit independent Slovakia. What is even more important, however, is that he is the author of the Partnership for Peace project, which sets the tone of current activities and considerations concerning points of departure and solutions to European security. His visit is taking place at a time when U.S. relations with Central Europe assume, so it seems, a new dynamism. This is because the domestic political scene in Russia, on which the United States almost exclusively and, perhaps, idealistically concentrated at the beginning of the Clinton administration, has undergone substantial changes in the course of the past year. The almost conflict-free partner Russia--let us only recall the Vancouver summit--has begun to act as a power with its own foreign political interests that it wants to assert. That these need not always tally with U.S. interests is borne out by Strobe Talbott's words in the U.S. Congress that "we will cooperate with the Russians where we will be able to, and, in areas where we will not be able to cooperate, we will have to find ways of minimizing the deterioration of the problem involved and of [U.S.-Russian] relations in general." During the Cold War, the United States spent considerable efforts and resources to defeat communism. It is therefore in its interest not to squander the political capital it gained with the fall of communism. And, as the hopes pinned on Russia are becoming increasingly problematic, Central Europe, where the thrust toward Western-type democracy is much less problematic and which could also form a geographic dam against opposite tendencies, is moving into the foreground. It is therein that one must seek the roots of the intensifying dynamism of U.S. relations toward Central Europe. Partnership for Peace is not only a security issue, but also a supremely political issue. The fact that Strobe Talbott said shortly before his trip that it must be transformed from something abstract into something real and be "given practical significance, especially in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe" and that, according to his own words, precisely this will be the central issue of his talks in Bratislava and Warsaw, clearly underscored the growing importance of the Central European region in U.S. eyes. In an interview for THE WASHINGTON POST on the eve of NATO's Brussels summit, President Michal Kovac proposed a certain form of political membership in NATO for the countries of the Visegrad Four Group, an idea that he also reiterated in a recent article for the NATO REVIEW. Of course, it is scarcely possible to expect any changes to the form of Partnership [for Peace] as approved by the supreme NATO body. The United States itself says, however, that Partnership for Peace is, by its very nature, an evolutionary process. Hence, if no specific criteria [for NATO membership] are set today, and if no form of associate membership is conceded, either, it does not mean that no conditions can be established for this in the course of the Pan-European and, in particular, East European political and security development, including by the activity of partners. The United States's view of Central Europe is the view of a great power. It is no coincidence that its representatives repeatedly place emphasis on regional cooperation among members of the Visegrad Four Group. Translated into plain language, this is an evident hint that the states of the Visegrad Four Group should resolve their internal and mutual problems to such an extent that their basic stability and orientation become irreversible. When considering European security, it is easier to think in the dimensions of a 65-million bloc --one, moreover, located in a region that has always been a bone of contention in Europe--than in terms of smaller entities. The incorporation of this bloc [into Western structures] will resolve problems more fundamentally, and a bloc is also better suited to influence, by its weight, the overall climate.
