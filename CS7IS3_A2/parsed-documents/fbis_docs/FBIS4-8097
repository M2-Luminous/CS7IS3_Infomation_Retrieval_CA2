The Security Administration of the Ministry of Defense and the Military Security Sector of the 1st Corps organized the conference. Participants in the conference were addressed by Alija Izetbegovic, president of the Presidency, among others. Here is a report by Edin Muhic: [Begin recording] [Muhic] The aim of today's conference is to examine the experience so far in the work of the Military Security Service and the Military Police and to define further tasks. Among others, Rasim Delic, commander of the Headquarters of the Supreme Command of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia- Herzegovina; Defense Minister Hamdija Hadzihasanovic; and Bakir Alispahic, minister of internal affairs attended the conference and submitted reports. Jusuf Jasarevic, head of the Military Security Administration, submitted an introductory report. Jasarevic pointed out that the present security situation is much better than it was some half a year ago, and the cooperation between the Military Security Service and the Ministry of Internal Affairs is at a satisfying level. In the future, the focus will be on preventing the enemy's subversive activity and at the same time on further clearing units from criminals and other forms of law violation, Jasarevic said. Defense Minister Hamdija Hadzihasanovic spoke about the government's activity on organizing and strengthening the Army. As regards duties of the Military Security Service, Minister Hadzihasanovic said the following: [Hadzihasanovic] The main aim of the Military Security Service is to prevent the enemy from obtaining information about our forces and intentions and to make it impossible for him to undermine the moral-political unity and combat readiness of the units and to carry out espionage, sabotage, and other subversive activities in our ranks. Participants in the conference were then addressed by Alija Izetbegovic, president of the republic Presidency. From his speech, we shall single out a part dealing with the need to prevent deviant phenomena in the work of the Security Service. [Izetbegovic] In your job, you should (?compound) [word indistinct] into another component that is very important, and that is respect for man, that is, a certain humanism. Sometimes, these services may turn into, well, (?only one sharp edge), a (?sharp edge) of a sort of struggle against the enemy and are sometimes forgetting the other (?thing), that is, that they should at the same time respect the law (?well), that they should be careful. As you know, it has happened, not in our country though, but has nevertheless happened that those services escape control and sometimes do some things that are not all right and that [word indistinct] struggle against the enemy, they sometimes forget that they may sometimes trample upon or crush or squash some innocent man and so on and to be (?too severe). [words indistinct] to nourish these two things --- professionalism and humanism in your work, and the more professional you are, you shall probably be more humane as well. [Muhic] After President Izetbegovic, Army General Rasim Delic took the floor. He said that one should continue this upward trend of strengthening the system of Military Security and Military Service and added the following: [Delic] It is necessary to continue to ensure close links among organs and units that deal with security in all institutions of our society, as that is the only way to ensure unity of all factors on the protection of basic values of the system we are building and will continue building. In this respect, it is [word indistinct] for the Military Security Service to enjoy support by all those people who desire a stable democratic state and the protection of the people from all forms of endangerment of its security and (?survival). [Muhic] Let us add at the end that it was concluded at today's conference that with a view to ensuring an expert training of the cadres, such conferences should (?in future) be held at the seats of three corps of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Thereby the security actions that are already under way and those that are yet to be carried out will certainly be even more (?fearful) and deadly. [end recording]
