During the opening of the party's political office in Samos, Political Spring Deputy Nikitas Kaklamanis said characteristically: "...if we find it appropriate, or someone proposes to us, or we propose to cooperate in some municipalities, something that is among our goals, I would say it is more likely to happen with PASOK rather than New Democracy." Responding to a correspondent's question on possible cooperation between Political Spring and other political parties in the election of the president, Kaklamanis said that the institution of the presidency cannot, in any case, be part of any kind of political commercialization or exchange.
