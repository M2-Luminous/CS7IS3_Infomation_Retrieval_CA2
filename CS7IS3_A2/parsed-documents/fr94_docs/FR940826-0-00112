(1) The jurisdiction (e.g., the participating jurisdiction or state recipient) or insular area must assume responsibility for environmental review, decisionmaking, and action for each activity that it carries out with HOME funds, in accordance with the requirements imposed on a recipient under 24 CFR part 58. In accordance with 24 CFR part 58, the jurisdiction or insular area must carry out the environmental review of an activity and obtain approval of its request for release of funds before HOME funds are committed for the activity. (2) A state participating jurisdiction must also assume responsibility for approval of requests for release of HOME funds submitted by state recipients.

These policies require one-for-one replacement of low/moderate-income housing demolished or converted to another use and the provision of relocation assistance to lower income persons displaced by such conversion or by demolition. * * * * * 22. In §92.354, paragraph (a)(2) is revised to read as follows: §92.354 Labor. (a) *␣*␣* (2) The contract for construction must contain these wage provisions if HOME funds are used for any project costs (as defined in §92.206), including construction or nonconstruction costs, of housing with 12 or more HOME-assisted units. When HOME funds are only used to assist homebuyers to acquire single-family housing, and not for any other project costs, the wage provisions apply to the construction of the housing if there is a written agreement with the owner or developer of the housing that HOME funds will be used to assist homebuyers to buy the housing and the construction contract covers 12 or more housing units to be purchased with HOME assistance. The wage provisions apply to any construction contract that includes a total of 12 or more HOME-assisted units, whether one or more than one project is covered by the construction contract. Once they are determined to be applicable, the wage provisions must be contained in the construction contract so as to cover all laborers and mechanics employed in the development of the entire project, including portions other than the assisted units. Arranging multiple construction contracts within a single project for the purpose of avoiding the wage provisions is not permitted. * * * * * 23. Section 92.633 is revised to read as follows: §92.633 Environmental review.

In accordance with 24 CFR part 58, the Indian tribe must carry out the environmental review of an activity and obtain approval of its request for release of funds before HOME funds are committed for the activity.
