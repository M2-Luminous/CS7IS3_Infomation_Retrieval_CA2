He reported in particular that an important conference is to be held next week with the government leadership in order to analyze the process of economic reform and identify weak points in it. The president had collected a number of sharp criticisms of and even complaints against the government, the press secretary reported. He he had already expressed these in a six-hour discussion with the prime minister a few days ago and now intended to obtain answers to the questions he had raised. Rumors about an imminent radical government reshuffle, in particular about the resignation of A. Chubays, were refuted. Rumors circulated by certain mass media about the imminent resignation of Presidential Administration Head S. Filatov were also resolutely refuted. The president places a high value on the results of the signing of the Treaty on Social Accord, V. Kostikov said, which made it clear that political forces which advocate civil peace undoubtedly can prevail over the forces of confrontation and political revenge. The events of 1 and 9 May have shown that the forces of the hardline opposition are extremely insignificant. The degree of animosity and the "verbal extremes" to which certain leaders have resorted testify that they have no public support and their tactics can increasingly be compared with those of the Bolsheviks. Naturally this does not mean that the president cannot see the danger of political extremism. The tactics of bombing and arson always lead to destabilization. But the president believes that the extreme opposition's hopes of revenge are illusory. Russia is already learning to distinguish politicians from political buffoons. As for the moderate, constructive opposition, normal discussions will be conducted with it. A number of meetings with factions have been scheduled. As far as relations with the State Duma are concerned, the president assesses them as favorable and is prepared for compromises in the spirit of accord, as he has in fact demonstrated by signing the Law on the Status of Deputies. At the same time, he cannot fail to see the trial balloons intended to test the president's tolerance. Some effort by the State Duma to interfere in matters that are the executive's prerogative can be observed. Here, V. Kostikov said, we need not cherish any illusions: The president will not tolerate any changes in the division of power which is enshrined in the Constitution. This is not a threat, V. Kostikov stressed, but a statement of the political experience which the president has gained from the events preceding October 1993. Answering journalists' questions, the press secretary reported that when the president made the decision to relieve S. Shakhray of his ministerial post he was proceeding on the basis of the idea that he should concentrate his efforts on coordinating the numerous areas of political work already under his control as vice premier -- which is why his resignation from that post was not accepted. At the same time, V. Kostikov said, he had instructions from the president to comment on S. Shakhray's style of work, in particular his tendency to accumulate too many posts and thus reduces the benefit accruing in his work. Furthermore, distressing observations have been made that S. Shakhray's personal political calculations for the future will never accord with the interests of Russia's stabilization. In answer to a question about the prospects of stabilizing the situation in the North Caucasus, V. Kostikov did not rule out the possibility of B. Yeltsin's meeting with D. Dudayev.
