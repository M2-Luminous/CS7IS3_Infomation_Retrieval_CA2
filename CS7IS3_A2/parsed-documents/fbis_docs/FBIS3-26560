Zhu, member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, praised Sichuan for its achievements in various sectors and its efforts to properly handle the relations between the reforms, development and stability. On January 6, Zhu paid a visit to the Chongqing No.1 Textile Mill, where he called a meeting of nine enterprises in difficulty to discuss with them how to end their plight. Zhu Rongji said that the establishment of a modern enterprise system required that the government kept its hands off enterprises, allowing them to enjoy decision-making powers and managers to bear full responsibility for their decisions. He said that for enterprises which continually suffer losses and cannot pay their debts, an experimental bankruptcy policy can be applied so as to reorganize them. He also stressed the importance of reforming the social security system so that the enterprises can smoothly transform their system and maintain stability. He urged managers and directors to overcome their difficulties mainly on their own by developing new products and studying the market, improving management and transforming the operational system. He called on them to show more concern for the living of their employees.
