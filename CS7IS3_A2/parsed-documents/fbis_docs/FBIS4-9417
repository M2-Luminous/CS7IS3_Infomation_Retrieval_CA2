He said: We should understand Polish democracy as a democracy of compromise and not of conflict, as many of the president's advisers put it. The SdRP can be one of the authors of the new constitution. We must fight for economic development. It is inadmissable for left-wing governments to be associated with inflation and to lead to economic chaos. Kwasniewski acknowledged that a positive aspect of the government coalition's activity had been the breaking of the stereotype that the coalition's creation would mean a departure from reforms and that it would continue Poland's international isolation. The government has been successful, according to the SdRP leader's assessment, in building a market economy, where economic actions are not isolated from social processes. In the campaign before the local self-government elections and the struggle for authorship of the reforms, Kwasniewski expects the SdRP to be attacked by both the right wing and the central-liberal groupings, as well as by the media, whose attention is focused on the weaknesses and setbacks of his party.
