"Since we started implementing macroeconomic adjustment and controls last year it has become apparent that the position of governor of China's central bank is not a popular post," Zhu told reporters at Beijing Airport before leaving on a nine-day visit to Japan. "There are not many people who want the post of governor of the Central Bank of China, so I have to continue to work in this capacity," he said. Zhu, who is seen as the main architect of China's far-reaching economic reform, has been the center of rumors that he would give up his banking post after next month's session of the National People's Congress, or China's legislature. "As a matter of fact the work of the central bank is now the responsibility of vice governors like Zhou Zhengqing and Wu Xiangwen... My function is only one of a shield and it seems that I'll continue to play this role," he said. Zhu also dismissed reports that recent macroeconomic controls were failing and the economy was in danger of overheating, while reiterating that this year's growth rate would be around 9 percent and could rise in the future. "At present the economic growth rate is rather high. That is because judging from the economic realities in China, we do not want to see big ups and downs," he said. "Therefore what we want is to keep a speed that is sustainable and healthy. If the speed is brought down quickly, artificially, that will lead to social instability," he said. Zhu also dismissed worries over the tightening and relaxing of controls over the money supply, saying the intensification of such controls would depend on the "realities of the national economy."
