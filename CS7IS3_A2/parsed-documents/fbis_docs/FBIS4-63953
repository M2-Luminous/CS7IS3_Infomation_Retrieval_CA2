In a speech in Kiev late on Tuesday [24 May], he called for the adoption of one sweeping act to settle differences between Ukraine and Crimea. Tsekov believes that the current tension follows not only Simferopol's recent decisions, but also a string of inconsistent political moves towards Crimea over the past 18 months. He said that under the Republic's constitution of 6 May 1992, Crimea is part of Ukraine and "that's all there is to it." Parliamentary delegations on both sides ended talks in Kiev late on Tuesday by deciding to offer their legislatures to set up a joint working group to iron out differences. In the meantime, a Ukrainian parliamentary commission has given the Crimean parliament three more days in which to repeal its resolution of last Friday to restore the Republic's 1992 Constitution.
