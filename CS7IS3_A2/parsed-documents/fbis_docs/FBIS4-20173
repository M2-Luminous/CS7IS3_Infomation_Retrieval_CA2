With voting figures of 16 for and 2 against, the party executive yesterday decided to urge the party's extraordinary congress to say yes. At the same time Center Party leader Olof Johansson wants nothing to do with party whips. Everyone must be able to vote in line with the conclusions they have reached. Olof Johansson has also backed away from his earlier position: that he, as party leader, should lead the campaign to promote the line adopted by the party congress. He is now unwilling to answer the question of what he will do if the Center Party's extraordinary congress says no to the EU. "I do not want to speculate about what will happen if the congress says no. The power lies with the congress," Olof Johansson said. He reiterated what he has been saying recently: He believes that things are inclining toward a yes at the Center Party extraordinary congress. Why then has he avoided making his position clear for so long? "This is a process. I did not want to give any indications until the Center Party's district meetings had reached their decisions. Now they have done so. I am part of a popular movement and reach my decisions as part of a popular movement," Olof Johansson said. Once upon a time Olof Johansson said no to the EEC, as the EU was once called, because it was not pan-European enough. "But I have undergone a change over the last 30 years, and Europe has too," Olof Johansson said yesterday. The reason why the party executive is now saying yes is because it wants to be involved in influencing policy in Europe. But the Center Party does not agree with everything which is being planned in the EU. "I do not believe in a common currency and central bank," Olof Johansson said. He does not want monetary union. And Sweden must not give up more self-determination than necessary. Center Party deputy chairman Andreas Carlgren said that the Center Party is a broad church. "We are able to show that we have divergent views of the question," said Carlgren, who thinks that the Center Party has handled the EU question more democratically than other parties.
