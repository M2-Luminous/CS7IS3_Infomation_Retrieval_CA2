The document urged localities and management departments of foreign-funded enterprises at all levels to complete, within a specific time, the work of forming basic-level party organizations in foreign-funded enterprises, in particular, wholly foreign-owned [wai shang du zi 1120 0794 3747 6327] enterprises, and ordered them to take measures to ensure party membership among the employees of wholly foreign-owned enterprises. It is Difficult to Form Party Organizations in Wholly Foreign Owned Enterprises The findings report of the Organization Department, which was approved and transmitted by the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee with a note, states: In recent years, the Central Committee has repeatedly transmitted to lower levels special documents complete with several specific requirements on how to strengthen the building of party organizations in foreign-invested [san zi 0005 6327] enterprises. Before and after the party's 14th National Congress, several principal central leading comrades specially made clear instructions on the issue. In terms of their implementation, so long as the local party organizational departments and the party organizations in the foreign-funded enterprises management departments attach adequate importance to the issue, the formation of basic-level party organizations in Sino-foreign cooperative and joint-venture enterprises will progress quite smoothly, and in some of them, the basic-level organizations of the Chinese Youth League have been set up or revived. A considerable number of newly formed, revived, or strengthened basic-level party organizations in Sino-foreign cooperative and joint-venture enterprises have begun conducting normal organizational activities and organized their members to play a relatively good role in political leadership. However, in wholly foreign-owned enterprises (including enterprises wholly owned by Hong Kong and Taiwan businessmen, the same below), the building of basic-level party organizations has been all along seriously hampered. According to the statistics provided by the foreign-funded enterprise management departments from 16 large and mid-sized cities throughout the country, including the three municipalities directly under the central government, by October this year (1993), approximately 70 percent of the wholly foreign-owned enterprises had not yet even had party groups set up. Foreign Businessmen Resist the Communist Party's Infiltration Into Employees Ranks After gathering the reports from various localities, the survey personnel of the Central Organization Department held that the reasons behind this state of affairs were as follows: 1. In Sino-foreign cooperative or joint-venture enterprises, in particular in such enterprises based on former state-owned enterprises as the Chinese side, among the legal-person representatives and managerial personnel of the Chinese side there is a certain proportion of Communist Party members. After enterprise merging, among the former staff members and workers of the cooperative enterprises there are still more or fewer party members. However, in the wholly owned enterprises of the foreign side, there is no Chinese representation at all. Of the employees newly recruited by the enterprises of this type after having themselves registered and starting operation, the proportion of party members was very meager, and many did not even employ any party members at all. In the absence of party members, building basic-level party organizations is out of the question. 2. When recruiting employees, the bosses of foreign-funded enterprises make every effort to prevent the Communist Party members from "penetrating" the ranks of employees by using various means and excuses, erecting barriers in depth, and setting up defenses at every step. In an extreme case, when a foreign businessman found out that there were Communist Party members among his employees, he dismissed them by inventing all sorts of excuses. 3. When recommending employees to management, foreign-funded enterprise management departments in various localities do not give full consideration in advance to the proportion of party members in the name lists of their candidates. Some of them even refuse to recommend party members to work in wholly foreign-owned enterprises in compliance with management's unreasonable demands. The Central Organization Department has received reports from such cities as Shanghai, Guangzhou, Fuzhou, and Kunming which showed that the problems revealed were extremely serious and even had reached intolerable proportions. For example, in order to smoothly get a job in wholly foreign-owned enterprises, some Communist Party members went so far as to go through quit-the-party procedures with their work units beforehand; some local foreign-funded enterprise management departments asked party-member candidates recommended to work in foreign-funded enterprises to withhold their party membership from management; when recommending technicians to management, apart from putting in a good word for them about their professional competence and moral quality, some foreign-funded enterprise management departments went so far as to specially announce that these people "are not members of the CPC"; and moreover, when recruiting employees for wholly foreign-owned enterprises, some foreign-funded enterprise management departments openly professed that "party members are not to be employed" and "no consideration will be given to members of the CPC." The Organizations of the CPC are Underground Party Organizations in Foreign-Funded Enterprises The findings report says: Because of the reasons mentioned above, there is no way to build basic-level party organizations in most wholly foreign-owned enterprises, and it is very difficult for basic-level party organizations which are already set up in such enterprises to carry out their normal activities. In the last two years, the Central Organization Department has received letters from some party members working in wholly foreign-owned enterprises, reporting that once their membership in the Communist Party was exposed, this meant endless trouble for them. Therefore, in their letters they asked if the party and government had any official documents and decrees or laws and regulations to ensure that Communist Party members are not discriminated against and their organizational activities are "legalized" in foreign-funded enterprises. In a letter to the Central Organization Department, a Communist Party member who worked in a foreign-funded enterprise said grumblingly: After working in foreign-funded enterprises, innumerable obstacles were put up and discrimination was applied against us just because we were Communist Party members. This made us naturally associate with the difficulties, hardships, and risks which underground party organizations encountered and endured in the party's history of struggle while working in the "enemy-occupied areas." The "note" attached by the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee to the findings report states: In the territory of the People's Republic of China where the Communist Party is a ruling party, it is right and proper for the Communist Party to set up organizations at the basic level and its members to carry out their organizational activities. However, in foreign-funded enterprises, unexpectedly there was the problem of whether the Communist Party is "legal" or not, and also unexpectedly, Communist Party members working in such enterprises poured out their demand to higher organizations and even the central organization of the party that they "hope to become just and honorable Communist Party members." This cannot but attract the great attention of the Party Central Committee and local organizations at all levels. Party Organizations Should Be Set Up in Foreign-Funded Enterprises Within a Specific Time According to the findings report, the plan worked out by the Organization Department of the CPC Central Committee to "complete the work of building basic-level party organizations in all foreign-funded enterprises within the specific time" was approved by the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee. The plan stipulates, in principle, that party committees of various localities should strengthen political leadership and offer better work guidance to basic-level party organizations in wholly foreign-owned enterprises which hire more than 100 employees in our country and ensure that the party organizations can carry out their normal activities on schedule so that they will be genuinely able to play the role of a fighting force. As far as such enterprises where no basic-level party organization have been set up so far are concerned, the local foreign-funded enterprise departments in charge of the enterprises must set about to find out the real political conditions of enterprise employees, and if there are already three or more party members in their ranks, urge them to set up a party group or branch as quickly as possible and carry out organizational activities on time. In an enterprise whose party membership is large enough to set up several party branches, a general party branch or a higher party working committee should be correspondingly set up to give unified leadership to the party branches. What remedial measures should be adopted in the days to come to deal with the case in which a foreign-funded enterprise's employee ranks, there are just one or two or not any party members? The Central Committee is studying ways to solve the problem. Trade Unions in Foreign-Funded Enterprises Must be Put Under the Leadership of the Communist Party The instruction of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee also states: The emergence of this new thing--foreign-invested enterprises--has really brought enormous results to China's economy. Nevertheless, as the number of such enterprises is increasingly expanding, the resulting problems cannot but attract the great attention of our party and government. At present the most pronounced problem with foreign-invested enterprises is the contradiction between management and labor. In some enterprises, disregarding China's laws, regulations, and decrees, some management personnel encroached upon the employees' legitimate rights and interests as they liked and even ignored the safety of the latter's lives. Therefore, the party, the government, and the Chinese employees in foreign-invested enterprises must have a full understanding of the importance and urgency of setting up trade union organizations in foreign-invested enterprises. However, like the trade union organizations in state-owned enterprises, the trade unions in foreign-invested enterprises must be put strictly under party leadership. In a foreign-invested enterprise, in particular a wholly foreign-owned enterprise, where there is no basic-level party organization and not even a single party member among the Chinese employees, how does the trade union, once established in such enterprise, accept party leadership? Before the transmission of a new relevant document by the Central Committee, the organization departments of party committees of various localities and the party working committees of foreign-funded enterprise management departments should adopt some positive remedial measures with regard to the foreign-funded enterprises where no party members are found in employee ranks. According to statistics, in all Sino-foreign cooperative and joint-venture enterprises, cases in which there are no party members in the Chinese management personnel and employees are very rare. It is relatively easier to solve this problem--sending party members to go in. However, this method of forcibly sending party members to go in should not be adopted in regard to the wholly foreign-owned enterprises where there are no party members among the Chinese management personnel and employees hired. The relatively stable and safe method to take is for the party working committees of foreign-funded enterprise management departments to lead their subordinate personnel management institutions to look for a number of candidates who are professionally competent and trusted by management in their work and give them guidance so that they will actively make progress politically, and promptly admit them into the party as conditions are ripe. Foreign Businessmen Should Be Prevented From "Illegal" Hiring of Labor While approving the transmission of the findings report of the Central Organization Department, the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee stated: Seeing the very grim situation recently in which in the course of their formation and operations, foreign-invested enterprises, in particular wholly foreign-owned enterprises, hired "illegal [hei 7815] employees" without permission by bypassing our relevant management institutions, thus causing a direct drop in the proportion of party members in foreign-funded enterprises' employee ranks, the Central Secretariat has suggested that the government take some practical and effective measures to prevent the abovementioned phenomenon from continuing to spread. The specific methods to be taken are that relevant government departments formulate clear laws and regulations and give appropriate punishment to the foreign-funded enterprises which hired "illegal employees" without the permission of our management institutions, personnel management fees collected from foreign-funded enterprises by management departments should be reduced appropriately, and a stipulation should be made that while recommending qualified people to foreign-funded enterprises, management departments should ensure high quality to win trustworthiness. The Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee maintained: So long as the phenomenon in which foreign-funded enterprise hire "illegal employees" from among unemployed persons in society is checked and the employees of wholly foreign-owned enterprises are all recruited through the recommendation of the Chinese side, it will be possible to ensure that Communist Party members will make up a certain portion of employees of these enterprises.
