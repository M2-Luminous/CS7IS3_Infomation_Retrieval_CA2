FR940304-0-00079 FR940304-0-00019 General comments received in response to the 1976 proposal are summarized in an April 26, 1978, Federal Register publication (43 FR 17909). In 1978, amendments to the Act required that all proposals over 2 years old be withdrawn. A 1-year grace period was given to proposals already over 2 years old. On December 10, 1979, the Service published a notice in the Federal Register (44 FR 70796) withdrawing the portion of the June 16, 1976, proposal that had not been made final, along with four other proposals that had expired. The Service published updated notices of review for plants on December 15, 1980 (45 FR 82480), September 27, 1985 (50 FR 39526), and February 21, 1990 (55 FR 6184). In these notices, 10 of the taxa (including synonymous taxa) that had been proposed as endangered in the June 16, 1976, proposed rule were treated as Category 1 candidates for Federal listing. Category 1 taxa are those for which the Service has on file substantial information on biological vulnerability and threats to support preparation of listing proposals. Clermontia lindseyana, Clermontia pyrularia, Colubrina oppositifolia, Cyanea shipmanii, Hesperocnide sandwicensis, Ischaemum byrone, Nothocestrum breviflorum, Portulaca sclerocarpa, and Zanthoxylum hawaiiense, which were proposed as endangered in the June 16, 1976, proposed rule, were considered Category 1 candidates on all three notices of review; Cyanea hamatiflora ssp. carlsonii was considered a Category 1 taxon as Cyanea carlsonii in the 1980 and 1985 notices and as Cyanea hamatiflora ssp. carlsonii in the 1990 notice. Cyanea stictophylla and Silene hawaiiensis were considered Category 1 species in all three notices. In the 1980 and 1985 notices, Isodendrion pyrifolium and Tetramolopium arenarium were considered Category 1* species. In the 1990 notice, these two species were accorded Category 3A status, but because new information regarding their existence has become available, they were proposed in 1992 for listing. Category 1* taxa are those which are possibly extinct, and Category 3A taxa are those for which the Service has persuasive evidence of extinction. Cyrtandra giffardii appeared as a Category 2 species and Clermontia peleana as a Category 3C species in the 1980 and 1985 notices. Ochrosia kilaueaensis first appeared as a Category 2 species in the 1985 notice. Category 2 taxa are those for which there is some evidence of vulnerability, but for which there are not enough data to support listing proposals at the time. Category 3C taxa are those which are more abundant than previously believed, and/or those that are not subject to any identifiable threat. Because new information provided support for listing, the above three species were conferred Category 1 status in the 1990 notice. The Service recognized Cyanea copelandii ssp. copelandii, Cyrtandra tintinnabula, Mariscus fauriei, Plantago hawaiensis, and Pritchardia affinis as Category 1 taxa for the first time in the 1990 notice. Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Act requires the Secretary to make findings on petitions that present substantial information indicating that the petitioned action may be warranted within 12 months of their receipt. Section 2(b)(1) of the 1982 amendments further requires all petitions pending on October 13, 1982, be treated as having been newly submitted on that date. On October 13, 1983, the Service found that the petitioned listing of these taxa was warranted, but precluded by other pending listing actions, in accordance with section 4(b)(3)(B)(iii) of the Act; notification of this finding was published on January 20, 1984 (49 FR 2485). Such a finding requires the Service to consider the petition as having been resubmitted, pursuant to section 4(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Act. The finding was reviewed in October of 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, and 1991. Publication of the proposed rule constituted the final 1-year finding for these taxa.
