[Sihanouk] Please come in. [Words indistinct] [laughter]. [(Li Bun)] We would like to thank Your Majesty for kindly granting us an interview despite your being very busy. We are very happy to see that Your Majesty is healthier and stronger. This is a source of pride for all Cambodian and Chinese people. [Sihanouk] Thank you very much. I am this healthy because of the great benevolence of the PRC and all the ladies and gentlemen -- male and female doctors and nurses -- who are giving me the care and medical treatment to relieve me from my illnesses, which include cancer. It is also thanks to the great friendship and considerable scientific knowledge of the Chinese doctors and nurses who have given me the treatments on behalf of the great Chinese people, the Communist Party of China, His Excellency [H.E.] President Jiang Zemin, and the PRC Government. For several months they have worked day and night to enable me to live longer for the sake of the sublime interest of the Cambodian nation and people, and so that I will be able to continue serving the correct cause of eternal and immortal friendship and fraternity between our two countries. We are fraternal countries which will always have great friendship, fraternity, and solidarity. Thank you. [(Li Bun)] We believe that Your Majesty will have perfect health and a very long life. [Sihanouk] Thank you very much for your great friendship and respect for me. [(Li Bun)] I would like to beg permission to ask some questions. China and Cambodia have a long-standing bond of traditional friendship, especially since the Bandung Conference in 1955, under the joint efforts of Your Majesty and the Chinese leaders of all generations. The friendship between the two countries has been continuously enhanced and tested in all circumstances. What is your opinion concerning the basis for promoting the fraternal, friendly relations between the two countries and the future of this relationship between the two countries? Thank you. [(Li Bun)] H.E. President Jiang Zemin has given a grand welcome for the official state visit I paid this week in the most glorious PRC, which is the greatest, most sincere, and oldest friend of our Cambodian people and nation. H.E. Jiang Zemin recalled that history shows that our two countries have established a bridge of friendship since time immemorial. In the Angkor era, the greatest era in Cambodia's history, there was close contact between our two peoples and nations. In the Angkor era, the Chinese philosopher Chou Ta-kuan paid a courtesy call on the Cambodian king and had close contact with the Cambodian people and stayed with them for a long time. He wrote to inform the Chinese people about Cambodian history, life and traditions of the Cambodian people and nation in that era. Later, I and H.E. Zhou Enlai reestablished the friendship as it was in the past. After the Bandung Conference, I had the great honor to pay an official state visit to the great Chinese state of the PRC. I had the great honor to call on H.E. Chairman Mao Zedong, and our friendship and cooperation has strengthened since then. The PRC has given us so much help. We support one another in the international arena. In Cambodia's national reconstruction, the PRC has helped us all along in this effort, thus enabling our country to become very prosperous during the Sangkum Reas Niyum era, that is from 1955 to 1969. H.E. President Liu Shaoqi, H.E. Premier Zhou Enlai, H.E. Marshal Chen Yi, and H.E. Chairman Li Xiannian went personally to Cambodia to give us cooperation and assistance. Later, H.E. Deng Xiaoping, the esteemed chairman, H.E. President Jiang Zemin, H.E. Premier Li Peng; H.E. Chairman Qiao Shi, and others have performed excellently in continuing the good traditions of friendship and cooperation with me and the Cambodian government. The PRC has helped us regain national reconciliation and security through the Paris Conference on Peace in Cambodia held in 1991. China has played a big role in that effort. Within the framework of the UNTAC [UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia], China also played a big role in helping Cambodia to achieve national reconciliation, peace, and the possibilities of rebuilding the nation. The Chinese people and nation have helped us in the national reconstruction to enable us to enjoy peace and prosperity following over two decades of war and misery. Throughout our life and the history of Cambodia, we will never forget this contribution of the PRC. We will always respect the PRC, which has made great contributions to us. Therefore, the basis of our friendship is the fact that we know each other very well and respect each another like real brothers. The many Chinese people who have had family ties to Cambodia since time immemorial and those Cambodians with Chinese blood represent another good bridge of friendship that has always bound our two countries together. The common ideals of justice, progress, freedom, independence, and mutual trust -- the correct ideals for all mankind -- are the basis for what has always bound us together. Another point is China's concern for the fate of Cambodia; they view it as the fate of the Chinese nation. China has always wanted Cambodia to enjoy prosperity and live forever with its independence and territorial integrity. We regard great China as our second motherland; that is, we love China wholeheartedly. We love each other without seeking to gain any personal benefit from each other; that is, we are honest with each other and are determined to defend our common ideals in the international arena and contribute to world peace and the development of various countries. These are the major principles and the main basis that will always bind our countries together as great friends and brothers and will help to strengthen our cooperation and solidarity. [(Li Bun)] [Words indistinct] the outcome of your visit? [Sihanouk] First is the enhancement and consolidation of the basis for the traditional bonds of friendship and solidarity between our two countries, peoples, and nations, and between the leaders and governments of our two countries -- the PRC and the Kingdom of Cambodia. We decided to cooperate in all fields based on the ideals of friendship, fraternity, mutual trust, and mutual interest in defending our common ideals in the world. Second, China -- that is, the respected PRC -- wants to honor me as a longstanding and faithful friend of nearly 40 years. In other words, because the Cambodian nation and people restored me as king of Cambodia, the PRC wants to express its highest consideration to the Cambodian king to show that it supports the Cambodian king for his loyal service to the nation. This service will enable Cambodia to achieve all the noble [words indistinct] peace, independence, and territorial integrity. Third, the PRC today -- as in the past; since the 1950's and 1960's -- wants to show its sincere desire to help Cambodia. It wants to help so that Cambodia can enjoy peace and prosperity through national reconstruction. The PRC has given Cambodia aid. When the two Cambodian prime ministers paid an official visit recently at the amiable invitation of H.E. Premier Li Peng, the PRC gave an additional sum of aid to the Cambodian nation. H.E. Jiang Zemin has said the PRC will continue to help us. Finally is the knowledge that the Cambodian delegation and I... [pauses] Cambodia has learned from the overall prosperity the PRC has accomplished under the leadership of H.E. Chairman Deng Xiaoping, H.E. President Jiang Zemin, and the CPC. They have set a good example for the Third World -- including Cambodia -- on how to carry out reforms and modernization; how to make contact with the outside world; how to build and make the country prosperous; and especially how to make progesss in the fields of the economy, industry, public works, justice, and so on. The progress the PRC has made over the past few years (?is an encouragement to) Cambodia and people around the world. It is a big lesson for us. I was greatly encouraged by the leaders of the Chinese nation and people; that is, H.E. President Jiang Zemin, H.E. Premier Li Peng, and H.E. NPC [National People's Congress] Chairman Qiao Shi. They met with me and said on behalf of the PRC that they support (?King) Sihanouk in his efforts to seek a basis for building the nation and making it prosper quickly. That basis is peace; that basis is to achieve national reconciliation, solve national problems, end the war, institute a cease-fire, and settle all disputes and conflicts between the Royal Government of Cambodia and the Party of Democratic Kampuchea through peaceful means. We must only use peaceful means. Their excellencies the PRC leaders and I are of the same opinion and views; 100 percent. This is a great encouragement to me. I feel greatly encouraged by the PRC leaders, who share my view that this matter must be resolved quickly so that the time for national construction is not wasted. We must only use peaceful means. It is a [words indistinct] I highly value my intimate and fraternal conversations with H.E. President Jiang Zemin, H.E. Premier Li Peng, and H.E. NPC Chairman Qiao Shi. Thank you. [(Li Bun)] [Question indistinct] [Sihanouk] I think that this reply will be in accordance with the desire to know. [(Li Bun)] Your Majesty, we at the international radio have enjoyed the support and encouragement of Your Majesty and the Cambodian people. This has encouraged us to continue striving to serve the friendship between Cambodia and China. [Sihanouk] I would like to take this auspicious occasion to express my respect, admiration, commendation, and gratitude to our Chinese brothers and sisters in the national radio, television, and press sectors who have given us immense support. This is because the PRC's radio, television, and press have genuine might and prestige in the national and international arenas. They have helped to disseminate information -- not only inside great China but also in the international arena -- on the Cambodian situation; developments, problems, and the efforts of the Cambodian people and nation toward national construction and defense. They have helped the international community come to know and understand us well. Therefore, I would like to express my heartfelt and deep respect, commendation, and gratitude to all our Chinese friends -- brothers and sisters -- who are members of the PRC's national radio, press, and television. Thank you. [(Li Bun)] Thank you.
