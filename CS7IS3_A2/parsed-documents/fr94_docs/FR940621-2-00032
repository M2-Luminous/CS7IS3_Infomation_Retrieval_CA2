FR940621-2-00032 FR940621-2-00022 Golden Field Office; Grant Award to Tufts University AGENCY: Department of Energy. ACTION: Notice of Noncompetitive Financial Assistance Award. SUMMARY: The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), pursuant to the DOE Financial Assistance Rules, 10 CFR 600.7, is announcing its intention to award a grant to Tufts University for continuing research efforts in support of the DOE Office for Building Technologies programs. Tufts' lab-scale research on electrochromic devices will help advance the goal of developing viable electrochromic windows for building applications. ADDRESSES: Questions regarding this announcement may be addressed to the U.S. Department of Energy, Golden Field Office, 1617 Cole Blvd., Golden, Colorado 80401, Attention: Louise Urgo, Contract Specialist. The Contracting Officer is John W. Meeker. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The proposed basic research will contribute to the DOE mission by identifying and solving the materials and optics problems associated with developing practical electrochromic windows for electrical control of radiant energy transfer in building and vehicle windows. Successful completion of this research would advance the goal of commercialization of electrochromic window technology. Deploying this window technology will reduce energy use in buildings which, in the U.S., accounts for about 40% of annual national energy consumption. Approximately one-sixth of that energy is wasted by unwanted radiation transfer through windows. DOE has performed a review in accordance with 10 CFR 600.7 and has determined that the activity to be funded is necessary to satisfactorily complete the current research. DOE funding for the Grant is estimated at $238,947 and the anticipated period of performance is twelve (12) months. Tufts will share in the grant in the amount of $110,785. Dated: June 10, 1994.
