Simeon pointed out in a PRENSA LATINA interview that with the GATT agreements and free trade, most products of most Latin American countries are not competitive. Simon added: To be able to compete, there must be scientific and technological support, which Latin America does not have. She went on to say that was the issue that dominated three days of debates on scientific development during the meeting of scientific, technological, and investigative officials in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia. The meeting ended on 3 June with a number of recommendations to the Ibero-American heads of state and government.
