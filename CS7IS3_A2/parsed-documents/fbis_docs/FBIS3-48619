The government chief negotiator Manuel Yan describes the signing of the document as an encouraging development for the peace process. Under the guidelines of the cease-fire accord, the government and the MNLF must identify the location and unit commanders of the respective forces. It has been agreed that the forces of both sides shall remain in their respective places and refrain from any provocative action. The cease-fire document will be sent to Jakarta for the signature of the OIC [ICO -- Islamic Conference Organization] chairman, Ministerial Committee of Six. It will then go to Jeddah, where the OIC secretary general will sign the document. Despite the cease-fire, however, government forces still have to cope with the presence of so-called MNLF "Lost Command" rebels. The other day, five police troopers were wounded in a series of clashes with renegade MNLF rebels in Basilan. The encounter occurred as DILG [Department of Interior and Local Government] Secretary Rafael Alunan III stressed that the operations in Basilan are purely police movements and not military offensives. The [word indistinct] military and police forces, Alunan says, are going after criminal elements engaged in piracy, murder, and kidnapping. The secretary also says the operations should not be viewed as a violation of the cease-fire agreement.
