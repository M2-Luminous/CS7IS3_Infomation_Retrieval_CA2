Rong Yiren inspected Shandong and investigated the problems of large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises there from 19 to 26 May. During the inspection tour, he was accompanied separately by Jiang Chunyun, member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and secretary of the Shandong Provincial CPC Committee; Li Chunting, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee and vice governor of Shandong Province; and Han Xikai, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee. He thoroughly familiarized himself with the situation of a dozen or so enterprises in seven cities, including the Jinan Light Motorcycle General Plant, the Qilu Petrochemical Corporation, and the Yantai Beijixing Watch General Plant. He also inspected the economic and technological development zones in Yantai and Weihai. He fully affirmed the efforts and exploration made by Shandong with respect to improving large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, and was satisfied with Shandong's achievements in this regard. The present overall situation of large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises in Shandong is better than last year, though some of them still have difficulties. In the first four months of this year, the total output value of large and medium-sized enterprises in the province rose 15 percent over the same period of last year, while their combined total of profit delivery and tax payment increased by more than 20 percent. Rong Yiren pointed out: Village and town enterprises have developed very rapidly and contributed to rural prosperity and stability and to the economy as a whole in recent years. Relatively speaking, large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises have been slower in development and suffering many difficulties. We should know that if large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises are in poor condition and fail to play a leading role in the economy, village and town enterprises will be unable to maintain a sustained and healthy development. It is understandable that the plant directors or managers of some large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises are feeling the pressure of difficulties. The promotion of the socialist market economy at present is providing large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises with a very good opportunity for development. Large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises have the edge in qualified personnel, technology, and equipment. Some successful enterprises among them have set an example. I believe that the cadres, workers, and staff members of large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises are full of confidence and they will work hard to make progress. Rong Yiren emphatically pointed out: In order to improve large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, we should take the road of reform to establish a modern enterprise system; we should carry out coordinated reforms of the hiring, income distribution, cadre, and other systems of the enterprises to build a good mechanism which conforms to the socialist market economy and fully arouses the enthusiasm of cadres and workers for production; we should seriously change the mode of operation of the planned economy and make great efforts to develop marketable products of good quality, great variety, and low cost according to market demand, and to eliminate inferior, outmoded products promptly; we should establish the notion of large-scale cooperation and abandon the practice of making an enterprise all-embracing regardless of its size; and while keeping to a main line of production, an enterprise should also engage in diversified undertakings, and in this way, it will widen its market and help resettle the surplus personnel resulting from streamlining. Of course, we should not do things beyond our reach, otherwise we will accomplish nothing. During the inspection tour, Rong Yiren showed great concern about and emphasized the scientific and technological progress of enterprises. He said: Large enterprises should have their own scientific research institutes, if conditions permit; this is the way to accelerate the updating of products, increase the scientific and technological contents of products, and enhance competitive power in the market. Attention should be paid to the training of enterprise workers and staff members so as to improve the overall quality of enterprises. Using foreign capital and advanced technology, particularly high technology, is a good way to transform the large and medium-sized enterprises. However, we should deal with reliable foreign businessmen and guard against fraud. In the meantime, we must not always trail behind others; instead, we should first learn from others, and then make our own creations and surpass others. He pointed out: We should put our own scientific and technological achievements to good use. At present, many of them have not been utilized; such a situation affects the improvement of the quality of enterprises and their products and restricts scientific and technological development. On the circulating-fund shortage reported by some enterprises, Rong Yiren pointed out: It is crucial to make funds circulate and to distribute them well. Since the state-supplied funds are limited, enterprises should mainly rely on society and themselves. He said: At present, the circulation of funds is too slow in quite a few enterprises. Enterprises should pay more attention to careful calculation and strict budgeting and to accelerating fund circulation. If they fail in this regard, the development of our market economy will be affected. The central authorities have already started to rectify the debt chain problem among enterprises. He emphasized: Enterprises must keep their word in business operations. They must not repudiate a debt, nor resort to dishonest practices. They must conduct business in an legitimate way and regard honesty as the best policy. Only in this way will our socialist market economy be vigorous and orderly.
