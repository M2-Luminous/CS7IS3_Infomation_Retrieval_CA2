Jonas Savimbi warned the Angolan peace talks mediator about the possibility of the United Nations imposing sanctions against UNITA. According to the letter delivered to Alioune Beye today, dated yesterday [28 June] from Huambo, Savimbi said that UNITA would no longer live with the fear of sanctions. UNITA spokesman Jorge Valentim refused to go into detail, but did not repudiate the possible interpretation that his letter implied that the UNITA leadership admitted that the talks might break down if renewed sanctions were imposed against the movement. The letter comes at the same time as an impasse at the Lusaka talks.
