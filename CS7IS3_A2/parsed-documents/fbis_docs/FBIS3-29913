Samdech Chea Sim sincerely thanked the Netherlands for granting humanitarian aid to Cambodia in the agricultural, health, and educational sectors and particularly for contributing to the Cambodian people's quest for peace. Concerning the Khmer Rouge [KR], he said that the royal government has made many concessions to reunify the nation and put an end to the war in Cambodia. However, because of their belligerent nature, the Khmer Rouge have not shown any desire for national reconciliation. They are bent on continuing the massacre and plunder of the people in the remote regions. Moreover, they have been using military forces against the Khmer Royal Armed Forces [KRAF]. Samdech Chea Sim stressed that if the Khmer Rouge keeps refusing to join the national reunification efforts, the royal government will be obliged to use military force to stop their savagery and protect the lives of the people. He also said that recently our KRAF have conducted sweep operations and succeeded in completely capturing the Anlung Veng camp from the Khmer Rouge. Samdech Chea Sim went on to say that His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk will return to Cambodia in April to join his subjects in celebrating the traditional Khmer New Year. The Netherlands ambassador said he is delighted to visit Cambodia and to find that Cambodia is reunified and has a new legitimate government and parliament. The Netherlands Government will help contribute to the rehabilitation of Cambodia in the spirit of friendship and mutually beneficial cooperation, he said before stresssing that the Netherlands also sent its peacekeepers to Cambodia, but it is most regrettable that these peacekeepers failed to disarm the Khmer Rouge. He pledged that he would make every effort to continue on the good bilateral cooperation between the Netherlands and Cambodia to help promote Cambodia's agricultural, health, and educational sectors.
