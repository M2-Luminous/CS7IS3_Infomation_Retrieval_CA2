FR940617-2-00106 FR940617-2-00065 [Dkt. C&hyph;3301] Institut Merieux S.A.; Prohibited Trade Practices and Affirmative Corrective Actions AGENCY: Federal Trade Commission. ACTION: Modifying Order. SUMMARY: This order reopens the proceeding and modifies the Commission's consent order issued on August 6, 1990, by deleting the requirement to lease to a third party the rabies vaccine business that the company acquired when it purchased Connaught BioSciences, Inc. The Commission concluded that the record does not show any approvable lessee despite Merieux's efforts to find one, and that retaining the lease requirement imposes significant costs on Merieux and could result in adverse impact on public health needs. DATES: Consent Order issued August 6, 1990. Modifying Order issued April 22, 1994. 1 1 Copies of the Modifying Order and the statements of Chairman Steiger, Commissioners Azcuenaga, Owen, and Starek are available from the Commission's Public Reference Branch, H&hyph;130, 6th & PA.
