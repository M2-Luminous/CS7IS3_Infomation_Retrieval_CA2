And now, according to press secretary Reidar Karlsson, the ministry will spend the "next few days" going through the documents from the Danish Hydraulic Institute (DHI) and the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute. The calculations show that the blocking effect of the link is between 0.32 and 0.52 percent, with a 0.2 percent margin of error. As a result the desired zero solution can be achieved through the compensatory dredging of 2.3 million cubic meters from the bottom of the Oresund. It has not yet been decided whether the ministry will then be able to make any direct recommendations to the Swedish Government in a few days' time or whether it needs to call in one or more experts from outside to evaluate the calculations. "The ministry's experts will now go through these documents, but it is too early to say whether they have the necessary competence to carry out a final evaluation of them. But this will be decided within the next few days," Reidar Karlsson said. According to RITZAUS BUREAU, the report from the Denmark's DHI contains mild "criticism" of the Swedish Water Rights Court which last Friday gave the thumbs-down to the calculations produced so far by the Oresund Bridge Consortium. "Our first report to the Water Rights Court which was based on varying current conditions showed that the bridge did not have a blocking effect of more than 0.5 percent," DHI department chief Jacob Steen Moller said. According to Steen Moller, it was unnecessary, after the first report, for the Water Rights Court to demand new calculations regarding south-flowing currents in the Baltic Sea.
