Information-Legal Integration May Become Reality"] [Text] The results of the conference that ended yesterday, on "Legal and Information Problems of Creating a Single Economic Space of the Commonwealth of Independent States," may have a certain impact on the progress of integration processes in the CIS. If the governments of the CIS countries go along with the conference participants' initiative on the creation of a specialized coordination council, a single information and legal space may be created on the territory of the former USSR. International experience shows that at present, cooperation between states in the sphere of information may provide the basis for boosting integration processes in the economic area. It is quite possible that the international conference, "Legal and Information Problems of Creating a Single Economic Space of the Commonwealth of Independent States," sponsored by the Russian State Legal Administration under the president's staff, has already laid the "cornerstone" in the foundation of an economic union. The conference participants' good intentions to make their contribution to the construction of the Commonwealth's building, however, can hardly be implemented without government support. This support more likely than not is in evidence at the level of the Commonwealth's interstate organs. One indirect evidence is the participation in the conference of CIS Executive Secretary Ivan Korochenya. The conference participants passed an "Appeal of the Conference Participants to the Heads of States and Parliaments of CIS Member Countries." It proposes to develop a single conception of an interstate exchange of legal information within the Commonwealth framework. Importantly, in the opinion of the conference participants, the main components for an effective exchange of legal information should be suitable coordinating structures to be formed within the CIS framework, and personnel skilled in the management of state affairs, highly skilled free market economy specialists to be trained at an interstate level. The conference decided to organize work on an interstate basis to evolve a conception for the forming of a single information and legal space whose result should be the creation within the Commonwealth's framework of an interstate system of legal information that would foster the formation and development of the Commonwealth's economic space. A decisive contribution to information integration could be made by a coordinating council on the provision of legal information around the CIS whose creation was proposed by the conference participants. The council is supposed to be made up of representatives of all CIS member states. The council is supposed to carry out the legal analysis of normative-legal documents in effect on the territory of the CIS member countries and submit the results of this analysis to the state organs of the Commonwealth countries.
