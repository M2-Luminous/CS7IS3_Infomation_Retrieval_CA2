The Washington summit between Leonid Kravchuk and Bill Clinton, already postponed twice, is provisionally scheduled for 12 March. This will be Leonid Kravchuk's third visit to the United States as Ukraine's Supreme Council chairman and president. The head of the government delegation, Ukraine's Economy Minister Roman Shpek, said in an exclusive interview for UNIAN before departure: "It is too early yet to speak of the size of credits to be granted to Ukraine. However, after hard work with the American side and international financial organizations, Ukraine can count on a total of $2 billion, including a system transformation loan (STL), a stand-by credit, and a rehabilitation loan. It is more important to convince the American side that Ukraine's leadership realizes the depth of the crisis processes in Ukraine and, most significantly, has a political will for reforms." Roman Shpek said he hopes to convince the Americans of Ukraine's intentions to pursue market transformations by fighting hyperinflation, as well as setting up a Ukrainian bank for reconstruction and development, and a national insurance company to safeguard investments and credits. The delegation also includes Ukraine's National Bank Chairman Viktor Yushchenko; Deputy Foreign Minister Oleksandr Makarenko; Deputy Finance Minister Borys Sobolev; Serhiy Osyka, deputy minister of external economic relations; Anton Buteyko, adviser to the president of Ukraine for international affairs; Valeriy Pavlyukov, deputy minister of machine-building, military-industrial complex and Conversion; and other experts. According to some reports, Ukraine's Deputy Premier Valentyn Landyk and Minister of Finance Hryhoriy Pyatachenko dropped out of the delegation at the last minute under pressure from the American side. The program of the visit includes meetings at the U.S. Congress, the State Department, other departments, the Federal Reserve Bank, and the IMF and World Bank headquarters. A total of 20 meetings are planned, Deputy Foreign Minister Oleksandr Danylenko [name and title as received] told UNIAN, as well as the initialing of a bilateral agreement preventing double taxation, and an agreement on promoting and protecting investments. These agreements are to be signed during Leonid Kravchuk's visit to Washington. "At the IMF, we will discuss the preparation of a program for STL system transformations, which will become a step toward receiving a stand-by loan," Roman Shpek told UNIAN. "If the preparation of the STL program proceeds without delay, the IMF will hopefully approve the relevant documents in four months. At the same time, we will negotiate a rehabilitation loan with the World Bank." Confidential sources reveal that the success of the visit will also be crucial with regard to the United States granting Ukraine a temporary beneficiary status in the generalized system of preferences which, as a concession in trade relations with the United States, has not been available to any other CIS country.
