FR941012-0-00058 FR941012-0-00011 The record indicates that training materials and courses for logging safety are widely available and that many logging establishments have implemented training programs (Ex. 4&hyph;122, 4&hyph;123, 4&hyph;181, 5&hyph;20, 5&hyph;33, 9&hyph;1, 9&hyph;2, 9&hyph;5, 9&hyph;6, 36; Tr. W1 163&hyph;64, W2 113, 115, 125, 199&hyph;201, OR 87, 259&hyph;60, 393, 546&hyph;47, 566). Trade associations such as AOL, APA and the Montana Logging Association have been providing training materials on an on-going basis (Ex. 5&hyph;27). APA expected to have completed a comprehensive training package for its members companies by 1989. In addition, state agricultural extension services are a source of training information (Ex. 4&hyph;122, 4&hyph;123). Several hearing participants submitted descriptions of their training programs and the actual training materials (Ex. 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 28, 29). OSHA is aware that many of the existing training programs are based on the training requirements of OSHA's pulpwood logging standard. Because the training requirements have been revised in this final rule, current training programs will have to be reviewed and upgraded, when necessary, to meet the revised requirements. In addition, the training provisions of the final rule vary to some degree from the proposed rule. As such, employers who made changes in their programs in response to the proposed rule will have to review their training materials to assure compliance with the final rule. OSHA is aware that employers, trade associations and other organizations that provide training will need time to prepare and/or update training programs to meet the requirements of the final rule and will need time to provide training to employees. However, the record also shows that many companies and organizations already have developed training programs that meet most of the requirements of the final rule (Ex. 5&hyph;20, 5&hyph;27, 5&hyph;52, 5&hyph;69, 9&hyph;2; Tr. OR 343). Many establishments, especially those in States that have logging standards, already are providing training (Ex. 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 28, 29). Therefore, OSHA does not believe that a lengthy delay is necessary to meet the training requirements of the final rule. The Agency believes that extending the effective date of the standard for 120 days after publication of the final rule in the Federal Register will be sufficient to allow employers and others to familiarize themselves with the final rule, to update training programs to meet the provisions of the final rule, and to conduct initial training. This phase-in period also will give employers time to determine whether current and new employees have received the training in all of the elements specified in this section or whether they will need additional training. b. Sufficiency of training. The second issue raised in the hearing notice concerned what training OSHA would consider sufficient to meet the training requirements in the final rule. Some commenters supported OSHA's preference for performance based training (Ex. 9&hyph;3, 9&hyph;15). Other commenters argued for detailed specifications to be included in the training requirements, including a minimum number of hours of training (Ex. 9&hyph;13, 9&hyph;19). In general, the final rule contains training requirements in performance language to allow employer flexibility in tailoring training programs to the individual circumstances under which they operate. The final rule sets forth the basic elements that must be covered in the employer's training program, such as safe performance of assigned work tasks; safe use of tools; recognition and control of workplace hazards; prevention and control of general logging hazards; and the requirements of the final standard. The training provisions also require that employees initially work under supervision and that they demonstrate the ability to perform their work tasks safely before being released from supervision. As discussed elsewhere in this preamble, each logging establishment has unique conditions or hazards associated with its logging operations, that result in unique methods of operation. OSHA believes that the general elements of the training provisions allow employers to take into account those differences while still requiring the employer to assure through training that each employee is able to perform the job safely.
