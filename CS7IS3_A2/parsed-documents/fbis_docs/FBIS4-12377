FBIS4-12377 "drnes068_j_94004" FBIS-NES-94-068 Daily Report 8 Apr 1994 ARABIAN PENINSULA Yemen Salih Takes Questions on Phone-In Program Salih Takes Questions on Phone-In Program JN0704193294 JN0704193294 BFN [Editorial Report] Sanaa Republic of Yemen Radio Network in Arabic, in a linkup with the Arabic Service of the BBC, at 1505 GMT on 7 April carries a 55-minute live phone-in program from Sanaa with Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the Yemeni Presidential Council. President Salih responds to telephoned questions and comments from an international audience. The program is moderated by the BBC's Madihah al-Madfa'i. Responding to a caller from Tunisia, Salih says that since the signing of the accord document in Amman on 20 February he has been striving with his coalition partners in the Yemeni Socialist Party (YSP) to implement the document. He says he regrets his efforts have "met with a lukewarm response from certain YSP leaders." Commenting on explosions in Dhamar Governorate "at 2000 yesterday", Salih calls it a "transparent game," calculated to create problems to justify opening indiscriminate fire on bystanders and nearby camps, including those of the Republican Guard and Public Security forces. The aim, President Salih contends, was to "create tension" and bring about the relocation of military forces from north to south and vice versa, as "envisaged by certain YSP leaders." Salih adds that he "had given instructions for military units not to respond with a single bullet." He notes with satisfaction that there were no casualties, apart from two members of the security forces injured trying to subdue a YSP member who attempted to break the law. Both he and 'Ali Salim al-Bid, Salih notes, followed developments personally and calmed the situation. The military committee then moved to the Dhamar Governorate to investigate the situation. Responding to a listener from Syria, who voices fears of the Yemeni issue being internationalized in a manner similar to the Gulf crisis, Salih says every effort is being made to contain the crisis, but regrets that some members of the YSP want to see the Yemeni crisis turned into a pan-Arab concern. Salih stresses, however, that he has no objection to "our brothers in the Arab world lending a hand" to the solution of the crisis. We are striving, he says, to contain the crisis and keep it from internationalization, a prospect he calls "very dangerous." Asked by a listener calling from Yemen to spell out the underlying causes of the Yemeni crisis, the president says the causes are well known and that they began to emerge after the 27 April parliamentary elections. He maintains that some YSP members, who initially went along with the election returns, "began to act so as to bring considerable harm to the Yemeni people and national unity." Taking a question from another Tunisian caller, Salih says the first days of Yemeni unity may have provided an admirable example for the Arab world to follow. But "we feared that our unity was bound to be targeted for conspiracies." The question was, Salih adds: "Who would implement such a plan?" "We believe a conspiracy is being implemented by the very authors of the unity." Those who brought harm and caused cracks in national Yemeni unity, he regrets, belong in the camp of the "makers of this great event." Salih exhorts "our brothers and partners" in the coalition government to avert military conflict that will cause considerable damage to the national economy and national unity. He recalls that Yemenis had a taste of infighting in 1972 and again in 1979, in both cases the "winner was the loser." Only the enemies of the homeland and Arab unity stand to gain from infighting, Salih asserts. Answering another caller from Yemen, President Salih describes his meeting with Yemeni leader 'Ali Salim al-Bid in Salalah as "positive on a personal plane" but not so in terms of the Yemeni crisis, especially since "new conditions running counter to the pledge and accord document were put forward." The president suggests that the YSP is trying to circumvent the Constitution and the accord document, which neither he nor the Yemeni people find acceptable. 'Abbas Bin-Hamid-al-Din, who identifies himself as a Yemeni national living in Cairo, proposes the expansion of the Political Forces Dialogue Committee to include men belonging to the Hamid-al-Din family, which previously ruled Yemen, to defuse the ongoing crisis, Yemeni President Salih says: "I believe that the Hamid-al-Din family contributed to the Yemeni crisis, because it has left us a burdensome legacy. It is part of this crisis. We have continued to pay a price, thanks to the policies pursued by the Hamid-al-Din family, and the British colonial rule." Responding to a question from a caller in Saudi Arabia regarding the need for President Salih and Vice President al-Bid to demonstrate flexibility to "avert endless civil wars," Yemeni President Salih says: "We, along with all well-intentioned people in the homeland, will do our best to resolve and contain this crisis so as to safeguard unity. This crisis is the price we are paying for this national accomplishment. We, along with all patriots and well-intentioned people throughout the Yemeni homeland, are determined to safeguard unity." Muhammad al-Bid, a Yemeni national in Riyadh, poses the following question to Yemeni President Salih: "Let us say that the country is divided, God forbid. Will Yemen relive the situation currently experienced by Somalia, which is going through immense fighting, chaos, and anarchy?" President Salih answers this question, saying: "We are optimistic that no civil wars will erupt. All patriots and honorable people inside and outside the homeland are careful to prevent the eruption of a civil war. We are doing our utmost to avert this eventuality. We will certainly contain this crisis. In the first months of the crisis, many provocations took place. Those who planned this crisis believed that a war would erupt in the initial stages of the crisis. Nonetheless, we have endured a lot to thwart these schemes, which seek to bring about a civil war, or return the situation to pre-May 20, 1990." Responding to a question by Ahmad Nasir al-Juraydi, a Yemeni national from the Central Republic of Africa, Yemeni President Salih says: "Security violations have been exaggerated by the media. There are some security violations everywhere. Most of these are criminal security-related violations. Some of these violations are committed by culprits to distort Yemeni unity, and tarnish the image of the Yemeni people. However, the Yemeni people are keen to safeguard their security and stability. The security organs are conducting their duties and pursuing those who are committing security violations." Caller 'Abdallah Salih al-Yafi'i from Mecca, Saudi Arabia, holds President Salih, Vice President al-Bid, and the entire Yemeni command structure responsible for the crisis. President Salih responds: "Since the inception of the crisis, we have made many concessions to safeguard Yemeni unity. For example, we did not show a determination to obtain a share in authority commensurate with the results we achieved in the parliamentary elections to the House of Representatives. We have abandoned some seats, and some pivotal authority positions in favor of our brothers within the coalition government, including the prime minister's post and a seat on the Presidential Council. These are concessions. It is no mistake if we makes concessions to one another, and to brothers, to resolve this crisis. We have even offered our brothers within the YSP to quit if we are deemed one of the causes of the crisis, so that a new leadership may be elected, and so that the Yemeni unity may remain intact." He mentions a proposal contained in a bill to be submitted to the House of Representatives stipulating that the president of the Republic may serve only two terms in office. He deems all these as concessions benefiting the Yemeni people. Responding to a question posed by 'Abd-al- 'Aziz Salih al-Mafqari from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, President Salih says the failure to send to court suspects charged in connection with a series of explosions and assassinations can be traced to the fact that some of them remain at large, while others are being interrogated by the Public Prosecution department. He adds: "We would like to address our YSP command brothers, saying that security agencies and all state bodies must be reactivated so that the state, including its defense, security, legislative, and executive bodies, may all function as a single team." President Salih adds: "God willing, the pre-May 22 situation will not relived. Nor shall we condone infighting. This is a political decision that I have made in my capacity as chairman of the Yemeni Presidential Council. I have decided that I will not allow infighting among the sons of the close-knit Yemeni people, regardless of the provocations, and regardless of what has happened. Had we been people without any sense of responsibility, we would have been dragged to infighting, and to a repartitioning of the country, which has been planned. However, all these schemes have been thwarted." Answering a question from Farid Ahmad Mubarak Juhayman in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, who urges Yemeni President Salih and Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid to tender their resignations so others may address Yemeni affairs, President Salih says: "I informed brother 'Ali Salim, in Amman, that if the dispute is personal, that is, one between the president and his deputy, then I was ready to tender my resignation so a replacement might be elected by the House of Representatives." President Salih maintains that the root causes of the crisis cannot be addressed by the mere resignation of leaders. He adds: "If the resignation of the president and his deputy would save the Yemeni people, then we would be ready to tender our resignations. But, I am afraid that such resignations might aggravate and exacerbate the crisis, and lead to a civil war." When asked by a caller from Riyadh about the frustration plaguing the Yemeni people because of their sufferings, thanks to the ongoing crisis, Yemeni President Salih denies that the coalition government is surviving by fabricating and managing crises. Answering a question on an alleged British role in the Yemeni crisis, and whether Britain has given the YSP the green light to effect a repartitioning of the country so Britain may benefit from oil revenues, given the fact that it has oil prospecting firms operating in Yemen, President Salih says: "We do not want to make accusations against anybody. We urge all our brothers, all our beloved ones in the Arab homeland, in the Islamic world, and in friendly states to aid the Yemeni people during the ordeal fabricated by some people, the ordeal that has immensely harmed our national unity. We will not make any accusations unless we have documents to corroborate such accusations. There are numerous rumors around, and so are propaganda campaigns targeting this or that country. However, we must be in full charge of our own affairs. This is better than having our own affairs decided by other officials, be they British, Americans, other foreigners, or other Arabs. We, Yemenis, are the people who must be in full charge of our own affairs." President Salih goes on to say: "This crisis is part of the schemes planned by some YSP leaders within the context of the so- called cultural plan. The Yemeni crisis is the very cultural plan they have spoken of. We have never wished to air such words over the media. But, regrettably, this is the cultural plan they are promoting to move the emotions of laymen, simpletons, and those who do not read between the lines with regard to this issue." Responding to a caller from Morocco, President Salih hopes that "unity-oriented Arabs" will not turn Yemen into a battleground for settling differences that surfaced before and during the Gulf crisis. He hopes they will help Yemenis contain this crisis. The program concludes at 1600 GMT.
