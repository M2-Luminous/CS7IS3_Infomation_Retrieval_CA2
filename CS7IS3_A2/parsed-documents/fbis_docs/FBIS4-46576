Sizov and A.G. Luzan under the rubric "Military Reform"] [Text] Yuriy Georgiyevich Sizov is a doctor of technical sciences and the author of more than 150 scientific works and inventions, who headed the Armaments Directorate of Field PVO of the Scientific-Research Institute of the Ministry of Defense from 1982-88. Aleksandr Grigoryevich Luzan is a candidate of technical sciences, and a well-known specialist in armaments and military hardware for field PVO. He has been deputy and then chief of armaments for field PVO of the ground forces for more than ten years. The rapid development of the means of aerial attack and the great difficulties in the use of the air-defense weaponry that has been developed for the country's PVO [air-defense] troops in the interests of the ground forces made it necessary to create a special branch of troops among the latter. The PVO SV [ground forces PVO] troops were first forced to use obsolete cannon weaponry and S-75 surface-to-air (SAM) systems. The mobility of the ground forces increased rapidly. Their successful operations under conditions of the continuously increasing threat from aviation and other means of aerial attack (SVN), however, required air-defense weaponry with completely different characteristics. The S-75 SAM system, quite a fearsome weapon at the beginning of the 1960s, had too little mobility. All of its combat elements were located on trailers that required cable communications between them. The deployment time was thus many hours, and movement was possible only along roads. The KS-19 and S-60 artillery systems also had insufficient mobility and, more importantly, their effectiveness was intolerably low against modern SVN. The decision was made to create air-defense weaponry that would meet the tough requirements of the ground forces. The first was the Krug SAM system (General Designer V.P. Yefremov), which entered service in 1965. All of the combat elements of the system were located on highly mobile, self-propelled tracked platforms: the acquisition and target-designation radar, the guidance radar, and the launchers with the SAMs. The outer boundary of the SAM lethal area was 50 km, with the altitude of targets from 3.0 to 24.5 km. The lower boundary was brought first to 500 meters, and then to 150 meters in later models. The appearance of the first SAM systems in service with the USSR and Western countries forced aircraft to adopt new tactics. Air power was forced in particular to operate primarily at low altitudes in the zones of powerful PVO. The Kub SAM system (General Designer Yu.N. Figurovskiy) was created to fight air power at low and medium altitudes. The system has two principal combat elements--a self-propelled vehicle with the electronics equipment, and a launcher with self-guiding missiles. The former has the acquisition radar, guidance radar and illumination station. It must be said that the combination of this many stations was done for the first time in world practice. The acquisition radar and the guidance radar were located separately for the analogous American Hawk SAM system. The reaction time could be reduced markedly with the joint placement of the stations, important in defeating low-flying targets. The Krug SAM system began to enter service with army and frontal air-defense missile brigades. Air-defense regiments for the tank divisions were formed on the basis of the Kub SAM system. A heavier and cheaper weapon was needed for the protection of the motorized-rifle divisions. The Osa SAM system (General Designer V.P. Yefremov) was thus created; it had all of the elements placed on a single self-propelled platform. This made it possible to protect troops advancing in battle formation. It must be said that the Mauler SAM system, in which all of the elements were also placed on a single vehicle, was also under development in the United States for many years. The project was not completed, however. The lighter and cheaper Strela-1 (Chief Designer A.E. Nudelman) and portable Strela-2 (General Designer S.P. Nepobedimyy) SAM systems with non-radar equipment, as well as the Shilka self-propelled AA cannon mount (Chief Designer N.A. Astrov), were created in addition to these other types of SAM systems for the PVO SV troops. The first two were later replaced by the Strela-10 and Strela-3 systems respectively. The analogous Chaparral, Redeye and Vulcan system were in service with the U.S. Army. The first generation of air-defense missile and artillery weaponry for the PVO SV troops thus took shape. All of the types of systems, aside from the Krug SAM system, were supplied for export abroad and took part in various military conflicts, where they proved themselves to be quite highly effective for their time. The further development of means of aerial attack, the increases in their mass and types and their fitting with electronic-warfare armaments required the creation of a new generation of arms. The assurance of high effectiveness of this generation of systems under the new conditions required serious increases in the complexity of air-defense weapons, which led to a sharp rise in their cost. It became necessary in this regard to optimize the types of air-defense systems for the PVO SV troops. An entirely fair question arises--why are we discussing the optimal types for the PVO SV, and not for all of the armed forces? The answer to this question is both complex and simple. First of all, the task of the necessity of developing second-generation systems arose in the middle of the 1960s, when the narrow departmental fragmentation even within the Ministry of Defense was very large. It existed between the customers, between the developers and even between scientific organizations. Second, there was a very serious battle among the customers. Third, quite powerful groups of developers appeared that were working for various customers. The various "weights" of the customers was a circumstance of no small importance. The leaders of PVO Strany [national PVO], as a branch of the armed forces, had greater access to the leadership of the Ministry of Defense and the other power structures of the USSR than the leaders of the branches of the armed forces, the PVO SV, and the customer, one of the directorates of the GRAU. The conceptual model for the leadership of the PVO troops in the creation of weaponry was for many years oriented toward fixed, semi-mobile or, in the best case, slightly mobile equipment. This weaponry was thus not suited to the ground forces. The reverse was possible--the troops of the PVO Strany could take weapons developed for the PVO SV. But this impeded ambitions and the orientation toward "their own" developers. The task of substantiating the optimal types was formulated as follows: find the types of air-defense systems under which the required protection of the force groupings with PVO is ensured, while the cost of the air-defense systems is minimal, i.e. find n at which C = min. The task of defeating all types of SVN could be fundamentally resolved by a PVO group that had only one all-purpose type of SAM system able to defeat all targets effectively. Another extreme variation is where a specialized type of SAM system is developed to defeat each type of SVN. The optimal solution is located somewhere between them, and is sought according to the criterion of minimal cost with the aid of mathematical modeling. The required effectiveness of PVO is determined proceeding from the level of losses of ground forces allowable while their fighting ability and capabilities for the successful fulfillment of the assigned mission are still preserved. A number of restrictions imposed on SAM systems by the specific features of the ground forces as objects of defense are introduced in the solution of the problem. These include mobility, terrain passability, frequency of change of positions, time for shutdown and deployment of the systems, resistance to climatic factors etc. Manned and unmanned aircraft, helicopters, ballistic and cruise missiles, guided aerial bombs and the strike elements of high-precision weaponry, as well as special EW and command-and-control aircraft that are in patrol zones, were considered as SVN. The operational-tactical background for the solution of the problem was taken to be repelling a mass attack by SVN in which all types of air-defense systems take part. The efficient types of air-defense systems were determined according to the results of computation; each of them should provide for the defeat of a certain set of SVN, with this set is moreover arranged in its own priority order for each type of system. The presence in a PVO group of air-defense systems of a certain type ensures its stability under the conditions of exposure to EW equipment. The development of second-generation systems was begun at the end of the 1960s and beginning of the 1970s. The types of air-defense systems received concrete designations and purposes: S-300V SAM system (General Designer V.P. Yefremov)--for the defeat of ballistic and aeroballistic missiles, EW and command-and-control aircraft in their patrol zones, aircraft of strategic and tactical aviation and other types of targets; the Buk SAM system (Chief Designer Ye.A. Pigin)--for the defeat of aircraft of tactical and strategic aviation, cruise missiles and other types of targets; the Tor SAM system (General Designer V.P. Yefremov)--for the defeat of aviation missiles and other combat elements of high-precision weaponry, aircraft of tactical aviation, cruise missiles and other types of targets; the Tunguska air-defense missile and artillery system (General Designer A.G. Shipunov)--for the defeat of combat helicopters, aircraft of tactical aviation, cruise missiles and unmanned equipment; the Igla portable SAM system (General Designer S.P. Nepobedimyy)--for self-defense against attacking SVN. The leadership of the USSR was forced to alter some of the procedures in the country and begin to destroy interdepartmental barriers at the beginning of the 1970s. This was determined to no small extent by the colossal expenditures that had to be made for the development and production of arms. Discussions began on the necessity of standardizing them. Some concrete steps were also taken. These include the creation of various Interdepartmental Coordinating Councils (MKS). An MKS was created in particular for radar equipment. The largest step in this regard was the decision in 1980 to transfer the leadership of the PVO SV troops to the PVO Strany troops, after which the latter began to be called simply the PVO Troops. The idea of combining all of the PVO troops under a unified command was not a bad one in and of itself. As much else that was done here during the "era of stagnation," however, the incarnation of the idea took on a grotesque nature. What in fact happened? The command and staff of field PVO were transferred to the PVO Strany High Command. The commander of the PVO SV forces, Colonel-General P.G. Levchenko, was named commander of field PVO and first deputy commander-in-chief of the PVO Troops. Some structural changes were made in the PVO staffs of the military districts, and substantial organizational changes were made in the PVO Strany troops. The various customers for PVO weaponry, however--the PVO GUV [Main Armaments Directorate] for the PVO Strany troops, the GRAU Directorate for field PVO--and the arsenals and bases remained under various departments. A paradoxical situation arose in the ground forces--the field PVO formations were part of the motorized-rifle and tank regiments, motorized-rifle and tank divisions and armies and, naturally, were subordinate to the corresponding commanders and the commander of the ground forces. Many questions of the administration of these formations, at the same time, were in the hands of the command of the PVO Strany troops. This situation brought harm to everyone. The commands began to be regarded as alien to the PVO formations in the ground forces in a number of cases, and a large portion of the housekeeping and other unpleasant work began to be passed on to them. The most complex PVO military hardware, after all, is in the ground forces--this is PVO hardware, and it requires well-trained and professionally prepared people. The command of field PVO, on the other hand, remained an alien body to the leaders of the PVO Troops. The commander of the field PVO was only nominally named first deputy commander-in-chief. All of this caused great harm, which became obvious to the leadership of the Ministry of Defense as well. The leadership of the field PVO was thus returned to the ground forces in 1986. Some positive aspects of the attempt to combine PVO should be noted for the sake of fairness. These are, first and foremost, the substantial destruction of interdepartmental barriers. A number of conceptual views in the PVO Strany thus underwent marked changes as a result. The necessity of a substantial increase in the mobility of the weaponry and the rejection of static weapons wherever possible was understood first of all. A model of the Buk SAM system was ordered in which the principal combat equipment was switched to wheeled self-propelled vehicles, and the appearance of the S-300P system was altered and began to look outwardly more like the S-300V system. Russia is now in a grave economic and political state. Spending for defense needs has been cut back sharply. Military reform is underway, but its implementation is proceeding with great difficulty, and the structure of the armed forces that existed under the USSR is by and large preserved. There are three branches of the armed forces in all of the leading countries of the world--the ground, naval and air forces. Each branch has its own high command, the size of which is quite large, and is staffed to a considerable extent by senior officers and generals. The upkeep of the high command constitutes an appreciable share of the funds that are allocated for the maintenance of personnel in that branch of the armed forces. The only country in the world that permitted itself to have five branches of the service was the USSR. When the collapse of the Soviet Union began, it was proposed that Russia have three branches of the armed forces. There were also to be strategic forces unified for the whole CIS, which were expected to include some of the structures of the PVO troops as well (first of all the system for warning of a missile attack (SPRN) and the system for fighting space weapons). This decision was dictated not only by economic considerations, but also by the great changes that have occurred in recent years in the structure and characteristics of SVN, first and foremost aeroballistic ones. The share of cruise missiles, which fly principally at low altitudes and can be defeated only at short ranges, has increased substantially. Various RPVs are close in trajectory and radar characteristics to aircraft in sport and agricultural aviation on which IFF transponders have not been installed. Sport aircraft often violate the airspace of neighboring states and do it, as a rule, unintentionally. What should be done with them--do they really all need to be shot down? The characteristics of some ballistic targets have been markedly altered. Recall the recent past, when the Pershing-2 ballistic missiles were placed in Western Europe. It turned out at that time that the SPRN in the USSR could not ensure timely target designation for firing on such targets. The problems that brought about the necessity of creating the PVO Strany troops as a branch of the armed forces thus proved to be largely unresolved. Those troops could not protect the entire country, but only a certain number of targets. A whole branch of the armed forces is probably not necessary for that. Such structural changes naturally cannot be carried out easily and require a certain amount of time, but they must begin now. The funds freed up thereby are best invested in enterprises that produce air-defense systems for the ground forces. Those arms have already won leading positions, and could be used not only to equip the armed forces of Russia, but could also be sold in the international arms market. The favorable situation that arose after the successful Mosaeroshow-92 weapons show and the Oborona-92 exercises, as well as the results of the IDEX-92 weapons show in Abu Dhabi, must be utilized. The funds invested in the production of air-defense weapons for the ground forces (the S-300V, Buk, Tor, Tunguska and Igla systems) could very quickly repay themselves a hundred times over. The decision needs to be made quickly, however. If the funds are not invested now, this year, the leading positions of Russia in air-defense weaponry will quickly be lost, and the market competitiveness of our air-defense weapons in the world market will be gone.
