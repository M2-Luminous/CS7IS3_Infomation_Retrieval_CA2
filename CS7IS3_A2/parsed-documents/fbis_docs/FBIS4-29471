FBIS4-29471 "dreas118__a94020" FBIS-EAS-94-118-A Daily Report 17 Jun 1994 ANNEX Japan SDP Chairman on Ties With LDP, Coalition SDP Chairman on Ties With LDP, Coalition OW1806092794 Tokyo YOMIURI SHIMBUN in Japanese 17 Jun 94 Morning Edition p 2 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW1806092794 Tokyo YOMIURI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Interview with Takashi Yonezawa, chairman of the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP], by an unidentified YOMIURI SHIMBUN reporter; place and date not given] [Text] [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Would you give priority to the Social Democratic Party of Japan's [SDPJ] return to the coalition or to the coalition's cooperation with some members of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]? Yonezawa: The first objective is to have the SDPJ and the New Party Sakigake return to the coalition. Even if the SDPJ comes back into the coalition, the number of the ruling partiy seats in the House of Representatives is not enough. Therefore, it is a matter of course for us to persuade some LDP members to join us. [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] The opinion of the SDPJ is also divided over the issues of returning to the coalition and submission of a no-confidence motion against the cabinet. Yonezawa: It is still uncertain when we will hear the conclusions of their debates on the concept of taking power and other matters. In a way, we are becoming impatient. [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Do you think the SDPJ and the coalition will be able to agree on the North Korean issue and the tax system? Yonezawa: The SDPJ signed the fundamental agreement before the Hata administration was formed. Therefore, I am sure we can reach an agreement if we confer with each other in a positive manner. [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Can you comment on the possibility of forming a "coalition of the conservatives of the LDP and the coalition?" Yonezawa: Saying that would be too optimistic. It is the same as saying that we need to find some LDP members who will cooperate with us, because we do not have enough Diet seats. [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] How about a coalition with former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone? Yonezawa: It would be an attempt to go against the current of the times. [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] What do you think of the idea of voluntary en masse resignation? Yonezawa: The coalition will loose its centripetal force as soon as the Hata administration says it will dissolve the cabinet. Using common sense, it is difficult to think that Hata will be re-elected to the premiership after an en-masse resignation. He will have to take his second and third best measures, including major cabinet reform. [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] What do you think of the opposition parties' movement to submit a no-confidence motion against the cabinet? Yonezawa: It seems that this movement is heating up. However, some people will also speak against it. [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Do you think the SDPJ will submit a no-confidence motion first? Yonezawa: I do not think so. Submission of a no-confidence motion is tantamount to saying that they will not join the coalition. [YOIURI SHIMBUN] Do you think the Hata administration will remain in power as a minori minority government and pending issues will be settled during the next extraordinary Diet session? Yonezawa: Of course, we will be talking about these possibilities if the opposition parties betray our hopes to enact the bills to redraw the electoral districts and to pass the budget related bills, at least. The lower house will be dissolved if we have to start the autumn Diet session without realizing our hopes.
