Yes, an earthquake took place in currency markets. The dollar rose to 20,500 Turkish lira [TL], and all economic forecasts went topsy-turvy. The currency stands stopped selling cash dollars to people. The Central Bank remained a mere spectator. The stock exchange transactions continued to fall, and the Treasury and the banks are getting ready to increase interest rates. [Begin offscreen reporter recording] The Turkish lira is experiencing a real shock. The Turkish people started to frantically exchange their money for dollars in the aftermath of developments that resulted from increasing the amount of money in circulation beyond TL66.4 trillion. The people started withdrawing their money from the stock exchange and started buying up dollars following the new bank interest rates and the bad mark given to the Turkish economy by international financial circles. People formed lines in front of currency stands to buy dollars or marks, and the cash foreign currency sales almost came to a halt in Istanbul and Ankara. Businessmen are unwilling to sell their dollars because they are finding it difficult to predict how much the dollar will continue to rise. All the predictions so far have been wrong, and at one point the dollar was selling at TL22,000 and the mark at TL11,500 at the currency stands. The dollar is selling at almost TL20,000 in Tahtakale [Istanbul financial district]. The businessmen's associations such as TUSIAD [Turkish Association of Industrialists and Businessmen] and the government had predicted that the dollar would reach TL24,500 and TL26,000 only at the end of 1994. The stock exchange transactions fell and shares fell by 403 points to 25,503. Despite this activity in the currency market, the Central Bank is keeping silent. [passage omitted] How did this happen to the currency market? According to economists in Istanbul, the clash between the Treasury and the Central Bank is the reason behind the rise in the value of foreign currency. In line with Prime Minister Tansu Ciller's request, the Treasury is trying to lower interest rates. Unlike in the past, the Central Bank is not selling its foreign currency reserves to collect the excess Turkish lira, which is now escaping the lower interest rates and is being changed into foreign currency. Because of this, the price of the dollar went out of control. [passage omitted] It is not known how the TL2,000 gap between the official exchange rate and the market will be bridged. Regarding the money shuttling between the stock exchange and the foreign currency market, and the government stance on this issue, business circles are warning that the excessive amount of money being printed in Turkey has opened the way for a considerable amount of speculative money to be accumulated. The economists, who have said that dollar prices have not gone up so fast anywhere else in the worl, now say: For the first time ever, speculative money is being used to buy up dollars. People are being dragged by this process. This money could leave the dollar market and return to the stock exchange at any time, and then people will suffer. The government is aware of this and is expecting such an occurrence. [end recording]
