FBIS4-23183 "drafr104_c_94034" FBIS-AFR-94-104 Daily Report 31 May 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 29 May South African Press Review for 29 May MB2905105494 MB2905105494 BFN [Editorial Report] SUNDAY TIMES Opposition to Taxes Criticized -- "The perpetual handwringing of the country's richest people, who seem to regard any taxation as though it were a flesh-gobbling virus, is becoming tiresome," begins the Johannesburg SUNDAY TIMES in English on 29 May in a page-18 editorial. "The latest burst of neurotic anxiety arises from speculation .... that President Mandela intends to impose a surcharge of 10 percent on the taxes of the wealthy." The editorial continues then by discussing the economic pro's and con's of increased taxes, concluding that it is unlikely that Mandela or Finance Minister Keys would impose such a surcharge. "Why, then, the continual bursts of hysteria from the whites?" "It is hard to explain, except in terms of neurotic guilt. People who feel they have been unjustly enriched by apartheid perhaps feel that the victims of apartheid will, sooner or later, exact revenge. There is a simple answer to these anxieties: it is what, in a different age, was called noblesse oblige, or the obligation of the privileged to put back into society some of the fruits of their good fortune. The policies outlined by Mr Mandela are benign and reasonable," and "if the hangwringing classes want to avoid special taxes and levies, their best course of action is to seize the RDP [Reconstruction and Development Program] as an opportunity, and make it work." RAPPORT Editorial Warns Against `Exaggerated Expectations' -- "What happened in the National Assembly this week was a remarkable display of national unity and the honest desire for peace and prosperity to reign in South Africa. All parties went out of their way to show their loyalty to South Africa and to commit themselves to a better standard of life for all people in the country," notes a page-14 editorial in the Johannesburg RAPPORT in Afrikaans on 29 May. "Even President Mandela said he would go down on his knees to beg for peace. Beautiful -- but the sober observer cannot help but wonder how long this peace will continue." "It is said that President Mandela's speech was better received in Houghton and Constantia than in Guguletu and Soweto. Elements within the ANC view the president's policy speech as a deviation from the socialist route and as pandering to whites and the business community. Black critics of President Mandela say, and not without grounds, that peace can only be maintained if the government succeeds in meeting the demands of its millions of young supporters." "It is clear that there are exaggerated expectations of the economy. To mention one example: Economists agree that there is no way Mr. Joe Slovo will be able to build as many houses over the next five years as he had promised to do." "During a visit to South Africa two years ago, Mr. Lee Kuan Yew, the man who helped to turn Singapore into an economic miracle, warned against high expectations. Like the ANC his party also entered into an alliance with the communists." "ANC supporters will have to heed his advice. First look for stability through proven economic policies."
