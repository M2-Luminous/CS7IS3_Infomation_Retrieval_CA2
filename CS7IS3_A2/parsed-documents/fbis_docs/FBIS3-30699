"Romania has an important contribution to make, you have good relations with the countries from the area. I think now is the proper moment for Romania's influence on this conflict to be felt, " mentioned the co-president for the European Community of the International Conference on Former Yugoslavia. He added that the true dimension of the losses suffered in consequence of the enforcement of the embargo are known, and so are the disbalances that have appeared among compensations for the neighbors of former Yugoslavia. The European Union is in charge of giving compensations to Romania, but it has not done enough in this respect, said Owen who gave assurances that the efforts of the Romanian Government would be given due response. As for the continuation of the peace process, the mediator said that the plan of action drafted by the European Union was being examined by the three parties in conflict. As for the intention of a number of Muslim leaders, that is of troops to be sent to Bosnia-Herzegovina under the aegis of the United Nations, Lord Owen mentioned that the Muslim countries had had access from the very start and Egypt had even sent troops to Sarajevo. Malaysia and Pakistan announced their readiness to participate in the UN actions in that area. What will follow, that will be decided by the UN Secretariat-General. The strategy used as a rule is not to involve the countries in the proximity of the conflict, and in this case the strategy also refers to the non-involvement of Muslim countries in the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina."
