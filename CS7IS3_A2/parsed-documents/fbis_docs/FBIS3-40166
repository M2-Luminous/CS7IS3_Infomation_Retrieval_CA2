During the interview, he set forth systematically his own views about the current state of agriculture and the rural economy, as well as how to concentrate on the reform goals of building a socialist market economy system, intensifying rural reform, and steadily developing the rural economy. The substance of the interview has been collated below for the reader. Remarks in italics are those of this journal's deputy editor, Han Jun. Remarks in regular type are those of Minister Liu Jiang. Ever since 1992, China's national economy has been in a new stage of making an all-out transition to a market economy and high growth. During this period, some incongruities in the development of agriculture have manifested themselves rather strongly. Agricultural problems have once again become a focus of general concern for society as a whole. Not long ago, the Central Committee convened a special rural work committee meeting in this regard, which studied strategic approaches and specific actions to be taken to buttress the basic position of agriculture, and to move China's agriculture and rural economy another step upward in the course of building a socialist market economy system. Against this background, how do you look at the current situation in agriculture and the rural economy? Overall, the situation in agriculture and the rural economy throughout the country is good. Since the remarks of Comrade Xiaoping during his travels in the south, and the Fourteenth Party Congress' setting of the reform goal of establishing a socialist market economy, the pace of rural reform and development have quickened appreciably. In 1992, more than 2,000 counties, 282 prefectures and cities, and 29 provinces (autonomous regions and directly administered municipalities throughout the country decontrolled grain procurement and marketing prices. In 1993, command-style plans in agricultural production and plans for the allocation of grain among provinces were abolished throughout the country. Second, a large number of all sorts of new rural economic organization forms have come to the fore. These include share cooperative system enterprises, peasant vocational (and technical) associations, rural cooperative funds, and organizations that integrate trade, industry and agriculture. Third, agricultural production is developing steadily, and readjustment of the internal structure of agriculture has quickened further. A bumper grain crop was harvested for 4 years in a row between 1982 and 1992. In 1992, national grain output reached 442.66 million tons, up 1.7 percent from the previous year. Output of all crops except cotton, which fell 20 percent due to natural disasters, increased in varying degrees. Animal husbandry and aquatic products production maintained a steady growth momentum, outputs of meat and aquatic products nationwide increasing 9.1 and 15 percent respectively over 1992. During the first half of 1993, summer grain production reached an all-time high, and the outlook for grain production for the whole year is much better than was estimated at the beginning of the year. Between January and June, outputs of all major farm products increased in varying degrees except for rape seed, which fell 12.5 percent. Outputs of meat, dairy products, eggs, and aquatic products increased 5, 3, 5, and 9.7 percent respectively over the same period in 1992. Not only did total output of farm products increase, but agricultural production began to change from mostly efforts to increase outputs to gaining "higher yields, premium products, and high returns." Output of premium quality agricultural products increased steadily. Fourth, township and town enterprises entered a new stage of high growth. In 1992, the gross output of township and town enterprises totaled 1.76 trillion yuan, up 51 percent from the previous year. During the same year, more than 9 million new people entered the rural work force. Rural staff members and workers totaled 105.81 million, which is more than the total number of staff members and workers in state-owned enterprises. Foreign exchange earnings from exports in 1993 broke the 119.2 billion yuan mark, accounting for 42 percent of the total value of commodity procurement for export nationwide. Tax payments to the state totaled 63.69 billion yuan, 18.23 billion yuan more than in 1992. Township and town enterprises continued to maintain a high speed growth momentum between January and June 1993, gross output value increasing 70 percent over the same period in 1992. Fifth, peasant income increased. In 1992, peasant per capita income nationwide grew more rapidly than during the previous three years, reaching 784 yuan. After deducting for price rises, this was a 5.9 percent increase. After deducting for price increases, peasant income increased by an actual seven percent between January and June 1993. In short, advances in rural reform, and rapid growth of the rural economy played a leading role, a ground breaking role, and a model role in hastening the development of a market economy nationwide. They lay a foundation for promoting growth in the entire national economy, and they provided the basic material support needed to enrich the livelihoods of city and countryside residents alike, to curb inflation, and to maintain social order. While fully affirming the achievements in rural reform and development of recent years, it is also necessary to understand clearly that both the development of agriculture and the rural economy are facing numerous deep-seated inconsistencies and limiting factors in a new situation in which the national economy is making a complete transition to a market economy and high growth. The most conspicuous manifestation of these inconsistencies are, first, city and countryside residents incomes are not increasing at the same rate. The gap between city and countryside income has widened further. Between 1989 and 1992, peasant per capita net income increased by an average only 1.8 percent per year. This was very much out of line with the annual average 5.2 percent increase in the gross output of agriculture. The slow growth of peasant income contrasts sharply with the income growth of city and town residents. The gap between city and countryside income has increased from the 1.72:1 ratio of 1984 to a 2.33:1 ratio in 1992. Agricultural production increases, but peasant income does not increase along with it. In fact, it may even decrease. This is a grim problem that China's agriculture has faced in recent years. Second, industry and agriculture do not grow in unison. The danger of a recurrence of unbalanced growth of industry and agriculture exists. In 1992, the industrial growth rate was 20.8 percent, making 1992 the highest growth year since reform and opening up to the outside world. The growth rate for agriculture was 3.7 percent. This included only 1.2 percent growth in farming. The growth ratio between industry and agriculture was 5.6 to 1. During 1993, industrial growth momentum remains very strong. The gap between industrial and agricultural growth remains very great. The high growth of industry has led a large rise in the prices of all intermediary input prices, the cost and price of agricultural means of production rising greatly in consequence. As of the end of June 1993, prices of the agricultural means of production had risen 16.5 percent, while the procurement price index for agricultural and sideline products for the same period rose less than 6 percent. At the same time, driven by comparative benefits, large amounts of agricultural development funds flowed into non-agricultural industries. Consequently, investment in agriculture --particularly medium and long-term investment -- is seriously inadequate. Historical experience shows maintenance of a between 2.5:1 and a 3:1 ratio between the speed of industrial and agricultural growth to be about right. The present state of affairs can go on for a short period, but if it continues, the present fairly balanced supply of agricultural products will be replaced by a shortage of supply. If that happens, agriculture cannot be supported, and the whole national economy will once again sink into a vicious cycle requiring major readjustments. Third, rural regional development is unbalanced. The gap between the central and western parts of the country and the developed areas of the east coast has widened. A look at the overall rural economy shows a gross social output value ratio among rural villages in the east, central, and western parts of the country to have widened from the 1:.67:.3 of 1980 to 1:.44:.22 in 1991. Central and western China have 36 and 23 percent respectively of the country's population, but their rural social gross output value amounts to only 25 and 12 percent respectively. Fourth, rural surplus manpower movement pressure has increased. Statistics show a surplus rural manpower of approximately 120 million in these areas of the country. Because of the high population base figures, rural manpower will reach a respective 490 million and 540 million by 1995 and 2000. The average annual manpower increase will be more than 13 million. If 5 million members of the rural work force move to the nonagricultural sector each year for the next 15 years, by the year 2000, a newly added surplus manpower numbering 64 million will remain in the rural villages. When this is added to the existing surplus manpower of approximately 120 million, total surplus rural manpower will be close to 200 million people. How to find opportunities for such a huge rural surplus rural manpower will be a thorny problem that will dog us for a long time to come. In short, we must take a comprehensive point of view, a dialectical point of view, and a realistic point of view about the situation in agriculture and the rural economy. We must not overestimate the overall production capacity of agriculture just because of the increase in agricultural products for several years running. We must not overestimate the prosperity of the peasants simply because their standard of living has improved considerably. We cannot be blindly optimistic about the rural situation just because great achievements have been scored in rural reform. Nor should we be negative and pessimistic. We must realize the tremendous potential and the favorable conditions for sustained development of agriculture, and we must realize that work in agriculture and the rural villages faces quite a few new circumstances and new problems. There is potential, opportunity, and hope for development of the rural economy, and there are also contradictions, difficulties, and dangers. Since 1992, the State Council has inaugurated a series of policy measures aimed at buttressing agriculture and protecting the peasants' interests. How well are these policies being implemented? The series of agricultural policies that the State Council inaugurated were welcomed by the broad masses of peasants. Governments and departments concerned at all levels devoted major efforts to implementing these policies, and implementation of these policies played a major role in stabilizing agriculture and protecting the enthusiasm of the peasants. For various reasons, however, results from various jurisdictions implementation of policies have varied somewhat from the Central Committee's expected goals. Take the issuance of the "two monies," for example, the main problems with which were late issuance and a low rate for getting the money to households. The policy did not play its intended role. Take also implementation of the policy of a floor price for peasant grain sales and a ceiling price for peasant means of production purchases about which every jurisdiction reported problems. One complaint was that the standard used in setting the floor price of grain was too low; thus, it afforded the peasants hardly any protection. The second complaint was that since Central Committee policy provisions protected only fixed procurement and grain slated for storage, jurisdictions were uncertain as to whether the flor price also applied to negotiated price grain. Third, the ceiling price for agricultural means of production was subject to change. In implementation, the ceiling price might even become the floor price for the means of production. Implementation of the grain and cotton "three links" materials price reform additional price policy brought little real benefit for the peasants. The way that summer grain and oil procurement funds were handled meant that money was largely at hand in most places for the procurement of state fixed procurement grain and oil, and grain slated for storage, but in most places no arrangements were made or money was not available for the procurement of negotiated price grain and oil. In order to avoid issuing IOUs for procurement, some places refused to buy. This meant that at the state grain production and marketing meetings held to place orders, and contracts for the allocation of grain among provinces were also hard to implement completely. Every jurisdiction also paid extraordinarily close attention to implementation of the policy of lightening the peasants burdens, but since the peasants burdens issue has such broad ramifications and is so complex, true implementation of the policy is very difficult, and the task is extremely daunting. For a long time in China, lip service has been paid to agriculture but little action taken. All sorts of policies emphasizing agriculture have frequently been very difficult to put into practice, so much so that many people refer to agriculture as "slogan agriculture." This should make people think long and hard. What do you think are the main reasons for the "slogan agriculture" problem in China? There are rather profound and complex reasons for the rise of the "slogan agriculture" problem. Historically, when neither agriculture nor light industry was fully developed following founding of the People's Republic, and per capita national income was very low, we relied on the large size of the country and the role of the planned economic system. We used the exchange at unequal value of industrial wares for agricultural products to take money directly from the agricultural sector, giving priority to the development of heavy industry. This was completely necessary given the special historical circumstances of the time. However, despite no practical difficulties for a long time, we have not changed our development strategy in a timely fashion. On the contrary, in order to ensure long-term implementation of this strategy, the state has adopted a series of mandatory policies for the separation of industry and agriculture, and for separating cities from the countryside. Large amounts of money have been extracted from the rural villages. At the same time, rural manpower has been confined to rural villages and shackled to the land. The result is serious imbalance between the development of industry and agriculture and between the development of cities and the countryside. This has led, in turn, to the formation of traditional agriculture in China, a dualistic economic structure in which rural villages and modern industry and cities coexist, and a bifurcated social structure. This is an important reasons why development of China's agriculture has been in a stagnant and backward state for a fairly long time since founding of the people's republic. The policy environment that emphasizes heavy industry while slighting agriculture, and emphasizes the cities while slighting the countryside has not been fundamentally changed today. It continues to hamper seriously the development of China's agriculture and its rural economy. The insufficiently developed rural economic system is also a basic reason for China's agricultural problems. After 15 years of reform, an embryonic rural market economy system has taken shape; nevertheless, the rural economic system is very much incomplete both at the microeconomic and the macroeconomic levels. One of the ways this is expressed is in the insufficiently developed rural microeconomic operating system and the rural property rights system. Peasant family authority to make their own operating decisions is still not as complete as it should be. The second way it is expressed is in meshing single peasant household small scale production with domestic and international markets. At the present time, the main operating entities in China's agriculture are the more than 200 million peasant households that practice family contracting of production, each household farming less than 10 mu of land. They produce all kinds of farm products on a small scale. They specialize but little. However, they face constantly expanding markets. Because farm products markets are poorly developed, because trading methods are backward, operating rules rudimentary, the degree to which the peasants are organized is low, and the development of intermediary organizations to link peasants with markets lags, it is difficult for the peasants to use effectively the information transmittal, and production regulation functions that the market mechanism provides. Faced with markets, many peasants are frequently at a loss. A third way in which the incompleteness of the rural economic system is expressed is in the process of making a transition to the market economy system. Most of the regulation and control methods that the government used in the past, which consisted mostly of administrative means, no longer apply; however, no agricultural macroeconomic regulation and control system that meets needs for the development of a socialist market economy has been established as yet. Government lacks sufficiently effective macroeconomic regulation and control methods for implementing agricultural policies. Subjectively, neglect of agriculture is an important reason for China's agricultural problems. The party and the government have always devoted extremely close attention to agriculture. Nevertheless, in actual practice, driven by the lack of separation between government administration and agricultural management, and their own interests, some local jurisdictions and government agencies have single-mindedly pursued increase in the scale of investment in industry and greater output value. Manpower and material resources, as well as investment, have been too much tilted toward non-agricultural industries. In particular, as a result of the consecutive year bumper harvests in agriculture of recent years, and the general difficulty selling staple farm products, some comrades mistakenly suppose that China's agriculture has turned a corner, or they are no longer concerned about the overall situation. Influenced by such thinking, some places have relaxed leadership of agriculture. Today, when the central authorities are calling for stable grain and cotton production to increase effective supply, to calm peasant sentiment, and to maintain social tranquility in the cities and countryside, local jurisdictions are primarily concerned with development of the local economy and increasing fiscal revenues. Furthermore, it is unrealistic to expect the banks, grain agencies, and supply and marketing agencies, which combine policy and business functions in a single body, not to consider their own interests in carrying out government policies. The mixing of government agency interests, the interests of business concerns, and government functions has produced distortions in the execution of policies. Delay in issuing the "two funds," the diversion of funds, and the substitution of materials for loans are examples. Some grassroots level cadres and peasants complain that "the central authorities provide the money; the local government makes an effort; the peasants suffer; government agencies gain; and everyone is dissatisfied." So what do you see as the way out of China's agricultural problems? During the past several years, the Central Committee and the State Council have held a series of important meetings on agriculture and the rural economy. The Central Committee Rural Work Conference, in particular, broke much new ground on rural policy. It did much to increase investment in agriculture, and this was extremely encouraging to our comrades who are engaged in agriculture and rural work. It will, no doubt, play a positive role in stirring the zeal of the peasants. If we just act in accordance with the plans and policies that the Central Committee and the State Council prescribe, firmly implement them, do a solid job, and wholeheartedly do real deeds for the peasants, there will be great hope for development of China's rural economy. Specifically, this means using the intensification of reform, expansion of deregulation, optimization of the structure, and increasing investment to solve fundamentally the various deep-seated inconsistencies and problems faced in the development of China's agriculture. For starters, we must first fundamentally change the longstanding dualistic economic structure and bifurcated social structure that emphasizes industry while slighting agriculture, and that emphasizes the cities while slighting the countryside. We must establish a development strategy for integrated development of industry and agriculture, the cities and the countryside. Right now, we must intensify macroeconomic regulation and control, to hold the scale of social investment and the speed of industrial growth within the limits that agriculture can bear. In addition, we must enhance the basic position of agriculture in the course of increasing macroeconomic regulation. We must also accelerate the movement elsewhere of surplus rural manpower. This is a major problem of strategic and over-arching importance in the future development of China's national economy. Small cities and towns must permit the peasants freely to enter and leave jobs in industry or commerce. County seat city, market town, and small city policies permitting peasant entry must be broadened. Doing this requires rapid reform of the household registration, labor employment, and social security systems, actively exploring new population control measures that are in keeping with needs of a market economy. Second, further intensification of a rural microeconomic operating system, rural ownership rights system, rural commodity circulation system, and government macroeconomic regulation and control system reform is needed to meet the reform goals that the 14th Party Congress set for the socialist market economy in order to hasten the establishment and perfection of the rural economy's operating mechanism and control system based on the market mechanism. First the output-related household contract responsibility system and the two tier operating system have become basic systems in China's rural economy. They should be stabilized for the long term. In order to encourage the peasants to increase their investment in the land, the farmland contracting period should be lengthened to permit farming rights on land to be passed from one person to another for payment according to law. The already formed land contracting relationships should not be changed capriciously. In townships and villages having developed non-agricultural industries where an overwhelming majority of the work force has already left the land, subject to approval of the masses, methods such as sub-contracting, transfer of contracts, and services in partnership may be employed to obtain various kinds of economies of scale. Farming that offers the economies of scale must be practiced in places where conditions warrant; the wishes of the peasants must be obeyed; and caution employed in action. In no case may there compulsion and commandism be used. For most places today, the most important matter in perfecting the rural microeconomic operating system is to provide the peasants with better services before, during, and after production by improving the socialized service system for agriculture. In particular, processing, and commodity transportation and sales services are needed. Proper guidance should be given in this regard that leads gradually to family-based farming on a proper scale. Second the stabilization and perfection of the microeconomic system in agriculture should be used as the basis for exploring actively reform of the rural property rights system. Currently, quite a few jurisdictions practice the dividing up among households of shares in collectively held assets. This effectively handles the problem of maintaining collective ownership of the means of production while also getting around the difficulty of peasant households having no innate connection with collectively held assets. It is an extremely beneficial test. The joint stock cooperation system is currently being developed very well in every jurisdiction. For the country as a whole, it is still in the exploratory stage. It must developed in a fairly standardized direction whether formed after the former township and village collective enterprises convert to some other form, whether its is formed by individual peasants in partnership, or whether it is formed through lateral share participation among various legal entities. The raising of capital, financing, and organization of the elements of production must be improved and, more importantly, the important goal of clearly defining equity rights and transforming enterprises operating mechanisms must be realized. The goal of rural land equity rights system reform is to use clear affirmation of ownership rights for collective land as a basis for encouraging the transfer for compensation of land contracting rights, thereby fostering markets for the circulation of land use rights. Third is greater reform of the farm products circulation system to guide the smooth entry into the market of peasants and agriculture. Deregulation of grain and edible oil prices is not yet complete; we must press ahead with further deregulation. Conditions must also be created for the gradual deregulation of cotton, flue-cured tobacco, and silkworm cocoon prices, procurement, and marketing. In addition, government can exercise regulation and control that reduces market fluctuations by establishing a reserve system and a price regulation system. A large country like China with a population of 1.1 billion will have to maintain the procurement of a certain amount of important farm products such as grain. However, procurement prices must be set equitably on the basis of the laws of value, and with reference to farm product supply and demand, production costs, and price ratios. In addition, all other farm products should be completely deregulated and be bought and sold freely. In order to stabilize the relationship between procurement and marketing, it is suggested that production and marketing of freely bought and sold products be linked, procurement and marketing contracts signed. Now that farm product prices and procurement and marketing are being gradually deregulated, how to organize scattered, small peasant producers for orderly entry into markets is an extremely important question. In foreign countries, the formation of cooperatives has been an effective answer. During the 1950s, China also set up supply and marketing cooperatives and credit cooperatives. However, for reasons known to all, these cooperatives ended up being "government run." Since reform, the flexibility in operation of these cooperatives has improved greatly; however, they still lack a mass character organizationally, and a democratic character administratively. While persisting in reform of both supply and marketing cooperatives and credit cooperatives, we should emphasize the nurture and development of peasant cooperative organizations such as various kinds of vocational associations, and operating organizations that combine farming, breeding, and processing; production, supply, and marketing; and trade, industry, and agriculture. Intensification of rural commodity circulation system reform requires the further building of a market mechanism. If one sees price deregulation as a quick variable [kuai bianliang] in policy, then the building of markets is a slow variable [man bianliang]. Without markets, fluctuations in production will intensify. Therefore, continued development of all kinds of country fair markets and specialized markets is necessary. Specifically, major efforts should be made to develop wholesale markets, and to foster futures markets to form a farm products marketing system based on country fair markets in which wholesale markets serve as the hub and futures markets play a vanguard role. At the same time, close attention must be given to various kinds of production element markets. At the present time, special emphasis should be placed on the development of manpower, financial, and information markets. Fourth is greater government macroeconomic regulation and control for the building and perfection of a social security system in agriculture. In a market economy, as a basic industry and as a weak industry, agriculture requires strong government regulation and control, support and protection. Much work must be done in this regard, but mostly in the following four areas: 1) Study and formulation of a development strategy. Government's administration and control of agriculture must consist primarily of administrative means of control transformed into close study of a medium and long-term development strategy for agriculture and the rural economy, and the drawing up of implementation plans; study of the formulation of an industrial policy; organization and coordination of the building of major agricultural base facilities and agricultural product bases that cut across jurisdictional lines, including management of investment; issuance of prices for leading farm products and market information; and directing overall balance between supply and demand for farm products. 2) Use of fiscal subsidies. In a market economy, government support for and protection of agriculture is expressed mostly through fiscal subsidies. Every country in the world subsidizes agriculture to some extent. Formerly, the national treasury provided very few direct subsidies to agriculture, most of which were applied to the commodity circulation realm and to consumers. A change will have to be made to mostly subsidize agricultural production and industries that serve agriculture. 3) Use of price supports. When government uses support prices for the procurement of staple farm products such as grain, the support price must be set on the principle of production costs plus a reasonable profit. When the market price is lower than the floor price, government must purchase at the floor price. Over the long term, the state must institute support prices in agriculture, set up a risk fund, including a production risk fund, a price risk fund, and a reserves regulation fund. 4) Perfection of the major farm products special reserve system. Government must set a reasonable size reserve, and gradually separate special government reserves from commercial stocks. 5) Support for the development of socialized service organizations for the spread of agricultural technology. Service agencies for the spread of technology such as farm technology, farm mechanization, animal husbandry and veterinary medicine, aquatic products, forestry, and water conservancy technologies are government institutions at the grassroots level. To a very large extent, they are like a social benefit institution. They provide major backstopping for the provision of socialized services to agriculture. If science and technology are to play to the full a decisive role in the development of agriculture, close attention must be given to agricultural education, to scientific research, and to the spread of technology. In a market economy, government fiscal support is the key to scientific research in agriculture, and to the survival and development of agencies that spread technology. Right now, the spirit of the "Agricultural Technology Promotion Law," and documents about stabilization of agricultural sector institutions and teams issued by "the five ministries and one commission" must be strictly enforced. The practice of using reduction of fiscal burdens as a pretext for cutting agricultural sector institutions operating expenses, or even to "divest" or "wean" them must be resolutely halted. Continuity in agricultural sector institutions and agricultural technology promotion teams must be increased, and necessary fiscal support provided for the development of endeavors such as agricultural science and technology research and the spread of technology. Making structure reforms should begin from what benefits the development of agriculture. Problems with the subordination of the "five stations" at the grassroots level of agriculture must be solved, all jurisdictions suiting general methods to specific circumstances and not acting with "arbitrary uniformity." In addition, science and technology at the grassroots level must be improved, the study of applied technology spread, and the storehouse of science and technology increased, The storehouse of high and new technology for "high yield, premium quality, and high return" agriculture, and for the prevention and control of livestock diseases and insect pests, in particular, must be increased to enable science and technology to make agriculture prosper. Third, once grain and cotton production have been stabilized, the rural industrial structure should be boldly readjusted as market demand requires. In adjusting the kinds of grain crops, more wheat and corn, which are in short supply, as well as readily marketable medium and premium quality rice should be grown. In the farming sector, more high economic value raw materials for industrial processing should be grown. In the overall agricultural sector, animal husbandry, the breeding of aquatic products, and forestry and orchards should be better developed. In the rural economy, major efforts should be devoted to the development of township and town enterprises, particularly in the central and western parts of the country. In the development of township and town enterprises, a policy of "active support, rational planning, correct guidance, and strong control" should continue to be employed. At the present time, glaring problems requiring solution in the development of township and town enterprises are the imbalance in development between the eastern and western parts of the country, the widespread dispersal over a wide area of such enterprises, and their fairly low returns. The first requirement is improvement of operating mechanisms, perfection of the contracting system, and development of a stock share cooperative system that enable the maintenance throughout of a flexible and effective operating mechanism. Second is the development of small industrial zones, development of small industrial zones powering the construction of small cities and towns, which spur, in turn, the development of tertiary industries, the conservation of energy, the availability of transportation, the lowering of energy consumption, and the reduction of pollution, while simultaneously soaking up more manpower. Third is the need to improve product quality in every way possible, succeeding with quality and establishing a firm foothold in the market economy. In the course of readjusting and optimizing the rural industrial structure, one problem that must be given extremely close attention is the need to tilt policies in favor of grain and cotton production. Once grain and cotton production in major grain and cotton growing areas has been substantially stabilized, major efforts should be made to develop secondary and tertiary industries to increase regional economic strength. Henceforth the state must concentrate all kinds of investment in both agriculture and non-agricultural industries in the major grain and cotton producing areas. It must also build a number of namebrand, special, premium, and new product bases, poultry and livestock bases, and livestock feed production bases, as well as agricultural and sideline products processing bases in principal grain and cotton growing areas. Henceforth, in general, the state should no longer increase agricultural sideline product processing and production capacity in non-production areas and in cities. Agricultural and sideline product processing firms already located in cities should also be moved to rural or production areas in a planned way. Business concerns and production and operating concerns in major grain producing areas that meet requirements should be given exporting authority. Fourth is greater investment in agriculture to raise agriculture's overall production capacity. The key to improving the position of agricultural bases lies in improving the overall production capacity of agriculture. In view of the country's agricultural development goals by 2000, overall production capacity of China's agriculture must be increased. An agricultural investment system must be formed in which the state plays the leading role that encompasses the state, collectives, and individual peasants. In accordance with the provisions of the "Agriculture Law," the national treasury must annually invest in agriculture an amount that is higher than the increase in regular national fiscal revenues. Capital construction investment in agriculture covered by state plan and within the national budget, and investment in industries that serve agriculture should be increased year by year to increase the disbursement of funds for the capital construction of agriculture as a percentage of all investment in capital construction within the national budget. Macroeconomic control of investment in agriculture outside of budget should be improved for good management and use of development funds and other special purpose funds for agriculture. The increase in agricultural loans should be slightly higher than the increase in bank loans nationwide, and the percentage of loans for policy purposes, such as medium and long-term low interest loans for agriculture should be increased. Raising the overall production capacity of agriculture means putting energies into the building of grain, cotton, edible oil, and sugar production bases. While paying attention to the building of the old bases, attention should be given to a second group of commodity bases during the Eighth 5-Year Plan, the overall production capacity of the country's commodity grain base counties account for half the country's commodity grain. In addition, a number of premium quality cotton bases, and a number of sugar crop production bases should be newly built. Comprehensive development of agriculture should be continued. Comprehensive development of agriculture has been a major measure for strengthening agriculture pursued since 1988. Central government investment, local government matching funds, public fund raising, and special purpose agricultural loans for this purpose total more than 5 billion yuan each year. The development encompasses more than 900 counties and some state farms throughout the country. Development during the past several years has increased the production capacity of major agricultural products, including more than 20 billion jin of grain and more than 7 million dan of cotton. The comprehensive development of agriculture must be conducted with greater intensity in future, emphasis given to the improvement of intermediate and low yield fields and cultivated land reclamation, protection of agricultural resources, improvement of the ecological environment, and the development of ecological agriculture. Finally is the lightening of peasant burdens, increasing peasant income, and protecting peasant rights and interests. In the final analysis, agricultural problems are peasant problems. "When the peasants are poor, agriculture does not prosper." Peasant income has increased only slowing in recent years. Not only has this directly affected investment in agriculture adversely and seriously dampened peasant interest in farming, but it has also seriously limited overall national economic growth. If the goal of a comfortably well-off standard of living by the end of the present century is to be reached, peasant per capita net annual income will have to rise more than 5.7 percent. The basic goal of China's future agricultural policy should be synchronous increase in the supply of agricultural products and peasant income. Increasing peasant income requires, first, the broadening of sources of income, meaning development of the rural economy. Second is checking the loss of peasant income, meaning reducing peasant burdens. Reduction of peasant burdens must be a task that is conducted unflaggingly over a long period, the peasants' burdens gradually being standardized and put under the legal system. Thank you very much for the interview.
