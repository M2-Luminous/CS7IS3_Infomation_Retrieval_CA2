But now, China has been turned into one of the "advanced" countries in the developing world in this respect, said Arpad Bogsch, director-general of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). "The change is from nothing to everything," he said. "The whole world admires what China has achieved in a very short time." For the past 15 years, Bogsch has been here almost every year. He advised China on the drafting and revision of its laws on intellectual property rights protection and witnessed nearly every progress China has made in this area. This time, Bogsch came to host a WIPO-China sub-regional symposium on the role of copyright in cultural and economic development, which was held in Kunming, capital of south-west China's Yunnan Province. Despite a tight schedule, he gave XINHUA an interview before his departure. He recalled that when he first visited China in 1979, there was only a "very weak" trade mark law here. In the past 15 years, China made great strides in the build-up of a legal framework for intellectual property, while engaged in the development of its economy. In 1983, a revised trade mark law became effective, which was followed by a patent law two years later. In 1991, the copyright law and regulations on the protection of computer software were promulgated and implemented. In nine years, the patent system has become a "strong and viable system" and patents are getting more and more attention as well as protection, he said. Chinese inventors more and more realize that it is in their interests and in the interests of their enterprises, universities and scientific research institutions to have an invention patented, Bogsch noted. Although the copyright law is relatively young, the national copyright administration has begun its work effectively, setting up various agencies inside the country and organizing royalties collection and distribution among authors, he said. In the meantime, China joined the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, WIPO, the Madrid Agreement Concerning the International Registration of Marks, the Berne Convention for the Protection of Copyright. From January 1 of this year, China has become a member of the Patent Cooperation Treaty. Therefore, China has completed the participation in international intellectual property agreements, he said. It has become a party to the international contacts in the field of industrial property and copyright, participating now in the formation of the future international relations in this field, he added. Bogsch noted that protecting industrial property and copyright is to protect inventors' and producers' interests, and encourage them to create and produce more and better cultural and material goods. "National creativity must be rewarded and encouraged," he stressed. In order to effectively protect intellectual property, a country must, first of all, have good laws, which will have fines or sanctions against non-compliance, he said. In this respect, China is one of "the advanced countries" in the developing world, he said. Secondly, the public awareness of the usefulness of copyright protection must be raised, he said. Yet, to his disappointment, people in many countries do not seem to have realized the significance of copyright. The presence at the Kunming symposium of over 100 Chinese participants from the country's 31 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions shows once more the importance China attaches to the improvement of its copyright protection system and to the role of copyright in its cultural and economic development, he noted. "China will have as good a copyright system as any country in a few years," he said. Touching on WIPO-China ties in the past 20 years, he said the cooperation was "excellent" and that WIPO advised China and helped it in the training of staff. On future cooperation, Bogsch noted that WIPO will continue to give training to more Chinese nationals and give advice, if requested, on how to improve and adapt new circumstances in industrial and copyright laws.
