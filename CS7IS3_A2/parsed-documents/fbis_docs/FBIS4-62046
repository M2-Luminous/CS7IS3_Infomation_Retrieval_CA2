The Duma part of the Russian parliament's Conciliation Commission was formed today. It is headed by vice-Speaker of the State Duma Valentin Kovalev. The commission also include the authors of the law -- Chairman of the Duma Organisational Committee Vladimir Bauer, his deputy Igor Shichanin, and also members of the Duma Committee for Legisaltion professors of law Viktor Vishnyakov and Oleg Mironov. "The commission has already begun its work," Valentin Kovalev told ITAR-TASS. Asked when it will be completed, he replied that "quite a few subtle constitutional and legislative problems have cropped up". Kovalev noted that "all this process is most extraordinary, because the president recommends the State Duma to suspend the action of several norms". He recalled that "the procedure for such a suspension was not envisaged by the constitutional legislation. This is why the Duma is confronted with several extremely difficult problems affecting its reaction to the letter even though it is most favourably disposed towards it". Kovalev said that "it was first of all necessary to solve several procedural matters, in other words to establish our competence to suspend these norms and then to get down to the crux of the matter". He stressed that a solution would be found within the frameworks of the Conciliation Commission, which will "satisfy the Council of the Federation, the State Duma, and the president". Kovalev said that the president's remarks were "quite extensive" and included almost six typewritten pages.
