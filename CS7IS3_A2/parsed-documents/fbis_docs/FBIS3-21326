The Commission directed once again that status quo ante should be restored in respect of those officers working as Electoral Registration Officers [ERO] and Assistant EROs in the 40 Assembly constituencies, who were transferred without prior approval of the Commission. "The Commission holds these transfers as gross violation of its orders and will consider the work of revision of rolls vitiated unless status quo ante is restored," a communication issued by its Secretary, Mr Ram Kishan said. In another directive, the Commission directed the Central Government to indicate by month end the maximum availability of Central police forces at a time for deployment in 10 States during Assembly elections due from this year-end to March next year making it "unequivocally" clear that it will not bunch several general elections. The Centre should also indicate the time that would be required for the movement of these forces from one place to another. "If the reply from government is not received by the stipulated date, the Commission will proceed to take decisions at the appropriate time on the basis of its own information and appreciation of these factors," it said.
