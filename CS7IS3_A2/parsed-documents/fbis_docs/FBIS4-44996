He indicates that Egypt is monitoring Israel's weapons policies and notices that they "are still geared for conflict, not peace." He warns, in an interview with AL-HAYAH, of the danger of American arms exceeding the limits of a country's legitimate security needs, saying, "When we reach the point of supremacy, and an upset in the balance, then we have reached a point of danger." He reaffirmed that a continued arms race would lead to a political shock in the Middle East, and warned of the likelihood of a confrontation that could result in damaging the interests of the lesser militarily-superior country. The text of the interview follows: ['Allam] What are the ramifications of the peace process on the armament needs of Egypt and other countries in the region? Are the factors and motives that defined the quantity and type of arms in the past now pass√©, with the advent of a comprehensive peace? [Fahmi] Neither Egypt nor any Arab state can accept exposing themselves to danger; this is something we insist upon. The relevant parties must take whatever steps they see as necessary in this regard, because the requirements for legitimate defense are a principled requirement, and absolutely cannot be tampered with. I believe there is no contradiction between maintaining the essentials for legitimate defense, and arms limitation and regional security. On the contrary, these two movements are congruent, as the concept of peace is based on the balance of security needs. The positions and commitments support each country's securing its national interests, and handling their security needs, in a framework suitable to its economic and social requirements. At the same time, we hope that among the results of peace will be a reduction in the tension in this region and a curb on the tendency of some countries to compete in arming themselves, developing arsenals, and introducing various new weapons systems. ['Allam] Egypt's motives for arming itself may have changed, but Israel's policies are not geared to a change in motives or the possibility of changing in the future. [Fahmi] We are monitoring Israel's arms policies, and we hope that these policies will evolve in conformity with the concept of peace. We see no logic or justification calling for military supremacy over a neighbor or neighbors, in the context of peace. Every party must review its concept of security in a way suited to the circumstances of peace and the changes that will occur in this region. ['Allam] Egypt proposes the principle of equality of balance. What is the concept of balance for Egypt--between Israel and every Arab party individually, or between Israel and the Arabs as a geographical bloc? [Fahmi] Prior to the peace process, there were unacceptable pretexts for the balance of Israel's military power with Arab military capabilities, as it was an invitation to an arms race. After the process, and the positive progress it has achieved on all tracks, albeit slowly, we can find absolutely no justification for the continuation of these invitations, rooted in the theory of conflict. The aim of the talks in the committee for arms limitation is a balance of security and equality of commitments among neighboring countries, regardless of whether they are Arab countries bordering other Arabs, or between Arab countries and Israel or other countries. Egypt does not believe in the philosophy of balancing blocs versus one state. ['Allam] There will be, within one year, a conference on "expanding the validity of the nuclear proliferation treaty." Will Egypt sign up to expand the validity or link it to Israel's signing the treaty, as is the case with the chemical weapons nonproliferation treaty? [Fahmi] We must look positively about the conference, to encourage the other countries of the region to join it, instead of looking upon it as a group to confront. Egypt calls upon the countries of the region, including Israel, to join the treaty, as matters will be assessed in light of it in time. It is not rational or understandable for any country to maintain the right to obtain a certain weapon or remain outside the system of banning certain arms, as long as its neighbors also join, especially as any arms limitation accord in any field would be based on a balance of power and of rights, and the congruence of legal commitments among neighboring countries. Egypt's cautious position as regards joining the treaty for banning chemical weapons is the result of the failure of a certain country to move towards compliance with our security demands, or to take into consideration some things that worry us in the area of securing our interests. ['Allam] Is Egypt disturbed by the fact that some countries of the region are still in the arms race, which could some day lead to hostile tendencies, and thus a move to build a defense and deterrent force, meaning that the multiparty talks are futile? [Fahmi] Egypt does not accept that a neighboring country be militarily superior to it, because this increases the likelihood that that neighboring country would in the future resort to arms in the event of a political dispute, and lest circumstances or a limited dispute escalate into a military confrontation ending in damaging the interests of the lesser militarily-superior country. Thus the continuation of the arms race would inevitably lead to instability and weakened security, and expose the region to a political shock. ['Allam] Are conventional weapons still Egypt's major alternative in the event Israel persists in refusing to sign the nuclear nonproliferation treaty? [Fahmi] Conventional weapons comprise the basic component in guaranteed legitimate defense, according to the United Nations charter. We hope that these weapons will remain the basic systems, meaning that we do not want things to go farther, with any country in the region beginning to introduce the nuclear factor into its security calculations. This would lead to a security imbalance that would be very hard to correct, and we do not believe that there is any chance for arms limitation measures or security arrangements if any country in the region retains the nuclear option. ['Allam] Does Egypt think that the United States, the major supplier of arms to the countries of the Third World, will have a role in stopping the arms race? [Fahmi] Some countries obtain their arms from the United States and other countries, and these are legitimate security needs. But when when we reach the point of supremacy, and an upset in the balance, then we have reached a point of danger, linked not only to the arms a country imports, but to other factors, such as local production and military capability. This is the responsibility of the United States, in arms limitation and regional arrangements in the Middle East, as the major sponsor of the peace process. I do not, however, agree with the attempts of some to assess the security of any country based solely on the arms it purchases. It is not possible to deal with this topic by banning the importation or sale of arms; we must look at all aspects, such as the country's capacity to manufacture arms and what it imports, as well as the types of these arms, and the arms it exports to other countries. ['Allam] The Cairo meetings last December, between rounds of the arms limitation talks, turned up disputes in points of view--what are they? What are the major topics to be at the Doha meeting? [Fahmi] There were differences, but not disputes. This is natural, as the meetings are part of the first phase of negotiations in this area. They came up in the area of the committee's work priorities, as some countries focused on confidence-building measures such as contacts, exchange of information, and arrangements regarding military forces. Other countries, mostly Arab countries, including Egypt, saw no contradiction between the pursuance of confidence-building measures and the initiation of the arms limitation process now. Despite these differences, the Cairo meeting was positive and constructive. Progress was made towards agreement on a regional security declaration, and arms limitation, including special principles for security and arms limitation, and its priorities and ultimate objectives. We hope to reach a final agreement on this declaration in the Doha meetings. ['Allam] Will the Arab joint defense accord be nullified if regional security arrangements are reached in the multiparty talks? [Fahmi] With the development of circumstances in the region, we will find ways of reconciling the new arrangements with the existing ones. There are numerous ways, not only this agreement--measures that support each other as long as they tend to defend legitimate and legal positions and principles. The matter of canceling the agreement concerns only the member states of the Arab League, and will be studied, as these states see this in the context of the League and not of the arms limitation committee.
