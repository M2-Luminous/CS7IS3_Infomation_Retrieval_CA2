FR940805-1-00049 FR940805-1-00010 FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY 44 CFR Part 67 [Docket No. FEMA&hyph;7103] Proposed Flood Elevation Determinations AGENCY: Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: Technical information or comments are requested on the proposed base (100-year) flood elevations and proposed base (100-year) flood elevation modifications for the communities listed below. The base (100-year) flood elevations and modified base (100-year) flood elevations are the basis for the floodplain management measures that the community is required either to adopt or to show evidence of being already in effect in order to qualify or remain qualified for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). DATES: The comment period is ninety (90) days following the second publication of this proposed rule in a newspaper of local circulation in each community. ADDRESSES: The proposed base flood elevations for each community are available for inspection at the office of the Chief Executive Officer of each community. The respective addresses are listed in the following table. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Michael K. Buckley, P.E., Chief, Hazard Identification Branch, Mitigation Directorate, 500 C Street, SW., Washington, DC 20472, (202) 646&hyph;2756. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Federal Emergency Management Agency proposes to make determinations of base flood elevations and modified base flood elevations for each community listed below, in accordance with Section 110 of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4104, and 44 CFR 67.4(a). These proposed base flood and modified base flood elevations, together with the floodplain management criteria required by 44 CFR 60.3, are the minimum that are required. They should not be construed to mean that the community must change any existing ordinances that are more stringent in their floodplain management requirements. The community may at any time enact stricter requirements of its own, or pursuant to policies established by other Federal, State, or regional entities. These proposed elevations are used to meet the floodplain management requirements of the NFIP and are also used to calculate the appropriate flood insurance premium rates for new buildings built after these elevations are made final, and for the contents in these buildings. National Environmental Policy Act This proposed rule is categorically excluded from the requirements of 44 CFR Part 10, Environmental Consideration. No environmental impact assessment has been prepared. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Associate Director, Mitigation Directorate, certifies that this proposed rule is exempt from the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act because proposed or modified base flood elevations are required by the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4104, and are required to establish and maintain community eligibility in the NFIP. No regulatory flexibility analysis has been prepared. Regulatory Classification This proposed rule is not a significant regulatory action under the criteria of Section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 of September 30, 1993, Regulatory Planning and Review, 58 FR 51735. Executive Order 12612, Federalism This proposed rule involves no policies that have federalism implications under Executive Order 12612, Federalism, dated October 26, 1987. Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform This proposed rule meets the applicable standards of Section 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778.
