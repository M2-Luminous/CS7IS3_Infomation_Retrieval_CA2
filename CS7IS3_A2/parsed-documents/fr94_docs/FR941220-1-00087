Appendix A Securities and Exchange Commission Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification I, Arthur Levitt, Chairman of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the ``Commission''), hereby certify pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that proposed revisions to Rules 138 and 139 under the Securities Act of 1933 (the ``Securities Act''), if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The reason for this certification is that the proposed revisions to the rules are intended to clarify the availability of the safe harbor provisions of the rules with respect to large domestic and foreign issuers. Any incidental impact on small U.S. entities is not expected to be significant. Dated: December 12, 1994. Arthur Levitt, Chairman.
