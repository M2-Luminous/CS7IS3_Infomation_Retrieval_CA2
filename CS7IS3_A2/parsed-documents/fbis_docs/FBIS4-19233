All the necessary documents are on hand, thus there are no further obstacles to the shipment, a customs spokesman said this afternoon. The containers of missiles are due to arrive in Hamburg by rail on the morning of 16 April. The Hamburg Green-Alternative List (GAL) were the first to become aware of the missile export, which involves missiles manufactured by the firm of Dornier in Friedrichshafen, the GAL said. They are to be shipped directly to Turkey on a Turkish ship. The GAL called upon the German Government and the Hamburg City Council to prevent the shipment. A council spokesman said that, as far as this issue is concerned, "They would not get involved in federal matters."
