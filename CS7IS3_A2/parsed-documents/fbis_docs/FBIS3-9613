Joint units of the Seven-South operational zone are liberating the hitherto occupied territories of the Teslic municipality and linking up with the units of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army's 3d Corps in a triumphant operation. Hajrudin Reidzovic reports: At the time of this report strategic front lines were pushed forward by the capture of a piece of territory 6 km long and 1.5-2 km deep. Important facilities [objekti], which have served as the most important strongholds of the Serb aggressors since the beginning of the war, have been captured: Kuzno Groblje PT 675, Vis Plane PT 677, hill 655, Tresnjev Panj and [name indistinct], name] or hill 497. [sentence as heard] Husar and Omerovo Guvno, notorious chetnik strongholds for the past 22 months, from which they have killed civilians, especially children, are also about to fall. At this moment our units are advancing relentlessly toward the south and the southwest. This is the collapse of the strategy of war criminal General Mladic. The number of dead aggressor soldiers exceeds 50, and twice as many have been injured and thus taken out of action. A substantial amount of arms and ammunition and military equipment has been seized.
