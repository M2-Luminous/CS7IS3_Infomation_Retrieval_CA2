FR941019-2-00134 FR941019-2-00081 ITC, a U.S.-based company that never had a Pilkington license and that has persistently but so far unsuccessfully attempted to enter the float glass plant design and construction market, proposes to add a broad injunction against Defendants' entering or enforcing any contract with a U.S.-based licensee that has the purpose or effect of inhibiting market entry by U.S.-based non-licensees. PPG, a U.S.-based Pilkington licensee, proposes rendering null and void all of the U.S.-based licensees' obligations under their respective Pilkington licenses. In response, the United States agrees that Pilkington's continued efforts to hinder entry and to enforce geographic and use restrictions against its U.S.-based licensees must be enjoined, and points out that the proposed Final Judgment achieves those results, albeit with more specifically drawn injunctive provisions that those proposed in the comments. Thus, Subparagraph IV.A. forbids Defendants to enforce license agreements with U.S.-based licensees insofar as they contain any contractual limitations or any payment or confidentiality obligations with respect to any technology that Pilkington disclosed to any U.S. licensee under its licensee agreement, subject to some narrow exceptions that lack the potential for competitive harm. Analogously, Subparagraph IV.B. forbids Defendants to claim that persons dealing with U.S.-based entities that have not been licensed by Pilkington are subject to liability under Pilkington's exclusive rights to float glass know-how, unless such claims are in good faith based on technology that is a misappropriated Pilkington trade secret specifically identified by Pilkington to the Department of Justice. The other comments offered by ITC and PPG propose specific changes of language to the proposed Final Judgment. The United States has considered each of these, and for the detailed reasons set forth in the attached individual letter responses, explains why the public interest does not justify withdrawing its consent to entry of the proposed Final Judgment. In the third comment, Minneapolis, Minn. lawyer John A. Grimstad, Esq. proposed several changes to the Judgment out of concern that they are necessary to protect the interest of his unidentified client, a domestic float glass producer that acquired its technology by a route not fully explained in the comment, and is uncertain as to where it fits into the Judgment's taxonomy of actual and potential technology users. Our individual response to Mr. Grimstad, appended hereto, demonstrates that the Judgment fully protects his client's right to be free of anticompetitive interference with its operations by Defendants, and that his proposed changes are therefore unnecessary. In sum, the United States finds no basis in any of the Comments for concluding that the public interest would be served by withdrawing its consent to entry of the proposed Final Judgment submitted to the Court by stipulation on May 25, 1994. and will request that the Court enter it forthwith. Supplement to Response On September 30, 1994, PPG filed an ``Additional Comment'' 1 reiterating its earlier proposal that Subparagraph IV.D. of the proposed Final Judgment be amended to add to the injunction against restraining float glass exports to the United States a new provision enjoining Defendants from restraining exports of float glass from the United States. PPG asserts that documents ``recently produced'' by Pilkington plc 2 ``demonstrate the need for the suggested change'' by showing 1 This ``Additional Comment'' was to submitted in accordance with the APPA, 15 U.S.C. §16 (b)&hyph;(d) in that it is dated well after the September 1, 1994, expiration of the 60-day comment period. 2 In its ``Additional Comment,'' PPG states that these documents were recently produced to it ``on a restricted basis'' by Pilkington plc in CIV&hyph;92&hyph;753&hyph;TUC&hyph;WDB, a civil action between those parties pending in this Court, and that, because of restrictions imposed by Pilkington, PPG can only submit the documents to the Court under seal. PPG also states that, because of these Pilkington-imposed restrictions, it has not served copies of the documents upon the Government. However, the Government's remarks herein concerning the ``Additional Comment'' have been prepared after counsel for Defendants, in response to the Government's request for copies of these documents, furnished copies of them to Government counsel, albeit with the restriction that they ``are not for further distribution outside the Department of Justice.'' That Pilkington's conduct *␣*␣* is designed to foreclose *␣*␣* American manufacturers from competing with Pilkington in the construction of new plants in foreign countries and, as well, in the export of glass from the United States to those foreign countries. They suggest that such exclusionary conduct is continuing to the present day. Without suggesting that these Pilkington documents lack the probative value that PPG asserts, the Government finds in them no reason to supplement its prior response to this suggestion. As stated in our individual response letter to PPG's counsel, at 3, 5&hyph;6, the need for the proposed change is obviated by the provisons of Subparagraphs IV.A. and IV.B., which respectively assure U.S.-based Pilkington licensees and U.S.-based non-licensees freedom to export float glass from the United States to any point in the world.
