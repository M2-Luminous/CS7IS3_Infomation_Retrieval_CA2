About 2,000 tonnes of foodstuffs have been delivered here, including vegetable oils and canned meat, dairy, and fruit products which will be sold to the population at moderate prices. This long-term campaign is being conducted within the framework of an intergovernmental memorandum on urgent Japanese humanitarian assistance to the Russian Federation. The first stage was carried out during the spring of last year. The money raised helped purchase modern medical equipment and equip medical institutions. This year it will be used to implement the program of social assistance to invalids. It should be noted that all stages of the humanitarian action are being strictly monitored not only by Russian social protection services but by the Japanese side as well. During the 27 March-4 April period a group of experts from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs will carry out a working tour of the Far East. The aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of the assistance in the region and to determine the best way of rendering it in the future.
