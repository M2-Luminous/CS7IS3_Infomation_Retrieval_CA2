Mario Rui reports. Rui: The organization has a budget of more than 900 billion escudos to diagnose, and at least try to control, drug trafficking. This is the organization's main objective. Much more than monitoring, the center will give the [European] Community and its member states objective and reliable information which can be studied at a European level so the Community can take the necessary measures to reduce drug use, production, and trafficking. The organization was set up by the Twelve and will be based in Lisbon. [begin recording] Portuguese Deputy Minister Marques Mendes: This is above all a political question. Faced with a tragedy of this kind, faced with the dimension of this phenomena in Europe and in the whole world, faced with the major efforts by the various societies, and in view of the small results achieved so far, I believe it is not possible for people to turn their backs on each other when it comes to this issue.
