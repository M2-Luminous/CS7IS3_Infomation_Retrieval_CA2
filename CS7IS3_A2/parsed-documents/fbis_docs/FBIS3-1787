The survey, the first of its kind in China, was jointly conducted by China's Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) and the Research Office of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce. The researcher said that 1,432 questionnaires were received from 1,700 private firms across the Chinese Mainland, a cross-section of the country's 184,000 registered private enterprises in last June. By last June, there were only about 400,000 registered investors in private firms in China, with a total registered investment of 45.29 billion yuan, or an investment of 246,000 yuan per investor. Compared with the state-owned economy, which dominates the national economy and the secondary collectively-owned economy, the private enterprise sector is rather small, according to the survey. Latest statistics show that the total output value achieved by registered private firms reached 42 billion yuan, about 1.4 percent that of collectively-owned enterprises and less than 0.5 percent of total industrial output. China began to register private enterprises in late 1988 and total private enterprises numbered 90,000 in 1989. The total number of private firms jumped to 238,000 last year, an increase of 70.4 percent over 1992, with the total registered capital climbing to 68 billion yuan, up 79.9 percent. China's private enterprises have been growing rapidly since 1992, when the private economy was officially recognized as a necessary supplement to the state-owned economy. The total number of the country's private firms grew at a rate of about 30 percent during the 1992-mid-1993 period, compared with less than 10 percent during 1988-1989. Last year, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce and about 25 provinces issued policies encouraging the development of private economy.
