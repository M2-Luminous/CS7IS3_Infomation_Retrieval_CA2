A commission of inquiry headed by the Supreme Court's president and with the participation of an Arab judge -- do you still think this is a meaningless decision, as 'Arafat termed it? [Al-Tibi] The decision to set up a state commission of inquiry is an internal Israeli Government's decision for the investigation of the incidents. Incidentally, the letter of appointment refers to checking the facts and circumstances, but somehow it was forgotten to authorize the commission to investigate the responsible elements: Was it Barukh Goldstein only or was it a whole movement, or a settlement, or the commander of the Central Command or his superiors? [Levi] It is clearly to be expected though that a commission chaired by the Supreme Court president will not restrict itself and will act as it finds appropriate. Let me ask you: We have just heard a very firm speech by the prime minister in the Knesset. In fact, I cannot recall a more resolute speech by him against a sector of the Jewish population. A commission of inquiry on the highest possible level was established. What else do you demand? [Al-Tibi] I cannot recall such a horrendous massacre which was committed by an IDF [Israel Defense Forces] officer who is a Qiryat Arba' settler. In the past, on 16 October 1993, the Palestinians -- the Supreme Muslim Council in fact -- in a letter to the prime minister and defense minister, warned that this person, Barukh [here al-Tibi shows a copy of the letter which clearly contained the name Barukh] engaged in provocations against Palestinians inside the Cave of the Patriarchs. A reminder to this letter was also sent, but there was no response. Talk is not of Barukh Goldstein only.... [Levi, interrupting] I assume that this very interesting letter which you mention will reach the inquiry commission when its starts its work. I assume you will pass it on. Still, despite the terrible dimensions of the massacre, let us talk of the peace process which is more important than the massacre. What conditions, if at all, will bring you back to the negotiations? [Al-Tibi] Prior to the cabinet meeting yesterday, the PLO had relayed to the Israeli Government six points which it thinks the government should have adopted in view of this new era. After all, the massacre has changed circumstances and conditions. It was proven that Qiryat Arba' and settlement in the heart of the Palestinian population are time bombs which should be handled, since this is not the first massacre either. Qiryat Arba' is responsible for another massacre, in the Islamic college, and for daily provocation, by the same people, not necessarily only Kakh members. The Palestinians do not protest only against Kakh -- is Rabbi Levinger a Kakh member? One of the Bet El rabbis, for instance, said that their beautiful wives light candles while the men set locals alight, and this was not forgotten. Therefore, it is necessary to handle the principle of settlers and settlements in the heart of Palestinian population. The Israeli Government completely failed to do that. [Levi] You are familiar with details of the negotiations than me, and you know that your demands, such as the removal of Jewish settlements from Gaza and disarming settlers, are not realistic. The impression is that you are taking political advantage of these murders. Furthermore, when Israelis were murdered recently -- since the peace process began, in fact -- a demand was repeatedly heard in Israel to discontinue the process. Prime Minister Rabin rose and stated each time, shortly after each murder: We will not stop the process because it would be a victory for the murderers. It seems that in your action today you are awarding the murderer. [Al-Tibi] The murder of the pregnant woman last week, for example, was a base and despicable murder which disgusted me personally. Still, reference here is not to an ordinary murder. It was a horrendous, unprecedented massacre. New circumstances were created by this massacre. The Palestinian residents in the territories are defenseless and should be protected. The IDF failed in its task. Due to this and other facts....[pauses] The agreement of principles stipulates the need for an international presence [last two words in English] -- this is the reason and the basis for the demand for international protection, on top of the IDF's failure. I heard ministers in the Israeli Government who demanded during the cabinet meeting that Jewish neighborhoods be removed from the heart of Hebron, and this is one of the necessary actions. [Later in the broadcast, Levi cites a reaction by security elements to the letter presented by Dr. al-Tibi during his interview, saying "this letter does not at all concern Dr. Barukh Goldstein, but Barukh Marzel, one of the Kakh leaders."]
