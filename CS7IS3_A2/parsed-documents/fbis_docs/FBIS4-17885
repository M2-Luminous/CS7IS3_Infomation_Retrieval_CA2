In this aspect the visit to Moscow of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was "fruitful," Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Kolokolov told Interfax on Wednesday. In his opinion, the time wasted as a result of the break-off of diplomatic relations "did not give Moscow more opportunities to promote a peaceful solution in the Middle East." Kolokolov expressed satisfaction with the content of "detailed" talks between Rabin and Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev on the problems of the Middle East settlement. They discussed the fate of Palestinian territories (Gaza and Jericho) which are now being liberated. "The main problem is how to organize the transitional period better so that by its end in two to three years normal Palestinian self-government structures can be formed there. We are satisfied with the discussion of this problem with the Israeli leader," Kolokolov said. He noted that Rabin expressed interest in continuation of Israel's talks on the Syrian, Jordan and Lebanese questions. Speaking about the prospect for calling a peace conference Madrid-2 at Russia's initiative, Kolokolov said that during talks in Moscow, the Israeli premier "did not deny such a possibility in principle." "At the same time, Russia and Israel understand that it is unrealistic to call Madrid-2 tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. It should be thoroughly prepared. The purpose of this conference is to summarize the results of the latest stage and to consider the possibility of intensifying activities in various directions. By the way, problems occurring at the bilateral talks could be a subject of discussions at Madrid-2," Kolokolov said. Speaking about the supplies of Russian arms to Syria which concern Israel, Kolokolov referred just to spare parts for weapons which were supplied earlier. "I understand the concerns of the Israeli side, but Syrians are also worried about supplies of new Western arms to Israel. Besides, Russia is not supplying offensive arms to anybody. We can talk just about supplies of spare parts and "defense weapons" to Syria. And if we do not sell military equipment to Syrians, other countries can do that," the diplomat said. He noted that Russia will do all it can to help Tel-Aviv find prisoners and missing Israeli soldiers. "We promised to get involved in that and to ask corresponding Arabic countries, where these people can be, in the first place Syria. Russian first vice-premier Oleg Soskovets now visiting Damascus has already been instructed duly," Kolokolov said. Speaking about the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza and Jericho, he noted that "Tel-Aviv promised to do that in the near future." "The delay in the withdrawal can be explained by technical reasons. Preliminarily, it is necessary to prepare the Palestinian police and that needs time and money. Israel has already urged a number of Western countries to ask for a certain sum for the formation of the Palestinian police," Kolokolov said.
