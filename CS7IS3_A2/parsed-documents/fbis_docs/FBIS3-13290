This is because we are always subjected to humiliation and annihilation and to looting and killing whenever others wish to express their grudge and hatred against us. The Ramadan massacre [in Hebron] was retained in memory no longer than 10 days. The West, led by the United States, believed that this massacre did not deserve to be remembered longer. Hence, this is an opportunity to examine international legitimacy. Others disregard this legitimacy while asking us to honor it. Others despise this legitimacy while asking us to appreciate it. They then hide their faces, so we cannot see their sarcastic laughter at the peoples and nations which still pin hopes on international legitimacy. The slaughter of more than 50 Palestinians in one of the holiest Muslim mosques is an example of what has become daily acts committed by the West or Israeli racism. We are only left with appealing to the world to protect us and send us--and perhaps at our expense-- witnesses to our humiliating death. This is so because we do not want to reconsider our position even on a single occasion which would express our courage and prove that we can do something. Those who have expressed much grief over the Palestinian people must reconsider their position. The Palestinian people need our support not our support for others against them. Now that grief has been expressed out of pan-Arab considerations, we would like to recall the fact, though seldom beneficial, that the Iraqi people are an Arab people, that hundreds of Iraqi children are starving to death, and that hundreds of ailing Iraqis pass away everyday because we, and not others, are the ones who are besieging Iraq by the false international legitimacy which is slaughtering the Iraqis and protecting both the occupation troops and settlers in Palestine. While we recall this catastrophe, the U.S. Administration reiterates its known tone that Iraq still violates international legitimacy and has not yet complied fully with its resolutions. This tone seeks to prevent the Security Council from lifting the embargo on Iraq's oil exports. These exports would enable Iraq to purchase milk for its children, medicines for its patients, pencils for its students, water colors for its painters, and some serenity and reassurance for its old people who have faced much U.S. intimidation since August 1990. For us to stand alongside the Palestinian people against the settler murderers, and to support the Ibrahimi Mosque and stand against all the Zionist, U.S., and Western arsenals, and also to back the brother against the enemy, the path is clear; namely, Arabs should end the blockade they are imposing against the Iraqi people. Only by doing this will we confirm that we are still Arabs who can have make their own decisions and who freely, independently, and courageously pursue their policies, so others would be compelled to respect us and honor the international legitimacy in whose name and under whose banner we are being slaughtered and humiliated!
