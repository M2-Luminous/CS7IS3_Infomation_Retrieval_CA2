Ministry officials said they had ordered the embassy in China to obtain information on the incident in which So in-sok, 53, a resident of Cheju Island, was reportedly killed by ethnic Koreans in Changchun city, Jilin Province, which he was visiting on business. A local daily has quoted So's relatives as claiming that So was stabbed to death by second-generation Koreans living in Changchun who tricked him into coming to Changchun and robbed him of 10,000 U.S. dollars before stabbing him to death. So had been running a trading company in Harbin city, Heilongjiang Province, since May last year when he was invited to Harbin by his two brothers who run a Korean restaurant there. Ministry officials said So's kin had requested that it intervene in the case, stressing they plan to act after learning all relevant details. However, they said, "We do not think the incident resulted from any structural problem in bilateral relations." Emphasizing that the incident may have been accidental, the Ministry officials hoped the case would serve as a warning for those wishing to travel to China.
