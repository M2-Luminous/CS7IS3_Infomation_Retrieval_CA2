In answer to the question as to whether Zhirinovskiy's shadow is hovering over the negotiations, Kozyrev joked in his usual manner: The Russian MFA [Ministry of Foreign Affairs], he said, proposes to announce a competition to invent an anti-Zhirinovskiy pill, since this is, he said, a medical rather than political matter. Behind the attempts at lightheartedness, however, there was easily detectable irritation caused by the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] leader's trip to Yugoslavia, which reverberated widely around the world. Many thousands of people flocked to Zhirinovskiy's rallies in Beograd, Belica, Vukovar, and Podgorica. Serbs like people who are not at a loss for words and express their thoughts straight, without subterfuge, albeit in a paradoxical manner. Judging by the comments in the international press and Western radio programs, Zhirinovskiy was clearly at his best; he was especially successful in variations on the Pan-Slavic theme that is very popular here. At the beginning of the 1980's, when I happened to work in Yugoslavia, I heard more than once from my interlocutors--and especially frequently in Serbia and Montenegro--the same popular expression on blood ties with Russians: "Mi smo jedna porodicha ot Japana do Jadrana!" In Russian this means: "We are one family--from the Sea of Japan to the Sea of Jadran"--this is what they call in Yugoslavia perhaps the bluest and warmest sea on our planet--the Adriatic Sea. One may assume that the LDPR leader, too, heard (and most likely more than once) this folksy geopolitical formula in his travels through formerly splendid parts which now, alas, have become the arena of horrible endless bloodshed. By the way, increasingly more international analysts are coming to the conclusion that had the Soviet Union not disintegrated, the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia would have continued its prosperous existence, too, glorifying in Serbian and Croatian, Slovenian and Macedonian, Albanian and Hungarian, and many other languages the tightly knit family-"porodica." Should we be surprised then that Zhirinovskiy, with his predilection for geopolitical issues, did not pass up the topic of "Japana and Jadrana" at Yugoslav rallies? According to a BBC radio commentary, the LDPR leader described his vision of a Pan-Slavic state from Vladivostok to Knin, the capital of the not-yet-recognized Serbska Krajina republic, causing a diplomatic demarche on the part of Croatia, which does not recognize this territory, populated by Serbs since time immemorial, as an independent Serbian state. But the Krajina Serbs have their own opinion on the subject. As Milan Martic, recently elected president of Krajina, said: "We need Russia's help; we need Russia to say its word!" Whether Kozyrev likes it or not, Zhirinovskiy was treated in Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Hercegovina, and Serbska Krajina as a representative of Russia, who finally--for the first time in the past few years, since the beginning of the perestroyka-reformist nightmare!--says exactly what the Great Brotherly Russia should have said! Let the West rail over Zhirinovskiy supporting the idea of Great Serbia, but what is there actually so seditious in it for a Serb, a Russian, or a Slav in general?! I can imagine the storm of elation Zhirinovskiy's words caused at a rally in the city of Belica: "Serbs can always count on Russia to protect them. Air strikes against Serbian positions would be tantamount to a declaration of war against Russia!" One can only regret that these words were not said by the president of Russia! The Western mass media emphasize in connection with Zhirinovskiy's tour that his views do not reflect the position of the Russian MFA. Meanwhile, it would be more correct to put it this way: The current position of the Russian authorities does not reflect the will of the voters expressed in the elections of 12 December 1993. Let us look, however, at how promising Kozyrev's idea regarding a competition to come up with an anti-Zhirinovskiy pill may turn out. One would assume that the ideal effect of this medication, in Kozyrev's mind, would be the phenomenon of that particular "refined diplomatic mumbling" which was identified and described in detail in his book "If in doubt, mumble!" ("The Bureaucrat's Handbook") by James Boren, a former U.S. Department of State functionary turned sociologist and political scientist. The hero of his tale is Probur (professional bureaucrat), a master of "decisive shelving" and "constructive red tape." The apotheosis of Probur's art is enthusiastic mumbling, which allows him "to use empty language forms to express great concern, deep thinking, and absolute competence." It remains unknown whether it is with the aid of already secretly produced pills or simply by lucky inspiration, but refined diplomatic mumbling is already widely used in Kozyrev's MFA. At that same press conference after the negotiations with Owen and Stoltenberg, the Russian minister demonstrated empty mumbling of the highest international class. For instance, delivering a soliloquy that the "peace process in Yugoslavia is not dead; it will continue, and there is a chance to reinvigorate this process." Next, however, in discouragingly destructive dissonance to the above, came a cheerful journalistic commentary: "The meeting participants did not preclude the use of air strikes in Bosnia." The Russian MFA is as usual obscuring the issue, trying to drown the substance of its position in obfuscation, widely using "yes" in which one keeps hearing "no," and "no" with an easily detectable "yes" in it... U.S. Secretary of State Christopher, on the other hand, does not find it expedient to keep things close to his chest and says, for instance, absolutely straight that he approves the report of the UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali since "it opens the way for potential use of military might." What the very first manifestation of this military might may be was stated in the television report for "Segodnya" by the journalist Sergey Gryzunov: One of the first two targets for a NATO aircraft bombing raid is Tuzla, where, by the way, a battalion of Russian volunteers is fighting on the side of Bosnian Serbs, and thus, said the journalist, who has not yet mastered the art of empty diplomatic mumbling and therefore still calls things by their proper names, "a situation may develop whereby Americans will be bombing Russians." The Russian MFA, meanwhile, is talking about an anti-Zhirinovskiy pill! Perhaps the LDPR leader should announce a counter-competition--for the best medicine against Proburs who disregard the national interests of the country they represent. Meanwhile, Americans Rejoice If Russia begins to conduct a policy that will return us to the period of the "cold war," this will inflict irreparable damage to the national security of the United States. This thought was put forward on Tuesday by the (U.S.) President's National Security Adviser Anthony Lake in an interview to the CNN television company. Commenting on the statement by LDPR leader V. Zhirinovskiy that a NATO air strike against Serbian positions in Bosnia and Hercegovina will be tantamount to a declaration of war against Russia, A. Lake said: "I think we should be glad that Zhirinovskiy is not speaking on behalf of the Russian government and does not participate in the formulation of Russia's foreign policy. Had it happened, we would now be arguing with Russia about who owns Alaska. Seriously speaking, our assessment of the parliamentary elections in Russia tells us that in voting for Zhirinovskiy the Russians voted against the economic situation in the country and not for nationalism. We should not, however, underestimate nationalist moods in Russia. Therefore our 'Partnership for Peace' initiative assumes not only expanding NATO membership by adding East European countries and the integration of Russia into a new unified Europe, but also provides the former communist countries with a security guarantee in the event of the potential ascension to power of a nationalist leader in Russia. We do not think that this will happen. We do not think that Zhirinovskiy speaks on behalf of the majority of Russians."
