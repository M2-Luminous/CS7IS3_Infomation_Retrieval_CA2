The United States has embarked on an action in Bosnia-Herzegovina calculated to divert world public opinion from the catastrophe of the Hebron massacre. The U.S. F-16s confronted the Serb fighter planes and downed four of them. Even though this action was endorsed by NATO, it resembles more a "willful action" on the part of Washington in order to overshadow Israel's atrocity. The world's public is still fiercely and categorically protesting against the Zionists' crime--of killing fasting worshipers in the shrine of Prophet Abraham (peace be upon him) more than ever before. In the occupied territories, the Palestinians have also entered the fray with all their being against the Zionist armed forces. In such circumstances, the U.S. action against the Serbs is more a decision to deliver Israel from the pressure of world public opinion than a move to chastise the Serbs, in order to defuse the importance and sensitivity of the debacle, and the carnage of Muslims at the hands of the Zionists, by trying to eclipse it with reports on Bosnian issues. In addition, this will also provide Washington and NATO members with the opportunity to project it as a decisive blow against the Serbs and to douse the inflamed sentiments of the world regarding the overt and covert collusion of the West and the savage Serbs and to give the impression that it did not remain an idle spectator. Washington's action can also be construed as ridiculing Russia. The Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev had earlier warned the West that every action with regard to Bosnia-Herzegovina should be coordinated with Moscow. Thus, by means of this willful act, Washington tried to convey the impression that it reserves the right to take the initiative in Bosnia-Herzegovina and does not need any coordination with Moscow. This means that the downing of some Serb planes can be considered a multi-pronged maneuver from the vantage point of Washington without any overt negative aspects for the United States, especially since it could also serve to divert the wounded sensitivities of the Islamic world from the bitter Hebron incident toward Bosnia-Herzegovina. This would be like saying that the United States is not the enemy of Muslims everywhere and it has taken action at least in their favor in Bosnia-Herzegovina. If this is the posture favored by Washington, then it is certain that Washington will not take any more such actions and will constantly seek to magnify this particular action from its propaganda loudspeakers. The reason is clear. Reports received from Bosnia-Herzegovina show that the Muslim-inhabited areas continue to be repeatedly bombed by Serb and Croat airplanes. Therefore, in order to preempt questions by the world public on its taking a stance against the Serbs, it has taken this action to prove that it can enter the fray against these crimes and if it stops midway, naturally this would be attributed to the European members of NATO. In clearer terms, it means that Washington wants to show that it wishes to confront the Serbs, but it is the European coterie of NATO, in which there is no consensus in this regard. This vantage point is more in harmony with Washington's past propaganda, as Washington has constantly sought to exonerate itself from being accused of prevarication and indecisiveness in its approach to Serbian crimes. Despite all the above, the heinous atrocities of Israel in the occupied territories should not be eclipsed by other events. Following the pogrom in the al-Ibrahimi shrine--instead of adopting a more peace-seeking attitude--Israel has intensified its crimes. Israel has attributed this massacre to a demented individual. If one such lunatic an commit such a crime, there is no dearth of such serial madmen in the chain of command in the Israeli armed forces and who will naturally continue to threaten, intimidate, torture, and kill every Palestinian at every moment in their homes, mosques, and streets. All the facts and figures indicate that this time the Palestinians have entered the arena with greater strength and determination as they sense, with all their being, that their existence and life is linked to revenge on the Zionists and only revenge on the enemy-- with all its serious dimensions--will make the bestial usurpers regret and refrain from greater crime and slaughter. It is precisely for this reason that a seething wave of protests, strikes, and uprisings has erupted all over occupied Palestine and without any regard for the treacherous compromising faction, the Palestinians are prepared to tackle the Zionists decisively. It seems highly unlikely that the deterrent and defensive actions by Israel will prove effective in combating this tidal wave of fury and general hatred in the occupied territories. The closure of the al-Ibrahimi shrine and promises of reparations cannot heal the wounded sensitivities of the Muslims, nor can it lessen the extent of the protest. By pledging to pay reparations, Israel has resorted to a new ploy, that, on the one hand it can carry out the butchery of Palestinian Muslims, and on the other hand it can pay reparations as blood money. In this manner, Israel is in fact paying blood money for its own victims so that it can continue perpetrating its crimes with a free hand. In fact, by offering to pay compensation, the Zionists are diverting the issue from its main path and are attempting to depict it as an accidental and unwanted occurrence, while it is really a preplanned and willful action in which the Israeli armed forces certainly played the primary role. In addition, such a proposal also indicates that pressure is so great on Israel that it is forced to promise compensation and naturally the Palestinians will not agree and will not settle for anything less than the impeachment and penalizing of the agents of this crime and by revenge on the savage Zionists.
