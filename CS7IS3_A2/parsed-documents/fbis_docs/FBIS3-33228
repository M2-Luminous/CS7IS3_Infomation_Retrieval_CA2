[Begin Sosa recording] He was never a candidate. So far there are no candidates and that is something that must be determined by the president of the Republic. There are some persons who, considering the superintendent's resignation, could occupy the position. I believe that at this moment it would not be fitting for me to start speculating on names. As I said, that will be determined by the president after discussing it with the Senate of the Republic. [end recording] The finance minister's statements were made after his five hour interpellation before the National Congress. He also referred to the resignation by Banco Latino's intervention board and stated that the creation of an administration board will not undermine the authority of those who are already involved. According to him, it is only a manner of expediting the entire process. In conclusion, he did not discard the possibility that Fogade's [Deposit Guarantee Fund] financial assistance to some banks could be eliminated. [Begin Sosa recording] We would first have to determine what the situation is, because transient financial assistance which, let's say, does not increase, could help to stabilize a specific situation. However, I believe that financial assistance that is constantly on the rise will undoubtedly lead us to at least some type of intervention. [end recording]
