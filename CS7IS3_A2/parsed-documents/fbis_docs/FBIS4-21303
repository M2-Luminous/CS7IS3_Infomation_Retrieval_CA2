The gang was engaged in the cultivation, processing, and trafficking of drugs, and over 110 persons were involved in the case. On 6 October 1991, police at the Xuzhou railway station arrested Xue Xibin [5641 0823 2430], a factory worker in Donghai County, carrying 350 g of opium. This led to a two-year investigation by a special task force set up by the Jinan Railway Public Security Bureau and the Xuzhou Railway Public Security Office. The investigation revealed that since May 1990, Xue, his partners Wang Ping [3769 1627] and Liu Sicang [0491 1835 0221] (both also from Donghai county), and others had been engaged in opium trafficking using the rail system, selling a total of 20,075.5 g in Henan and other areas. With the approval of the Supreme People's Court, Xue, Wang, and Liu were sentenced to death. Two gang members received the death penalty with a suspended sentence, while 16 others received either life imprisonment or sentences ranging from two to 15 years.
