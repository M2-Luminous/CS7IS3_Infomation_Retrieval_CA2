Speaking at a rally in southeastern Turkey, Turkes said that the PKK was receiving foreign support in its terror actions. "The PKK says that it will make Turkey a bloodbath on the March 21 Nevruz haliday. It will not be able to do so. ``All of us are brothers, come from the same ancestors. The terrorists are trying to force our citizens in east and southeastern Turkey to flee to other regions, so as to realize their dreams of greater Armenia,'' he said.
