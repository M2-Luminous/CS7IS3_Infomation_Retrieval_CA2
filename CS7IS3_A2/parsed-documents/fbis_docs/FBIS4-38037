The enemy's violation of the land and people; its resorting to acts of kidnapping, murder, and destruction; its breaching all international laws, norms, and charters; its pursuit of a policy of organized terrorism and brutal aggression against our nation; and its disregard for world public opinion are all the result of its feeling of impunity under the U.S. umbrella. The United States pays no attention to laws and human rights slogans when the issue concerns "Israel's" violations and attacks. The justifications used by the U.S. Administration to prevent the condemnation of "Israel" are based on the need to continue the peace talks and to disregard anything that might obstruct or jeopardize these talks. This means releasing "Israel's" hand to commit more crimes and attacks as long as the victim has no right to complain and the international community is not obliged to condemn the aggressor. This also means the shedding of more of our blood and our people's blood on the altar of negotiations. Concern for continuing these negotiations has become a cover and a justification for the continuing and unrelenting Israeli aggression. All this is taking place under the shadow of a domineering and tyrannical U.S. policy that is persistently trying to control UN bodies and organizations including the UN General Assembly. The United States wants to use the United Nations to serve its policy and to make it an obedient tool condoning the injustice and aggression practiced by "Israel" with U.S. support and protection. The United States has disregarded all international rules and norms and has adopted a policy of double standards. This is proved by the United States not applying the same international rules and laws on "Israel" that it firmly applies in other regions and countries. The U.S. claim that what is taking place is between "Israel" and Hizballah and does not concern the Lebanese Government is a false claim. It can be refuted by the wonderful solidarity displayed toward the Resistance and with which Lebanon--its Government, political forces, and people, with their various groups and tendencies--responded to the Israeli crime. This proves that the Resistance has become the mecca of all Lebanon--Government, parties, and people. This Resistance is the truest expression of the entire Lebanese people's rejection of the Israeli occupation and their position, standing in one trench in confronting it and foiling its plans against the land, sovereignty, civil peace, and all the foundations of national unity among all the Lebanese. We ask: How long will decisions be imposed on people and how long will injustice and aggression be practiced against them? How long will international political and economic organizations remain hostage to the United States such that they have become establishments and offices appended to the U.S. State Department?
