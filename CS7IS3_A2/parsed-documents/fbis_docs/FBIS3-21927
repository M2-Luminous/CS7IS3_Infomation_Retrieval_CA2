This was achieved through an operation conducted in the town of Tijuana, Baja California, during which Federal Judicial Police agents captured two presumed drug dealers attempting to smuggle the shipment into the United States. The ephedrine, a chemical component essential for processing cocaine base and producing amphetamines, was being transported by Martin Flores and Carlos Denis Diaz, who had received the product from Guadalajara, Jalisco. There is another individual implicated in trafficking with this drug, named "Ezequiel," who is now being sought by federal agents. The drugs were located in the parcel section of the Tijuana Bus Terminal. The two presumed drug dealers went there, picking up the drugs to be delivered and later smuggled into the United States. When making their preliminary statements, the subjects under arrest admitted that this was the fifth time that they had engaged in this type of work, claiming that they were each to receive $500 for the service. The Federal Public Prosecutor's Office ordered a detailed investigation to locate the one or more owners of the chemical, which is used for the so-called "cuts" in cocaine, providing the drug with a greater stimulating potential. Based on the investigations being conducted by the social representative, it will be determined today whether the two presumed accused have connections with cocaine distribution rings established in Mexico and the United States.
