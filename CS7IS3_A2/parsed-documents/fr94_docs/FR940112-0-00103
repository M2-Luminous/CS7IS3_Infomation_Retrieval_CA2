FR940112-0-00103 FR940112-0-00022 Conclusion To the extent that this amendment will have an economic effect on the airlines and the general public, it will only be a minor, positive one. Therefore, the FAA has determined that this amendment involves a regulation that is not a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 or significant under the Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). Since no small entities would be affected by the rule, the FAA has determined, and it is certified that under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the rule will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities. The economic impact is so minimal that it does not warrant a full regulatory evaluation.
