Welcome to this special interview with the Constitutional president of the Republic, Ramiro De Leon Carpio. Yesterday marked 365 days since President De Leon Carpio took office and, of course, the Guatemalan people would like to know what has truly happened during those 365 days. What has the president, his cabinet and his work team really done to benefit the Guatemalan people. [passage omitted] Mr. President, welcome to this edition of "Channel Seven News." Thanks for accepting the invitation to talk, not with me, but with the Guatemalan people. I believe the events at the end of May and early June 1993 are still fresh in the minds of the Guatemalan people. Perhaps the best question to begin this interview with President De Leon Carpio might be, what was the condition of the country when you took office on 6 June 1993? What caused this situation? [De Leon] I believe that is a very scientific way of establishing whether or not there have been achievements. First, you must know what the situation was, where Guatemala was headed, how President Serrano was ruling the country, what was happening, and what the situation was when President De Leon Carpio took office. This is the logical, fundamental way to profoundly and seriously examine my first year in office. I would divide the answer into five aspects: press, international affairs, and the three broad areas of policy, economics and social issues. I will broach the first. I was presented with a country that had a terrible international image, a Guatemala that was totally isolated from the international community precisely because of President Serrano Elias' disruption of institutional order. This total isolation was nefarious and negative. This was the international situation I encountered. Regarding the press, I say the news media are the expression of fundamental freedom, of individual and social human rights which are very important because they are the pillars of democracy. Remember how things were a year ago in May? The government and the president directly harassed not only reporters but the news media. There was total disruption and incidents took place that had never taken place in Guatemalan history, not even during the dictatorships. This was the situation I encountered in these two aspects. Regarding the broad areas of policy, economics, and social issues, I would begin with policy because the people had recently rescued themselves from the abyss into which President Serrano was leading them with his disruption of institutional and constitutional order, his anarchy, and his extreme authoritarianism. The people demanded a reform and a reorganization of the three branches of state, and they staged demonstrations. In the political sphere there was always an urgent desire to cleanse the government and to break with the past. We were in a state of political upheaval that united various sectors, but my arrival was politically motivated. I arrived at the presidency to rescue institutional order and this is what I encountered. In the economic aspect, inflation rose to 14 percent in 1992 and the situation in 1993 was quite difficult. The treasury was totally empty, and there were debts in every area. To mention a few, in the area of health, the hospitals had a debt of 130 million quetzales, the internal debt surpassed 900 million quetzales, the government had been unable to reduce the foreign debt and the international monetary reserve did not amount to $500 million. In other words, the situation was chaotic. The general public may not have noticed, but when the president took office he faced an empty treasury, debts, and of course, the distrust of investors. There was no security for foreign or local investors, our economic situation was totally outdated, and prices for staple products were in utter disarray. As for social matters, the country was in total upheaval. Remember that a year ago vans and buses were being burned in the streets, a student was murdered by a deputy's bodyguard, and there were demonstrations and riots. The social upheaval was palpable. People in the countryside were not participating in social projects. There was a total lack of confidence in the government for its misuse of state resources and the millions it spent from secret funds. All in all, it was a chaotic situation in every respect: economic, political, and social. I must add that overnight, 72 hours before taking office -- I did not even know I was going to be president -- I encountered this difficult situation. Analysts say that no president has ever taken office in Guatemala under such unfavorable conditions. It has been a tremendous challenge, and to answer your question, that was the situation I faced. [Gudiel] There was definitely chaos in Guatemala. Mr. President, 365 days have gone by. You have served one year of the two and a half you will be in office. After 365 days, have things improved? What is your opinion? Briefly, please, because I have many questions to ask you before our viewers start calling. [De Leon] Very well. Along the same lines I mentioned, I believe our international situation is totally different. After being internationally isolated, Guatemala is now recognized by the international community. I might add, without false modesty, that the Guatemalan president has considerable prestige among the international community. The international community supports and backs the Guatemalan president and the administration over which I am honored to preside. The isolation I found has been totally reversed. [Gudiel, interrupting] Nevertheless, and forgive me for interrupting, Mr. President, but you mentioned five points and now you are going to defend them. We are on the first one. [De Leon] I am not going to defend them. I am going to make a comparison. I answered your question about the condition in which I found the country in terms of those five aspects, and now I will explain the current situation. [Gudiel] You will compare one with the other. What about the travel warning? [previous two words in English] [De Leon] Well, that is something very special. The travel warning was issued for Guatemala because of certain situations and due to incidents like the recent explosion of a terrorist bomb at a residence. [Gudiel, interrupting] We opened our newscast with that information today. [De Leon] Exactly. It is part of an internal destabilization plan because that is the only way to delay the attainment of peace. The travel warning is the result of a series of manipulated situations, and we are struggling against them. Their origins are not in the international community but in sources that are foreign to the states. When I say that upon arrival I found Guatemala to be internationally isolated, it is because international doors were totally closed. [Gudiel] It pleased us very much to see the Costa Rican president in Peten yesterday. [De Leon] That was a truly historic event. In the past we had to go to Costa Rica. Guatemalan presidents would wait for invitations from Costa Rica because it was the only democratic country. It was a luxury for a Guatemalan president to go to Costa Rica. That, however, is no longer the case. The Costa Rican president asked me to invite him on a working tour and he visited Peten. This proves -- and here I speak of Asia, Europe, and Latin America -- that there is support for the president and the administration. In short, Guatemala is no longer isolated from the concert of nations. That is the situation from the international viewpoint. As far as the news media are concerned, I will say little because the differences are obvious. Following the harassment suffered by the news media in the past in what I would describe as a war waged by [former] President Serrano with an authoritarianism unprecedented in Guatemalan history, after those attacks on reporters, the news media, and so forth, there is now full and absolute freedom of the media and expression. There are isolated problems. Problems exist in Guatemala as they do everywhere in the world, but freedom of the media and of expression are pillars of democracy that I defend and practice. This government has been and will continue to be tolerant, because I believe in freedom of expression and of the media. Let's move on and discuss the three main areas. As for the political aspect, our main problem was the disruption of constitutional order. That order has never been as preserved, strengthened, and supported as it is now by the Guatemalan Army. As I said before, and because we are talking in such a [word indistinct], pleasant, honest, and open manner, I am not losing any sleep over a possible coup d'etat. That is entirely out of the question. [Gudiel, interrupting] Do you sleep soundly? [De Leon] I sleep very soundly, particularly if I am exhausted after a hard day of work. Economic and social problems keep me awake and concern me, but the prospect of a coup d'etat does not. I am categorical about this because coups d'etat are a part of our history that we have overcome. All Army officers are aware of their professional responsibility and the role they should play in a democracy. This circumstance, which did not exist when I took office, has helped preserve and reinforce constitutional order. Previously the country's constitutional order was undermined by the rupture created by this organization. People also asked me to purge state organizations; that is, the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. That purge is nearly a reality. Although I took the long way -- the legal and democratic path which I had to choose -- we are only two months away from a new Congress and two and a half months from a new Supreme Court of Justice. In sum, the political problems I encountered when I became president are close to a resolution. It has taken some time, if you will, but the legal path required time. This choice led to the constitutional reforms which -- despite criticisms against the referendum -- are being implemented and are yielding results. I will give you several brief examples. First, the constitutional reform is yielding results in terms of pretrial proceedings. For the first time in Guatemalan history, a deputy has been separated from his post. It was made possible by a change in procedure. Now the deputies cannot be judges and defendants at the same time. The organization has changed. This has helped eliminate the prevailing political impunity. Discretionary funds are another example. The president eliminated confidential expenditures last year, and this year those funds were transferred to areas such as family and education. Discretionary funds were entirely eliminated from all state organizations by a constitutional reform. In addition to being an extremely significant and unprecedented step in Latin America, this step precludes corruption because, as we all know, discretionary funds often give rise to acts of corruption. On the other hand, a constitutional reform also gave full autonomy and independence to the prosecutor, attorney general, and comptroller general. There is also a reform regarding the prohibition of domestic debt without collateral and the nonissuance of currency without reserves. At that time people demanded several constitutional reforms. Now the situation is different. As for the economic aspect, I cannot give you many details, but at the end of 1993, inflation was at 11.6 percent, which is a substantial reduction from 14 percent in 1992. This year we are aiming for a 10-percent inflation rate. The foreign debt has been reduced by $174 million. The internal debt of the Bank of Guatemala to the central government has been reduced by $484 million quetzales. The national currency has been stabilized and strengthened. In addition, for the first time in many years, international monetary reserves have reached $801 million. The situation is different despite the widely known difficulties and circumstances. As for the social aspect, I found a nation immersed in total chaos and without any confidence to participate. Now there is administrative and economic decentralization and a drive toward increasing social participation. Above all, based on the principles of honesty, clarity, and authority, the Guatemalan community participates in social projects. As a result, and based on available information, I think the situation has changed. In terms of investment, operational costs represented 60 to 65 percent of the budget, yet the government was never able to reach a 30-percent investment level. It was never able to invest more than 20 percent. Now the budget has a 28-percent investment level and 50-percent operational costs. In 12 months we have been able to do what was not achieved in many decades: invest 67 percent of the full amount programmed. Previous governments were only able to achieve 35 to 40 percent. That is the difference between the previous and current situation. [passage omitted] [Gudiel] Mr. President, you were a renowned human rights ombudsman. Everyone knows that you did an excellent job, and that is why virtually everyone asked that you be chosen to replace President Serrano Elias. What is the current human rights situation? For example, what is the status of the notorious obligatory military recruitment, an everyday news story that receives a lot of attention from the people and the media. What is your view on this issue, and how can this recruitment, which is undoubtedly needed to maintain the Army, be done without harming the rights of the citizens being recruited? [De Leon] With regard to an overall reply on human rights, I am not the one to give this answer. It is the institution in charge of this matter, it is the human rights ombudsman; he will issue a report at the year's end. There is also Monica Pinto at the international level. We currently have a list of recommendations from [name indistinct] as well as from Monica Pinto. We are trying to comply to the greatest extent all the recommendations. We believe that at the end of the year we will have a very, very positive report. Of course, this does not mean that no more individual human rights violations will occur; the main source of these violations is political violence, the internal armed conflict. I pointed this out when I was ombudsman, and I repeat this now. Until this internal armed conflict is solved, the main cause, the main source of these individual human rights violations will not be eliminated. I am referring to the right to life, physical integrity, dignity, security, freedom, and so forth. Now, as far as economic, cultural, and social human rights are concerned, these continue being violated, however, here I am referring to a more structural matter. Nevertheless, what is true is that no government can accuse this government of engaging in systematic violations, as a result of a government policy, a state policy. This no longer exists. Here I make a comparison once again. When I took office I found a situation of human rights violations, I dare not say as a government policy because at that time a policy such as that no longer existed. Currently, however, there is a very big difference. Here I am going to repeat the words I spoke as ombudsman about human rights violations. There can be no conditional response to this if human rights have more or less been violated. Either they are respected or they are violated. In this case, I seek to leave my successor a legacy of a nation where human rights are totally respected. In those cases -- as happens in any part of the world -- where a human right is violated, the person responsible must be tried and punished, no matter who it is and what institution he belongs to. This is in broad terms. I would like to say that for me it is very satisfactory that the situation is different, even though there are still isolated problems. With regard to military recruitment, in principle, as I have always said, this is a right but at the same time a duty. This is set out in the Constitution, it is not the Army that decides there must be recruitment, rather this is a constitutional duty. This is stated in the Constitution. There have been three types of problems -- I pointed this out when I was ombudsman -- and they continue occurring although on a much lower scale. We have data, statistics on these problems. One has to do with discrimination, the second is the methods used, and the third has to do with cases in which minors are involved. One must acknowledge.... [pauses] the very defense minister acknowledged the other day, that there are problems, of course errors exist. Nevertheless, this year a very special phenomena has occurred. That is, in the majority of the departments there has been a large voluntary flow of young peasants enlisting. Maybe it is for the salary, or due to necessity, in any case they come of their own free will. We have statistics on this. This has avoided greater problems, although they continue to exist, this must be acknowledged. What are the solutions? One is in the law. There is a draft bill that was presented some time ago to the Congress; however, it has been placed on the back burner. I do not think there is any hope that this Congress will pass this law. [Gudiel] That will not be until after 14 August.... [De Leon, interrupting] That is a possibility. The solution is there, a law. Subsequently, as you said at the beginning of your question, we must take into account reality. The army anywhere in the world where it is organized constitutionally, as in Guatemala, is an army that requires recruitment. Logically this must be in a form regulated by the corresponding laws, and in this case it should be. Now, we must recall that there is still an internal armed confrontation going on. Anyone who says there should be no forced recruitment is either naive or wants the Army to not have the means to face a subversive group. He does not want to face the situation, and face an obligation, the goal for which the Army has been constitutionally created. That is, to maintain the nation's domestic peace and security. That is the reply to that question. Now I believe this is part of an overall situation we are experiencing that is drawing us closer to peace. As I did not touch the political aspect of this issue I want to take this opportunity to explain the peace process situation as it was one year ago and how it is now. A year ago this process was totally bogged down and we have never been so close to peace as now. An overall human rights agreement has been signed. This was the Gordian knot that one year ago did not allow the process to advance. A timetable has been signed. In this timetable there is a cease-fire slated for September. We have hopes that the cease-fire will take place before, we have hopes that the URNG will accept it taking place before. Nevertheless, by September there must be a demobilization and in December the signing of the peace agreement. [Words indistinct] there is a great difference. When I took office on 6 June, the process was totally bogged down. There was no credibility in the peace process. Currently we are one step from achieving peace; however, this is the most difficult step. This is why there currently is terrorism, this is why there is upheaval, this is why there is a series of created, provoked deteriorations. I fear that the current URNG philosophy, strategy -- given it is not prepared to join national political life -- is to prolong the situation. This is the reason for the acts of terrorism, this is the reason for the provoked upheavals, this is the reason the very xenophobia was created in some places. It was not by chance that these problems arose. I have taken this opportunity to touch on the issue of peace because it embodies the overall human rights agreement. It also draws us to something very important: that Guatemala can end the internal armed conflict that has been going on for more than three decades. This has left behind a balance of hundreds of thousands of dead, widows, orphans, shedding of tears, destruction, desolation, hate, and resentment. When the end of this armed conflict comes, we will be faced with an even more difficult task: for this to be a lasting peace. For this we must continue combating poverty, eliminating those possible causes that could give way to new discontent. Because in a country.... [Gudiel, interrupting] This is what practically gave origin to the problem.... [De Leon, interrupting] To some extent yes. At that time, it was a mixed political-ideological situation. Currently the flag could be merely economic. This is what must be avoided so that this current effort, ending the conflict and attaining peace, is for something. That is, that in our country all those dead, all that blood that was shed, not be repeated. That it be a lasting peace. This is why we must give macroeconomics a human face, a social face. We must combat poverty, this is the core of our government program. Take those small projects, which I mentioned a while ago and commented on by some, those 12,000 almost 13,000 small projects we concluded in 12 months. Those projects have not only supplied potable water, electricity, pedestrian crossings, telephone service, and others, but they have given back hope. This is the most important; the return of hope to a people who had lost it. Before this hope was returned they were probably easier prey to the guerrilla's language, to their words. This no longer holds true. Currently a hamlet such as [word indistinct] where potable water supply was taken, the leaders themselves said: Here there is not a remote possibility that someone will get involved in some [word indistinct] movement, in some guerrilla movement. We now realize that we can improve our standard of living; we can emerge from those situations of wantonness, if water is supplied, if electricity is supplied, if there is honesty, if there is social investment, such as we are currently doing.
