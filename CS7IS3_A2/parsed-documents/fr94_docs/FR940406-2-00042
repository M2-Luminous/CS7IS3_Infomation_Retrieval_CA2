FR940406-2-00042 FR940406-2-00022 Energy Information Administration Forms EIA&hyph;23, 23P and 64A, ``Oil and Gas Reserves Surveys'' AGENCY: Energy Information Administration, Department of Energy. ACTION: Notice of the Proposed Extension of the Forms EIA&hyph;23, ``Annual Survey of Domestic Oil and Gas Reserves,'' EIA&hyph;23P, ``Oil and Gas Well Operator List Update Report,'' and EIA&hyph;64A, ``Annual Report of the Origin of Natural Gas Liquids Production,'' and solicitation of comments. SUMMARY: The Energy Information Administration (EIA), as part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden (required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, Pub. L. No. 96&hyph;511, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ), conducts a presurvey consultation program to provide the general public and other Federal agencies with an opportunity to comment on proposed and/or continuing reporting forms. This program helps to ensure that requested data can be provided in the desired format, reporting burden is minimized, reporting forms are clearly understood, and the impact of collection requirements on respondents can be properly assessed. Currently, EIA is soliciting comments concerning the proposed extension of the Forms EIA&hyph;23, ``Annual Survey of Domestic Oil and Gas Reserves,'' EIA&hyph;23P, ``Oil and Gas Well Operator List Update Report,'' and EIA&hyph;64A, ``Annual Report of the Origin of Natural Gas Liquids Production.'' It is proposed that Forms EIA&hyph;23P and EIA 64A be extended without modification. For large operators reporting on Form EIA&hyph;23, the form will be modified to also collect estimates of reserves and production associated with enhanced oil recovery methods and nonconventional gas. This proposed modification reflects the growing importance to U.S. oil and gas supplies of enhanced oil recovery and nonconventional gas. To offset the incremental burden associated with this proposed modification, the requirement to report indicated additional reserves on Form EIA&hyph;23 will be discontinued. For small operators reporting on Form EIA&hyph;23, the form will be extended without modification. DATES: Written comments must be submitted by May 6, 1994.
