The essence of the plan is decentralisation, a concept close to the heart of a Northern Leaguer like Gnutti. A user-friendly network of outlets will be set up nationwide, providing businessmen with the information they often complain is slow in coming from central offices in Rome, on tax breaks, funding, law changes, and work opportunities. For the preparatory period, Gnutti said a six-month extension would be necessary for staff seconded into the Industry Ministry from other departments including the now-defunct southern development agency. After that, staff will be taken on to man the new outlying offices. Boosting small and medium-sized industry is a key goal of the new-look ministry, Gnutti told the press. His targets include: stepping up relations with the anti-trust authority; enhancing protection for the consumer; transferring technology to small and medium firms; seeking out new markets; boosting funding to smaller firms; fostering broader share ownership; and pressing on with ministry re-organisation. On privatisations, Gnutti confirmed the government's intention to press ahead with the disposals of INA [National Insurance Institute], ENI [National Hydrocarbons Corporation], ENEL [National Electric Power Board]. On EFIM [Manufacturing Industry Holding and Financial Company], he recalled that the liquidation deadline is January 25, and revealed that problems in the armaments, rail and aluminium sectors had emerged from talks with liquidator Alberto Predieri.
