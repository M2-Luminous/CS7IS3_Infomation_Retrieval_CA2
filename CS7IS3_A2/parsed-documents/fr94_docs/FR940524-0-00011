FR940524-0-00011 FR940524-0-00006 FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY 44 CFR Part 61 RIN 3067&hyph;AC24 National Flood Insurance Program; Insurance Rates AGENCY: Federal Insurance Administration, FEMA. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This final rule increases the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) chargeable (subsidized) rates, which apply to all structures located in communities participating in the Emergency Program of the NFIP and to certain structures in communities in the Regular Program of the NFIP. The rule is to help the NFIP satisfy the premium requirements for the historical average loss year and to reduce the general taxpayers' burden with a more equitable sharing of the costs of flood losses between general taxpayers and the insureds. EFFECTIVE DATE: October 1, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Charles M. Plaxico, Federal Emergency Management Agency, Federal Insurance Administration, 500 C Street, SW., Washington, DC 20472, (202) 646&hyph;3422. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On March 21, 1994, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) published in the Federal Register (Vol. 59, Page 13298) a proposed rule to increase the chargeable (subsidized) rates. The chargeable (subsidized) rates, for which an increase was proposed, are the rates applicable to structures located in communities participating in the Emergency Program of the NFIP and to certain structures in communities in the Regular Program of the NFIP. They are countrywide rates for two broad building type classifications which, when applied to the amount of insurance purchased and added to the expense constant and Federal policy fee, produce a premium income somewhat less than the expense and loss payments incurred on the flood insurance policies issued on that basis. The funds needed to supplement the inadequate premium income are provided by the National Flood Insurance Fund. The subsidized rates are promulgated by the Administrator for use under the Emergency Program (added to the NFIP by the Congress in Section 408 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1969) and for use in the Regular Program on construction or substantial improvements started before the effective date of the initial Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) or on or before December 31, 1974 (this additional grandfathering was added to the NFIP by Congress in section 103 of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973), whichever is later. FEMA proposed to increase the chargeable or subsidized rates as follows: ‚ê£ 1Type of structure 1Rates per year per $100 coverage on 2Structure 2Contents (1) Residential $0.60 $0.70 (2) All other (including hotels and motels with normal occupancy of less than 6 months in duration) .70 1.40 For comparison, the current subsidized rates are as follows:
