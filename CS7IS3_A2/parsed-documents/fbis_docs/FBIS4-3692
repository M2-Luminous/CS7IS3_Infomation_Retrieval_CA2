Akayev delivered an ebullient speech first. He spoke highly of Premier Li Peng's speech in Tashkent and said: China's four cardinal principles for developing relations with the Central Asian nations have deeply impressed these countries, including Kyrgyzstan; they are in the interests of the peoples of all Central Asian nations and will have a far-reaching impact on maintaining peace and stability in the region. He said: Li Peng's remarks that China will always be a good friend and neighbor of all Central Asian nations reached every family in the region within a couple of days. Akayev added: The whole world knows that under the guidance of Deng Xiaoping, the reverend chief designer, reform and opening up have brought about astonishing economic development in China in the late 20th century. He praised China for having found the correct path of development and having become a successful model of revitalizing the economy among developing countries. Premier Li Peng said in his reply: "My visit to four Central Asian countries is aimed at deepening understanding, promoting friendship, and expanding development. Judged by the conditions in the three countries I have visited, this goal will surely be achieved." He said: "His excellency the president has just highly evaluated China's achievements over the past decade or so, and I extend my sincere gratitude for his remarks. However, I would also like to say that China has indeed undergone some significant changes, but we have also met with some difficulties and problems in the course of forging ahead. We have the confidence that, under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee with President Jiang Zemin as the core, we will overcome one difficulty after another and constantly push our cause forward." Li Peng said: Situations differ in various countries; all countries should search for a course of development suitable to their respective conditions, and Kyrgyzstan is doing this presently. He said: It is hard for a young country which has just become independent to avoid having some difficulties, and "I believe that the Kyrgyz people have the ability and wisdom to overcome the temporary difficulties, to constantly achieve fresh progress on the path of development, and to gradually realize prosperity." Li Peng said: The towering and giant Tian Shan will not cut off the friendship between the peoples of China and Kyrgyzstan; it should become a link connecting the two countries. China will always live in a friendly manner with Kyrgyzstan and other Central Asian nations, as well as its northern neighbors such as Russia, and it will always seek common development through mutual benefit and cooperation. Zhu Lin, Premier Li Peng's wife; Ismail Amat, state councillor and minister in charge of the State Nationalities Affairs Commission; Qi Huaiyuan, director of the Office of Foreign Affairs under the State Council; and others were invited to the banquet. Also attending the banquet were President Akayev's wife; Prime Minister Dzhumagulov and his wife; Supreme Soviet Chairman Sherimkulov and his wife, and other high-ranking Kyrgyz officials.
