The man then turned the gun on himself and committed suicide. One Hebron doctor said 16 Palestinians were certified dead in a Hebron hospital and another two in a hospital in east Jerusalem. More than 70 other were wounded. The killer apparently disguised himself in an Israeli Army uniform before opening up with an automatic rifle on the Moslem faithful who turned out in large numbers for Friday prayers during the fasting month of Ramadan. The army imposed a curfew on Hebron and closed off the area of the Tomb, which is holy to Jews and Moslems alike and crowded every morning. Scuffles broke out in the complex on Thursday evening as Israelis celebrated the start of Purim, a holiday marking the deliverance of Jews from a massacre in Persia. Police Minister Moshe Shahal condemned the slaughter. "I condemn in the strongest possible way these murders, whatever the nationality of the person who committed them," he said. Palestinian militants declared a strike on the Gaza Strip in memory of the dead and the Koran, the Moslem holy book, was read out in the mosques, a correspondent reported. It was the worst killing ever by Jewish settlers, who in July 1983 shot dead four Palestinian students in Hebron. Border police shot dead 20 Palestinians on Temple Mount in the Old City of Jerusalem in October 1990. The Tomb complex, which houses a mosque, fell under Israeli control in the 1967 Middle East war and has since been shared by the two religions. Hebron has always been one of the tensest of Palestinian towns where 500 Jews live among 70,000 Arabs. Another 5,000 Jews live in the adjacent settlement of Qiryat Arba'. In Hebron, Palestinian protestors smashed an AFP photographer's car with rocks. Before Friday's killings, 1,180 Palestinians had died from Israeli bullets since the intifadah or uprising began in December 1987. Over the same period 203 Israelis have been killed by Palestinians. An anonymous telephone caller to AFP in Jerusalem claimed responsibility for the killing in the name Jewish extremists. The caller said the massacre was to avenge the December 6 shooting by Islamic fundamentalists of an Israeli settler and his son, Mordekhay and Shalom Lapid, in Hebron. The caller said he represented the "Zealots of the God of Israel", an unknown group. An AFP photographer reported that violent clashes erupted in Hebron between Palestinians and soldiers who had opened fire. At the city's Al-Ahli hospital dead bodies were still arriving. "The dead and wounded are still being brought in," said photographer Patrick Baz. "A small child was just brought in dead from bullet wounds. He was wrapped in a blood-stained blanket."
