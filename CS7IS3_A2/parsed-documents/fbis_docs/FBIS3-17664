It is not ruled out that this request will be satisfied in the near future, and as early as September, a Belarusian delegation will be able to participate as a full member in the Second Conference of the Interparliamentary Union. This was announced today by Supreme Soviet Chairman Mechyslaw Hryb during a news conference devoted to the results of the work of the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly's delegation at the First Conference of the Interparliamentary Union in Paris. He pointed out that the joining of the world's oldest interparliamentary organization by Belarus will be very beneficial in a political aspect, because of the possibility to draw more global attention to the problems of our Republic, including those connected with dealings with the aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster. Answering a question as to whether he discussed in Paris with Vladimir Shumeyko any possible scenarios for uniting monetary systems [with Russia], Mechyslaw Hryb answered in the negative. According to him, talks [on this topic] are in the competence of the Executive Branch -- namely, the Governments of Belarus and Russia.
