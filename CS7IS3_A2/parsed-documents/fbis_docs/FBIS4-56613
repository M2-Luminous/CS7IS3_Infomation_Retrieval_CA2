There were no casualties. It is not yet known when the plant will be reactivated. The fire, which occurred in a pipeline sector of the plant, has interrupted the long chemical process that will allow the plant to produce heavy water as of the beginning of 1996. Heavy water, which is used as a refrigerant for the turbines of nuclear plants, is currently being imported. According to Fernando Huici, an engineer for the National Atomic Energy Commission (CNEA), the accident occurred due to "the failure of a support holding up part of a pipeline carrying a synthesis gas made up of hydrogen and nitrogen." The official said "this gas, which has a temperature of 600 degrees centigrade, ignites when it comes into contact with the atmosphere, and what we call the "blowtorch effect" occurred -- in other words, a small fire." After stating that the plant's security has not been affected, Huici indicated that the plant's management has called in the Toese Company of Denmark, which installed the system, to carry out an inspection. Although the official believed that "the plant will be running again" within the next few days, he lamented the interruption of the operation. "We were at a very important stage in the process," he said. [passage omitted]
