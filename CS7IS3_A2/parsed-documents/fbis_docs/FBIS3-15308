Kravchuk confirmed he would not take part in the June presidential elections. Because he believes that an extremely complicated situation may take shape, when, even after a second round of parliamentary elections, the parliament will not be plenipotentiary due to the election of an incomplete Supreme Council. As a result, it will not be able to form a government. If, at the same time, the acting head of state starts an election campaign and also elections to local organs of executive power are conducted, then a total collapse of power in the country may become imminent with unpredictable consequences. Thus, out of the two possible variants -- to abandon everything and proceed to presidential elections, or, showing responsibility for the situation in the country, not to do so -- L. Kravchuk opted for the latter. Even though Leonid Makarovych [Kravchuk] stated that political considerations had been the main ones in his decision, one should not rule out moral aspects either. "In no other country of the world will you hear such dirty slander, remarks unworthy of cultured people, and provocations with regard to the person of president, as I hear both within the walls of our parliament and outside it," said L. Kravchuk. Is it possible that he will revise his decision? Even though the president did not give a straightforward answer, he remarked that the decision depends upon many factors. In particular, it depends on the election of a plenipotentiary parliament and the formation by the latter of a new government. It is also necessary, stressed L. Kravchuk, to determine what president will be elected and with what powers. Unless we do this, there again will be a power struggle between the legislative and executive power structures. In Leonid Makarovych's opinion, the same must be done with regard to the heads of local power structures. Even prior to elections, the candidates must know their rights and duties. For this, it is necessary to adopt a special law. "Many of your political opponents see Ukraine's economic difficulties in its course toward independence and demand that all ties with Russia be restored and that the `Belarusian variant' be introduced in our country. What do you think of this?," a HOLOS UKRAYINY correspondent asked L. Kravchuk. The restoration of all ties, believes the president, will mean the return to or restoration of the Soviet Union, because the old structure of industry will remain unchanged. Today, this is absurd. Even [Russian President] B. Yeltsin pointed out in a recent speech before parliament that Russia must produce everything the Russians need. The same applies to Ukraine and the whole of the CIS. In other words, while building states and new economic structures, it is necessary to create a common market of the CIS countries and to resolve, in a coordinated manner, both economic and political questions. L. Kravchuk did not support the idea of introducing the "Belarusian variant" in Ukraine. Even if Russia had agreed to introduce a ruble zone in our country, stressed Kravchuk, it would have demanded such concessions as would totally eliminate our political and economic independence. What is the president's attitude toward the idea of Ukraine's federalization? In answering this question, L. Kravchuk pointed out that, historically, a unitary state took shape in our country. That is why, there is no sense in deliberately dividing it into federative lands. On the other hand, he stressed, Ukrainian regions must have extensive independence in questions of budget, administration of state property, and so on. Speaking about the Crimea, the president considers the 1990 decision on granting the peninsula the status of autonomy was correct. "If that had not been done," said L. Kravchuk, emphasizing that it was the first time that he had spoken so openly about it, "in 1990, there existed a real threat that the Supreme Council of the former USSR would adopt a decision on separating the Crimea from Ukraine. Today, the situation is different. Especially after signing the Tripartite Statement, in accordance with which both the United States and Russia made a commitment to respect Ukraine's territorial integrity. As regards relations with the present Crimean leadership, it is necessary, believes Leonid Makarovych, to proceed along the road of mutual understanding, and not confrontation. At the same time, he stated, any actions aimed at separating the Crimea will be regarded as illegal with corresponding consequences. This crucial political issue must be taken into account by the Crimean authorities. At the journalists' request, the president also expressed his opinion on problems of privatization in Ukraine and our society's emergence from the crisis. At the end of the meeting, L. Kravchuk called upon all citizens of Ukraine to take part in elections. In his opinion, we must not allow chaos to prevail. Because it is a road toward conflicts and confrontations.
