The visit, it adds, comes within the context of Egypt's continuous efforts for peace and security in the Arab region in the eastern Mediterranean and its eagerness to defuse inter-Arab differences. In its editorial today, Tuesday, the paper says that Musa's hope for more open Arab relations in 1994 stems from Egypt's belief in the unity and harmony of Arab interests. It notes that Egypt is conducting preventive diplomacy at the Arab level in general and at the Jordanian-Palestinian level in particular. The paper explains that Egypt is always open to Arab cooperation within the context of mutual respect and nonintervention in internal affairs. It affirms that negotiations on peace in the eastern Mediterranean requires the Arabs to maintain unity. The paper says everyone must realize that Arab reconciliation at this time is vital to achieving a just and comprehensive peace and that this goes beyond the post-peace phase to building modern Arab economic resources.
