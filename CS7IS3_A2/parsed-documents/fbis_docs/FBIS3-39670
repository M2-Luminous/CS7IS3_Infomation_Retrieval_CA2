The dispute escalated suddenly last week, after the Greek decision to close the port of Salonika to all trade destined for FYROM. Mr. Pangalos, whose country currently occupies the presidency of the European Union Council of Ministers, continued: "The European Commission has taken the initiative to send Hans Van den Broek to Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Yugoslavia -- FYROM] and then to Athens to assess the new situation in the region. (...) The Commission decided to ask for legal clarification enabling it to determine whether or not it should refer the case to the European Court of Justice." At Breydel (European Commission headquarters) it is considered that Greek sanctions against FYROM are incompatible with Community treaties. A Commission spokesman said on Monday: "The Greek decisions clearly break trading regulations." In this type of situation, the jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice requires that the sanctioning country must present evidence that it is subject to "law and public safety difficulties that it is unable to deal with," the spokesman said. The Greek minister, who chaired a meeting of the Twelve devoted mostly to FYROM and preparing for Tuesday's negotiations with the four candidate countries on Community enlargement, did not hide the fact that Greece had been the target of a running fire of criticism from its partners in the European Twelve, annoyed by the decision taken unilaterally by Athens and skeptical as to its legal basis. "Several countries have criticized the content of the Greek Government's decision and the way in which the Greeks announced it to their partners," he said at a news conference. Mr. Pangalos added, however, that "the Greek Government has decided to lay on the table all the legal arguments that justified its decision," although he did not say what these arguments were. The Greek minister merely gave an enigmatic allusion to excessive oil imports that seemed to suggest that Skopje would be reselling part of its purchases to Belgrade, thus bypassing the international embargo imposed on Serbia by the United Nations. He told journalists: "Twelve million tonnes of oil were sent (last year) from Salonika to FYROM, while FYROM itself can only use 5 million tonnes. It is up to you to decide where the remaining oil ends up."
