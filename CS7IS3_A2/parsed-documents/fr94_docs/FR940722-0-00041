FR940722-0-00041 FR940722-0-00013 By letter dated April 21, 1993 (administrative record No. ND&hyph;Q&hyph;01), North Dakota submitted a proposed amendment (``Amendment XVIII'') to its permanent program pursuant to SMCRA. North Dakota proposed this amendment in response to required program amendments at 30 CFR part 934.16 (l) and (y), published in the January 9, 1992, Federal Register (57 FR 827). In addition, North Dakota proposed State-initiated changes to the requirements for preblasting surveys and to NDCC chapter 38&hyph;14.1 reflecting 1992 changes to the Small Operator Assistance Program by the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;486) (Energy Policy Act) at sections 507 (c) and (h) of SMCRA. (For a document relating to the regulatory provisions proposed by North Dakota for preblasting surveys and small operator assistance, see an additional final rule Federal Register notice for the State of North Dakota published elsewhere in this issue.) The Director notes that Federal implementing regulations were published in a final rule Federal Register notice dated May 31, 1994, addressing, in part, the changes to the Small Operator Assistance Program by the Energy Policy Act (59 FR 28136). OSM published a proposed rule in the May 19, 1993, Federla Register (58 FR 29155) announcing receipt of the amendment and inviting public comment on its adequacy (administrative record No. ND&hyph;Q&hyph;7). The public comment period ended June 18, 1993. The public hearing, scheduled for June 14, 1993, was not held because no one requested an opportunity to testify. During its review of the amendment, OSM identified concerns relating to: (1) The proposed provisions at NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(4), regarding SOAP requirements for reimbursement of training costs and NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(5), regarding the prohibition of SOAP assistance to operations not subject to payment of AML fees; (2) the requirement for North Dakota to revise its implementing rules at North Dakota Administrative Code (NDAC) 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29 to be consistent with the proposed statutory revisions; and (3) the proposed revisions at NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;03(6), regarding the definition of ``road'' and NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;08, regarding the authorization for individual civil and criminal penalties under the coal exploration program. OSM notified North Dakota of these concerns by letter dated November 12, 1993 (administrative record No. ND&hyph;Q&hyph;14). By letter dated December 3, 1993, North Dakota responded by submitting additional explanatory information and a revised amendment (administrative record No. ND&hyph;Q&hyph;15). Specifically, North Dakota: (1) Stated, with respect to NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(4), SOAP requirements for reimbursement of training costs, that it will propose the necessary statutory change in the next legislative session; (2) provided a statement of clarification regarding North Dakota's intent with respect to its implementing rules for the revised SOAP statutory provisions; and (3) proposed to revise its rules at NDAC 43&hyph;02&hyph;01&hyph;20.3(c)(2), regarding the definition of ``road'' and NDAC 43&hyph;02&hyph;01&hyph;05, regarding the authorization for individual civil and criminal penalties under the coal exploration program. OSM announced receipt of the revised amendment in the December 28, 1993, Federal Register (58 FR 68617, administrative record No. ND&hyph;Q&hyph;16), and in the same notice, reopened and extended the public comment period on the adequacy of the amendment and the additional materials submitted. The comment period closed January 12, 1994. III.
