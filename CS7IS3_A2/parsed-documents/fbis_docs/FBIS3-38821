He said the balance of "risks and benefits" of an allied air strike to halt the carnage was now changing. But, after talks between European Union foreign ministers, he said it would be "irresponsible" to take a military decision. "These are not questions for diplomats but for soldiers. It is for NATO now. NATO governments have to get it right." He was speaking after the Prime Minister called for immediate, effective and "more muscular" action to halt the bombardment of civilians in Sarajevo. John Major believes that action in the wake of the atrocity which killed 68 people cannot wait for an overall settlement of the civil war in the former Yugoslavia. Mr Hurd had earlier endorsed an EU declaration expressing "revulsion" at the brutal shelling of civilians and calling for an early meeting of NATO ambassadors to consider the next step. "The aim should be to bring about the immediate lifting of the siege of Sarajevo, using all the means necessary, including the use of air power." The Foreign Secretary insisted the declaration was a step forward after last month's NATO statement reaffirming the allies readiness to use air strikes. But there was no agreement today on French demands for an ultimatum to be delivered to the warring factions -- pull your heavy arms out of Sarajevo or face air strikes in 30 days. Mr Hurd said the EU was not issuing any ultimatums today. NATO would go into the "specifics" and come up with proposals. There would need to be further consultation with the United Nations Secretary-General and a final decision would be taken by the governments of the 16 NATO countries. Mr Hurd said it was a question of re-assessing the risks and balances of military intervention. "What we have asked NATO to do, in the light of arguments and information we don't have here today, is to strike the balance anew. Up to now that balance has been against, but in my mind the balance is moving." Mr Hurd repeated his insistence that any use of force should be "forward looking." He went on: "It should not simply be retaliatory. It should be aimed at actually improving the present situation. The test of the use of force is whether it would do more good than harm, that is a test which NATO will have to apply. Clearly this does bring nearer a decision...to use force." Mr Hurd said the lack of exact proof about the origins of Saturday's devastating mortar bomb did not alter the fact that the carnage was brought about because of the way the Serbs have been harassing Sarajevo. "They are no longer in a position to persuade the world of the merits of their case." Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind will also discuss tougher action against the warring factions with the United Nations military chief Lieutenant General Sir Michael Rose in Bosnia today and report back to the Prime Minister. UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali has asked NATO to prepare for possible air strikes against artillery positions in and aournd Sarajevo. Representatives of NATO's members are set to meet in Brussels on Wednesday to discuss the request. [Mr Hurd said the risks still had to be weighed up before any ultimatum could be approved or issued -- the risks to UN troops on the ground, the risks to the continuation of the humanitarian effort and questions about targeting. He commented: "Lifting the siege is a worthwhile objective. There is an overwhelming feeling now that this has to be attempted, that the balance of risk and benefit has changed, that proposals which when tested before were found wanting need to be tested again with a view if possible of putting them into effect." British Government officials made it clear tonight that air strikes would not go ahead if the military planners considered the risks of failure too great, or that available targets were inappropriate.]
