In private, ministers insisted that the IRA was operationally weak and that the Republican movement would find it extremely difficult to renew its campaign of violence once a ceasefire was declared. The risks involved in wooing Sinn Fein, it was argued, were worth taking in order to exploit this opportunity. The IRA's activities in the past six months have made a mockery of these extravagant notions. Its campaign against civilians and troops has continued mercilessly; in March, its mortar assault on Heathrow took the security service completely by surprise. Soon after, an army helicopter was brought down by IRA fire in Co Armagh. Further "spectaculars" have been promised by Sinn Fein's president, Gerry Adams. On the other side of the sectarian divide, meanwhile, Loyalist violence has intensified horribly. The Loughin Island massacre nine days ago was a brutal reminder that the Loyalist gangs are no less murderous than their Republican adversaries. Even if Sinn Fein announces a temporary ceasefire in the next few days -- as some predict -- the paramilitary menace will remain. The bloodshed of the last six months is clear evidence that the existing programme of Anglo-Irish diplomacy is not enough. Constitutional reform in the North -- leading to the establishment of an administrative assembly by the end of the year -- should now be at the heart of Mr Major's Irish strategy. But so too should a full review of the security options open to ministers. Too often, the debate on Irish security is reduced to a sterile argument between the supporters and opponents of selective internment. In fact, this is only one of many options which ministers should be investigating -- and by no means the most important. There is still scope for improved cross-border arrangements, for instance. British helicopters and cars should be given greater freedom to pursue suspects into the Republic; the long-planned extradition reforms in the South should be completed as swiftly as possible; and liaison between the Royal Ulster Constabulary [RUC] and the Republic's security forces should be strengthened. As we report on today's Agenda page, there are also a number of basic legislative and procedural steps which could be taken to increase the pressure on the paramilitaries. Telephone intercept evidence could be made admissible in court, as it is in America. The existing powers of specialised investigators to interrogate suspects involved in terrorism and of the state to prosecute those who refuse to answer questions could be widened. The Italian "supergrass" system -- much admired by the RUC -- should be further explored by the British Government. The potential benefits of these proposals must, of course, be weighed against their potential impact upon civil liberties. But few ministers have shown a real interest in such questions when they have been raised by Unionist politicians or RUC officers. The Government remains committed to the belief that the problems of Ulster can be resolved by Anglo-Irish diplomacy, and to a fatalistic acceptance that the IRA can never be beaten. The first assumption is manifestly mistaken; and the second, contrary to ministers assertions, has yet truly to be tested.
