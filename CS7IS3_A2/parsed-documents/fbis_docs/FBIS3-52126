Seeing a need "to stop the civil clash and achieve some reconciliation to lay the foundations of internal peace and stability," the writer calls for dialogue among all the political forces in Egypt, including the Islamists. "The various challenges cannot seriously be confronted except through the effective participation of all the political and intellectual forces and trends," he maintains. Huwaydi calls for learning from the lesson of Algeria, which, "after two years of reluctance when the country paid dearly," concluded that it was futile to try to ignore the Islamic trend. He also notes contacts between the British Government and the Irish Republican Army, quoting British Prime Minister John Major as saying: "A responsible government can waste no chance for peace, no matter how remote." The writer criticizes the position of "some secular elite groups" in Egypt for "putting all Islamists in one basket and branding them with extremism and terrorism on the pretext that one group actually practices terrorism and the other--the moderate group--`hides' this evil intention." He says this characterization is not lacking in falsehood, fabrication, and slander. In his call for dialogue, the writer draws attention to three points: The Islamic trend and all political forces "denied legitimacy" must be invited to the national dialogue. "All political forces, irrespective of their trends, are partners in the homeland and therefore have a right to contribute to its present and future." He states: "The Islamic trend is emphasized here for many reasons, notably that it is the most powerful among the forces denied legitimacy. It is also the party targeted by most of the slander designed to exclude it from the dialogue. Participation in the dialogue gives that dialogue credibility and seriousness and may help it succeed eventually." The writer adds: "I do not hide my intellectual affiliation with that trend, affiliation with the project and the position, not beyond that." He goes on: "When I discuss the Islamic trend, I do not mean a specific group, as some of those who like to offer interpretations and fish in muddy waters may think. I am concerned about the principle." Finally, on the subjects of such a dialogue, the writer proposes: "First, democracy, second, democracy, and third, democracy."
