Last year, diplomatic relations became tense and Ankara and Bern drew their ambassadors back upon the outlawed separatist terrorist PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] organization's attack on Turkish Consulate in Bern. Dreifuss who came to Strasbourg to attend a Council of Europe ministerial meeting on drugs, speaking to an AA reporter said Switzerland was ready to improve bilateral relations with Turkey. Recalling Swiss justice authorities' request for investigation on Turkish Consulate in Bern, Dreifuss said Turkish Government did not want the investigation to be done and drew its ambassador back. Dreifuss defended the idea that it would be more difficult to put the separatist terrorist organization under control if they ban this organization adding that the Swiss Government will never allow any terrorist organization to create violence.
