Tang and Debbie Kuo] [Text] Brussels, Jan. 5 (CNA) -- A second delegation from the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species (CITES) is scheduled to visit Taiwan later this month to reassess Taiwan's wildlife conservation efforts. CITES spokesman Le Duc said the delegation will be comprised of four or five standing committee members, who will deliver a report to the full committee in March in Geneva, after which a final decision will be made on whether to recommend trade sanctions against Taiwan. The CITES standing committee voted 3-3 in a September meeting last year to postpone trade sanctions proposed by Britain's Environmental Investigation Agency, which claimed Taiwan had only perfunctorily cracked down on the illegal trade of rhino horn and tiger parts. The first cites delegation -- a lower-ranking trio -- visited Taiwan Nov. 28-Dec. 2. Its report was positive on Taiwan's conservation efforts. Murray Hosking, a CITES standing committee member from New Zealand, will lead the second CITES delegation to Taiwan around the end of January after the delegation visits South Korea, Le Duc said.
