FR940907-0-00034 FR940907-0-00015 The State sets forth the emission limits which shall apply to sources of VOC used in the coating of flat wood paneling. The State has replaced methods for determining VOC content in a coating with other recordkeeping and compliance requirements. The State has removed a provision allowing State discretion on equivalent emission rates and transfer efficiencies. The State lists exemptions to this rule. The State describes under what circumstances the use of an afterburner, used to achieve compliance with the emission limits in this rule, may be interrupted outside of the ozone season. G. Rule 621␣(Emission of Volatile Organic Compounds From Existing Metallic Surface Coating Lines) The State sets forth the emission limits for existing metallic surface coating lines and the compliance and recordkeeping requirements needed to demonstrate compliance with these limits. The State establishes an alternate limit for glass adhesion primer which is used to affix windshields to automobile frames. This alternate limit and its justification is discussed in this action's technical support document. The State has also replaced language providing State discretion and pertaining to equivalent emission rates and transfer efficiencies with new more explicit language which, in addition to being acceptable to the commission, must also receive EPA's approval before being incorporated into the SIP. The State lists exemptions to the provisions of this rule. In certain instances, the rule for coating of automobile, truck, and business machine parts (R 336.1632) may apply. When a source is complying with R 336.1632 it will not have to comply with R 336.1622. In addition to these specific exemptions, the State also provides broader based exemptions as well. With the addition of new exemptions, other existing exemptions were removed from the regulations. Any coating lines that were previously exempt under the exemptions that have been removed from the rules and are no longer exempt, now have 1 year from the State's adoption date of these rules to demonstrate compliance. The State has included provisions allowing the discontinuance of a natural gas-fired afterburner, used to meet the emission limits of this rule, between November 1 and March 31. H. Rule 622␣(Emission of Volatile Organic Compounds From Existing Components of Petroleum Refineries; Refinery Monitoring Program) The State has added to the list of components which require annual inspection those components that are ``difficult to monitor.'' The State has replaced the requirements for all inspections described in EPA 450/2&hyph;78&hyph;036 with Federal Reference Test Method 21. The State has defined leaking as an instance when a concentration of more than 10,000 ppm, by volume, as methane or hexane, is measured by Method 21. The State has added the following provisions: (i) If for 2 consecutive quarters 2 percent or less of the process valves in a given refinery unit are found to be leaking, then inspections may be skipped for 1 quarter. If for 5 consecutive quarters 2 percent or less of the process valves in a given refinery unit are found to be leaking, then inspections of process valves may be done annually. If a subsequent inspection shows that more than 2 percent of the process valves are leaking, quarterly inspections shall again be required. (ii) To determine the percent of valves leaking on a refinery unit, the total number of valves found to be leaking on the refinery unit during the specified monitoring period shall be divided by the number of valves required to be monitored. Under exemptions from the monitoring requirements of this rule, the State has removed an exemption for inaccessible valves but added an exemption for components that are unsafe to monitor, until monitoring personnel would no longer be exposed to immediate danger. The State has added the requirement that a current, written description detailing routine sampling procedures and listing the sealing devices involved shall be maintained and, upon request by the commission, shall be submitted to the commission in an acceptable format. I. Rule 623␣(Storage of Petroleum Liquids Having a True Vapor Pressure of More Than 1.0 psia, but Less Than 11.0 psia, in Existing External Floating Roof Stationary Vessels of More Than 40,000-gallon Capacity) The State has added to its list of exemptions for external floating roof stationary vessels, those vessels that are used to store jet naphtha (Jet B or JP&hyph;4).
