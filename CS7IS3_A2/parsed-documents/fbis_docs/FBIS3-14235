It was manifest in the refusal to have Jerusalem mentioned as an occupied Palestinian city. Likud lost in Israel but it still rules supreme in Washington. The Likud Party lost power in Israel but Likud logic still prevails in the U.S. political circles. In its approach to the Arab-Israeli conflict and especially the Palestinian question, the U.S. Administration appears to be more Israeli than the Israelis. It is a Likudist approach, putting pressure on the ruling Labor Party to rise to the level of its own extremism. The latest UN Security Council discussions presented a rare opportunity to demonstrate that U.S. (Likudist) position as it really is. In the beginning, and despite the Hebron massacre, Washington was opposed to the issuance of any resolution by the Security Council and just called for a statement by the chairman only condemning the massacre. It was acting on Israel's behalf. When it realized the magnitude of the Palestinian and Arab fury as a result of the massacre and the extent of the world's sympathy with the victims of the massacre, Washington kindly agreed to let the Security Council pass a resolution provided it did not condemn Israel. The Council would have had to condemn the massacre as an anonymous act by unknown people in an unknown place with unknown responsibility and unknown culpability. When the Palestinian side tried to link the massacre to the Geneva Convention on occupation and people under occupation, the United States opposed that and insisted that there should be no mention in the resolution of Jerusalem as an occupied city. It objected to that part of the resolution when voting took place. The United States wants to force the world to act on the basis that the Oslo agreement supersedes everything that came before it, that all the Security Council's resolutions on Jerusalem, the massacres, the deportations, and the settlements, are now null and void and no longer constitute terms of reference for the negotiations, and that the only terms of reference are the Oslo agreement and what the negotiators agree upon in their meetings. The Likudist character of the U.S. Administration is no illusion, nor is it an exaggeration. The Jewish lobby in the United States is openly pro-Likud. It had even opposed the Oslo agreement. Shim'on Peres, the architect of that agreement, had to go to Washington to persuade the Jewish lobby to accept it because it was in Israel's interest. Furthermore, the main Jewish figures in the U.S. Administration who are responsible for the handling of the Palestinian question, are also pro-Likud, from Dennis Ross to Martin Indyk. In addition to that Likudist line, the U.S. Administration is willing to change the Security Council from an international body to a secretariat attached to the White House. Voting on the massacre resolution was postponed 12 times. The postponements took place after phone calls from Warren Christopher to the U.S. representative at the Security Council. That representative (not the the Council's chairman) then announced these postponements to reporters. When asked by reporters: Are you disappointed? She replied: I am always disappointed -- having been transformed from being the representative of a superpower into a mere secretary receiving orders on the telephone. The U.S. position on the Security Council and on Jerusalem in particular is a dangerous position, very dangerous indeed, and its seriousness may even be greater than that of the massacre itself necessitating a general Arab awareness and a unified Arab stand rising to the level of the issue of Jerusalem and what it means to everyone. Dennis Ross was threatening Yasir 'Arafat when he told him that discussion of the issue of the settlements and international protection would bring down Rabin. In other words, it would bring Likud to power. Examined in depth, that was not an American threat but rather a U.S. wish and a hint as to what could happen in the future as the U.S. Administration prepares to implement the Likud designs fully.
