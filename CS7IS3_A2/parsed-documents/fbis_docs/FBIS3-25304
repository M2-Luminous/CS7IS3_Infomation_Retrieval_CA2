This was announced by the leader of the Conservative Party, Dr. Ferdi Hartzenberg. On the line now we have Amanda Visser. Good afternoon to you, Amanda. [Visser] Good afternoon. [O'Donnell] What reasons were given for this decision? [Visser] Well, Dr. Hartzenberg said that they have negotiated with the ANC [African National Congress] and the government, they have given their final demands. Those demands were not met, and they still don't have self-determination, and because they don't have self-determination they are not prepared to go into a government that will be, as they put it, a communist parliament and a communist government. [O'Donnell] So what are their plans now, then? [Visser] Well, they said that they are going to put pressure on the elections, as they can. What they mean by that is not quite clear, but they say that they are going to start at the local level. They are not going to participate in the 50-50 [proposed 50 percent white, 50 percent black local councils]; they are going to get their own burger [citizen] councils which they are going to get in place, and they are going to put whatever kind of pressure they can to stop this election. [O'Donnell] And does this decision from the right-wing parliament include the other members of the Freedom Alliance? People like the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party], Bophuthatswana, and so on? [Visser] Well, they were not here today, apparently, but it seems as if they will also not participate, because they said that if the Swazis can have their own territory, Inkatha must have their own territory, the Boer volk [nation] must have their own territory, and that is the kind of demands that the IFP made, as well. Those demands were not met, so they will not particpate.
