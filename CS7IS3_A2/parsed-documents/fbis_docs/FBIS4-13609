The most serious consequence of the episode was the possibility that it might ignite the silent conflict among government figures, who have begun exchanging charges of complicity in helping the fundamentalists mount this attack on Algeria's highest security prison. Along with the increasing tightening of security, the recent operation has threatened to torpedo President Zeroual's efforts at dialogue. Moreover, other splits have broken out in the ranks of the Islamists and have become so acute that Ali Belhaj has threatened Abassi Madani with assassination. What is happening behind the scenes with the government and the fundamentalists in Algeria? For the first time since Liamine Zeroual assumed power in Algeria, signs of splits among government figures have begun to appear, particularly between the president and Prime Minister Redha Malek. While President Zeroual has announced that the security policy followed for the past two years against fundamentalist terrorism has limits and does not constitute the only solution to the country's crisis, Redha Malek has ruled out returning to what preceded the crisis with the fundamentalists. Thus he has clearly indicated that he opposes the idea of dialogue with the historic leadership of the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), the very dialogue that President Zeroual has engaged in both before and after his election. Regarding these efforts at dialogue, informed Algerian sources have told AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI that a week before taking power President Zeroual visited Blida military prison, where he met Shaykh Abassi Madani, the head of the FIS. The same sources add that the president is convinced that the dialogue must continue and that Algeria can emerge from its crisis only if all parties without exception participate. The appointment of the chairman of the former dialogue committee, Youssef Khatib, as presidential advisor confirms this policy. Government Figures Divided Opposition to this policy began to appear a few days ago inside the government. The prime minister chose a suitable opportunity to reveal the existence of this opposition when he announced his rejection of any return to what preceded the elections. An explanation for this clear position is that Malek, who knows the level of progress that the dialogue has made, wanted to divulge the content of the dialogue. Informed sources state that the head of the FIS, whom the government proposed releasing from prison before the Feast of Breaking the Ramadan Fast [3 March], refused to accept President Zeroual's condition to agree to talk on a personal basis, rather than as head of the FIS. Shaykh Abassi Madani stipulated that before he would continue talking with the government all FIS-member political prisoners should be released before the end of Ramadan and that the decree dissolving the FIS should be repealed. He demanded that legislative and presidential elections be held in one year, not in three years as was approved before Major General Zeroual was elected president. Redha Malek's statement was considered a clear response in his own name and in the name of his supporters in the military establishment to the demands of the FIS leader. The statement constituted a warning to the president and to dialogue supporters about the danger of accepting these conditions and of pushing the dialogue to "undesirable consequences"--to causing a split in the military establishment. The tightening of security has greatly contributed to revealing the splits in government positions. There have been numerous assassinations and terrorist acts. The operation of freeing over 1,000 prisoners from Tazoult prison in the Aures Mountains increased the tension even more between opponents and supporters of dialogue within the government. Some even started accusing opponents of having facilitated the Tazoult operation in order to impose their conditions and policy on President Zeroual's faction. Clearly, everyone agrees that there were official factions involved in the prisoners' escape. In particular, about 450 guards were outside the prison during the operation, and the intervention forces nearby in the area did not arrive at the prison until eight hours after they were notified. They had been notified three hours after the escape took place. The accusations are not restricted to the radical wing of the army. The latter in turn accuses pro-dialogue factions of involvement in several incidents to prove that the security policy has failed and that there is no solution but dialogue. Such charges focus on senior military intelligence officials whom Chief of Staff Mohamed Lamari, the leader of the radicals, has been unable to transfer into retirement. He had presented a list of about 25 high officers whom he asked to be changed, but President Zeroual, who is also minister of defense, rejected the request. Islamist Splits The government's position and the conflict between dialogue supporters and opponents are complicated by an increase in terrorist operations and by the existence of disagreements and divisions within the fundamentalist movement. Algerian sources state that disagreement has emerged recently between the two leaders of the FIS, Shaykh Abassi Madani and Imam Ali Belhaj, who is known to be the leader of the hard-line faction. The sources say that Abassi Madani has lost much of his influence on the FIS and its base because of his having fallen into the trap of dialogue and that it will be impossible for the dialogue to produce results unless Ali Belhaj is brought in. Some assert that the conditions that Abassi Madani proposed to President Zeroual were really those of Belhaj, who pressured Madani, prevented him from completing a deal with the government, and threatened him with assassination. Clearly, divisions in the fundamentalist movement are preventing a political solution to the crisis from being reached and thus are encouraging the factions that support military action. It should be noted that the Armed Islamic Group (GIA), which was led by Djaffar El Afghani (he, along with seven of the group's leaders, was killed), has split into four groups. There is a group in the capital, led by Abdelkader Hattab (known as Mouloud), who has threatened to continue assassinations until the government falls. The group controls the Bordj El Bahri quarter. Abdelkader Hattab has been accused of having assassinated former Prime Minister Kasdi Merbah in August 1993 and of having assassinated the head of television, Mustapha Abada. Then there is the group of Sayeh Attia, the recently elected successor to Djaffar El Afghani. The group controls the Media area near Algiers. It is considered responsible for the murder of 12 Croatians, a governor, and 18 employees of the governorate, including the chief of intelligence. The third group is led by Khaled Sehili, who with his group controls the city of Blida. He is accused of about 150 operations, particularly the murder of 400 soldiers. Controlling the popular quarter of Sidi Bel Abbes in the capital is a fourth group, led by Kada Benchiha, who is accused of the murder of several French and one Briton. A peculiarity of this group is that it decapitates its victims after killing them. Attention is now focused on the GIA, which is considered to be the FIS's historic military arm. It is led by Abdelkader Chebouti, who has links to senior intelligence officers and has on a number of occasions been shielded by them so that he should not fall into traps set for him by the police and army in a number of areas. Chebouti was able to attract the officer Said Mekhloufi, who held the post of editor-in-chief of the magazine AL-JAYSH. Mekhloufi is now responsible for organizing military cells and training groups called "The Islamic Forces." This is an organization modeled after the official army and armed with machine guns. These groups control the coastal roads west of the Algerian capital and south of it, particularly in the Amour Mountains. The armed Islamic movement seems to have become active again after the death of GIA leader El Afghani. Chebouti is considered to be a supporter of Ali Belhaj and holds a position opposing FIS leader Shaykh Abassi Madani. He is also an opponent of dialogue with the government. He has announced on more than one occasion that he will not stand with his hands tied in the face of government attempts to draw some leaders into dialogue. He has threatened moderates with the severest punishment. The division in the fundamentalist movement and the lack of a unified leadership undoubtedly complicate the situation, particularly the situation of Major General Zeroual, who has set all his hope on making the dialogue successful. In the next few weeks he is expected to try to change the balance of forces in his favor. There is much talk now about the existence of a plan to make changes in the government. Perhaps these reports are what led Redha Malek to open fire on dialogue supporters within the government.
