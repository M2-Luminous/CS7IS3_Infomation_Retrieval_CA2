SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This is a synopsis of the Commission's Notice of Proposed Rule Making, CS Docket No. 94&hyph;44, adopted May 5, 1994, and released May 16, 1994. The complete text of this document is available for inspection and copying during normal business hours in the FCC Reference Center (room 239), 1919 M Street, NW., Washington, DC 20554, and may be purchased from the Commission's copy contractor, International Transcription Service, (202) 857&hyph;3800, 2100 M Street, NW., Washington, DC 20037. Synopsis of the Notice of Proposed Rule Making 1. The Commission, in response to a Petition for Rulemaking filed by the petitioner, proposed to amend Section 76.51 of the Rules to add the community of Castle Rock, Colorado, to the Denver television market. 2. In evaluating past requests for hyphenation of a market, the Commission has considered the following factors as relevant to its examination: (1) the distance between the existing designated communities and the community proposed to be added to the designation; (2) whether cable carriage, if afforded to the subject station, would extend to areas beyond its Grade B signal coverage area; (3) the presence of a clear showing of a particularized need by the station requesting the change of market designation; and (4) an indication of benefit to the public from the proposed change. Each of these factors helps the Commission to evaluate individual market conditions consistent ``with the underlying competitive purpose of the market hyphenation rule to delineate areas where stations can and do, both actually and logically, compete.'' 3. Based on the facts presented, the Commission believes that a sufficient case for redesignation of the subject market has been set forth so that this proposal should be tested through the rulemaking process, including the comments of interested parties. It appears from the information before us that the television stations licensed to Denver and Castle Rock do compete for audiences and advertisers throughout much of the proposed combined market area, and that evidence has been presented tending to demonstrate commonality between the proposed community to be added to a market designation and the market as a whole. Moreover, the petitioner's proposal appears to be consistent with the Commission's policies regarding redesignation of a hyphenated television market. Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 4. The Commission certifies that the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 does not apply to this rulemaking proceeding because if the proposed rule amendment is promulgated, there will not be a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small business entities, as defined by Section 601(3) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A few cable television system operators will be affected by the proposed rule amendment. The Secretary shall send a copy of this Notice of Proposed Rule Making, including the certification, to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration in accordance with paragraph 603(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Public Law 96&hyph;354, 94 Stat.1164, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. (1981). Ex Parte 5. This is a non-restricted notice and comment rulemaking proceeding.
