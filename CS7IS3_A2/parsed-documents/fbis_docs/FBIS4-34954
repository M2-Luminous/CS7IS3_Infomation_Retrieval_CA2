Those who want to travel to the neighbor country who have been interviewed by PRENSA LATINA have denounced how the U.S. Interests Section in Havana denies visas. This situation in recent months has become more prevalent because of political reasons. Some of those interviewed, after insisting that they remain anonymous for fear of reprisal from U.S. diplomats (an eventual definite denial of visa), said they believe that the forced entries by 150 people into the diplomatic missions of Belgium, Germany, and Chile in this capital are a result of U.S. immigration restrictions. Sitting around the U.S. Interests Section building as they wait for an answer to their requests to meet with their relatives, the applicants noted that the majority of the people who entered the missions by force have stated their desire for visas to travel to the United States, which is the main destination of those who want to leave the island. Foreign media, and the U.S. media, in particular, report on the forceful entry into the embassies and on the country's difficult situation. A worker criticized this reporting by pointing out the notorious silence such media maintains regarding the other side of the coin: the closing or blocking of legal departure methods. In 1984, Havana and Washington signed an immigration agreement in which the United States would renew its preferential visa granting to Cuban immigrants with residence in Cuba, to allow up to 20,000 visas annually. This renewed preferential visa granting applied especially to close relatives of U.S. citizens and Cuban residents in that country. U.S. compliance with this agreement has been poor, said a lady who has already traveled once but who is, as she said, aware of the fact that sometimes political interests prevail over the interests of people who have nothing to do with politics. According to official Cuban statistics, in 1993 the U.S. Interests Section approved only 1,000 of the 20,000 visas it could have approved for Cubans who had requested them in order to spend time with their relatives in the United States. In 1993, Cuba authorized the departure of approximately 100,000 people who wanted to visit the U.S., but only 30,000 made it. Of those who made it, most were people over 40. The rest had their visa requests denied by the Interests Section, which from July 1991 to May 1992 suspended visa processing because they claimed that visa requests had stockpiled considerably. People who in recent days visited the Interests Section have told PRENSA LATINA that on one day six visas were granted, out of 300 applications, and that on the next day another six out of 260 applications were granted. An elderly lady said: "Judging from what I heard from those who visited the Interests Section this morning and from several dozen people who have already come out of there, only one visa has been granted. No one is certain about being chosen for travel, but the young find it more uncertain, according to comments heard by this reporter in the "park of the wailing," a plaza near the U.S. Interests Section where impatient applicants meet and where rejected applicants reflect on their pain. Another person interviewed did not dispute that constant visa refusals encourage illegal departures, but that person refused to accept that hypothesis as conclusive, because this would lead to the belief that all who want to visit their relatives have the objective of remaining there and this, he emphasized, is not so. After spending hours, days, and even weeks coming and going and forming lines to enter the Interests Section building (many from the countryside rent rooms nearby or sleep in the open), the applicants may have to face a rejection of their application, in which case they must wait one year before being able to present a new application.
