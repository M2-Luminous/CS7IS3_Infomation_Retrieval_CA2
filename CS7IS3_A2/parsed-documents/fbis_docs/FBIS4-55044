Klaus, however, sees no reason for such a meeting to take place. Do you see a reason for it? [Moravcik] I agree with the Czech prime minister on this point. A meeting of the prime ministers becomes important when experts, ministers, or deputy prime ministers are unable to clarify contentious issues. Our meeting would have to concern a wider range of issues. We are not in a situation where we would feel that such a meeting is necessary. [Popelka] Is the situation surrounding the so-called old clearing account not a reason for such a meeting to take place, as recently suggested by Deputy Prime Minister Brigita Schmognerova? [Moravcik] Not all possibilities of bilateral negotiations have been exhausted in this case. Some new aspects have surfaced. The problem is that the basic payments agreement was disadvantageous for Slovakia. The agreement on payments for the old clearing account provides for compensation for the difference in the exchange rates [of the Czech and Slovak korunas] from the state budget. This is a burden on the Slovak state budget. While negotiating the agreement, the Slovak side apparently did not calculate bilateral claims well enough and did not realize that we are worse off than the Czechs. This is why we came up with the idea of abolishing the old clearing account. The true gist of the problem, in my opinion, is that the payments agreement needs to be changed, but the Czechs are not interested in this because the present state suits them. [Popelka] The opposition has repeatedly referred to you in connection with the club of the "Leninist spark." What kind of a club is this, in fact? [Moravcik] It was set up after we gained the impression that the thinking represented by Mikhail Gorbachev was not applied in Slovakia. The club's task was to bring together people who realized the need for more radical changes. The name "Leninist spark" was only a camouflage designed to hoodwink the StB [State Security Corps]. The organizers are registered in StB files because later they were rated as candidates for the criminal act of sedition.
