The first was control group (fed with water). The second and third groups were fed with medicinal herbs according to prescriptions No. 1 and 2 respectively. The rats were tail suspended with heads down 25-30 degrees for 15 days. Mechanical properties of the soleus muscle were determined with tesion and displacement transducers. Blood flow in soleus muscle was determined with [.sup]51[/]Cr labelled frog red cells. The result indicated that blood flow increased in soleus muscle in the second and third group rats but decreased in the first group rats; peak force of isometric twitch and tetanic contraction of soleus muscle increased in the second and third group rats but decreased in the first group rats. There were corresponding relationships between blood flow and peak force of various kinds of muscle contractions. The correlations were: Y[.sub]1[/] = 16.98 + 705.42x; Y[.sub]2[/] = 9.04 + 1183.76x where: x -- blood flow in soleus muscle (ml/min.g); Y[.sub]1[/] -- peak force of isometric twitch (N); Y[.sub]2[/] -- peak force of isometric tetanic contraction (N). These results provided scientific basis for adopting effective countermeasures against muscle atrophy during weightlessness or simulated weightlessness.
