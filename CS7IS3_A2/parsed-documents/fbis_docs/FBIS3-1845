Institutional Upgrading Is the Fundamental Way of Opposing Corruption There are temporary and permanent cures for corruption. It is a temporary cure to morally encourage incorruptibility among officials, urging them to exercise self-discipline and keep politically clean. It is a permanent cure for corruption to root it out of its hotbeds. As we mentioned in the previous article, the current corruption in Chinese society has something to do with the process of transformation to a market economy, including institutional defects, institutional changes, and an imperfect legal system. If corruption occurs in certain departments, localities, and among certain cadres, we can regard the phenomenon as an isolated case and mainly adopt the method of fighting it morally, enforce the law on the very few corrupt officials, and make public several major and important cases to "send a warning to a hundred by executing one." Nevertheless, when corruption has become a common practice in society and people in the higher echelons and the lower levels are all seeking rent [xun zu 1416 4436], this shows there is big trouble with the existing structure which will foster and breed corrupt elements of all descriptions, major and minor. The exclusive use of "party discipline and state laws" against corruption is just like cutting the fragrant-flowered garlic, which grows thickly once its previous patches are cut. This being the case, it is necessary to eradicate the hotbeds and soil which breeds corruption with institutional upgrading. Objectively, corruption can be found at any time and everywhere. However, in different societies and under different structures, corruption differs in degree and scope. By remedying corruption permanently through institutional upgrading, we mean minimizing the scope of corruption characterized by people seeking rent through institutional checks. Establish a market economy system. By institutional upgrading, we mean establishing a modern market economic system and an economic environment based on fair competition. This includes abolition of the double-track price system, economic privileges, and economic monopoly; promotion of the free flow of production elements and trade freedom; restriction of special interest groups; correction of excessive government intervention; and the reduction of the loss of government effectiveness. The adoption of these reform measures conforms to the goal set by the Chinese leaders to establish a socialist market economy system and will thus greatly help expedite the marketization process of the Chinese economy, cut the cost of social business, and promote economic prosperity and social progress. Resistance comes from within the CPC. Resistance to anticorruption comes from within the CPC, with its main manifestation being the formation of Communist-led special interest groups of all descriptions. The CPC is not a monolithic bloc. It does not share identical interests and does not have unity in steps. Otherwise, so long as the party Central Committee issues an order, corruption would disappear across the country or at least would be controled. Within the CPC and the state machinery, various kinds of independent economic and political interest groups have emerged. This is one of the most important characteristics of the changes which have taken place in Chinese society since reform was introduced, a reflection of the development of the internal groups of the party and the state machinery from being unified to being pluralistic and from being centralized to being decentralized. The role of the political party has been weakened while the role of interest groups is intensifying. State authority is diminishing while group authority is expanding. These groups are special interest groups rather than the interest groups in the general sense, such as the interest groups of the workers, of the peasants, of the teachers, and of the scientists. Their main characteristics are as follows: First, motivated by their own interests, they set the pursuit of their own group's maximum interests as their objective. They are exclusively concerned about the growth of their own group, disregarding the loss of society's total wealth. Therefore, so long as there is a lack of institutional checks or there are economic rent [zu jin 4436 6855], motivated by their own interests, they will seek the rent. Second, they belong to groups of a profit-sharing nature and participate in sharing society's resources and profits. Although they constitute a small proportion of the country's total population, they are always in a position to obtain a higher proportion of economic resources. Third, they are exclusive and monopolistic in nature. They exclude other groups from participation in profit-sharing activities, hinder the free flow of production elements by opposing their competitive opponents' participation, and increase their social monopoly. Of course, when they share economic rent and other resources with their opponents, or resist external threats and rectification efforts, they will collude with each other intensively and extensively, "one official covers up for another official" and, thus, make themselves more complicated and difficult to deal with. Fourth, they are highly influential and able to cause the "lose of government effectiveness." They try every possible means to influence government policy and even the policymaking of the highest echelons of leadership. They also ask for excessive government intervention, or the intervention by top leaders, to achieve some economic privileges and preferential policies and promote their own interests. They try by every possible means to oppose and hinder the adoption of reform measures conducive to fair competition because the measures will mean the loss of many of their monopolistic benefits. Fifth, their vested interests are rigid. There can be an increase rather than a reduction in the absolute interests they obtain and in the relative interests they share. Reform touches on vested interests. The characteristics mentioned above determine that any major measures for institutional upgrading will undoubtedly meet with strong opposition from these special interest groups because reform touches on their vested interests and may put them in an unfavorable position. For example, many interest groups disagree to such reform measures as cutting customs duties and abolishing import restrictions and exclusive state control in foreign trade. Just as Paul A. Samuelson said: The history of tariff protection has revealed more opposite cases. Some industries are in their infantile stage forever. What is protected by the government is the vested interest groups which have always refused to cast away their diapers for many years rather than infantile industries. (Paul A. Samuelson and William D. Nordhaus: "ECONOMICS" (12th) Chinese edition, published by the China Development Publishing House in 1992, p 1450) Interest group behavior should be standardized. The difficulty with market-oriented reform is how to handle some special interest groups. Practicing the market economic principles based on fair competition will, in essence, help reduce or get rid of the economic rents exclusively shared by these special interest groups. Institutional upgrading is aimed at standardizing the commercial behavior of these special interest groups, restricting their monopoly, and allowing other groups or manufacturers and business people to get involved in competition, rather than eliminating and expropriating them so that the market based on competition becomes more mature, monopolistic profits will become average profits, and economic rents will disappear gradually. Proper government intervention is a prerequisite for institutional upgrading. In real economic life, the government, more often than not, will provide certain special interest groups with some sort of monopoly, intentionally or unintentionally, such as economic privileges or preferential policies. Thus, the other groups will follow suit and also seek preferential policies conducive to their interests. The government, in particular the central government, can both create and eliminate unfair competition. It must be made clear that the purpose of government intervention is to define a series of regulations for market competition, put an end to market distortions and ineffectiveness, create a market economic environment based on fair competition for the various kinds of main players in economic activities (including special interest groups and general interest groups), and bring the role of the market economy into the fullest play. To oppose corruption, we must not rely on launching mass movements. Anticorruption is an institutional upgrading activity. It needs careful planning, organization, and implementation. To combat corruption, we must not rely on launching mass movements, or turn anticorruption into a political movement, because a mass movement or a political movement cannot remove the institutional roots of corruption, or remedy institutional defects, and is bound to lead to either confusion or disturbance. Anticorruption is an institutional reform in the genuine sense. The road to the most successful institutional reform is one of active reform progressing step by step. Institutional upgrading needs to bring the "superiority of achieving development at a later date" of the countries starting modernization later than others and the leading role of the central government into play, achieve institutional upgrading at relatively less cost and higher speed, and wipe out, once and for all, the conditions breeding corruption. As a latecomer to modernization and modern market economy, China can learn from and use for reference the experiences in institutional upgrading which have taken hundreds of years for developed countries to achieve at a high price, including institutional framework, economic systems, and legal standardization. This is the so-called "superiority of achieving development at a later date." With the government playing a leading role and the help of the superiority of achieving development at a later date, it is possible for China to lower the economic rents in the various aspects of endeavor and check the vicious expansion of corruption by carrying out market-oriented reform in a relatively short time, say, two or three years, and, further, to roughly establish the framework of the socialist market economic system in a relatively short time, say, 10 years or a little longer. We Do Not Oppose the Use of Ethical Restraining Forces. Finally, what needs pointing out is that we favor curing corruption permanently by institutional upgrading. However, this does not mean excluding and opposing the use of ethical restraining forces but, on the contrary, they must be strengthened and fully used. The following major reform measures to be taken are all based on this idea. At the same time, consideration has also been given to short- and long-term measures. Some measures can be gradually put into effect in the short term and some take a relatively long time to implement. V. Suggestions for Major Institutional Upgrading Measures To Cure Corruption Permanently 1. Liberalize interest rates and make them market oriented. Capital is the most sought after element of production and, while capital is the source of economic growth, it can become a bottleneck for economic expansion. In a market economy, "everybody is equal before interest rates." This is one of the basic conditions for the main players in economic activities of all types to enjoy fair competition and economic freedom. Interest rates are the use price of funds and reflect the relationship between fund supply and demand. For many years, state-owned banks have pursued official interest rates in some enterprises (mainly state-owned enterprises) and market interest rates among some other enterprises (mainly nonstate-owned enterprises). Moreover, they gave "preferential treatment" to the former in the form of a loan quota ration and employed "discriminatory treatment" to the latter. This is the typical way of doing things based on the "theory of the unique importance of class origin," a method which violates the principle of fair competition in the market economy. It is one of the main causes for the distortions in the funds market and the large-scale rent-seeking activities. Moreover, the current banking and financial activities are basically directed by administrative orders. Under the pressure of political groups, the banks grant "political background" loans and governments at all level directly interfere in the banks' loan business. The basic line of thinking on cracking the crux of this problem is to turn the "double track" interest rate system to a "single track" market interest rate system, liberalize interest rates, relax the restrictions on loan quotas, forbid the pursuance of discriminatory or preferential interests rates toward any enterprises, let "everybody be equal before interest rates," and grant financial discounts and subsidies to loans used by such sectors as agriculture, energy, and telecommunications. For this purpose, we suggest: Pursue the idea that "everybody is equal before interest rate." --Pursuing market interest rates and abolishing official interest rates. Savings interest and loan interest rates should fluctuate side by side. Commercial banks are entitled to decide their own interest rate levels. Government organizations are not entitled to issue mandatory orders on loan and interest rate levels to commercial banks. Interest rates can be liberalized in two steps: First, official interest rates can be increased gradually and oriented to market interest rates and restrictions on loan quotas can be relaxed gradually and, second, interest rates can be oriented to the market and restrictions on loan quotas can be lifted. --Promoting development of commercial banks and interbank fair competition. We should lift the restrictions on bank businesses (including regional and trade restrictions), allow the development of nongovernmental commercial banks and the participation of foreign commercial banks in competition in the domestic market, eliminate the restrictions on the free participation of financial enterprises in such competition, and let relevant departments be in charge of examining and approving the qualifications of enterprises to engage in financial activities. Several major specialized banks are still occupying a monopoly position. They should be divided into smaller banks and encouraged to compete with one another in accordance with a fair competition mechanism. --Pursuing mortgages on assets (funds) in enterprise lending. Mortgage loans are extended to enterprises, which use 50 to 75 percent of their funds (circulating funds plus fixed assets) as pledges, according to their types (production enterprises and enterprises engaged in circulation) and the degree of their creditability. Once enterprises default on their loan repayments or their assets are less than their debts, they will be confiscated and sold by public auction by the banks. --Granting loans to agriculture, communications and transport, energy, telecommunications, and other basic industries and giving them government financial discounts and subsidies to promote their development. Some of the help-the-poor funds of the poverty- stricken areas should be changed into financial discounts and subsidies to help the areas develop their economies. Abolish exclusive state control in foreign trade and turn down trade barriers. 2. Since customs tariff rates were cut, nontariff trade barriers were removed, and the reform of exclusive state control in foreign trade was introduced, the Chinese economy has rapidly become more market-oriented and the market orientation index has increased from 25 percent in 1979 to 63 percent in 1992. Nevertheless, China's foreign trade structure, in particular its import structure, still conspicuously retains the characteristics of the planned economy, such as exclusive state control in foreign trade, import licensing and control, high customs duties, and export control. These ways of doing things are, in fact, protection by the government of the interests of a small number of interest groups and some producers at the expense of the interests of the whole and the consumers. They have hindered the overall liberalization [kai fang 7030 2397] of the Chinese economy and thus are detrimental to promoting the free flow of production elements and both domestic and international competition. Therefore, it is increasingly urgent to reform the foreign trade structure, in particular the import structure. It is also the only way of reducing and eliminating the economic rents brought about by the structure. For this purpose, we suggest: --Lowering customs duty rates by a wide margin and eliminating nontariff import restrictions; scrapping the import licensing of major commodities, lifting administrative controls over imported commodities, and simplifying customs duties; and terminating various localities' power of tariff concession, which should go to the central government. --Eliminating exclusive state control in foreign trade, empowering enterprises of all types to directly import and export, treating state-owned and nonstate-owned enterprises equally without discrimination, with the relevant departments in charge of enterprises' import and export qualifications, and auctioning the import approval documents for major commodities. --Lifting restrictions over the operation by foreign capital of such industries as commerce, trade, banking, insurance, communications and transport, post and telecommunications, real estate, and tourism, and boosting the competitiveness of the tertiary industry at home. --Removing controls over foreign exchange and gradually establish a floating exchange rate system to make the renminbi a freely convertible currency and promote the internationalization of the Chinese economy. --Gradually using international market commodity prices and establishing links between international and domestic markets. --Pursuing an appropriate, protective policy toward agriculture and infantile industries at home but a more liberal policy toward car, petrochemical, and other monopolistic industries. Put monopoly under strict control and promote fair competition. 3. Put monopoly under strict control and ensure that enterprises of various types and localities compete with one another on a free and fair basis. Competition is the core of the market economy and also a motive force in economic development. However, the market economy does not operate in a vacuum, with competition going unregulated. One of the important government functions in the market economy is to set "regulations" for competition through policies and laws; create an environment of fair, open, and just competition for the main players in economic activities; and ensure the effective operation of the market economy. Antimonopoly is interference by the government in the incomplete market competition. It is achieved by enacting a set of laws with which to standardize and restrict enterprise behavior such as monopolizing the market and forbidding enterprises from taking irregular actions to compete. The formation of monopoly has many factors, including product difference, superior cost, and the rate of economic returns. The most important reason is institutional hindrance. To put it another way, the system has restricted other manufactures and business people and the element of recourse from getting free access to the markets for certain professions and trades. If the market is open and allows fair competition, those who corner it have to engage in a fierce competition with other manufacturers and business people who have free access to the market, their monopolist profits will gradually disappear. To prevent monopoly operations and ensure fair competition, we suggest: --Enacting an antimonopoly law as soon as possible to curb monopoly, unfair competition, and the conspiratorial actions of a small number of enterprises and reorganizing and disbanding some monopoly organizations and enterprises, in particular, companies or trade companies with exclusive control over certain industries which must be divided into more than two companies so that they will compete with each other. --With the exception of a small number of public trades (such as water supply, electricity supply, gas supply, and post and telecommunications) and the military industry, most trades will not restrict enterprises engaged in other trades from having free access to the market and set up manmade barriers to the market. Companies are prohibited from monopolizing public and service trades (such as communications and transport, telecommunications and telephone, insurance, and broadcasting and television). The government should exercise the necessary economic controls and impose restrictions on their prices, product varieties, and the conditions of market access. --Prohibiting the adoption of means other than efficiency competition to compete, such as preferential interest rates and franchised operations. --Accelerating the transformation of various industrial departments and companies from monopoly to fair competition in their sectors and the transformation from the control of state-owend enterprises to the industrial management of state-owned enterprises and nonstate-owned enterprises and from administrative departments to trade associations. Market unity helps break regional confinement. --Reaffirming the principle of separating finance and industry and preventing the convergence of financial monopoly and industrial monopoly; implementing the provision made by the Central Committee and the State Council on 28 July 1989 that trust investment companies and other financial institutions are prohibited from directly running nonfinancial enterprises and those which have been set up should be separated in terms of functions within the specified time. The operational scope and funds of the abovementioned companies should be reassessed so that finance and investment are separated. --Abolishing various kinds of preferential policies and tax concessions, including the multifarious practices in violation of fair competition adopted by the special economic zones, development zones, cities enjoying provincial status in the state plan, and companies whose development plans are listed separately in the state plan. --Breaking down market barriers set up by different regions, ensuring the free flow of production elements, and establishing a single domestic market.
