FR940414-1-00059 FR940414-1-00010 However, since there are only a few ingredient-specific immunoassay tests available, EPA does not consider this method of determining compliance to be feasible at present. EPA also considered the possibility of using Total Organic Carbon (TOC) or the Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) as measures of the performance of wastewater treatment in removing active ingredients and other pollutants. This alternative was also rejected because it would be very difficult to establish a specific concentration of TOC or COD that would reflect adequate treatment and removal of the active ingredients and other pollutants for all of the diverse wastewater matrices found at pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging facilities. Lastly, the Agency gave some consideration to a measurement of the toxicity of the wastewater. This was also rejected, because toxicity measurements are in no way specific to any given pollutant and they are not expected to be sensitive at the levels that represent good wastewater treatment. To alleviate the burden associated with monitoring for each specific regulated pollutant would have required EPA to identify a suitable surrogate pollutant in each case for formulating, packaging or repackaging facilities, which was not possible. Option 2 is estimated to cost $28.7 million annually for the 2400 facilities, and would be expected to remove 111,683 pounds of active ingredients per year. The estimated costs for Option 2 are slightly lower than the estimated costs for Option 1, due to a lower volume of wastewater that is expected to be treated by the Universal Treatment System. Since EPA believes that wastewater from rinsing the interior of shipping containers can be directly added to the product being formulated, EPA has estimated that no cost is associated with the recycle of this stream. EPA has estimated the cost of holding the rinsate from cleaning equipment interiors and bulk storage tanks. This cost is based on the greatest volume expected to be generated over a 90 day period. EPA has assumed that facilities will hold these wastewater sources no longer than 90 days in order to avoid the possibility of being classified a RCRA waste storage facility, and separate holding tanks to avoid cross-contamination of wastewater were costed for each product the facility reported making. If there is a gap in production of greater than 90-days based on the reported production schedule for a given product it was assumed that the volume would be combined with other pesticide process wastewater for treatment through the Universal Treatment System. Generally, wastewater volumes from interior cleaning were costed for recycle only and were not part of the hydraulic load that was costed for treatment through the Universal Treatment System. Therefore the Universal Treatment System can be smaller than the system costed for Option 1. EPA estimates that the economic impact of Option 2 would be one possible plant closure and 192 line conversions. Option 2 was rejected even though it does incorporate pollution prevention practices, because it does not represent the best available technologies, i.e. the best performance of facilities in this subcategory. In addition, EPA would still need to establish standards for a long list of pollutants and there would still be some pollutants for which the discharge would be uncontrolled. As discussed previously an estimated 669 of the 1305 PFPR (not including refilling establishments) facilities are achieving zero discharge. EPA generally could find no significant difference between facilities that use but do not discharge wastewater versus facilities that do discharge. There is generally no significant difference in production processes, volumes produced, type of products made, active ingredients used, geographic location or any other factor. Therefore, Option 2 for PSES was also rejected because it would allow a discharge and thus result in largely inconsistent requirements for PSES compared to BPT/BAT for direct dischargers. Option 3 is also estimated to cost $28.7 million annually for the 2400 facilities and result in one plant closure and 188 product line closures or conversions. However Option 3 is estimated to remove 111,996 pounds per year of active ingredient pollutants. As discussed previously, EPA has proposed to select not Option 3 but a variation of Option 3 in which the costs and economic impacts associated are reduced for the small sanitizer facilities. (See Section XIV of this preamble for more detailed discussion). Options 4 and 5 were rejected because they rely on transferring wastewater pollutants to other media as part of their approach. In addition their very high cost would result in greater economic impacts on many facilities. Option 4 is estimated to cost $290 million and Option 5 is estimated to cost $364 million for the 2400 facilities. The projected economic impacts include 8 plant closures for both Options with 193 product line closures or conversions for Option 4 and 230 product line closures or conversions for Option 5. It should be noted that there are small numbers of facilities that could find it less expensive to practice pollution prevention on the interior cleaning wastewaters and send the rest of their pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging wastewater off-site for disposal than it will be for them to install a treatment system to handle these wastes. EPA is providing suggestions for handling wastewaters and treating and/or recycling them in an efficient, low-cost manner such that these facilities can be dissuaded from opting to transfer wastewater pollutants to other media.
