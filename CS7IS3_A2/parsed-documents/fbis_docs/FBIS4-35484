Following the publication of such an article, the Communication Ministry service explanation added, the office of the communication minister summoned AL-WATAN editors, as well as the journalist who wrote the article for a meeting. They were asked to furnish the names of those who supplied them with the information in a bid to establish the source of the leak that was used to write the article that clearly violated the criminal code articles, as well as the information bill. A collective statement was signed by two AL-WATAN editors and the journalist with their free will. The latter did, however, sign another statement individually. The communication minister's statement points out that the unfounded claims, published in today's AL-WATAN editorial, has complicated the situation in the country because the highest body of the state was depicted as a normal administration. The Communication Ministry statement concluded by saying that there was no doubt that necessary legal measures will be taken by the competent authorities against AL-WATAN.
