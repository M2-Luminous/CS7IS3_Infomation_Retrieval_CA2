Actually, a game is being played that seems to be misleading the United States. He added: "We are telling everyone that what is happening is a game. We have told the United Nations that this cannot continue because the Turkish side has no political will. If there is no political will, there can be no results on the substance of the Cyprus issue or the confidence-building measures." Asked whether the Cyprus issue is being turned into the Famagusta issue, Kliridhis said that some have a strange view: "For example, they believe that if they give us Kyrenia, the Cyprus issue will become a Kyrenia issue, and if they give us Karpasi, the Cyprus issue will become a Karpasi issue, and if they give us Famagusta, the Cyprus issue will become the Famagusta issue. ``Just think what the situation in Cyprus would have been if we had made the correct steps and gotten Karpasi then. We would have secured one area. Today, everyone wants the decision of the Third Vienna Treaty on Famagusta to be implemented. But, when it was adopted everyone condemned it. ``If the Turkish side believed that the Cyprus issue would be resolved by reaching an agreement on Famagusta, it would have been happy because it would not be pressed to return Morphou or other territorial percentages. However, it knows that Famagusta is not the solution to the Cyprus problem and also knows that if this measure works Greeks and Turks will socialize and cooperate in Famagusta. If this happens, Denktas's main argument, that the Turkish Cypriots do not trust the Greek Cypriots to live with them, will collapse. The opening of Famagusta will demonstrate that they can live together. So, Denktas will be unable to maintain a dividing line and say that they can live together in Famagusta but they cannot anywhere else.'' Disagreements President Kliridhis added that access to Famagusta is not the only point of disagreement. He said: "It is being said that the Turks want separate customs offices. The Turks disagree. They do not want customs offices. The thought was that products for the occupied areas would be `bonded' and taxed there according to the common market tax. The Turks do not accept this. They are saying that each side can do anything it wants in its part and charge any tax it wants. They do not accept taxes for Famagusta or the airport. ``They do not accept UN administration, either. They are saying that there are `de facto' administrations, the Greek and Turkish Cypriot, and do not accept the establishment of a UN administration. They want a joint `de facto' rule with the UN Administration. ``We have started with the disagreements. Access to Famagusta was the first one, and it continues to be. We disagreed on the size of Famagusta's fenced-off area but it seems that on this point they have accepted the municipal limits. We also disagreed and continue to disagree on the timetable. There are also other points of disagreement.'' Asked about Europe's role, Kliridhis said: "Turkey knows that it cannot be accepted in Europe now because of its financial situation. So it is trying to utilize the financial protocols to restructure its economy and prepare for the accession. Greece has veto power and is using it. When U.S. President Bill Clinton urges helping Turkey to join the European Union [EU], he is doing it because Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller asked him to. ``I believe that things will change greatly when we join the EU. This is why I believe that the stance we maintain until January, when the issue will be reexamined, is very significant. We have been told clearly that accession negotiations will begin if there is progress in the Cyprus talks. Negotiations will also begin if there is no progress, but not because of us. ``When negotiations begin, Turkey will have to do some serious thinking. Cyprus will obviously join the EU in two to three years. So, Turkey will have to abandon any expansionist designs or plans because it would be inconceivable to attack a European country. ``Then it must weigh the benefits of holding 37 percent of Cypriot territory and maintaining occupation troops against the price of being prevented from joining Europe. At that point, Turkey will become more reasonable about a Cyprus solution. This is why our efforts focus on keeping the talks open so it does not appear that we would have been unjustifiably negative on anything.'' Asked what he would have wanted for his birthday, Kliridhis joked that he wants to be 30 years younger. He added: The best gift for my birthday would be to see the Cyprus issue resolved.
