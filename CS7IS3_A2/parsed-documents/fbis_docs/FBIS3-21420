In essence, what they denote is a strange reluctance on Washington's part to view the problem in all its complexity and an equally peculiar propensity to endorse without a thought the patently-motivated Pakistani propaganda on human rights violations in the valley. To the Americans, the problem is not really and probably never has been one of terrorist-inspired insurgency in an area which was entirely peaceful till the mid-eighties, presumably because such a stance will bring into focus Pakistan's clandestine role both in Kashmir and Punjab. Instead, the United States is bent on describing what is happening in the valley as an intensifying civil strife in which the Indian security forces are supposedly acting like an occupation army while an innocent Islamabad is merely standing on the sidelines, wringing its hands in despair about the plight of Muslims in the state. There is no appreciation in this blinkered view of Pakistan's earlier futile forays into the state, the threats, including one of a nuclear confrontation, that its leaders have been issuing about making India atone for the sins of liberating Bangladesh and of the treatment of minorities in Pakistan, compared with India's incomparably better record. If anything is clear from this inexplicably partisan attitude, it is that the United States cannot hope to act as a "catalyst," as it claims it wants to do, to promote better India-Pakistan relations. All that it can achieve through its tilt reminiscent of the Nixon-Kissinger period towards a country it was on the verge of declaring a terrorist state not long ago is to cause widespread dismay and disillusionment in India. Such feelings will be all the greater because the American stand is liable to be seen not as an expression of naivete, but as a cynical ploy to put pressure on India if only because the latter is recognised as far too independent-minded and dismissive of global American strategies. Clearly, the resentment in the American establishment about India's role as a leader of the nonaligned movement persists despite the total transformation of the international scene. Until now, India's open society had dissuaded the United States from complaining about human rights violations, but the unfortunate situation in Kashmir has given it an opportunity which it is seemingly loath to miss even if it means turning a blind eye to Pakistan's more blatant transgressions. In the process, it is again siding with elements in Pakistan that are basically inimical to democracy.
