The document states: The electoral victory of the African National Congress headed by undisputed leader Nelson Mandela was a victory for the progressive people of the world and paved the way for the establishment of diplomatic relations between Cuba and South Africa. After noting that the agreement signed by the foreign ministers of the two countries was one of the first international acts carried out by the new government, the document states that there are many broad possibilities for cooperation. The document views as fundamental "the commitment to work unitedly to turn common dreams of independence, equality, and social well-being into reality." The declaration adds: "Generous Cuban blood has enriched the African soil, and for Cuba it is an honor and also a compelling duty to take part with its South African brothers in the beginning of this new page in their history. The declaration also expresses Cuba's interest in contributing modestly to the edification of a multiracial and truly democratic South Africa. The declaration expresses the wish that "the international community be consistent in its support for the process that put an end to apartheid, and grant the new government the cooperation necessary to secure its goals of peace, harmony, and progress."
