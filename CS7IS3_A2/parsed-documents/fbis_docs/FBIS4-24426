The round-the-clock service is about to celebrate its first birthday -- and a survey has shown which section is most consulted by the public. The service was set up in June last year by the municipal telecommunications bureau. When a caller dials 168, he or she hear a recording listing the numbers for the available subjects. A second call will provide recorded information on that topic. The list includes general knowledge on psychology, sex, family, banking, foreign exchange, stocks and shares, mainland entry and exit formalities, and a special service for foreigners. "Most of the daily 100,000 calls were for banking information and general knowledge about sex," said Chen Qiang, deputy head of the center said. "This indicates the rise of Shanghai people's sense of banking and investment. Nowadays, more and more people who are embarrassed to ask for sex general knowledge face to face with the experts like to make a phone call," he said. Chen said that Shanghai was the third city after Nanhai city, Guangdong Province, and Haikou, capital of Hainan Province, to open such a phone service, which has been praised by residents, the municipal government and experts.
