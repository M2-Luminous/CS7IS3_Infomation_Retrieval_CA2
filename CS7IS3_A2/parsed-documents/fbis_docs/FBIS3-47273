National Radio of Guyana broadcast the New Year address three times, saying that President Kim Il-song in his New Year address described the victory of the Korean people last year as a victory of the revolutionary line of the Workers' Party of Korea, a great victory of the singlehearted unity of the leader, the party and the masses. The Mozambican paper NOTICIAS quoted President Kim Il-song as saying that the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula must be settled through DPRK-U.S. talks and that pressure and threats will have no effect on the Korean people and may invite catastrophe, far from achieving a solution to the problem.
