Addressing special centenary celebrations for the U.S. Army Command and Staff College, he said that some countries have acquired the capability to manufacture nuclear weapons. The United States is trying to persuade them in a friendly manner, but it will not refrain from using force if these efforts fail. Ejazul Haq, a former Pakistani minister and member of the National Assembly who was present at the function, told JANG's special correspondent that although the secretary did not mention Pakistan in his speech, it was obvious that he was referring to us. This is because he addressed Ejazul Haq in particular before mentioning the threat to use force and excused himself to Haq when he did mention it. The United States is keenly interested in nuclear nonproliferation. It is no secret that it is striving to realize this objective throughout the world. It is also evident, though, that the U.S. campaign against nuclear weapons is neither equitable nor impartial. It has no objection to certain countries' nuclear programs and is indirectly assisting and supporting the advancement and success of their programs. The most conspicuous example is Israel. Informed sources are aware that Israel not only has the capability to produce nuclear weapons, it also has a huge stockpile of such weapons. Despite knowing this, the United States has never expressed any concern about Israel's nuclear capability or threatened Israel. On the contrary, Israel tops the list of countries receiving U.S. foreign aid. The two countries have pursued very close and longstanding technical cooperation. It would not be incorrect to say that the United States and Israel are two bodies sharing a single heart. It is also no secret why the United States has been ignoring the Israeli nuclear program. The United States considers Israel its closest ally in the Middle East, like a virtual state of the United States, and is deeply interested in accelerating its defense and nuclear capabilities. Similarly, although the United States keeps protesting against the Indian nuclear program, it has never adopted a tough stand against the increase in India's nuclear capability, as it has with Pakistan or North Korea. In fact, there were occasions when the United States -- through France -- indirectly helped India continue its nuclear program. Given the circumstances, the U.S. threat to use force against Pakistan is very regrettable and deserves to be condemned. This attitude is all the more amazing in view of the fact that Pakistan has already made some very rational and just proposals for winding up its nuclear program. Pakistan has proposed that the Indian Ocean be made a nuclear-free zone. Pakistan has expressed its readiness to open its nuclear installations for international inspection on the condition that India does the same. Pakistan has also expressed its willingness to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty provided that India does as well. India has not made any positive response to these rational and practical proposals. The logical next step would have been for the United States and the Western powers to exert pressure on India to achieve the goal of nuclear nonproliferation. Even if we acknowledge that such pressure was exerted, we cannot deny it was done in a half-hearted manner. During U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Talbott's recent visit to Pakistan, Pakistan expressed its willingness to implement any just proposal on nuclear nonproliferation. The Indian response, on the other hand, was disappointing. Under the circumstances, the U.S. secretary's threat of using force against Pakistan is incomprehensible and extremely regrettable. We are fully confident that despite the U.S. secretary's threat, Pakistan will adhere to its principled stand and that the United States will not succeed in bullying this country. It is inappropriate for the United States to use such language. Certain quarters of the Pakistani Government are overly optimistic that a way can be found to provide limited defense aid to Pakistan despite the Pressler Amendment. The latest pronouncement by the U.S. secretary of the Army should be enough of an eye opener. The Pakistani Government should seriously make every possible effort to meet its defense needs through non-American sources. Also, the government should obtain the text of the secretary's speech, examine its implications, and lodge a protest with the U.S. Government if warranted.
