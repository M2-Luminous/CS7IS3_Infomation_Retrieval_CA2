FR940407-0-00035 FR940407-0-00005 DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY Office of Foreign Assets Control 31 CFR Part 580 Haitian Transaction Regulations; Blocked Individuals of Haiti AGENCY: Office of Foreign Assets Control, Treasury. ACTION: Final rule; amendment. SUMMARY: The Treasury Department is amending appendix A to the Haitian Transactions Regulations to add as section I of appendix A the names of individuals whom the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control has determined are blocked individuals of Haiti, either because they are included within the definition of the `` de facto regime in Haiti'' as defined in Executive Order 12755, or because they meet criteria for blocking set forth in Executive Orders 12853 and 12872. Property of these individuals that is located in the United States or within the possession or control of U.S. persons, including their overseas branches, is blocked, and transactions with these persons are prohibited. EFFECTIVE DATE: April 7, 1994.

Background The Office of Foreign Assets Control (``FAC'') is amending appendix A to the Haitian Transactions Regulations, 31 CFR part 580 (the ``Regulations''), to add a list of blocked individuals of Haiti as new section I to appendix A. Section I identifies individuals whose assets are blocked pursuant to Executive Order 12755 of October 4, 1991, Executive Order 12853 of June 30, 1993, or Executive Order 12872 of October 18, 1993. It supplements the list of blocked entities in section II of appendix A. On July 27, 1993, FAC published in the Federal Register (58 FR 40043) appendix A to Part 580, establishing a list of persons and entities whose assets were blocked, based upon a determination by the Director of FAC pursuant to §580.305(a) of the Regulations that they were included within the definition of the `` de facto regime in Haiti.'' Section I of appendix A identified individuals and section II identified entities of the de facto regime whose assets were blocked. Effective August 31, 1993, section I of appendix A was revoked consistent with United Nations Security Council Resolution (``UNSCR'') 841 calling for the suspension of certain sanctions against Haiti in light of the Governors Island Agreement. See 58 FR 46540 (September 2, 1993). The assets of individuals identified in section I were unblocked, while the assets of entities identified in section II were, and remain, blocked. On October 18, 1993, trade and other sanctions against Haiti were reimposed pursuant to Executive Order 12853, consistent with UNSCR Resolution 873. Reimposition of U.S. sanctions included the blocking of assets of certain classes of individuals. This amendment incorporates in new section I to appendix A a list of individuals whose assets have been blocked subsequent to the reimposition of sanctions against Haiti. Included in section I are individuals who were identified in a November 1, 1993 notice in the Federal Register (58 FR 58480) as blocked individuals of Haiti, as well as individuals whose assets were later blocked. The persons identified in section I are included for one or more of the following reasons: A. They are persons who seized power illegally from the democratically elected government of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide on September 30, 1991, or who, since October 4, 1991 (the effective date of Executive Order 12775), have acted or purported to act directly or indirectly on behalf of, or under the asserted authority of, such persons or of any agencies, instrumentalities, or entities purporting to act on behalf of the de facto regime in Haiti, or under the asserted authority thereof, or any extraconstitutional successor thereto; B. They are Haitian nationals (as defined in Executive Order 12853) who have provided substantial financial or material contributions to the de facto regime in Haiti or done substantial business with the de facto regime in Haiti; or C. They have (1) contributed to the obstruction of the implementation of UNSCR Resolution 841 and 873, the Governors Island Agreement of July 3, 1993, or the activities of the United Nations Mission in Haiti, (2) perpetuated or contributed to the violence in Haiti, or (3) materially or financially supported any of the activities described in items (1) or (2) of this paragraph. The designations in this amendment are made by FAC pursuant to the exercises of authority in Executive Orders 12775, 12779, 12853 and 12872, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1701 through 1706, the United Nations Participation Act, 11 U.S.C. 287c, and the Regulations. These provisions block all property and interests in property of the blocked individuals that is located in the United States or within the possession or control of U.S. persons, including their overseas branches. U.S. persons are prohibited from engaging in transactions with these individuals unless the transactions are licensed in advance by FAC. Payments and transfers of funds owed to blocked individuals may be made, pursuant to a specific license issued by FAC, into a blocked account held in the name of the blocked individual at a U.S. financial institution located in the United States. This list is not all-inclusive and will be updated from time to time. One cannot assume that an individual is not a blocked person based solely on his or her non-inclusion in section I of appendix A. In particular, it should be noted that all members of the Haitian armed forces are deemed to be blocked individuals of Haiti, as they are deemed to constitute part of the de facto regime in Haiti within the meaning of §§580.303 and 580.305(a) of the Regulations. Accordingly, all assets in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons of these individuals are blocked, and U.S. persons are prohibited from engaging in transactions with them unless licensed by FAC. Section II of appendix A, listing blocked entities of the de facto regime in Haiti, remains in full effect and force. Because the Regulations involve a foreign affairs function, Executive Order 12866 and the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553, requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, opportunity for public participation, and delay in effective date, are inapplicable. Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required for this rule, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612, does not apply.

For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 31 CFR part 580 is amended as set forth below: PART 580_HAITIAN TRANSACTIONS REGULATIONS 1. The authority citation for part 580 is revised to read as follows: Authority: 50 U.S.C. 1701&hyph;1706; 22 U.S.C. 287c; E.O. 12775, 3 CFR, 1991 Comp., p. 349; E.O. 12779, 3 CFR, 1991 Comp., p. 367; E.O. 12853, 58 FR 35843, July 2, 1993; E.O. 12872, 58 FR 54029, October 20, 1993. 2. Appendix A to part 580 is amended to revise the heading and the introductory note and to add a new section I to read as follows: Appendix A to Part 580_Blocked Persons of Haiti Note: Section I of appendix A lists the names of individuals whom the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control has determined are blocked individuals of Haiti, either because they are included within the definition of the `` de facto regime in Haiti'' as defined in Executive Order 12755, or because they meet criteria for blocking set forth in Executive Orders 12853 and 12872. Section II of appendix A identifies entities of the de facto regime in Haiti whose assets are blocked. Property of these individuals and entities that is located in the United States or within the possession or control of U.S. persons, including their overseas branches, is blocked, and transactions with these individuals and entities are prohibited. The information listed below is the most complete information now available to the Office of Foreign Assets Control. The absence of any particular person from appendix A is not to be construed as evidence that the person is not a part of, or owned or controlled by, or acting or purporting to act directly or indirectly on behalf of, the de facto regime in Haiti, or is not otherwise a blocked individual or entity of Haiti pursuant to Executive Orders 12755, 12799, 12853 and 12872.
