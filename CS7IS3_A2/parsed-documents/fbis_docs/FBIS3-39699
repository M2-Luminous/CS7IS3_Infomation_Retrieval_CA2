Aizpeolea report: "Pujol Demands That Gonzalez Accelerate Turnabout in Autonomy"] [Text] Madrid -- Generalitat [Catalan autonomous government] Premier Jordi Pujol stated yesterday that the time has come for the development of autonomy, and that this cannot be prolonged indefinitely, as happened with the transfer of 15 percent of personal income tax. Pujol made these statements after meeting unexpectedly with Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez at Moncloa Palace for three and a quarter hours. This meeting marks the official start of the negotiations on the turnabout in autonomy that Jordi Pujol announced months ago. The meeting was relaxed, and Pujol did not hesitate to describe it as "positive." The Catalan head of government tried to minimize the tension created following the publication of a document from the Generalitat Premier's Office demanding, among other things, a direct relationship with the throne. The report also demanded protocol precedence in Catalonia for the Generalitat premier over the central government's prime minister. After reaching agreement with the Socialists on economic policy -- which resulted in this year's budgets and the labor reform -- Pujol is now making his continued support conditional on an agreement on autonomy. Convergence and Union's 17 votes in the Congress of Deputies are the key to the government's securing a parliamentary majority. Yesterday's meeting between Gonzalez and Pujol took the news media completely by surprise, since the Generalitat premier himself asserted on the previous day that it was not the time to hold a meeting because of the tension created by the controversial document's publication. Pujol apologized for the deception. "We did not wish to find ourselves subjected to news media pressure," he said, but the meeting allowed no delay. Both Pujol and Gonzalez himself needed to relax the political atmosphere, and the Generalitat premier also admitted that this meeting should have been held a month ago. The Generalitat premier informed Felipe Gonzalez of the contents of the turnabout in autonomy sought by the Generalitat. He made five demands for areas of responsibility: Development of the autonomous police force, regional planning, public health funding, the reform of the peripheral administration, and some other outstanding transfers. None of what he put forward goes beyond the Catalan statute. Pujol, whose visit to Moncloa Palace coincided with that of Netherlands Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers, set no deadlines for the negotiations on the development of autonomy, but made it clear that they cannot be prolonged indefinitely. "There are no deadlines, but they cannot be prolonged indefinitely, as happened with the transfer of personal incomes tax," he said. He also made it clear in a relaxed tone that what he is demanding as autonomous powers for Catalonia is also valid for other autonomous communities. "Now We Will See" The Generalitat premier said that he did not demand replies from Gonzalez. He confined himself to informing him of his proposal for the development of autonomy and on that basis issued the challenge: "Now we will see." He only altered the moderate tone of his statements when he answered a question about the reasons the autonomy process is again at a crossroads by saying that "the Socialist government's policy has been very reductionist and restrictive." But Pujol tried to leave a trail of relaxation on his passage through Madrid, both during his meeting with Felipe Gonzalez and at his appearance before the news media. For instance, he played down the Generalitat Premier's Office document demanding an agreement with the throne and precedence in protocol for the Catalan premier over the central government's prime minister. Pujol, after stating that he does not accept the document as a whole, nor does he feel "guilty" about it, said that "the Generalitat has never demanded an agreement with the throne." With respect to protocol, he acknowledged that the Generalitat proposed a modest reform in 1983 or 1984. "We wished to place the Generalitat premier higher up, but never ahead of the prime minister." In short, he said that the document was one of so many ordered by the Generalitat in order to reflect. "We are doing this in order to emerge from the circle of those of us walking around Los Naranjos courtyard, reflecting and reflecting." The Generalitat premier tried to counter the impression that Catalonia has won many advantages for its parliamentary support for the Socialist government. He insisted that the only demands met were the transfer of 15 percent of personal income tax, as well as some economic measures for enterprises, from which "other communities have also benefited." Pujol also tried to relax the atmosphere by stressing that his conversation with Felipe Gonzalez turned more on the issue of the economy than that of autonomy. Five Points Pujol tried to explain that the development of autonomy was only one of five items at the meeting. The other four were the European situation, the economic situation, the social and labor situation, and structural problems of the economy. In the economic field, Pujol revealed that Gonzalez forecast an improvement for this year. Both in this issue and in the European issue, the Generalitat premier showed his agreement with the stances set out by Gonzalez. In an effort at relaxation, Jordi Pujol even denied that he raised with the prime minister the thorny issue of the Generalitat's and the autonomous communities' representation in the EC. He disagreed more in the case of social and labor matters. "The government should have gone further in the reform of the labor market. It must be made more flexible," he said.
