Nationalists Are Unhappy Over His Arrival, and Federalists Over His Inattention to Them"] [Text] After Boris Yeltsin's departure from Kazan the visit by "the high Moscow guest" continues to be discussed in public and political organizations of Tataria. Nationalist movements see Yeltsin's coming as a "meeting between Mintimer Shaymiyev and the head of a foreign state." For instance, Tatarstan Independence Party leader Nazib Galeyev explained to SEGODNYA's correspondent: "Yeltsin is the president of a neighboring sovereign republic whom we did not really invite and who cannot resolve any of our internal problems." Activists of the Solidarity committee raise the question about the failure of a treaty recently concluded between Moscow and Kazan to correspond to Tatarstan's fundamental law and believe that contacts with the Russian authorities cannot be pursued until after "the treaty has been adjusted to the republic constitution." The Tatarstan Republican Party, although it finds that treaty "infringes Tatarstan's interests," nonetheless considers Boris Yeltsin's visit not useless "in light of budget infusions he promised." Ruzal Yusupov, leader of Tatar republicans, complained that "now the question is only how much Tatarstan will get, for instance, from KamAZ [motor works] which Yeltsin promised to help." The bloc of "federalist" parties Equality and Legality -- as local representatives of Russia's Choice call themselves, the Democratic Party of Russia, the People's Party of Free Russia (which has dissociated itself from Rutskoy and Lipitskiy and intends to affiliate with Gaydar) and also the Accord movement, hoped during Yeltsin's visit to "draw Moscow's attention to the fact that Tatarstan is being ruled by a union of old party nomenklatura and the national elite." On the day of negotiations between Presidents Yeltsin and Shaymiyev the "federalists" staged pickets at the walls of the Kazan Kremlin and then used mass media to protest the fact that the Russian president "did not wish to meet with any representatives of the independent public." Virtually all political organizations of Tataria stated their discontent with Boris Yeltsin's "limited scope of meetings" in Kazan. A leader of the Russian Federation Citizens movement, Vasiliy Barabash, who is senior inspector at the Lenin district division of the Kazan City Internal Affairs Directorate, said that plainclothes police were instructed on the day of Boris Yeltsin's arrival to snatch placards from the pickets of democratic organizations. According to the inspector, "security forces from all areas around Kazan and all special task and militia forces were brought into the city to make sure that everywhere Yeltsin moves would be through a narrow corridor, without communicating with the public." Conversations with "grass-roots citizens," according to Vasiliy Barabash, were organized in places specially designated by the authorities, "with people prepared in advance." Republican leader Ruzal Yusupov said he was sure that "if the Russian leader really wanted to learn about the actual situation in the republic, he would not have gone exclusively to show-piece sovkhozes, in the old tradition of the stagnation era." "This cannot be helped: Traditions are traditions; after all they are all party people," Ruzal Yusupov concluded in a conversation with SEGODNYA's correspondent.
