On April 26-May 6, Jiang, also general secretary of the Communist Party Central Committee, visited local state-owned enterprises, where he had discussions with a number of enterprise managers on the establishment of a modern enterprise system in China. He stressed the important role that large state enterprises play in establishing and developing a socialist market economic system, pointing out that the basic way out for state-owned enterprises lies in the further deepening of reforms. Conditions are good in Shanghai for carrying out a modern enterprise system on a trial basis, said Jiang. He urged the municipal party committee and the local government to continue to create a favorable environment and conditions for the reform of enterprises by conducting active explorations in readjusting the government's functions, improving the management of state-owned assets, perfecting the management inside enterprises, establishing a social security system, perfecting the market system and relieving the enterprises of excessive burdens. The work should be well organized and done step by step, he said. He called on party committees at various levels to earnestly study Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and better put it to practice. In response to the demand of developing a socialist market economy, Jiang said, great efforts must be placed on the building of socialist ethics to improve the quality of the people at large and advance the development of the society on the whole. He fully confirmed the achievements of local authorities in carrying out the national economic guidelines and ensuring good momentum in the economic development. Jiang noted that the central authorities will persist firmly in the policy of opening up and developing Shanghai's Pudong New Area, the largest economic development zone in China. The Pudong New Area not only concerns the development of Shanghai but also is an important symbol of China's reform and opening policy, Jiang said. He asked local officials to insist on emancipating their minds and seeking truth from facts, to maintain and push the good momentum forward and do better work in the future.
