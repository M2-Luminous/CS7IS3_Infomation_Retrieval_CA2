At the end of his speech, he said: [Begin Khamene'i recording] Today is the stage of reconstruction. Today the people have the opportunity after a long war. For this very same sensitive reason, you can see that the world is attacking the productive policies of the Iranian people with poisoned arrows from all sides. It engages in propaganda, it engages in political games, it engages in security provocations, it engages in economic sabotage. The enemy does all it can, but thanks be to God, it is not successful in the majority of cases. In this era, the thing that can make you victorious, the thing that can build the nation, the thing that can keep the Iranian people on the political scene, the thing that can mobilize all forces in this holy path of construction is holding on to Islamic values with both hands.
