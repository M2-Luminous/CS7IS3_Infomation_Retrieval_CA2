Savichev; place and date not given: "The Snail Effect: Former Ministry of Security Staff Must Be Cut by 42 Percent"] [Text] It is probably not necessary to explain one more time how difficult it is to get any information from "competent organs." Especially in these troubled and unstable times we live in. Even the anonymous interview our special correspondent V. Savichev held with a high-ranking officer of the former MB [Ministry of Security] is only one personal opinion regarding the processes taking place in this sphere. [Savichev] In your opinion, why was the decision made to disband the MB? [Answer] In his speech the president called the MB the last bulwark of totalitarianism. We have to keep in mind, however, that all enforcement structures in all times were created in accordance with the existing state model and worked for that model. [Savichev] One gets the impression that lately they have been working in an autonomous mode. [Answer] We work for the state; the consumers of our product--information--are concrete people in the leadership of that state. It is up to them to decide which part of this information to put to use and which to bury. [Savichev] So which is it: Too little produced, or poor use? [Answer] I think in the current situation it is both. [Savichev] So it follows that enforcement agencies remain a state within a state? [Answer] We have always been and will be a state within a state. It is a sort of a snail effect: When democrats, deputies, the press, or anyone else attempt to touch the soft feelers, it immediately instinctively retracts part of its body into its shell. The genius of communist leaders was precisely in that they succeeded in creating self-contained, self-reproducing structures, be it the system of the party nomenklatura or enforcement agencies capable in a critical moment of switching to an autonomous mode of operation. [Savichev] Then perhaps the president's decision to disband the MB was caused precisely by this factor? [Answer] I think that the reasons for this decision were somewhat different. It is no secret that relations between enforcement structures have always been rather complicated. Each tried to get ahead, or sometimes even upstage colleagues from the neighboring agency, in order to demonstrate to the masters greater loyalty and get a bigger piece of the pie. This is true not just in our country but anywhere in the world. Now, after the October events and the latest elections, the president has realized that he does not have a base of support. There is not a single more or less serious political force in Russia today. But there are other forces, ostensibly not political, that are beginning to quietly exert pressure on him. The reorganization of the MB, in my opinion, indicates a desire to bring this agency closer under his wing in order to create a counterbalance to those pressuring him. [Savichev] All right, B. Yeltsin made the decision, as a result of which half of the staff will lose their jobs. At the same time, the structure possesses a certain share of state power. Will this system be willing to self-destruct? [Answer] Of course not. But at the same time the MB is not a political organization that puts forward ideas and attempts to implement them. The MB protects what already is--this is the specificity of its work. Besides, this system has over the past few years sustained considerable damage, and I do not think it is capable of adjusting the current external environment to meet its needs. More likely it will adapt to a new environment. The MB is such a complex organism that amputation of any of its components--that is, relegating it to carrying out the functions enumerated in the president's decree--will have the most negative consequences for national security. [Savichev] But the MB in the form in which it existed truly is a monster, and society is simply scared to live with it... [Answer] People get scared when they see a huge dog only when it is not restrained, hungry, and vicious. We are an instrument of the state, but there is no state yet. And no idea. What are we to do? Yes, we are a monster. The MB of such a huge country should be a monster. But one has to know how to manage this system. [Savichev] A very rich acquaintance of mine recently found himself in a situation of being "shoved" quite badly. So badly that he was not able to fend it off with the help of regular "specialists." The help came, through an intermediary, from counterintelligence professionals, who first ascertained how solvent he is. Well, they very quickly identified, and then simply squashed like flies, those racketeers. After that, they found their boss and warned him that, well, you are a good guy; we respect you and will leave you alone, but leave our people alone, or we will no longer respect you... Do you not think that if they can decide whom to respect and leave alone in the criminal world, they can do the same in other spheres--for instance, in politics? [Answer] I would probably agree with you, but if we want to discuss this more or less seriously, one needs the facts... [Savichev] I am sure there are people among your acquaintances who will not be hired into the new structure. What are their plans for the future? [Answer] Plans are different, but no one intends to take a job in a government structure. [Savichev] This leaves commercial ones. [Answer] Mainly, yes. And mind you, the people who being are forced to take this step are quite good. [Savichev] And the decisive factor, of course, is money. [Answer] There is an equally important factor of resentment. Resentment of the way they have been treated; of what has been done to the great power, for whose sake they at some time risked their lives--and these are not just pretty words. You see, in the past there was at least some ideology, ideals, if you wish; now it is a vacuum. When I cannot buy my son an expensive toy, and I see someone's Mercedes parked next door, I begin to think: Why do I need this job? I am fluent in three languages; I know how to work with people--take my word for it... I support democracy, but I fail to understand why it is that the more democracy we have, the more disadvantaged a man feels. Still, the material factor for most people I know is not the goal for which they would sacrifice honor and loyalty to motherland... Otherwise there would be many more of those defections that are such a fashionable subject to write about these days. When I worked there, my driving force, my main professional instinct was to protect you all.
