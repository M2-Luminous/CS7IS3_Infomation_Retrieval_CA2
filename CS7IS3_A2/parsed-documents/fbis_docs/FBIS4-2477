The local government sent anti-riot policemen to put down the demonstration. Four villagers were arrested and some villagers were reportedly hurt, although no accurate figures are available. This was the second riot in Guangdong in the last 10 days sparked by the problem of land acquisition. A similar incident occurred early this month in Huiyang County. The riot occurred in Gongbei village, Shitan town, Zengcheng City. At around 1000, about 3,000 villagers surrounded the city government building, marching and protesting with banners on which were scrawled messages about dying of hunger if they got no compensation for their land. Other villagers, holding hoes, held up the traffic and blocked the road from Shitan to Xintang and Zengcheng county seat, denying entry to public security vehicles. There was a standoff and tension ran high. At around 1400, hundreds of anti-riot policemen arrived at the scene and fired a dozen tear gas canisters to disperse the crowd, and later arrested a few villagers. Local villagers said that when the anti-riot force fired the tear gas, the situation was very chaotic. Many villagers were beaten up by public security personnel, and some were wounded. As of yesterday evening, an accurate count of the wounded was unavailable. Yesterday there were still a few villagers tacking up posters on the street, but the city had quieted down. The authorities began an investigation into the village riot a few days ago, but would not confirm whether official corruption was involved, only telling reporters that the matter was under investigation. Local villagers said that, about six months ago, the village government sold land of about 500 mu to a Hong Kong businessman for property development for 10 million yuan. It is understood that the village government had collected the money, but villagers had never received any government compensation. In the last six months, villagers had repeatedly demanded the land sale proceeds from the village government, but to no avail. The villagers charged the government officials of corruption. Early this month in Huiyang, there was a similar village riot sparked by the villagers' suspicion of their land sale money being pocketed. About 600 villagers of Bogang village, Xiayong town, Huiyang County besieged and vandalized the town public security neighborhood unit. A villager was shot in the thigh by public security personnel and seven were arrested during the incident.
