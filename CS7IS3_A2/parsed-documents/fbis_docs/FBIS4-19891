He was born in Athens in 1939. [passage omitted] Yennimatas personally told the Greek people that he was suffering from cancer. He went to the United States for treatment and after a few weeks returned to Athens with obvious hope that he had surpassed the danger. His condition deteriorated and again he informed the people, this time telling them that the cancer had affected his liver. His wife, Kakia, died of cancer a few months ago.
