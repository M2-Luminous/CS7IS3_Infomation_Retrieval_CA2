France was among five countries which abstained at the time, while 37 nations voted for a total ban on disposing of even weak radioactive waste at sea. France has not done such dumping for many years. Barnier said in a radio interview that Prime Minister Edouard Balladur had decided France should continue to set a good example and would sign the convention along with the majority of countries. Other abstainers to date include Britain, Russia and China.
