This was announced by OeTV Chairwoman Monika Wulf-Mathies this afternoon in Stuttgart. This means the wage compromise deal for the 3.5 million or so workers and employees in the public service sector is settled. The 36-man OeTV negotiating commission had earlier recommended acceptance of the compromise with 29 votes. The employers' proposal provides, among other things, for a pay rise for lower paid workers from July 1994. The pay of medium- and higher-paid employees will be raised from September 1994. In addition, the pay of east German employees will be brought up to western levels in two phases of 2 percent each. Employment-protection measures are also planned in eastern Germany. The new wage agreement will have a 15-month period of validity to offset costs.
