That is the reason why it must be emphasized internal incertitude is characteristic of the so-called societies in transition. The reason for such a prognosis is simple -- in such states, the most-radical and, in many senses, most-sensitive change comes about, which is in the titular ownership of the social capital, which was in the hands of the state in the former socialist countries. The bright side of the coin of privatization is the establishment of the market economy, when sound competition has to be the leading factor in the overall economic progress of the country. When we speak about sound competition, we will allow ourselves a small digression in the terminological explanation. Competition (this comes from Latin, meaning contest, rivalry) is carried out through supply and demand and the game of prices on one hand, and the action of the competition forms the market prices of the goods, following the law on the value of goods production, on the other hand. However, the transformation of the social capital, the famous "privatization," can and has to be viewed as a necessary evil that must be overcome with as few tremors as possible. Otherwise, the transformation itself would be transformed into a general theft that would leave nothing of the state. In such circumstances, "sound competition" becomes unimaginable, and "Madame Mafia," organized criminal, comes onto the scene. Awakening in Darkness Recent Interior Ministry information shows that the increasing number of acts of committing or concealing criminal acts causing great damage was characteristic of the last year, as was the receiving and giving of bribes, causing the appearance of a more serious dilemma on the surface. According to the information, this kind of detected criminal act, compared to 1992 and 1993, has increased 107 percent. The figure itself -- no matter how hard we try to view it as a conditional correlation -- points to an alarming situation. In order to avoid the dilemmas -- it is a fact that Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], compared to most post-communist countries or societies in transition, is maintaining a high level of security, which should not and must not make us self-satisfied. Particularly not when we talk about the economic crime that is increasing in the country. On the other hand, when we talk about the phenomena of "bribery" and "corruption," we must stress that they represent the more difficult forms of economic crime. In keeping with the way they transpire (most frequently they are done in private, or through various mediators), they are at the bottom of the list of proven cases. In other words, the so-called "black" figure of unrevealed criminal acts is the greatest in this area. As a matter of fact, there is an opinion that the criminal sphere in which bribery and corruption belong, the least revealed, is practically the most widespread in reality. Therefore, it exists, but due to its character, the difficulty of revealing and proving it, the absence of a practical strategy for its detection by state organs, it remains in the dark, that is in the unrevealed crime range. If we go back to the introductory views on the high risk of privatization, with the presumption that the dominance of social ownership is still reality in Macedonia, on the eve of its own metamorphosis into private or some other kind of ownership, we indubitably come to the conclusion that the social property is the most threatened at this moment. The remolding of the social capital into private capital reveals numerous hitherto-unknown forms of economic crime. On the other hand, the methods are classical -- abuses, bribery, and corruption. Almost overnight, like mushrooms after rain, new businessmen are appearing -- owners of private or mixed companies who, at the expense of everybody's or nobody's social ownership, at the expense of the sleeping and disorganized state, and primarily all at the expense of the workers who are rapidly approaching the edge of bare subsistence, make their wealth very quickly. The Robbery of the Century Continues As a matter of fact, it is a public secret and a regular subject of discussion among the common citizens, among those with a salary or pension of around 100 to 200 German marks a month, that the state is being robbed blind. For the time being, there are neither answers nor reactions from those bodies and services that are there to protect the state. There are no replies from the legislative or executive bodies that had to enact and implement the legal basis for preventing the state-damaging and dangerous events. The most logical conclusion is that such a situation suits all, particularly those in power. Except, of course, for the citizen whose bare existence is put at stake. Thus, the reaction of the common people is reduced to ordinary gossip about the state or the ruling power, which, regardless, is continually becoming a self-serving power. In order not to make this sound like a radical trade unionist dirge about the difficult fate of the working people, we shall stick only to the aspect that, according to the competent state institutions and their associates, is, especially now, demonstrating such indolence and indifference, which makes the whole matter look like an introduction to a kind of totalitarianism. Parallel to all this, what seen be noticed in Macedonia with open eyes, conveys to image that the state let go of the reins a long time ago. It has not just released them, but it is showing less interest and strength in taking control. It can be seen that individuals are making money overnight, that taxes are being avoided, that deals are mostly made in "cash" in order to avoid the financial institutions, that some companies have the exclusive right to import and export, given to them for their beauty (confidentially), that speculative liquidations are taking place, that the social capital is being sold off for next to nothing.... In such a situation, the rapid polarization of the citizens is evident, as well as the growing public discontent with the striking examples of abuse, machination, and speculation, which finally leads to a certain institutionalization of the crime. Claims that the state authority bodies are not involved in such filthy deals are fairy tales. In brief, no matter how painful it may be, the ancient scheme of connecting the economic power with the political power is slowly emerging in the Republic of Macedonia. This also creates the conditions for the revival of the connection between the criminal climate and the state establishment, which represents a basic definition of the phenomenon -- organized crime.
