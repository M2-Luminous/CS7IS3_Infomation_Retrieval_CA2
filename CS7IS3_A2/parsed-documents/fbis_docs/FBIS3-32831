I am at the Congress of the Republic covering reaction to the bill which Congress approved early this morning on the conflicts over civilian versus military jurisdiction in cases that do not involve drug trafficking. The bill eliminates the possibility that one person alone can decide if a case is to be tried by a civilian or military court. We have Antero Flores Araoz, congressman for the Popular Christian Party [PPC] with us. Congressman, we would like your comments on this issue. How do you view the fact that a congressional majority passed this bill when the La Cantuta case is still to be resolved? [Flores] Listen, what we saw at the Congress last night is something we never imagined could happen. Really, all moral principles were trampled. They [the ruling majority] did not care about anything and displayed an attitude of total arrogance and gall. The issue was not on the agenda and had not been discussed at the council board meeting. The issue was presented between midnight and dawn. They took advantage of the fact that the tribute to Don Luis Alberto Sanchez [recently deceased American Popular Revolutionary Alliance leader] had ended, and, without even distributing copies of the bill beforehand, they started the debate. The bill had not even gone through the commissions. This bill really dashes all the international pacts on international law signed by Peru. Those agreements clearly stipulate Peru's commitments with the due process of law and the people's right to be tried by competent courts. This law has a set purpose. [Collantes] However, the argument presented to substantiate the bill's approval is that the physical integrity of the magistrates, who have to decide on the jurisdiction of the La Cantuta case, has to be protected. [Flores] Does this mean the Armed Forces and the Police are not able to protect one, two, or three supreme court justices? Does this mean our Armed Forces and Police are so inefficient that they can't provide this protection and that we need to trample all moral principles and violate five articles of the Constitution simply because a leaflet fell in a justice's home? Is this their excuse for trampling the Constitution and international agreements? Please! This is only a plot between the Executive and Legislative branches to cover up the people involved in the famous La Cantuta case. They have become accomplices in this case. [Collantes] Congressman, a few minutes ago you presented a bill to repeal the questionable habeas data [as heard] article included in the 1993 Constitution. What prompted this action? [Flores] It is really very simple. Many people are talking about the need to regulate the constitutional article on habeas data and stressing that some of its dangers should be expunged. The PPC bloc believes, and said so when the Constitution was being debated, that the habeas data has to disappear. Dead dogs do not bite. Let us wipe out this article from the Constitution and kill this deadly institution at the root. [Collantes] This was PPC Congressman Flores. The opposition congressmen are currently meeting at Democratic Movement Congressman Henry Peace Garcia's office and will shortly issue a communique on the case having jurisdiction problems and on the bill approved early this morning. Back to the station.
