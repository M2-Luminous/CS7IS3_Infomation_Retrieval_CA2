In separate action on the same day, formations of overseas-based pursuit-assault planes and fighter jets of the U.S. Air Force present in South Korea flew in a ground-attack support of puppet army units in a war exercise staged with Pochon, Chunchon and Kapyong areas as operational theatres. Their ceaseless war rackets clearly show that the U.S. imperialists are rushing headlong along the road of military adventure against the northern half of Korea.
