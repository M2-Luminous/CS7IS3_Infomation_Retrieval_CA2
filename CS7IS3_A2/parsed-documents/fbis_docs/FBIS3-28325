Among the key officials Hosokawa met separately at his official residence were Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, and Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii. Hosokawa insisted that the new 7 percent levy on almost all goods and services, known as the "National Welfare Tax," is indispensable to secure funds for a 6 trillion yen tax reduction, which is a key element in the 15 trillion yen stimulus package, the aides said. Political sources said the rift among the coalition parties is too deep to be healed by Monday, and could affect the government's efforts to compile the fiscal 1994 budget. The Hosokawa cabinet is scheduled to decide on the pump-priming package on Monday, a fiscal 1994 economic projection on Wednesday and a Finance Ministry budget plan for fiscal 1994 on Thursday. Later on Thursday, Hosokawa is scheduled to leave Tokyo for a summit with U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington the next day. If things do not go smoothly, the government's plan to adopt the fiscal 1994 budget by February 15 may have to be delayed until February 20, political sources said. In an early morning news conference on February 3, Hosokawa proposed reducing 6 trillion yen of taxes retroactive to January 1 and replacing the present 3 percent consumption tax with the 7 percent national welfare tax in April 1997. But the proposal hit major opposition from the Social Democratic Party, the largest among the seven parties in the ruling coalition, which threatened to quit the coalition unless the fresh tax plan was dropped. Even members of Hosokawa's Japan New Party voiced opposition to the new tax. Coalition leaders went into huddles to debate the proposal and finally scrapped Hosokawa's tax cut and increase program on Friday, about 35 hours after Hosokawa's announcement. On Saturday, policy-makers of coalition parties held an emergency meeting and reached a basic agreement on several key issues, including the 6 trillion yen tax cut plan, government sources said. The agreement also called for the establishment of a consultative body to discuss ways to raise funds for the tax cut, the sources said. SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama told a news conference in Gifu, central Japan, that the 6 trillion yen tax cut should be carried out separately from the new tax proposal because it is part of the government's pledge to the United States. He said the new tax proposal surfaced all of a sudden and still needs time for a careful study. Murayama proposed forming a consultative panel from the coalition parties to discuss measures to fund the tax reduction. The panel should discuss a vision to promote public welfare and administrative and fiscal reforms, while taking into account the domestic economic situation, he said. Ichiro Ozawa, Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] co-leader and the coalition's chief strategist, in a commercial television program aired Saturday, said the new tax is important for the graying Japanese society. He said the welfare tax concept has gone through a democratic process, because it has been discussed by representatives of all the ruling parties since last year. Yohei Kono, president of the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party, said Hosokawa and other responsible officials have to be blamed for the controversy. "Remarks by the top political leader of a country bear heavy responsibility. To our great regret, Mr. Hosokawa showed a lack of principle," Kono said at a news conference in Otsu. Kono urged the ruling coalition to make public the course of developments that led to Hosokawa's news conference to announce the imposition of the new indirect tax. He also said those who were involved in the developments must shoulder the blame.
