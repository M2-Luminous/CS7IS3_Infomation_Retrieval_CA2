The wheels of the plane bearing UN insignia touched down on the runway of the Dubrave airport this morning, or, to be more precise, at 1145. The landing of the first plane at Tuzla airport passed without any incidents. General Michael Rose, commander of the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] for Bosnia-Herzegovina, was in the plane, as were some of the staff who will take care of the delivery of humanitarian aid to this region in the future. As we have found out from sources close to UNPROFOR, over the next few days some of the equipment necessary for navigation and fire prevention is expected to arrive at Tuzla airport. In a way, the landing of the first plane bearing UN insignia marks the fact that Tuzla airport has started functioning. As for the official opening, that will depend on the political decisions made at the level of the United Nations.
