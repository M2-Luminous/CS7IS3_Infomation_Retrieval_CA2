Lack of controls at state enterprises and units, profiteering, pilfering, and illegal sales of products were among the recurring issues debated in an effort to contribute to streamlining our economy and fostering the fight against crime. [First unidentified speaker] "The reason I stress the population's support of the police is that these people are selling things and are contributing, to some degree, to increased need in the population. The population wants to eat sandwiches and can find none. The state has no means of providing them. These people are selling guava sandwiches and thus the population's need is satisfied. We are not against this. But what is the price of that guava sandwich? Some may think this does no harm; but not everyone is able to pay 20, 30, or 40 pesos for a ham sandwich or 50 pesos for a rice and pork boxed lunch. I believe that the first thing the population has to do is to support the police in this effort. We ought to arrest these people who are selling products at elevated prices. People in the streets tell me: I am not a policeman. Perhaps not; but as a revolutionary, you are also a policeman." [Second unidentified speaker] "We all have to realize that cheese sandwiches take flour. Who produces flour? The state alone. Therefore, that person is profiting by selling the bread made by the state. I get a tiny piece of bread and, as a revolutionary, have to be happy with it. I am a revolutionary. I am a communist. I must be satisfied with that piece of bread that is my ration. We do not have the resources to distribute bigger portions. I give my little piece of bread to my son to take to school so he can get through the day. How come these people are selling bread? I have to fight these people, just as I do those selling pizzas. I arrest them and cannot shirk. Where did he get the flour when the pizzerias are closed because of the shortage of flour? Where did he get the flour? The state is the sole producer of flour. Only the state produces bars of soap. So all those people selling those products on the streets are doing so at the expense of the state. I agree with what the comrade said earlier: What we need is control." [Third unidentified speaker] "I believe that if we arrest all these people....[changes thought] despite some saying that they are small fry, we still have to arrest them. Some say, catch them at the factory; but these people have already dodged factory controls. Let us arrest them. We have a 24-hour-a-day presence on the streets. I believe that in the end this contributes to the distribution of soap, flour, bread, pizza, and everything else to the people. I believe that we cannot lose a single day, although some feel this should be the responsibility of other bodies. No, this is everyone's task and we all must support it." [Fourth unidentified speaker] "The state has to take control in Jaguey. People say that entire plantations of oranges are rotting. People are going there to profit from that. Who owns that product? It is a state product that the state could sell to the population and recover its investment. Who is making money? The bandits in the streets who have the resources the state lacks. This is a measure the state ought to take." [Fifth unidentified speaker] "You visit Guira and find plantains rotting on the ground. You ask the manager why there are no plantains in Havana when they are rotting here. He answers that there is no transportation. This is a shame. Anyone can go to Guira and carry home a bag of plantains; otherwise, they rot on the ground. However, the local patrolman confiscates the plantains and fines the person 40 pesos. [Inaudible rebuttal by another speaker] No. One has to keep the worker in mind. We know who is a worker and who is a profiteer. We have to feel for the worker who goes there to get a bag of plantains to feed his family, not for the person who day after day fills the trunk of his car to sell them in Havana." With political courage, Havana's provincial patrol unit policemen discussed shortcomings they need to overcome. [Sixth unidentified speaker] "Is this not included in the Official Gazette? Is this not a crime of profiteering? Just as the PNR does nationwide, I go and arrest this individual carrying 60,000 pesos in the trunk of his car. We check his file and find that he has an criminal record and no job. Hence, where does the money come from? Why is he not indicted? Why he is not tried for profiteering when that is a crime?" The opinions expressed by the members of Havana's provincial police patrol unit do not differ from those expressed everyday by Cuban workers, because they are an integral part of the people.
