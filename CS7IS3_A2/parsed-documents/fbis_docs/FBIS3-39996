Aerospatiale Director Louis Gallois feels that American political pressure should ecourage Europeans to examine this very revolutionary way in selling airplanes. In effect, the Saudi contract revives the U.S.-European dispute about international trade in airliners, an issue that was not resolved during the recent marathon of GATT negotiations, since the United States preferred not to make any conclusions on this point until they could find a chink in the armor of European defenses. It refused to include the 1992 agreement as one of the exceptions to the GATT general rules, and it is still seeking to limit Airbus influence in the world while attacking the consortium for the reimbursable advances which its industrial partners receive from the four countries involved in the the project (France, Germany, Great Britain, and Spain). At the same time the United States defends tooth and nail their own system of indirect support through military research programs which lead to civilian spin-offs. It was hoped that the agreement reached in 1992 between Washington and Brussels on direct and indirect public aid to the civilian aviation industry would calm moods. The Saudi affair shows that this is simply not the case. By referring to GATT, the leaders of the European aeronautics industry are baulking at Washington's argument, because Article 4 of the text concerning the trade in airliners expressly states that "the signatories shall refrain from subjecting airlines (...) to excessive pressure for the purpose of buying civilian aircraft of a given origin, which would entail discrimination against suppliers from another signatory." By announcing the signature of the Saudi contract, Bill Clinton provided the Europeans with a weighty argument during the negotiations on the aeronautics section of GATT which are to enter a crucial phase this year.
