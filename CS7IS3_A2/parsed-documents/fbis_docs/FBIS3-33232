The civilian parties were not present at the proceedings. General Luis Chacon Jara, who presided over the proceedings, waited half an hour for the lawyers of the victims' relatives. Their failure to appear confirmed their decision not to attend and participate in the trial. Despite the secrecy with which the trial is being conducted, it filtered out that prosecutor Saul Calledo opened the trial by reading a summary of the preliminary proceedings and demanding sentences from three months to 20 years for the various accused men. Two of the military men, Colonel Guzman Calderon and Gen. Rivero Lasso, were interrogated this afternoon. The questioning will continue tomorrow at 0900. Two criminologists are of the opinion that, should the existing penal code be applied, the maximum sentence that the involved military men would receive would be life for the clearly typified crimes of kidnapping and manslaughter. The La Cantuta case, which created a crisis in the government when it was transferred to a military court, is still being debated due to the penalties demanded by the military prosecutor, Col. Raul Calledo Valdivieso. Several authorities have described the penalties as mild because the existing penal code is being applied to military law. It has been reported that the penalties demanded for the accused range from two to 20 years for the crimes of homicide, kidnapping, abuse of authority, and oversight. According to a comparative chart, simple homicide receives a minimum sentence of six years and a maximum of 20 years under military law, while under the civilian code such a crime is punished with a maximum penalty of life. Under common law kidnapping receives at least 10 years, but the crime does not exist under military law.
