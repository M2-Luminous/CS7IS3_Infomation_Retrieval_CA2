A preliminary understanding to this end was reached last Tuesday in Kiev at the meeting of President Leonid Kravchuk and a Russian delegation, which included among others ambassador Yuriy Dubinin and the Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Navy Admiral Feliks Gromov. This was reported to the press on Wednesday in Sevastopol by Admiral Gromov who came to the Crimea together with Dubinin to study the situation involving the fleet. Under the Massandra protocol the Ukrainian part of the fleet should be surrendered to Russia as a form of payment for Ukrainian debts for Russian fuel and energy supplies. However, according to well-informed sources in the staff of the fleet, the essence of the protocol is going to be slightly changed. Russia will be getting only the part of the fleet stationed in Sevastopol together with the infrastructure of the city. Ukraine will keep the other naval facilities and ships located and stationed in Ukraine and Crimea. Dubinin described the meeting with Kravchuk as constructive. He said that immediately after returning to Moscow the Russian delegation is going to submit a detailed report about its visit to Kiev and Sevastopol to the president and prime minister. Dubinin and Gromov hope that the information about the meeting with Kravchuk and the report as a whole will help ease the tension caused by the latest incidents related to the fleet and resolve the fleet problem as a whole. Gromov regretted the refusal of the Ukrainian authorities to permit the Russian delegation to Odessa where it intended to sort out the difficulties. He stressed that it is quite difficult to establish the truth and added that he did not see anything wrong in the steps taken by the Cheleken ship. Last Saturday the ship took navigation equipment from Odessa to Sevastopol. "That is why I think the conflict was to a certain extent provoked by the actions of Ukrainian naval representatives who came to detain the hydrographic vessel," Gromov said. According to him, the seizure of the conservation ships in Odessa was a direct violation of all agreements between Russia and Ukraine.
