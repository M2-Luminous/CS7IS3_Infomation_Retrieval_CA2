FBIS4-30161 "dreas122_c_94006" FBIS-EAS-94-122 Daily Report 23 Jun 1994 North Korea KCNA Denounces `War Hysterics' of `Traitor' KCNA Denounces `War Hysterics' of `Traitor' SK2306060194 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0459 GMT 23 Jun 94 SK2306060194 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN ["War Hysterics Carried Into Extremes" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, June 23 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim Yong-sam called together "directors of non-economic ministries and agencies of the `government'" at "Chongwadae" on June 20 and told them that "strength must be built up, if peace is to be maintained," according to a radio report from Seoul. On the same day, the traitor Kim Chong-pil, chairman of the "Democratic Liberal Party" of South Korea, showed up at a puppet army unit in the frontline area and cried "the alert posture must not be slackened a moment". And he let loose a bellicose blast, driveling "if a war broke out again, I will fight on the front even as a private second class." This fully shows that the war hysterics of the Kim Yong-sam group has been carried into extremes. It is now running about like a headless fly to provoke a new war, taking issue with the fictitious "nuclear issue" of the North. The outpouring of the traitor Kim Yong-sam fully revealed his criminal intrigue to contain the North with armed forces in reliance on outside forces. And the traitor Kim Chong-pil's outcry that "he would fight on the front" is a harebrained folly of a special-class bellicose element who has gone off into war hysterics, itching to provoke a war against the North. The traitorous Kim Yong-sam clique are precipitating their own destruction by persistently resorting to the criminal moves to do harm to the fellow countrymen and plunge the nation into a holocaust of a nuclear war in league with outside forces, peddling the "doctrine of inevitability of sanctions against the North".
