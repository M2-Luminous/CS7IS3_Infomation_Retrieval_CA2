The highways link the region with Qinghai and Sichuan Provinces and Nepal, respectively. The construction of the Heihe-Gamdo Highway has been completed, and work is going well on some sections of the China-Nepal Highway, upgrading projects on the Qinghai-Tibet and Sichuan-Tibet Highways, and the Lhaze Bridge. Highways in Tibet are subject to frozen earth, mud-rock flows, snowslides, snow storms, desertification and landslides. Statistics show that such natural disasters have blocked highways in Tibet for an average of over 100 days each year in the past over 40 years. The Qinghai-Tibet Highway has undergone three large-scale improvements. As Tibet is the only region with no railway outlets, the Chinese Government attaches great importance to highway construction. In the past 40 years the central government has invested over 4 billion yuan (almost 500 million U.S. dollars at the current exchange rate) in highway construction. The upgrading and improvement of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway started in 1992 and will cost 850 million yuan (about 100 million U.S. dollars).
