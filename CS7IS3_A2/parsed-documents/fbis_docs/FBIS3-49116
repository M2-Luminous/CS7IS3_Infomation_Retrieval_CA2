Egyutteles respects the laws and the Constitution and does not seek the revision of the state borders with Hungary, Duray said, adding that his movement wants to strive to ensure rights for the Hungarian minority only as a legal part of the Slovak Republic. It is only by coincidence that the Komarno meeting will take place on the eve of U.S. President Bill Clinton's meeting with the presidents of the Visegrad countries in Prague, Duray said. Egyutteles demands that the ethnic principle is taken into account while introducing the new territorial division of Slovakia, he said, adding that his party intended to propose that the Komarno meeting appeal to the Slovak parliament to ratify the European Parliament Charter of European Towns and Regions. The Slovak Republic has not yet joined this agreement.
