This day is an important one because it marks the first significant step made by our people in their struggle to be free. [passage omitted] Ladies and gentlemen, we are celebrating this year's Madaraka day against a background of optimism and suffering by our people. We are all aware of the many social and economic hardships that ordinary Kenyans have had to put up with in the last two years due to worldwide economic recession whose effects were made worse by prolonged drought. During the same period we have had to implement far-reaching economic and political reforms. That we were able to successfully undertake comprehensive reforms is a testimony of the resilience of our nationhood. Indeed, few countries in Africa would have gone through such a transformation without the risk of social turmoil. I am therefore most grateful to Kenyans, particularly the ordinary men and women who bore the brunt of most of these reforms. I am equally grateful to our friends who have tried to understand the negative social impact some of the measures have had on our people. In spite of these short-term setbacks, I am convinced that the reforms that we have implemented would lead to renewed to economic growth and prosperity for our people. What is urgently needed, and my government is taking adequate measures, is to sharpen the reforms and to focus on the social dimensions of development. This should be done by developing programs in all the relevant ministries to address the basic needs of the poor and disadvantaged in search of security, food, school fees and textbooks, medical services, transport and water. The identification of needy cases and the provision of assistance will be done by the local relief and welfare committees. My government has already started these programs by providing school fees and safety nets for those retiring from the public service. My government is also making budgetary provisions to strengthen this program in the 1994-95 financial year. I am, however, making a very strong appeal to the donor community to join us in refocusing the structural adjustment programs to an approach which meets all the noble ideals of balanced development. Ladies and gentlemen, as I said during the recent international investment conference, my government is fully committed to a market driven economy which will attract foreign investments. However, my government is concerned with the increasing marginalization of sections of our population as we open up the economy to market forces. This is an area which cannot be left to market forces alone and that is why ways and means must be found to cushion the vulnerable groups from the adverse effects of economic liberalization. As we grumble with the effect of these reforms it must be understood by all that the concept of transparency and accountability is not expected to be applicable only to the people of Kenya, for to do so is tantamount to saying that Kenyans cannot be trusted or be relied upon, that would be most unfair. Recognizing that no society on earth can claim to be perfect, we will continue to serve our people in the best manner possible. In turn, we expect foreign organizations and institutions based in Kenya, especially the nongovernmental organizations, to conduct their affairs openly, fairly and with due regard to the laws of this country. Dear Kenyans, as we celebrate this day when we attained internal self-government it is also appropriate to review the political atmosphere in our country. Seventeen months ago we held the elections which ushered in a multiparty Parliament. The elections were preceded by intensive political activities, which unfortunately, divided Kenyans along ethnic lines. Today, long after elections were concluded, Kenyans still look at one another with suspicion. Some leaders continue to regard themselves as the guardians of the interests of their supporters only. Besides, some leaders continue to spend a lot of useful time politicking rather than guiding Kenyans into development-related activities. Indeed, one of the reasons why the economy performed poorly last year was because of our people spending many man hours in unproductive activities. Fellow citizens, it is upon you to decide on your future and as your president I urge you to choose hard work for prosperity and development. Kenyans are known for their determination, commitment, and hard work. Indeed, since independence the culture of hard work, unity and love for one another has been responsible for the significant development that the various sectors have registered. Regrettably, we risk losing the culture of hard work, tolerance, and unity of purpose if we continue engaging ourselves in activities that would not benefit anyone. Tribalism is on the rise. Politicization of almost every aspect of our social life is getting entrenched and an increasing number of Kenyans are spending their most valuable times in idle talk. This has to stop. Ladies and gentlemen, the time to arrest this situation is now. We must ensure that tribalism does not gain a foothold in our society. After all, the many patriots who made it possible for us to be free people set aside their ethnic differences in order to pursue their common objectives. It is therefore incumbent upon all leaders from KANU [Kenya African National Union], the opposition, the clergy and other categories of leadership to demonstrate their commitment to a united Kenya. On my part, I will always, as I have done throughout my political carrier, champion the interests of all without fear or favor. Events taking place in neighboring countries should serve as a reminder to Kenyans to guard against divisive politics. As I have often said it is the ordinary mwananchi [citizen] who is the innocent victim when a chaotic situation grips any country. My government will not tolerate leaders who are bent on inciting people or diverting their efforts from those which enable them to earn their livelihood in a peaceful atmosphere. Equally, the government will give all necessary assistance to leaders who are genuinely interested in helping Kenyans improve their standards of living. I have deliberately emphasized the need for us to remain united because I genuinely believe that Kenyans have a right to live in peace with one another. Indeed, that was the main reason our forefathers waged a bitter struggle to win freedom from political domination. Leaders bent on inciting Kenyans and wasting their times are betraying the very spirit which was the driving force behind the struggle for independence. [passage omitted] Ladies and gentlemen, events taking place in other parts of Africa are both disturbing and regrettable. Indeed, unless the unwarranted killings and displacement of people stops our continent faces a very bleak future. The loss of lives taking place in Rwanda, Somalia, and southern Sudan must stop. There can be no justification for such a heavy toll of human lives. Regrettably, the loss of lives taking place in some parts of Africa is happening at a time when donors are increasingly diverting interests from the continent. African leaders must appreciate that the continent is on the verge of complete marginalization from the rest of the world. We must act now to save this continent from social turmoil or disintegration. On our part, Kenya will continue to participate in efforts to bring lasting peace to conflict-torn parts of Africa. In view of the serious concern I attach to problems facing the people of Rwanda, I have requested my colleagues President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire, President Hassan Mwinyi of Tanzania, and President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda to join me in a meeting which is being proposed for 6 June, Monday. But I am not optimistic of this meeting, because of the complicated tragedy which took place in Rwanda. Because it is so complicated, no one hopes for a clearer future. Many international communities all over the world wonder why neighbors are not rushing to save Rwandans. It is because of that complication. I pray God that Rwandan leaders will be shown the right way to protect the lives of the innocent children, women, and the entire Rwandan people. The state of genocide that gripped that country is indeed chilling and unbearable. It must come to an end, if that country is to move forward. My fellow countrymen, the conflicts which face some African countries should make us Kenyans resolve to maintain peace which we have enjoyed since independence. We owe it to future generations to build a united, peaceful, and prosperous country. As we celebrate this year's Madaraka Day let us once again renew our commitment to live in peace, love, and unity with one another. May God bless you all. Thank you.
