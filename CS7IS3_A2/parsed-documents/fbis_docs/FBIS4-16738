At the Moment, However, Only the Politicians Are Active"] [Text] A Civic Accord Assembly will be convened in the Kremlin on 28 April for the signing of the Agreement on Civil Peace. The document will be open for amendments, comments, and suggestions until 20 April. Thus there is very little time left. However, no great activeness has been observed yet among the potential parties to the agreement. The Social Democratic Party of Russia has clearly announced its readiness to sign the memorandum. The Party of Consolidation supports the idea of the agreement. The Majority Party, one of the "newest" Russian parties, has expressed its attitude toward the contract. It is a very ambivalent attitude, let us note: While supporting the idea of consensus itself, the party's leadership has announced a readiness to affiliate to the agreement only if it is substantially reworked. Given that according to fundamental political, economic, social, moral, and ethical criteria there exist not just different but even opposing viewpoints, it may be that even those political forces which are amenable to accord will not be able to agree "point by point" and that the memorandum will be signed by only those few opposition organizations which even without a special agreement are taking part in political activity on a strictly constitutional basis and according to constructive principles. But it is the passivity of the population which is surely the most worrying factor. Of course, the nonparticipation of the overwhelming majority of citizens in the conciliation process is not evidence of the indifference of the masses toward their own fate and that of the country but is the result, on the one hand, of the exceptionally weak influence of political organizations among the masses and, on the other, of a fairly formal attitude toward the process on the part of the power structures at all levels. There is a third reason as well. Many (not only in number but also in scope) nonpolitical and social organizations -- various types of unions, societies, associations, and foundations -- have been excluded from the conciliation process. Reliance on a party whose only interest lies in the struggle for power is surely less promising as regards accord than the involvement in the peacemaking process of nonpoliticized associations which have a much broader base among the masses, are the fundation of a civic society, and could form a reasonable, calm, and constructive counterweight to the politicians' ambitious aspirations.
