Replacement satellites will be ready for launch in July and October of 1994, respectively. "On 24 January in Kourou, Arianespace suffered its first failure in four years of consecutive successful launches. Over the course of those 26 flights, Ariane placed in orbit 40 European and foreign satellites. Today we have experienced a failure! We can accept this without undue distress, because we know the launcher is reliable though (unfortunately) not perfect." With those remarks, Arianespace CEO Charles Bigot summed up the situation after the surprising--and financially painful--failure of the European launcher's 63rd flight. It was Ariane's sixth failure in just over 14 years, and Ariane 4's second failure (out of 35 launches) since starting service in June 1988. The misfire abruptly deflates Ariane 4's success rate from its previously enviable level of 97.1 percent, to a mere 94.4 percent! The 24 January failure was the most costly one in the entire world history of commercial launches. Indeed, the Ariane 44LP carried record insurance of $356 million, or about Fr2.2 billion, on its twin payload of two, Aerospatiale-built telecommunications satellites, the first Turksat 1A and the second-to-the-last Eutelsat 2. Mohammed Dhabi, general director of Faugere & Jutheau, the broker that insures all Ariane launches, says the Eutelsat 2/F5 was covered for about Fr1.1 billion (170 million accounting units), and the Turksat 1A for about the same amount. The contract to insure the two satellites had totally depleted the funds available on the world market. Charles Bigot further notes that Arianespace's insurance department, S3R, had to add $35 million to the $321 million collected on the international market (from 87 insurance companies). "It is a brutal loss," acknowledges Charles Bigot, who ticks off the additional costs of modifying Ariane and of revenues lost by the two operators, Europe's Eutelsat and Turkey's P&T. The satellites of the Turkish postal and telecommunications office were made by Aerospatiale in Cannes, with the help of Alcatel Espace in Toulouse. Ariane's 63rd flight was the first time Aerospatiale had had two of its satellites on board one launcher. In another first, the French firm was even granted the privilege--as are all direct Arianespace customers--of inscribing its name on the European rocket, since it had signed a contract with Turkey to place both Turksats in orbit in January and July, 1994, respectively. Finally, it was Aerospatiale's--and more broadly, any European firm's--first experience with a "turnkey" delivery (geostationary-orbit, ready-to-operate satellites), as stipulated in the $315 million contract it had signed with the Turkish P&T in 1990. The Turkish Minister of Transports and Telecommunications, Mehmet Kostepen, had come to watch the launch in Kourou via a specially chartered Airbus 340 Aerospatiale and Arianespace had reserved for its 150 VIPs. Mr. Kostepen was obviously quite disappointed at Ariane's failure, which deprives him of a satellite scheduled to begin operating and generating revenues by late February. In particular, the Turksat 1A was slated to relay Turkey's four national television stations and 10 private ones throughout Turkey, Central Europe, and the Middle East. The expanded broadcasts are meant to reach 100 million Turkish speakers, and to turn the Turksat program, in which Ankara will ultimately invest a total of $600 million, into a money-making proposition. But Mehmet Kostepen has not lost confidence in Ariane, stating that "the second Turksat should be launched in July" and that "God willing, I hope to be in Kourou again to see it launched." On the other hand, Eutelsat's general director Jean Grenier seemed more affected by the mishap. Grenier certainly had no desire to lose his satellite, despite the fact that he had protected himself by insuring a Eutelsat 2 for the first time. "I don't know what we're going to do," he confided to us immediately after the 2/F5's loss. Grenier has not ruled out the possibility of ordering an additional Eutelsat 2 to avoid a capacity shortfall between now and the arrival of his new "Hot Bird Plus," which Aerospatiale and MMS are currently vying to build. The botched launch is also "an enormous disappointment" for Aerospatiale CEO Louis Gallois, who had come to watch his first Ariane launch. Gallois's group has been the main manufacturer of Ariane rockets since 1973. According to him, the failure demonstrates that "We are still at the technological development phase." This terse comment was an unintentionally harsh condemnation of Ariane teams, which were already "bitterly disappointed by the accident." Charles Bigot stressed this when he "apologized to his customers for the failure" that lost the two satellites, which tumbled into the Atlantic off the coast of Africa. In a letter written the day after the Ariane accident, French space minister Gerard Longuet "reaffirmed his personal confidence and that of the government" in Arianespace and "the entire Ariane program community." The industry minister believes that "Ariane will resume its excellent track record without delay." So the investigating committee will have to do its job thoroughly, but most of all, quickly. Indeed, Arianespace thinks that, given the nature of the accident, "There is reason to hope for fairly quick diagnosis and corrective measures." Charles Bigot has announced that the investigative team will "submit an initial report by mid-February"! "Arianespace's priority is to serve its customers," says Bigot, adding that, according to the rules, customers that have just lost a satellite are given relaunch priority. "Ariane's manifest will be altered accordingly," so that the (insurance-paid) replacement satellites can be launched as soon as possible. But the actual advantage of this policy will be slight in this case, at best maintaining the previously-scheduled launch dates of the next models, Turksat 1B and Eutelsat 2/F6, for July and October, 1994. Aerospatiale Space-Defense Director Michel Delaye has, in fact, confirmed that the two satellites will be ready for that date. Delaye notes that the Turkish contract requires Aerospatiale to provide a replacement satellite to Turkey within two years. Moreover, if the second satellite is lost as well, the Turkish P&T can demand full reimbursement of the $315 million. Jean Grenier explained that the Eutelsat 2/F6 was designed for a slightly different mission than the 2/F5 (which was altered to broadcast to the East), and is not in any case scheduled for launch until next October. But perhaps the European organization's satellite will be able to cut in ahead of its Luxembourg SES competitor's Astra 1D in the fall. In any event, Arianespace aims to "start flying again shortly" to "make up the time lost" as a result of the F63 failure, a delay that is still difficult to calculate exactly. "We have the capacity to speed up our schedule," says Charles Bigot. The CEO noted that "the operational plan calling for 10 flights a year over three years beginning in 1994 does not require a launch rate of one every five weeks, but just under half that." The original schedule was established precisely in order to allow for technical, program, or industrial glitches. Moreover, says Charles Bigot, on 1 February Arianespace expects to unveil a new operational plan "that will accelerate operations still more and enable the company to launch rockets every three weeks." The new plan will probably require working Arianespace teams six out of seven days. The first task of those teams will be to dismantle (and perhaps ship back to Europe) the third cryogenic stage that is now mounted on the next launcher (F64), scheduled to carry an Intelsat 7 on 23 February. Charles Bigot is not willing to announce a new launch date, but he hopes that operations will resume "in a few weeks." That seems rather optimistic, however, and at best specialists believe Ariane will be grounded for at least two to three months. All of Ariane's next flights will be postponed accordingly, at least for the remainder of 1994. Boxed Material: An Overheated Bearing Is the Cause of Failure Arianespace's CEO confirmed the day after the launch that initial examinations during the night had revealed "a failure caused by the premature shutdown of the third-stage engine. Eighty seconds post-ignition of the cryogenic stage, the pressure in the center of the stage, the pressure from outflowing oxygen, and the rotation speed of the liquid-oxygen turbopump, which had all been normal until then, slowed for 0.5 seconds, then dropped abruptly." More specifically, a quick survey of recordings shows that, after 60 s of nominal cryogenic engine operation, the countersunk bearing of the oxygen pump (also cooled by liquid oxygen at 170ï¿½C) become abnormally heated. Overheating was slight at first, during two stroke operation, then shot up exponentially, quickly exceeding the maximum threshold. This surge destroyed the bearing and stopped the oxygen turbopump, which was rotating at 13,000 rpm. Francois Calaque, the director of Aerospatiale Launchers, privately made the same diagnosis immediately after the accident, when only preliminary data on the F63 failure were available. The accident, Charles Bigot went on to say, "has nothing to do with the (four-day) launch postponement decided as a precautionary measure (before F63), to correct the (electrical) anamoly discovered in an interface case of the previous (F62) launcher's module." Now Arianespace must clarify exactly, and as quickly as possible, the underlying cause of the accident, which began with the destruction of the bearing. As Charles Bigot explains, the bearing "acted as a fuse," and engineers must figure out how it could have become vulnerable to destruction just one minute after ignition of SEP's HM7B cryogenic engine. According to Daniel Mugnier, director of Launchers at the National Center for Space Studies, the disastrous heating of the bearing was apparently due solely to a mechanical overload (which the bearing is not designed to tolerate), rather than a purely thermal phenomenon. But it will be up to the immediately-formed investigative committee to "thoroughly analyze and elucidate the reasons for the anamolous operation of the engine," declared Charles Bigot. Arianespace's CEO affirmed that "the Ariane system is mature and proven, but remains technically fragile." Its cryogenic propulsion system in particular, he says, "is more sensitive than the rest of the rocket." This is a well-established fact, since problems with cryogenic propulsion have unfortunately caused five of Ariane's six failures since 1980!
