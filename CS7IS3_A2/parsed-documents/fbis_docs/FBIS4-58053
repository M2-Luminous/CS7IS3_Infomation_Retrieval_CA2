Military officials of the Aden-based Yemen Socialist Party (YSP) said the 1,200 troops pulled out after reinforcements of northern troops, including elite Republican Guards, arrived at 'Imran, 60 kilometers (37 miles) north of Sanaa. Yemeni journalists who visited the scene said the northern troops gained the upper hand in the fighting which began on Wednesday, and the southern forces sought refuge with an allied tribe, the Bakil. YSP officials described the southern forces' retreat as a "brilliant tactical manoeuvre," which avoided unnecessary casualties. President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih blamed south Yemeni "secessionists" for the fighting, which also left 200 people injured, and warned them to halt the provocations. The official SABA' news agency said Salih, visiting northern troops wounded in the clashes, appealed to the southerners "to see reason and to adopt peaceful dialogue as a means of resolving differences." A pro-YSP newspaper, October 14, said Friday northern troops based in the south were reinforcing their positions. "The (northern) al-'Amaliqah brigade is stocking up with weapons and ammunition in order to tighten its grip on Abyan province and a key point commanding eastern the gateway to Aden," the paper said.
