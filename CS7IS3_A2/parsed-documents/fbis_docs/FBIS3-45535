He said that serious difficulties facing the coal industry last year lay in the large amount of debt owed by coal consumers with the money in arrears increasing by RMB 3.8 billion over late last year. Such debt, according to Mr Wang, resulted in a serious shortage of capital required by the coal industry with the payroll for coalminers being badly affected. Banks had to help pay salaries by giving coal mines loans. The shortage of capital needed by coal mines make them unable to afford raw and processed materials as well as equipment, all of which are of great importance to the safety of coal mine work. As important repairs for mine facilities cannot be carried out because of lack of money, safety technology required by the coal industry had been adversely affected. Statistics show that orders accepted by coal enterprises registered a sharp drop last year, making up a mere one-tenth of orders received in 1992. Orders for coal mining equipment amounted to a mere RMB 93 million for 1994, far lower than the RMB 651 million in 1992. Facilities for safety in the coal industry cannot be renewed because of the shortage of capital. Should the input into mining production not be forthcoming, according to the Vice Minister of Coal Industry, Mr Zhang Baoming, the supply of coal will be in jeopardy. These serious problems have been of great concern to the State Council which decided to allocate a bank loan of RMB 1.5 billion to the coal industry to pay salaries to the miners, Mr Wang said. The State Council was determined that the People's Bank of China and the Economic and Trade Commission would be responsible for the settling of the debt in the coal industry and a national meeting of heads of branches of the People's Bank of China would place it at the top of the agenda for an early solution.
