CONTENTS: 1. Israeli Center Prepares 365 Studies on Islamists 2. Islamists' Activities Highlighted 3. Repentant Extremist's Story Refuted 4. Labor Party Official on Party Policy, Cultural Conflict ISRAELI CENTER PREPARES 365 STUDIES ON ISLAMISTS In a 250-word report on page one, AL-SHA'B writes that "the Israeli Academic Center in Cairo has prepared about 365 studies on Islamic groups in Egypt, and about 2,567 researchers and public figures collaborated with the espionage center to prepare 295 field studies, including one on the Labor Party and its questionable relationship with the Muslim Brotherhood." ISLAMISTS' ACTIVITIES HIGHLIGHTED In a 300-word report, 'Adil al-Bahnasawi writes on pages one and seven that the killing of innocent people in al-Ghana'im in Asyut Governorate by the security forces has caused "extreme anger among the people." The writer adds that "until this incident took place last Sunday evening [27 March], al-Ghana'im has been outside the circle of this escalating conflict between the security forces and the Islamic groups." Another 240-word report by 'Amir 'Id and Khalid Yunis on pages one and seven notes that "the Islamists scored a sweeping victory and all their candidates won in the pharmacists union elections that took place last Tuesday [29 March]." REPENTANT EXTREMIST'S STORY REFUTED Under the headline "The Story of the Investigation's Agent Who has Become a Television Star," AL-SHA'B publishes on pages one and seven a 950-word report commenting on the television interview with repentant Islamic extremist 'Adil 'Abd-al-Baqi. The paper says that according to reports received by AL-SHA'B, 'Abd-al-Baqi "works for the State Security Investigations Service," was "planted among the Islamists to spy on them and collect information," and "has never been a leader and has not recruited 10,000 people as he claimed, but was merely a member in the al-Shawqiyun group." The paper says that it has interviewed some of those mentioned by 'Abd-al-Baqi, including Shaykh 'Abdallah al-Samawi who "affirmed that 'Adil 'Abd- al-Baqi works for the State Security Investigations Service and that he befriended him and got married to his sister-in-law to spy on him." Shaykh al-Samawi denies that 'Abd-al-Baqi was his student in prison or that he instilled in him the idea of stealing from the rich to spend on members of the group. He adds that when they both got out of prison, 'Abd-al-Baqi came to his house to apologize for his ill manners in prison and ask for forgiveness and to be accepted as a student, promising he would be a loyal and faithful student and would only get married at his hands. Shaykh al-Samawi then says: "I was deceived and thought that he came with a pure heart." LABOR PARTY OFFICIAL ON PARTY POLICY, CULTURAL CONFLICT AL-SHA'B features a 3,600-word article on page five by 'Adil Husayn, former chief editor of AL-SHA'B and Labor Party secretary general, in which he begins by outlining the party's dogma. Husayn says: "Under the banner of God is great, we seek to mobilize our people against American oppression and the strategic alliance between the U.S. Administration and the Jews, which seeks to cause strife among Muslims, humiliate us, and weaken us militarily, politically, and economically. "The Labor Party, under the banner of God is great, is fighting the corrupt and illegal profiteers despite their power and high positions. God is stronger and higher. Yes, we fight the corrupt who plunder the nation's resources and hand its keys to the enemies. "We resist the sale of national public sector companies to foreigners and Jews cheaply. We resist injustice, reject manifestations of luxury, and object to the displacement and impoverishment of workers and people. "We reject attempts to cast doubt on Islam and on those who call for adherence to the Islamic shari'ah under the pretext of combating extremism and terrorism. We reject the spread of despotism, torture, indiscriminate killing, military courts, and death sentences en masse. We loudly declare that these methods will not end violence but aggravate it. "All citizens and champions of freedom: You must realize that if you display indifference and allow the violation of your rights and sanctities to become a matter of principle and course, things will not stop with those who oppose the regime by force. State terrorism will reach anyone who expresses opposition in words. The current case against the leaders of the Labor Party and the editors of its newspaper is a prelude to something worse--all tongues will be cut and full darkness will prevail. "The Labor Party is waging a struggle for the sake of God on various fronts. We ask the sons of this nation to participate with us in this struggle by joining our party and backing our policy. We ask them and ourselves to be patient, because God's victory is near. "I say to the faithful that we must struggle and prepare the means for strength and victory, and then leave the rest to God's will. God's victory is certain to us; He does not violate His promise. Whether victory comes in our days or at the hands of those who come after us, we accept His will. But I wrote once and add today that the signs indicate that today's youths will witness the day of victory, God willing, if they strengthen their determination and intensify their efforts. I am not dreaming or imagining; I follow what is going on around us, in the Islamic nation and the world, and the facts and developments confirm the truth of what I am saying." Husayn then reviews in detail a study by Samuel Huntington entitled "Is It a Clash Among Cultures?" which notes that the world is no longer composed of states but of seven or eight regional cultures. The conflict in the world will continue and perhaps intensify, not among states but among these cultures. The study explains how the West can deal with these cultures, including the Islamic awakening, and maintain its domination. Husayn emphasizes the need for unity of the Islamic nation and strengthening of its alliance against the "Western Satan." He says unity can only be based on obedience to God. "It is against religion and country to accept the enemies' domination of our affairs and to befriend them." This is the duty of believing governments. "But even if there are weak, corrupt, or unbelieving governments, the people's power can force them to abide by God's order," he says. The writer concludes that the Islamic nation can achieve its goals and face the Western challenge. This, he says, demands "patience and the ability to continue the struggle and sacrifice." We are on the offensive in all places to raise the banner of "there is no God but Allah," and through large physical and material sacrifices we will achieve victory. But what is Egypt's role in all this? "It is certain that those who govern in Egypt have nothing to do with this Islamic awakening. In fact they are deliberately trying to smother it." But they will fail. "Do what you like. The day of reckoning is coming. On our part, we will continue the struggle by legal means to remove you, O corrupt and impotent ones, so persons who can restore Egypt to its place at the heart of the Islamic renaissance will assume control. In this struggle, I do not think that trials--or anything of the sort--will deter us. It is a small price that we will pay willingly, hoping that God will bless us."
