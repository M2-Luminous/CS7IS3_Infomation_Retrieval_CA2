I. Kolosova; UDC 519.681:05] [Abstract] The problems of debugging parallel programs are discussed. Metho ds of gathering information by tracing are described. This information is sufficient to begin analysis before one begins debugg ing repeated executions. This article proposes a method of autonomous analysis of these event traces which enables the user to better understand the behavior of the parallel program, reduce the search for errors, and reduce debugging tests. The first sec tion describes a method of forming and using event traces, and includes a consideration of an architecture with shared storage. The creation and use of traces of implicit events are addressed. The second section presents the autonomous analysis method. This method makes it possible to find errors associated with a lack of correlation of interacting processes, processes which are execution time-independent in some parallel intervals, and implicit events which occur when the program is stopped. Competitiv e processes are detected. The method is implemented in Turbo Prolog 2.0. Figures 7; references 14: 2 Russian, 12 Western.
