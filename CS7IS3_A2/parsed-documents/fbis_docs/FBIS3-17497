Several political commentators have assessed Russia's policy on using force as the beginning of a new cold war and a wave of military pressure directed on the former Soviet Union, particularly the republics in the Caucasus. The statement was not a new development in Russia's policy of strengthening its military presence in the CIS republics. But Kondratyev's statement indicated that Russia has ignored the international community's opinion and challenged international norms. That was a new and undesirable factor in his statement. Undoubtedly, one of the reasons Russia moved to use force is the radical political developments in that country. Another is Russia's failure to realize its views on international and regional developments during the past few years. Russia tried to find a legal solution to two problems in the international arena until as recently as yesterday. It called for international status for the MDB [not further identified], as in the case of the CSCE. It will be recalled that Moscow has an influential position in the MDB. Russia called on the world to agree to the deployment of its military forces in the troubled areas in the former Soviet Union as peacekeeping units. But the international community has rejected its proposals on the grounds that they conflicted with international norms. Consequently, Russia now seems to have abandoned its diplomatic initiatives and adopted a different policy. Deputy Defense Minister Kondratyev's statement has revealed a sharp turn in Russia's policy. Naturally, that has created several questions in people's minds. Why does Russia, which has deployed military units in several republics on the bases of bilateral agreements, insist on giving the status of a peacekeeping force to two of its divisions? That aspect promised nothing favorable for Azerbaijan. Russia has no military troops in Azerbaijan and Baku does not wish to allow any to be deployed in the Republic. Everyone knows that Russia covertly directs pressure on the sides involved in the Karabakh problem. Apparently, the deployment of its military units in the region as a peacekeeping force will create a favorable opportunity for it--politically and legally--to direct pressure on the sides without having to conceal it. Azerbaijan's political leaders have often stated that they oppose the deployment of Russia's troops in the disputed region under any title. They believe that the Russian troops will most probably be based between the warring sides, that is, in Karabakh. But that will make the dispute worse. Undoubtedly, the move will prolong the dispute indefinitely and create an undesirable situation for Azerbaijan. Despite its assuring but misleading aspects, the deployment of Russia's military forces in the region in the form of a peacekeeping force could place Azerbaijan in an unfavorable political and military situation. Regarding Kondratyev's fearful statement, REUTER has quoted Western observers as saying that the effort made to realize its stipulations will, undoubtedly, create a clash between the Western world and Russia, which is already in a difficult situation.
