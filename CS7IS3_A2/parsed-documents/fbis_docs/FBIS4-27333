Other parties have continued their criticism of "the relationship between Ozawa and Yuichi Ichikawa" who is secretary general of the Komeito [Clean Government Party], and now some Shinseito members are criticizing Ozawa as "too self-righteous." Uproar Over Dismissal Hajime Funada, secretary in charge of policy affairs for Shinseito, notified Aino of his dismissal as director of the Committee on Rules and Administration. His dismissal, however, was decided as part of a series of shakeups in Shinseito two weeks ago. Mr. Ozawa was discontent with the way that both Okuda and Aino, who attached importance to cooperation with opposition parties, ran the Diet. Kozo Watanabe, acting secretary general of Shinseito, did not notify Okuda of Aino's dismissal out of consideration for Okuda. Kozo Watanabe did not let Okuda know about the dismissal of Aino, who is known to have been "Mr. Okuda's protege for 17 years," for fear of intensifying the rivalry between Ozawa and Okuda. In his article in the weekly journal, Aino accused Ozawa of forming the parliamentary group "Kaishin" and claimed that its formation was "Mr. Ozawa's mistake" that resulted in the minority government. Aino, who is strongly reacting against his dismissal, is claiming Ozawa dismissed him in retaliation for his criticism of Ozawa. Aino is increasingly making critical comments about Ozawa, saying: "It is not permissible to send Mr. Funada to me to notify me of my dismissal. Mr. Funada was a junior legislator just like my younger brother when we belonged to the Takeshita faction." Junior legislators in Shinseito are siding with Aino, asking, "What is wrong with speaking of Mr. Ozawa's mistake?" Party Reform [subhead] Shinseito was been able to overcome the crisis arising from Aino's dismissal after Kozo Watanabe and Toshihiro Nikkai, secretary in charge of general affairs, succeeded in calming Okuda. Aino nonetheless is stressing the need to reform the way that Shinseito is run under Mr. Ozawa's top-down style, saying, "It is necessary to promote intraparty communication." Some junior lawmakers are arguing: "The secretary general of our party holds the exclusive right to manage our party's personnel affairs. If our party were run by a bottom-up style, it would be unable to deal with this uncertain political situation." Explaining what Ozawa thinks, a senior lawmaker in Shinseito says: "Mr. Ozawa has always made decisions with all things taken into consideration. He has managed our party's personnel affairs with potential media criticism taken into account. It is regrettable that nobody understands the way he gets things done." A senior legislator in Shinseito says, "We support Mr. 's reformist policies, but all things have not gone the way Mr. Ozawa hoped." Whether or not Ozawa is able to reform Shinseito while listening to intraparty opinions is likely to determine the future of Shinseito.
