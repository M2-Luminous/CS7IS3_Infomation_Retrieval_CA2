FR941222-0-00009 FR941222-0-00003 NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION 10 CFR Part 72 RIN 3150&hyph;AF02 List of Approved Spent Fuel Storage Casks: Addition AGENCY: Nuclear Regulatory Commission. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is amending its regulations to add the Standardized NUHOMS Horizontal Modular System to the List of Approved Spent Fuel Storage Casks. This amendment allows the holders of power reactor operating licenses to store spent fuel in this approved cask under a general license. EFFECTIVE DATE: January 23, 1995. ADDRESSES: Copies of the environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact, as well as, the public comments received on the proposed rule are available for inspection and/or copying for a fee at the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW. (Lower Level), Washington, DC. Single copies of the environmental assessment and the finding of no significant impact are available from the individuals listed under the next heading below. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Gordon E. Gundersen, Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, telephone (301) 415&hyph;6195, or Dr. Edward Y. S. Shum, Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, telephone (301) 415&hyph;7903. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Section 218(a) of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (NWPA) includes the following directive: ``The Secretary [of the Department of Energy (DOE)] shall establish a demonstration program in cooperation with the private sector, for the dry storage of spent nuclear fuel at civilian nuclear reactor power sites, with the objective of establishing one or more technologies that the [Nuclear Regulatory] Commission may, by rule, approve for use at the sites of civilian nuclear power reactors without, to the maximum extent practicable, the need for additional site-specific approvals by the Commission.'' After subsequent DOE technical evaluations and based on a full review of all available data, the Commission approved dry storage of spent nuclear fuel in a final rule published in the Federal Register on July 18, 1990 (55 FR 29181). The final rule established a new Subpart K within 10 CFR Part 72 entitled ``General License for Storage of Spent Fuel at Power Reactor Sites.'' Irradiated reactor fuel has been handled under dry conditions since the mid-1940s when irradiated fuel examinations began in hot cells. Light-water reactor fuel has been examined dry in hot cells, since approximately 1960. Irradiated reactor fuel has been stored continuously at hot cells under dry conditions for approximately two decades. The NRC's experience with storage of spent fuel in dry casks is extensive as described in the proposed rule to establish 10 CFR Part 72, Subpart K (May 5, 1989; 54 FR 19379). Further, the United States has extensive experience in the licensing and safe operation of independent spent fuel storage installations (ISFSIs). By the end of 1994, six site-specific licenses for dry cask storage will have been issued: Virginia Power's Surry Station, issued July 2, 1986; Carolina Power and Light's (CP&L) HB Robinson Station, issued August 13, 1986; Duke Power's Oconee Station, issued January 29, 1990; Public Service of Colorado's Fort St. Vrain facility, issued November 4, 1991; Baltimore Gas and Electric's (BG&E) Calvert Cliffs Station, issued November 25, 1992; and Northern States Power's (NSP) Prairie Island Nuclear Generating Plant, issued October 19, 1993. All except NSP have commenced operation and loaded fuel. At the end of 1994, dry storage spent fuel inventories of these utilities are as follows: 500 assemblies at Virginia Power, 60 assemblies at CP&L, 530 assemblies at Duke Power, 1480 fuel elements at Public Service of Colorado, and 190 assemblies at BG&E. NSP plans to begin storing fuel soon. In May 1993, Consumers Power's Palisades Station commenced operation and loaded fuel under the provisions of the general license in 10 CFR Part 72, Subpart K. At the end of 1994, approximately 168 assemblies are stored at Palisades.
