Do the insurgents still think the same way? [Ilom] I believe that first of all there was a fundamental decision. It was to struggle and dedicate oneself to the people's cause. As of that moment, it became an historic option and path, motivated by structural reasons in the country. It was not a romantic decision, but a very serious, profound, and delicate political decision. We had to respond to the situation that had existed in the country for many years when we took up weapons in 1962. The armed struggle is a last resort, not tactical or casual. [Hernandez] Everything seems to indicate that there were options to solve problems, but perhaps you were closed to establishing an open dialogue? [Ilom] No, history has demonstrated that political spaces have been totally restricted. Other times they have been formal, but we believe that real democracy still does not exist in Guatemala. [Hernandez] Why didn't you negotiate from the beginning and not after 33 years of armed struggle? [Ilom] One could say now that the conditions are right. Seeing what has occurred at the national and international level, we could say the time is right for negotiation. [Hernandez] Could this represent a success or satisfaction? [Ilom] Satisfactions are of a moral nature and the greatest is having contributed so that the people can organize, demonstrate, defend themselves, and struggle for their rights. I believe that is my greatest satisfaction, and also being able to participate in the people's armed struggle. [Hernandez] How would you refer to the case of the millions killed? [Ilom] War is always painful. One goes to war when there are supreme reasons that justify it or make it necessary. In Guatemala the social cost has been quite high, but the majority of those killed was a result of the manner and means used by the Army to repress and massacre entire populations. [Hernandez] Did the guerrillas provoke that repression? [Ilom] I believe that we seek only general objectives. In war there is a substantial difference. One is the military struggle on which we base ourselves. It could be described as a clean war with the painful loss of human lives. Unconventional warfare is different because of the tactics involved. The Army, however, kidnaps, tortures, and kills, and that is repression. Sabotage becomes a military technique, recognized by any treatise writer (tratadista). We are involved in a unconventional war. [Hernandez] There is talk of a war, in the field and politically. The military claim they won the first one and that the URNG [Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity] seeks to win the second one. How do you view this? [Ilom] That is a very fanciful and absurd view. On the one hand, because it does not respond to reality, because the URNG has not been defeated, despite the fact that the Army has proclaimed itself the winner approximately 800 times in the past 10 years. Another mistake is to say that there is a political and military war. For us it is an overall form of struggle. This enlightens us and preserves the armed movement. These are affirmations by recalcitrant sectors who do not want to seek a peaceful solution. [Hernandez] Why do you maintain a contradictory position and conduct terrorist acts while engaging in a peace dialogue? [Ilom] Let us make one thing clear. We conduct military activities, not terrorist activities. As long as a cease-fire is not agreed upon, the URNG actions will continue. It depends on the Army to make a counteroffensive, although it can be resolved through political negotiations. Then, it is wrong to say that while there is dialogue there will not be war. It does not represent a lack of will, however. [Hernandez] Don't you think the people see this as an inconsistency? [Ilom] No. [Hernandez] Why? [Ilom] For us it means remaining in the struggle. What has not been said is that there are sectors seeking to block the progress in the peace talks. [Hernandez] What sectors? [Ilom] Both the Army and private enterprise have come out in that direction. [Hernandez] What makes you think they are the ones, and what objectives do they seek? [Ilom] It is clear, because they are the minority privileged sectors that do not want transformations that are necessary for the country in every respect. They want to maintain society as they have for the past 30 years, to maintain a counterinsurgency situation that has led the majority of the people to poverty. This is always done at the cost of the people, who must endure subhuman conditions. [Hernandez] By blowing up bridges and electricity towers, are you directly struggling against those sectors? [Ilom] Of course. We have conducted military sabotage of bridges and some electricity towers that specifically affect the large producers of the country who do not want the people to organize and claim their rights. In the same way, last August we began to charge the war tax on farms, in view of the intransigence of sectors that do not want the negotiations. The checkpoints and highway holdups are not our actions. They are carried out by the military, with the aim of discrediting us. I would also like to explain that the latest incidents, such as the demolition of the San Juan River bridge on the way to the Atlantic was not the work of the URNG. [Hernandez] Don't you stop to think that the people are the ones who suffer from the demolition of bridges and the lack of electricity? [Ilom] It only causes them inconveniences. Of course, we would not like it to happen, but reports exaggerate how people are affected. They are inconvenienced by having to transfer from one vehicle to another and having to wait for electricity repairs to be made to restore service. [Hernandez] Have you ever considered other methods that do not affect the population? [Ilom] Yes, we have other alternatives such as the practice of the war tax. This has been selective and carried out at very specific political moments. [Hernandez] When you speak of the war tax, how many victims have had to yield to your demands? [Ilom] Look, I can't say how many, because many of them have paid their tax and they could have been affected. It is an important activity and we have made some tax extensions for humanitarian and labor reasons. [Hernandez] How successful have you been? [Ilom] We have been successful economically. [Hernandez] Is part of the success you speak of the kidnapping of Franterno Vila Giron? [Ilom] No, that was not done by the URNG. It is quite different to collect taxes from a farm than to kidnap persons. In this case the Army must be investigated. [Hernandez] Yet the guerrillas are accused of having links to the FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front] to conduct kidnappings. [Ilom] That was a baseless charge aimed at affecting the FMLN and the URNG. We have clearly said so. [Hernandez] Are you going to continue with the war tax? [Ilom] Until the process of negotiation concludes. We are only beginning and that activity has been reported at the international level. [Hernandez] In other words, the URNG does not have economic resources? [Ilom] Economic resources are always insufficient, but the URNG has been struggling for 12 [number as published] years and can continue to do so with or without money. It is not an economic problem, but rather a political one. [Hernandez] There are guerrilla forces that are out of control. Is this so, and could it be described as a disintegration? [Ilom] There is no force out of control in the URNG. It involves bandits or special Army groups who conduct counterinsurgency activities. [Hernandez] It was reported in Europe that Commander Ilom is tired of the struggle and is searching for new objectives. Is this true? [Ilom] You can say you have seen Gaspar Ilom and that he has the same revolutionary enthusiasm he had on the first day, only with 30 more years of experience. I am not tired. On the contrary, each day I am ready to struggle for my people in whatever form is necessary. [Hernandez] When the URNG becomes a political party, what will your wishes and role be, and who among the commanders could be a presidential candidate? [Ilom] That is not a function of the URNG. We have not strived for leadership, much less for any candidacy. We have a project that will permit the country to progress and to resolve an armed conflict. Then the bases can be established to resolve the economic, social, and political crisis. [Hernandez] But for such a project, one needs to be in the presidency. [Ilom] We are a developing political force and a real alternative for uniting efforts and seeking consensus.
