FR940817-0-00050 FR940817-0-00017 Some commenters stated that immigration inspectors at ports of entry need the authority to execute arrest warrants for immigration violations to conform with historical practices of the United States Attorneys offices. In light of existing practices, the Service and the Department agree that immigration inspectors at ports of entry do need to continue executing arrest warrants for both criminal and administrative immigration violations. However, immigration inspectors do not need the authority to execute arrest warrants for non-immigration criminal violations. The investigation of non-immigration criminal offenses associated with the authority to execute an arrest warrant for non-immigration violations is beyond the scope of an immigration inspector's responsibilities. Accordingly, the structure of §287.5(e) in the final rule has been changed to focus on the distinction between ``immigration'' and ``non-immigration'' offenses, and to grant authority to immigration inspectors to execute arrest warrants for immigration violations. The revised language of §287.5(e) also specifies, as the structure of the proposed rule specified, that detention enforcement officers are authorized only to execute warrants of arrest for administrative immigration violations, not warrants for a criminal arrest that can be executed by other officers. In carrying forward this distinction, the Commissioner is authorized to designate additional officers (individually or as a class) to execute warrants of arrest for administrative immigration violations, while approval of the Deputy Attorney General must be sought to designate additional officers (individually or as a class) to execute criminal arrest warrants. Finally, §287.5(e)(2)(ii) grants authority to execute criminal warrants of arrest for non-immigration violations only to border patrol agents, special agents, deportation officers, their supervisors and managers, and immigration officers who need such authority and who have been designated by the Commissioner with the approval of the Deputy Attorney General. Several commenters questioned the efficacy of granting immigration examiners the power to arrest for immigration violations in §§287.5(c) (1) and (2) yet not authorizing them to carry firearms in §287.5(f). Similarly, other commenters stated it was inappropriate to authorize detention enforcement officers to carry firearms yet preclude them from effecting any arrests. The Service and the Department disagree. The ability to effect an arrest is not conditioned upon the carrying of a firearm. Other federal, state, and local law enforcement officers' duties require them to make arrests without a firearm, and they do so without incident. Similarly, the potential need and ability to use deadly force to defend an officer does not imply a concomitant need for arrest authority. The two authorities are not necessarily concomitant. Detention enforcement officers do not need arrest authority. Detention enforcement officers' principal duties are to transport and guard detained individuals who have already been placed under arrest. They also execute warrants of arrest for administrative immigration violations. In order to clarify the detention enforcement officers' authorities, §287.59(c)(6) has been added to the final rule. Five commenters questioned whether immigration examiners and deportation officers who perform inspectional duties at ports of entry on an overtime basis would be precluded from exercising the enforcement authorities granted to immigration inspectors. Immigration examiners, including free trade examiners, and deportation officers are considered to be immigration inspectors when in the uniform of an immigration inspector and performing inspections or supervising other immigration inspectors performing inspections, provided all training requirements for immigration inspectors have been met. To avoid misinterpretation, the Service has added language to the rule stipulating that immigration examiners are authorized to exercise the same enforcement authorities granted to immigration inspectors when they are in the uniform of an immigration inspector and performing inspections or supervising other immigration inspectors performing inspections. Deportation officers are already listed as authorized to exercise the same enforcement authorities granted to immigration inspectors, but §287.5(b) has been amended for clarification to include deportation officers only when in the uniform of an immigration inspector and performing inspections or supervising other immigration inspectors performing inspections. Two commenters stated that certain immigration officers stationed in Service offices overseas should be granted law enforcement authority. They also noted that immigration officers stationed overseas occasionally must work on cases within the United States. The Service and the Department note, however, that immigration officers cannot exercise any of the enforcement authorities while working in foreign countries. When overseas officers are assigned to a duty post within the United States, they assume the power to exercise all of the criminal and civil enforcement authorities assigned to the applicable category of immigration officers, provided all training requirements have been met. For example, a special agent overseas who is detailed to an assignment in the United States has all of the enforcement authorities granted to special agents, provided that the detailed special agent has met all training requirements for special agents. However, overseas immigration officers do need the authority to interrogate, administer oaths, and take and consider evidence. Accordingly, §287.5(a) in the final rule has been amended to grant such officers authority to interrogate, administer oaths, and take and consider evidence in or outside the United States.
