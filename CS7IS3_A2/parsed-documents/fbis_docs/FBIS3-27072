Speaking on German television, Kohl said he had phoned U.S. President Bill Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin about the Bosnian conflict and the NATO ultimatum during the day. He said the two presidents should seek a peaceful solution to the conflict by taking advantage of the good relations between them. The chancellor also announced that Germany will provide backup support for their NATO allies when necessary. The NATO ultimatum orders both Bosnian Serb and Moslem forces to relinquish control of their heavy weapons in Sarajevo by midnight on February 20, or face Allied air strikes. The ultimatum came after a mortar attack on a Sarajevo street market on February 5 killed 68 people and wounded nearly 200. Over the past few days, the international community has tried to avert an escalation of the Bosnian war in hopes that the NATO ultimatum will be able to end the 22-month-long Bosnian war. Also today, the United States, Britain, and France welcomed a Russian proposal to send Russian troops to Sarajevo in exchange for the withdrawal of Serbian heavy weaponry from around the Bosnian capital. But they emphasized that the NATO ultimatum still holds -- heavy weapons must be withdrawn or placed under U.N. control by the deadline, or face Allied air strikes.
