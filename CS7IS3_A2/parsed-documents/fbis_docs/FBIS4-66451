This measure was necessitated by the July 1993 revised ``waste treatment law'' that specifically regulates the treatment of gasoline station wastes. In the private sector, Ishiyagawa Plant of Kobe Petroleum Business Co-op Union had been treating gasoline station wastes without government subsidy. The ANRE's treatment plant for spent oil and oil-containing sludge from gasoline stations will be built by providing a subsidy of ¥200 million (two-thirds) in FY94 to the Prefectural Petroleum Commerce Co-op Federation, which will pay the remaining one-third. Initially, only one plant is planned, and it is to be modeled after the Ishiyagawa Plant of Kobe Petroleum Business Co-op Union. This particular plant, constructed on a 3,205-sq m lot at a cost of approximately ¥300 million and in operation since 1974, is capable of treating 550 kl of spent oil and 100 tons of oil-containing sludge per month. Spent oil is preheated to 130�C, dewatered in a flushing tower, and sent to a stationary separation tank, where the sludge sinks to the bottom. Oil recovered from this process is converted into heavy oil, which is used as fuel for public bath houses and greenhouses. Oil-containing sludge, together with the sludge separated from spent oil, is sent to an incinerator for separation of the oil component from the aqueous component. Processed sludge is disposed of at reclaimed dumping sites in Kobe City. Processed spent oil, which may be classified as between A and B heavy oil grades and which has a low sulfur content of 0.6 percent, can be re-used. According to a recent survey by ANRE, the majority of gasoline stations paid the processor for spent oil processing; approximately 50 percent of the total spent oil was stored in drums. The same trend was also seen for oil-containing sludge. Therefore, the construction of more treatment facilities is desired not only by regulators, but also by petroleum dealers, who are concerned about their waste disposal.
