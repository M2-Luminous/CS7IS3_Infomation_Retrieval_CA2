Opposing peaceful evolution has become a very pressing task of our people and the war veterans force. Indeed, members of the WVA have actively participated in the struggle against peaceful evolution and have, together with people throughout the country, strived to heighten vigilance against the enemy's schemes and tactics. They have promptly detected and consistently monitored work of various organizations of reactionaries, especially their sabotage activities. Moreover, the WVA has also seriously implemented the foreign policy of our party and state, carried out tasks in accordance with our party lines and orientations, and motivated various people's strata to actively participate in the struggle against wicked schemes of the hostile forces.
