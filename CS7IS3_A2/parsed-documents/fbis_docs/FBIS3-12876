Today, he held a phone conversation with Minister Shulamit Aloni and explained to her that not all the reports regarding this issue are accurate. Rabin told Meretz leader Aloni he wants to meet Meretz ministers tomorrow in order to explain the situation to them. Meanwhile the Meretz Knesset faction convened in Tel Aviv today and decided to reject Tzomet's inclusion in the coalition at the present time. Environment Minister Yosi Sarid explains the decisions of his party: [Begin Sarid recording] Meretz believes that the inclusion of Tzomet in the government at the present time is unwarranted and should be rejected. In the wake of the Hebron massacre and its grave repercussions Tzomet's inclusion would send out a negative message to our Palestinian interlocutors, Israeli Arabs and their public and Knesset representatives, and would have an adverse effect on the peace process' chances of quickly proceeding toward a positive conclusion. [end recording] It is worthwhile to note that Minister Sarid put the emphasis on the present time. Meretz believes that at the present time Tzomet's inclusion would harm the peace process, but in a few months -- after the first stage of the Oslo agreement is implemented -- conditions could change. Meretz's statement also mentioned SHAS [Torah Observing Sephardim], calling on it to return to the coalition. Meretz is perhaps signalling to Rabin that they are willing to compromise on SHAS' return to the coalition. [passage omitted]
