FBIS4-60492 "drnes101_c_94001" FBIS-NES-94-101 Daily Report 24 May 1994 ARAB AFRICA Egypt Musa News Conference on Sudan, Yemen, 'Arafat Musa News Conference on Sudan, Yemen, 'Arafat NC2405163694 Cairo MENA in Arabic 1405 GMT 24 May 94 NC2405163694 Cairo MENA Arabic BFN [Text] Cairo, 24 May (MENA) -- Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa has stressed that if Sudan continues to take measures against Egyptian interests in Khartoum, Egypt will not remain silent; it will reconsider its policy toward Sudan. During a news conference he held today, the foreign minister said that despite allegations, which all have a weak and illegal basis, the Sudanese authorities' acts against Egyptian families on the day preceding 'Id al-Adha demonstrate the reckless attitude of the brothers in Sudan, not only in taking these measures but also in their timing and implementation. Continuing, 'Amr Musa said: We disagree with the Sudanese measures and the way they were implemented. The Sudanese authorities chose the easiest but worst way to harass Egyptian families residing in Sudan. This runs counter to Islam and also lacks decency. The decisions, which were based on completely false premises, were meant to harm relations and halt any efforts to promote them, the foreign minister added. At his news conference, the foreign minister said: I was preparing to visit Sudan, but the Sudanese authorities have decided to oppose Egypt's request to join the Preferential Trade Area [PTA] for Eastern African States. Egypt's application was opposed solely by Sudan, which threatens Egyptian interests and prevents the Egyptian people from enjoying economic cooperation with the East African states. When the Sudanese Government resorted to this stand, I decided to cancel the visit. The foreign minister said that Sudan opposes Egyptian membership in the PTA even though Egypt has refused to take part in any international conference that might take a stand against Sudan or its interests. He said that this Egyptian position stems from Egypt's historical viewpoint favoring integration between Egypt and Sudan and fostering the brotherhood of the two peoples. Consequently, we cannot do anything against Sudan's interests. We have demonstrated this stand in the field of human rights and in the UN Security Council, UN General Assembly, the World Bank, and the IMF, 'Amr Musa added. Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa suggested that there is a minority in Sudan trying to poison relations between Egypt and Sudan. However, Musa affirmed that Egypt will take steps only when it believes it will be necessary and useful. During the news conference, the foreign minister said these Sudanese measures will have a negative impact on the relations between the two peoples. He reiterated Egypt's firm stand concerning the unity and territorial integrity of Sudan, even though the Sudanese Government's measures are meant to mar its relations with Egypt and other countries. The foreign minister pointed out that a minority in Sudan will not succeed in affecting the historic and deeply-rooted relations between the Sudanese and Egyptian peoples. Regarding the situation in Yemen, the foreign minister described it as tragic and regrettable, stressing the interest in the issue of Egypt and President Husni Mubarak, as well as their keenness to find a solution to the problem there. He maintained that no Arab state would approve of the current situation in Yemen. We must candidly condemn the use of force between brothers, he said. Musa added that no one would have expected that Yemen, which was united four years ago, would end up in such a tragic political situation. The foreign minister said that unity is a legitimate objective for all Arabs, and this also applies to the people of Yemen, both north and south. Musa added: We cannot but support the voices which call for unity. However, unity cannot be safeguarded by military action, the foreign minister said. To a question about 'Ali Salim al-Bid's secession and decision to establish the Democratic Republic of Yemen, 'Amr Musa said: Let's wait for a while so that we can deal with the tragic situation and infighting between the Yemenis. He said no Arab state can take a mere observer stand regarding the situation in Yemen. He underlined the recent contacts by President Muhammad Husni Mubarak with the Yemeni president and a number of officials. Foreign Minister Musa said the failure to reach a cease-fire shows the extent of the tragedy in Yemen. He added that the Arab world as a whole must handle the tragedy by halting the fighting, disengaging the armies, and seeking to reopen dialogue between the Yemenis in the north and south, because they are all Yemeni and are one nation. As for the continuing political situation, he noted it is up to the Yemeni people themselves. He emphasized that such a clash may generate a continuous conflict in most parts of Yemen. Commenting on the Nonaligned Movement ministerial conference due to be held in Cairo on Tuesday, Musa said President Husni Mubarak will inaugurate this conference, in which 108 countries will take part, and that Egypt has so far received notice that 85 ministers will attend. He added that the conference will discuss all pressing political issues, such as Bosnia-Herzegovina, Somalia, and the effects of GATT [General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs]. He pointed out that Serbia and Montenegro are not the natural inheritors of Yugoslavia and hence they cannot inherit nonaligned membership automatically. He stressed that Belgrade's military operations and military policy against Bosnia, Croatia, and other republics that used to comprise Yugoslavia are acts of aggression and violations of the UN Charter. He said that given these violations, Belgrade cannot automatically participate in the Nonaligned Movement's meetings, noting that because of all this, Egypt did not send an invitation to Belgrade, a measure that was agreed upon with Indonesia, who currently chairs the movement. Musa commented on the current crisis caused by Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat's statements in South Africa about a jihad. He said president 'Arafat played a major role in leading the Palestinian action that recently led to the transitional agreement called Gaza-Jericho and it was 'Arafat who signed the joint statements in Oslo, Washington, and Cairo. He added: If we count on statements coming out of Israel and Palestine we will end up nowhere. The foreign minister said: It is not right for us to hesitate because of a statement that might have been distorted or not quite understood. But what is certain, we feel, is that President 'Arafat is determined to implement the Declaration of Principles and the concluded agreement and to press ahead toward a peaceful settlement between the Palestinians and Israelis according to the principles of land for peace and rights for rights according to the Madrid formula. He expressed his belief that we should not make any decisions based on any statement that we are not sure of as to form, content, and text, especially one that would harm rather than serve the peace process. He reiterated Egypt's readiness to advance the peace efforts in the right direction. Musa expressed hopes for a settlement to the Libyan-Western crisis, a halt to the escalation of the situation, and a solution based on the need to respect international legitimacy and the Libyan people's right to respect for their sovereignty and rights. The foreign minister said tensions between Iraq and Kuwait cannot be eased without an official Iraqi stand affirming that the Kuwait issue has ended and acknowledging that Kuwait is a sovereign Arab state. He explained that in the absence of this, there can be no talk about Arab relations and Iraq's return to the Arab fold.
