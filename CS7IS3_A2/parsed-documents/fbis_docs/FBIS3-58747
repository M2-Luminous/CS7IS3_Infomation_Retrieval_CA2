He told party workers in west Belfast: "The Unionist veto prevents political movement and makes the achievement of consent impossible." Mr Adams hinted, however, that if the right signals flowed from the Downing Street declaration an IRA ceasefire could not be ruled out. "I have to go back to the May 10 situation, where Sinn Fein negotiators with the British government delegation meetings and the political basis and perameters for them, and at the British request a proposition was put to the IRA to suspend its campaign and the IRA agreed to do that and then the British walked away from it. "On the one hand that makes the situation all the more dangerous because of the way the British Government tried to abuse that process. "But on the other hand, the IRA have been very positive about the Irish peace proposals put by myself and John Hume. "There is still the opportunity for peace and Sinn Fein is committed to ensuring the British Government doesn't squander that opportunity." Mr Adams accused the Government of being an obstacle in moving the peace process forward. He said: "Their inability to come to a definitive attitude or to decide whether this declaration fits into the overall peace strategy is tied totally to the British clarification. "In other words, the sooner they provide this clarification the sooner Sinn Fein can come to conclusions. The only logical reason for the British refusing clarification can be that they are working to their own political agenda."
