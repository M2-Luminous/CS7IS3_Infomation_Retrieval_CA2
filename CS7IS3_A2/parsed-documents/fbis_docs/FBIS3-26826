The report points out that special interest groups among the armed forces and bureaucrats have been formed within the CPC. The specialists warn in their report: The factor that has the greatest possibility of breaking off the process of reform and modernization in China comes from corruption within the CPC; therefore, development is the last word and anticorruption is also the last word [fa zhan shi ying dao li, fan fu bai ye shi ying dao li 4099 1455 2508 4289 6670 3810 0646 5201 2408 0048 2508 4289 6670 3810]. Since corruption has become a kind of malignant cancer on the mainland, it cannot be rooted out by depending on "party discipline and state laws" alone. The only way out is "the establishment of a new system." Dr. Hu Angang and Dr. Wang Shao-kuang, of the Political Faculty of Yale University in the United States, jointly completed "A Report on the State's Ability in China" last year and first put forward the replacement of the "overall contract system" with the "tax-sharing system" in order to strengthen the ability of the central administration. This has attracted much attention at home and abroad. Kang Xiaoguang is 31 years old. He graduated from the Applied Mathematics Faculty of the Dalian Engineering College and later was awarded a master's degree in Theoretical Ecology by the Ecological and Environmental Research Center of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. In recent years, he has engaged himself in the study of China's national situation and his representative work is "Agriculture and Development -- A Study of Several Questions Concerning China's Agriculture," published by the Beijing University Press in 1993. Beginning today, MING PAO will carry by installments an interview with Hu and Kang by our staff reporter, Mr. Liu Lu, in order to give a detailed account of their starting point in writing the report, as well as the report's main contents. [end foreword] On the Chinese mainland today, the two major issues that have attracted the greatest attention of the people are inflation and corruption. If we say that the former occurs intermittently, then the latter has become more serious with each passing day. Therefore, the publication of the "report on the national situation" entitled "Opposing Corruption Through the Establishment of a New System" immediately attracted extremely great attention among political and academic circles. It is said that even before the report was published it had been submitted to the high-level CPC leadership as "reference material." During a special interview with Hu Angang and Kang Xiaoguang a few days ago, this reporter asked them why they carried out a study on anticorruption as part of the national situation, they replied: Deng Xiaoping said after the 4 June incident: "If corruption, especially corruption at a high level within the party, is not punished, there is indeed a danger of failure." However, to date, the practice of corruption throughout the party, the Army, and the country has become more and more serious, instead of being brought under control. It has become an extremely common social phenomenon. It is not at all exaggerating to say that the degree of corruption on the Chinese mainland has become a kind of malignant cancer, which has spread rapidly to society as a whole. Corruption has become the greatest social pollution in China today. We are worried that in the future, the factor that will have the greatest possibility of breaking off the process of reform and modernization in China comes from the serious corruption within the CPC. Hu Angang and Kang Xiaoguang said frankly: "The common people call some cadres `corrupt officials' and `local tyrants and evil gentry' without mincing words." Corruption within the CPC makes the CPC and its political power lose its foundation of legitimacy, meaning that the support of the common people for the party and the government is decreasing. This is one of the expressions of the universally declining state ability in China, that is, the ability for legitimation is decreasing. "Water holds up ships, but also can drown them. [no closing quotation mark as published] If corruption is allowed to spread and if it is impossible to thoroughly solve the problem of corruption, particularly corruption at a high level within the party, it is not impossible that the Communist Party may fall from power because of corruption caused by the system. As a matter of fact, CPC leaders have been aware of this possibility. Jiang Zemin pointed out on the CPC's 70th founding anniversary that party style has a bearing on the party's existence and survival. If the corruption phenomenon is allowed to developed, the party will be on its way to self-destruction. In this sense, development is the last word and anticorruption is also the last word. Hu Angang and Kang Xiaoguang said: Deng Xiaoping repeatedly admonished: "The third-generation leadership should win the confidence of the people," and it is necessary to win the confidence of the people through punishing corruption. Apparently, whether or not the CPC's third-generation leadership can have legitimacy depends on whether or not it has the courage and determination to oppose corruption, whether or not it is able to oppose corruption in an effective way, and whether or not it can carry out its promise to the more than 1 billion people. This is the fundamental reason why we have carried out this research. In the report on the national situation, we have proceeded from the worst possibility to forecast the worst possible ending as a warning. However, as scientists of China, we hope we are not successful prophets.
