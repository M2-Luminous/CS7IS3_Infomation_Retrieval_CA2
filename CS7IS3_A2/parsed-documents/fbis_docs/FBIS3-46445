The U.S. Senate voted by 62 to 38 yesterday to urge the Clinton administration to lift expeditiously the U.S. embargo on trade with Vietnam. The department spokeswoman Christine Shelly told a regular news briefing that "no decision has been made there on the lifting of the trade embargo and there isn't any time frame for reaching such a decision." Shelly said, "It's something which remains under review, and the administration has indicated that it would consider the views of all sides of this issue," including the Senate resolution. She also said there are some who believe that U.S. should move on to the normalization of relations with Vietnam and there are others who think that the continued accounting for the POWs and the MIAs absolutely must come first. "There are arguments that can be made on both sides," Shelly said, "but I don't think the administration has specifically taken a position on one or the other." However, she noted that "the President has linked further progress in our relations with Vietnam to achieving the fullest possible accounting on the POWs and the MIAs." "The key thing for us is to get to the point where we are completely satisfied with the accounting for the POWs and the MIAs and then to take things from there," Shelly added.
