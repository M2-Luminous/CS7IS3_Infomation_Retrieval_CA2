FR940317-1-00062 FR940317-1-00013 (b) Report of claims officer_(1) Format. The claims officer will prepare a written report of investigation on DA Form 1208 (Report of Claims Officer), except that no recommendation on disposition of prospective claims will be entered in block 11. Where a formal investigation is conducted in accordance with the procedures in chapter 5, AR 15&hyph;6, the report may be submitted on DA Form 1574 (Report of Proceedings by Investigating Officer/Board of Officers). If the claims officer does not feel either form is appropriate, the claims JA/attorney advising the claims officer will be consulted for guidance. (2) Processing. The report should normally be completed and submitted to the appointing authority within 60 days of the accident/incident. If a final report will not be completed within that time one or more interim reports may be required by the commander or claims JA/attorney. The appointing authority will either return the report for further investigation or, if satisfied that it is as complete as possible given the information available, forward one copy of the report to the appropriate claims office with or without comment. (3) Content. The report will contain findings of fact concerning the incident, to include the circumstances leading to the incident (e.g. training and experience of Army personnel involved) and the resulting property damage and/or injuries. These findings should be based on the evidence reasonably available within the time available for completion of the report. See chapter 5, DA PAM 27&hyph;162 for guidance on the information needed in the most common types of claims incidents. (4) Limits on findings. The unit claims officers will not make findings concerning questions of liability or attempt to assess a dollar value on personal injuries. The findings should merely state the facts (who, what, where, when, and how). While a clear and complete statement of the facts will often make it clear who is responsible for the damage or injury, the determination of legal liability and the appropriate amount of compensation is the responsibility of the claims JA/attorney or the courts. (5) Use and release of information. The report of this initial investigation may be used in conjunction with any administrative or legal action within DOD, such as line of duty investigations, reports of surveys, disciplinary actions under the Uniform Code of Military Justice or civilian personnel regulations, contract actions, or the collateral investigation of an Army accident required by paragraph 1&hyph;7c, AR 385&hyph;40. It may also be used by the commander or the unit's safety officers as the basis for their safety report (DA Form 285 and 285&hyph;1) when a centralized accident investigation or separate safety investigation is not conducted. It may be released to the public, to law enforcement personnel, state and federal regulatory agencies and other non-DOD entities subject to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act and the Privacy Act. (6) Disposition of reports. The claims processing office or area claims office having jurisdiction the type of claim involved will retain the claims officer's report until a claim is received or until six months after the time for filing a claim is past. If no claim is filed within the statutory limit, the report will be disposed of as an organizational record in accordance with AR 25&hyph;400&hyph;2. (c) If an incident occurs, or a claim is filed, in a foreign country where no appropriate commander is located, investigative assistance may be sought from the Defense Attache or the Military Assistance and Advisory Group (MAAG). Incidents involving Attache or MAAG personnel, and claims arising from their activities, will be investigated in accordance with DIAM 100&hyph;1B, volume 1, section T, chapter 1, or AR 175, chapter 6, as appropriate. (d) Under the provisions of DODD 5515.9 the Commander, USARCS, or designee, may request assistance from DOD components whose personnel are involved in incidents generating claims in the investigation of such claims, and may appoint DOD personnel as claims officers for the purpose of conducting such investigations. ยง536.17 Claims office responsibility. (a) The claims JA/attorney receiving notice of an incident requiring investigation will immediately refer it to the appropriate claims officer and will notify, the Commander, USARCS of all major incidents involving serious injury or death, or where non Federal property damage exceeds $25,000. In some cases the claims JA/attorney assigned to the case may decide that a unit claims officer investigation is not necessary and waive the requirement.
