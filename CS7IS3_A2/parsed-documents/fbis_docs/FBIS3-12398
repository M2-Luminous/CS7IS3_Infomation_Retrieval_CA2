FBIS3-12398 "drnes040_c_94005" FBIS-NES-94-040 Document Type:Daily Report 1 Mar 1994 Egypt Reports View U.S. Embassy's Reaction to Terrorism NC2402203594 NC2402203594 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] Cairo ROSE AL-YUSUF in Arabic on 21 February carries two reports on the response to possible terrorist threats by foreign embassies, particularly the U.S. Embassy. The first report, written by Khalid Dawud, appears on pages 5-8. The 3,000-word report has a compound headline: "ROSE AL-YUSUF Uncovers Secret Meetings of the Foreign Communities; U.S. Security Patrols To Protect 12,000 Americans From Extremists; A Meeting in the UK Embassy: The British Did Not Panic; The German Embassy: Translating the Extremist Statements So That the Germans May Decide for Themselves; The French Embassy: These Are Internal Affairs." Beneath the headlines, the magazine publishes two miniature, mostly unintelligible, photocopies of presumed U.S. Embassy documents. The first it describes as "security instructions issued by the U.S. Embassy Security Office to the members of the community." The other, on which the words "USIS Cairo" is discernible in boldface, is described as "an invitation by the U.S. Embassy for a meeting of the U.S. community and journalists to discuss the statement issued by the extremists." The reports start out by saying: "The U.S. Embassy in Cairo has convened two meetings of the U.S. community in Cairo to ask them to raise their security awareness and remain alert because `the situation may change.' "The first meeting was held at the embassy headquarters in Garden City last Sunday. The second was held at the American School in al- Ma'adi on Tuesday amid strict security measures and with a request by officials of the Embassy Media Office that nothing be published about what takes place in these meetings. "What is peculiar is that the number of Americans who cared to attend the first embassy meetings did not exceed 50-60 people. This means that the embassy is more afraid than the community. Furthermore, many of those who came to the meeting were journalists who were eager to get a briefing about the situation. "U.S. Embassy Security Official Robert O'Brien, who headed the meeting, said: `This place is safe to live in, but this situation may be about to change.' Despite his assurances that the embassy does not advise U.S. nationals to leave Egypt or not to visit it, he pointed to the seriousness of the three recent terrorist statements, signed by the Islamic Group-Egypt." The report summarizes the statements recently issued by the Islamic Group and goes back to the remarks made to the U.S. community by the U.S. Embassy security official, this time identified as "O'Brien Lee." It says that the U.S. official "expressed particular concern over the second statement by the Islamic Group, `because it was the most specific' regarding the threat against foreigners." The U.S. official added "that they (the terrorists) will not have any credibility unless they carry out their threats, which is particularly worrying." The report cites the U.S. official as warning U.S. nationals to be alert to changes in their environment, avoid calling attention to themselves, and alter their daily routines. The report says: "The meeting also brought the revelation that the Americans, even prior to the latest terrorist threats, were running `vehicled patrols' involving 11 roving cars carrying patrols of U.S. security men in al-Ma'adi and downtown." The report then discusses the reactions of the UK, German, and French Embassies to the threat. UK Press Spokesman Martin Day is cited as saying that, "Of course, these threats have to be taken very seriously." Day notes that a meeting of representatives of the UK community in Egypt was held "last week." The purpose of that meeting was "to inform the community of the content of the recent statements by the extremists." The report cites Day as saying that "most community members have not yet panicked because they know that the situation so far is reassuring." Moving on to the German reaction, the report says that "a German Embassy employee said that what is going on now is a `fax war' and that this is part of a clear strategy that the [extremist] groups are following to cause panic." German Embassy officials have met German teachers and businessmen living in Egypt to brief them on the latest developments. The embassy also translated the extremists' statements and provided the community with it so that "they can decide for themselves what has to be done," the report notes. The report then says that the French Embassy, caring for a community of 5,000 French nationals, remains "the most reserved" of all embassies. A press spokesman for that embassy expressed a desire "not to comment on Egyptian domestic affairs." The report cites the spokeswoman that "even if meetings were held of the French community, this would be an internal matter." The report cites, without elaboration, that "similar instructions" have been issued by the Italian Embassy. The report concludes by saying: "The atmosphere in the foreign embassies and communities is one of wait and see. Either the security forces will succeed in their daunting task of eradicating terror, or the terrorists will manage to stage renewed attacks. Any operations, small or big, will simply cause panic and instability, a matter that will harm the ordinary people even more than the government." A 1,300-word unattributed report entitled "How is the Protection of the U.S. Embassy in Cairo Organized?" appears on page 8 of the same 21 February issues of the Cairo weekly magazine ROSE AL-YUSUF. The report begins with a description of the U.S. Embassy's security arrangements: "The U.S. Embassy in Cairo is open for only five days a week. But the Regional Security Office, located on the sixth floor of the ugly cement building, is manned 24 hours a day by 30 Marines and 300 Egyptian security men, who are positioned in various parts of the embassy. "Not all the Americans working at the embassy are equal. This is particularly true for those who are allowed to move between the ninth and 15th floor of the new cement building, where the most important embassy offices are located, including the yet empty ambassador's office, still waiting for the new ambassador. "The Security Office is responsible for the following: contacting Egyptian police and other security organs; providing advice to the ambassador on all matters of security; providing protection to all distinguished U.S. visitors; making investigations on behalf of U.S. legal authorities on background matters; making investigations into matters of terrorism, crime, and espionage; supervising the embassy's local 300-strong security force; running the security and alarm systems at the embassy; supervising the Marines; providing information about the security background of the employees and their revenue ['a'idatihim; a possible misprint of 'a'ilatihim, meaning families]; supervising the emergency plan in the event that the embassy is in danger; protecting all classified material; supervising security arrangements for U.S. residential quarters; and providing information for the U.S. business community on security-related matters, an effort coordinated by the U.S. State Department." The report then notes that the Marine unit in the embassy is "one of the largest in the world" and that its personnel "are stationed in eight different positions in various parts of the embassy and at the gates." The local security force, however, is responsible for protecting the main embassy gates and the residential quarters, and runs 11 car patrols in al-Ma'adi and the downtown areas around the clock. The report notes that the Security Office has four stages of alert--white, yellow, orange, and red--corresponding to the intensity of the danger involved. The report says that "the embassy advises everyone to be on yellow alert." The report then cites the U.S. State Department's travel advisory about Egypt and concludes by saying that "the U.S. Embassy in Cairo has asked U.S. nationals visiting Egypt or residing in the country to raise their security alertness and to avoid calling unnecessary attention to themselves or their activities."
