Kontic had sent a letter to the European Bank at the beginning of January, requesting that a mission of this bank pay a visit to Yugoslavia in order to discuss the reconstruction of the monetary system with Yugoslav experts. Larosiere believes that the FRY government should remain in contact with the bank's board of governors concerning its readmission, but at the same time expressed doubt that the bank's members would wish to tackle this issue before the sanctions against Yugoslavia are lifted and "a more favorable international climate is created."
