Khieu Kanharit, and other aides, Samdech Hun Sen, vice chairman of the Cambodian People's Party and second prime minister of the Kingdom of Cambodia, arrived in Tokyo on 9 May. That morning at the New Otani Hotel, Samdech Hun Sen granted an audience to H.E. (Nishio) Watanabe, former chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party, who expressed his joy concerning the positive developments in the Cambodian peace process. H.E. Watanabe also expressed the firm hope that the current meeting of the Socialist International Council would certainly welcome the good experiences of national reconciliation and development from the Cambodian delegation. In his reply, Samdech Hun Sen conveyed the Cambodian people's gratitute to the Japanese people, who had helped the Cambodian people sail across a difficult stage in their history. He pointed out that although the Royal Government of Cambodia [RGC] faces a great many problems that have piled up for more than 20 years -- especially the social, economic, and Khmer Rouge problems -- the RGC is still optimistic about Cambodia's future. This is because what is important now is that Cambodia's problem is no longer a foreign conflict or intervention, but it is only the concern of Cambodia. Samdech Hun Sen also invited H.E. Watanabe, an activist and a pioneer in the construction of the Chroy Changva bridge [in Phnom Penh], to visit Cambodia. The latter accepted the invitation with pleasure. That afternoon, Samdech Hun Sen and his delegation visited the Tokyo Stock Exchange, where he conducted research and study on key mechanisms of a free-market economy. In the evening, Samdech Hun Sen and his delegation attended a reception in their honor by Japanese deputy foreign minister (Azuma). H.E. (Azuma) expressed his concern about the development of less than good relations between the Kingdom of Cambodia and the Kingdom of Thailand, both good friends of Japan. He voiced hope that the two countries would be able to reach a wise and peaceful settlement. For his part, Samdech Hun Sen informed H.E. (Azuma) about the view of the RGC, which believes that it cannot rebuild the country by taking its neighbors as enemies. Therefore, it is not the time for Cambodian-Thai relations, although tense in the recent past, to be considered ruptured. The RGC will strive to maintain its patience and preserve good relations with its neighbors, thereby insuring regional stability The reception was held in an atmosphere of joy and cordiality.
