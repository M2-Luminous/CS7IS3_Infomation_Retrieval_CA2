FR941219-1-00052 FR941219-1-00016 The Act and its implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.61, 17.62, and 17.63 for endangered plant species set forth a series of general prohibitions and exceptions that apply to all endangered plants. With respect to the four plants from the four counties in northern California, all trade prohibitions of section 9(a)(2) of the Act, implemented by 50 CFR 17.61, would apply. These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to import or export; deliver, receive, carry, transport, or ship in interstate or foreign commerce in the course of a commercial activity; sell or offer for sale in interstate or foreign commerce; or remove and reduce to possession federally listed plant species from areas under Federal jurisdiction; maliciously damage or destroy any such plant species on any area under Federal jurisdiction; or remove, cut, dig up, damage, or destroy any such plant species on any other area in knowing violation of any State law or regulation or in the course of any violation of a State criminal trespass law. Seeds from cultivated specimens of threatened plant taxa are exempt from these prohibitions provided that a statement ``of cultivated origin'' appears on the shipping containers. Certain exceptions apply to agents of the Service and State conservation agencies. The Act and 50 CFR 17.62 and 17.63 also provide for the issuance of permits to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involving endangered or threatened plant species under certain circumstances. The Service anticipates few trade permits would ever be sought or issued for the four species because the plants are not common in cultivation or in the wild. Requests for copies of the regulations on listed plants and inquiries regarding them may be addressed to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Ecological Services, Endangered Species Permits, 911 N.E. 11th Avenue, Portland, Oregon 97232&hyph;4181 (503/231&hyph;6241; FAX 503/231&hyph;6243). Public Comments Solicited The Service intends that any final action resulting from this proposal will be as accurate and as effective as possible. Therefore, comments or suggestions from the public, other concerned governmental agencies, the scientific community, industry, or any other interested party concerning this proposed rule are hereby solicited. Comments particularly are sought concerning: (1) Biological, commercial trade, or other relevant data concerning any threat (or lack thereof) to Lasthenia conjugens, Navarretia leucocephala ssp. pauciflora , Navarretia leucocephala ssp. plieantha , and Parvisedum leiocarpum ; (2) The location of any additional populations of these species and the reasons why any habitat should or should not be determined to be critical habitat as provided by section 4 of the Act; (3) Additional information concerning the range, distribution, and population size of these species; and (4) Current or planned activities in the subject area and their possible impacts on these species. Any final decision on this proposal will take into consideration the comments and any additional information received by the Service, and such communications may lead to a final regulation that differs from this proposal. The Act provides for a public hearing on this proposal, if requested. Requests must be received within 45 days of the date of publication of the proposal. Such requests must be made in writing and addressed to the Field Supervisor of the Sacramento Field Office (see ADDRESSES section). National Environmental Policy Act The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment, as defined under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, need not be prepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuant to section 4(a) of the Act. A notice outlining the Service's reasons for this determination was published in the Federal Register on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244). References Cited
