The initiative is based on eliminating the dispute between the General People's Congress [GPC] and the Yemeni Socialist party [YSP] -- on the grounds that these are the two principal forces which achieved unity -- and removing the Yemeni Reform Grouping [YRG] from the coalition so that it will become an effective opposition force that can achieve a kind of balance in the political system. The initiative -- which is signed by the National Organization for the Defense of Unity, Democracy, and Social Peace and the Saba' Conference for Yemeni Tribes -- says that the YRG's inclusion in the coalition has caused the dispute among the three parties to move into state institutions, hence causing them to play the role of a ruler and an opposition at the same time -- which has been associated with the crisis all the time. A number of Yemeni intellectuals are behind the initiative. Asked about the bad timing of their idea -- which comes in the wake of the the announcement of the "Pledge and Accord Document," which is considered a way out of the current crisis -- they said that "there are still numerous dangers surrounding the implementation of the document. The official signing (for which arrangements have begun to be made recently) does not guarantee its implementation." [passage omitted] The initiative urges the YRG to abandon its position on the Presidential Council ('Abd-al-Majid al-Zandani's seat) in favor of the GPC and its ministerial portfolios in favor of the GPC and the YSP. It also urges the formation of a committee consisting of 12 senior officials from the two parties to include for the first time Colonel 'Ali Muhsin al-Ahmar -- commander of the 1st Division and half brother of the Yemeni president -- from the GPC and Col. Qasim Yahya al-Mahla'i from the YSP, thus representing the military at a high level for the first time in the dialogue between the GPC and the YSP. Because the military establishments of the two sides played an important role in the crisis, whether with regard to the threat of an explosion or securing a mutual deterrent to prevent this explosion. The initiative, a copy of which AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has obtained, stresses the need to consider 22 May -- the day unity between the two parts of Yemeni was announced in 1990 -- a starting point for resolving the crisis, building a modern state organ capable of implementing unionist policies, discussing the nature of the "coalition relationship" between the GPC and the YSP, and "determining the causes of tension and conflict in this relationship," in order to come out with a healthy and sound view to consolidate the elements of stability in the political system. The initiative also urges the formation of a military committee comprised of the most competent commanders to assume the task of "reformulating the combat doctrine of the Armed Forces, drawing up a new defense strategy, supervising the Armed Forces' withdrawal from the cities and the contact areas (it specifies a distance of 100-150 km on both sides of the previous border between the two parts), drawing up a practical plan to rebuild the Armed Forces and set a ceiling for the troops' number, and reconsidering the haphazard promotions that have taken place over the past three years." The initiative also calls for reexamining the civil service organ and forming a higher council to supervise administrative reforms, diagnose current problems, draw up a bill to regulate work inside it, and to achieve professional stability for employees "in isolation from partisan and political fluctuations." And also to study "the bad situation in the judiciary, to agree on specific measures to purge it of corruption, to rebuild it in order to ensure its neutrality and independence, and to ban any interference in its affairs by other state authorities." The initiative also broaches the need to acknowledge the existence of current security conditions and "to analyze the phenomenon of terrorism and political assassinations" in the framework of an honest security study.
