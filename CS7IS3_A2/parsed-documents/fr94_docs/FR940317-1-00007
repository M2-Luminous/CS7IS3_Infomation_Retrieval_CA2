FR940317-1-00007 FR940317-1-00003 In that regard, petitioners suggested that the criteria contained in the NRC's backfit rule be applied to the development of all new regulatory programs. That is, if a regulation is not necessary for the adequate protection of the public health and safety, the NRC would be required to show that the rule would substantially increase safety and that its benefits outweigh its costs. Response. The Commission does not believe that the analogy between colleges and universities and medical services provided in a nonprofit institution is a valid one. The Commission recently decided to reinstate a longstanding (but temporarily withdrawn) fee exemption for nonprofit educational institutions. The key to educational institutions' singular treatment, however, is not their nonprofit status, nor the fact that they provide valuable social benefits; rather, it is the existence of certain structural market failures in educational institutions' production of new knowledge. In other words, colleges and universities produce new knowledge primarily through basic research, and disseminate it (essentially for free) to all who want it, without receiving compensation from those benefitting. In economic terms, this new knowledge is often termed a ``public good.'' 1 1 The Commission's analysis of this aspect of the petition is based in part on a memorandum prepared by an NRC consultant on the topic of externalized benefits and public goods. This memorandum has been placed in the NRC Public Document Room for examination by any interested persons. See Memorandum to NRC Staff from Stephen J.K. Walters, Professor of Economics, Loyola College (Md.), dated January 4, 1994. Two defining characteristics of a public good are its nondepletability and nonexcludability. That is, one person's acquisition of knowledge does not reduce the amount available to others; further, it is not efficient_and often is impossible, as a practical matter_to prevent others from acquiring it at a zero price. These characteristics make it difficult to recoup the costs of producing new knowledge. Because the value of a public good may be very great, but the costs of producing it impossible to recapture, public subsidies may be necessary for production to occur at all. The Commission has decided to exempt nonprofit educational institutions from annual fees to advance continued production of new knowledge. By contrast, medical practitioners have the capability of obtaining compensation for the benefits they provide. Unlike new knowledge, medical services are both depletable and excludable. The benefits of medicine, while unquestionably significant, are therefore a private rather than a public good, in economic terms. The Commission believes, in sum, that the market failure considerations that apply to educational institutions' attempts to produce new knowledge simply do not apply to medical practitioners. There is no structural barrier to the recovery of costs incurred in producing the benefits of medicine. The situation of the medical practitioners is not fundamentally different from that of the for-profit licensees whose claims for exemption on grounds of inability to pass through costs the Commission has rejected in the past. (See 58 FR 38666&hyph;68; July 20, 1993.) In this regard, the Commission notes petitioners' claim that Medicare may not account for NRC fees when reimbursing physicians and hospitals. The Commission is also aware of pricing pressures caused by competing nuclear medicine modalities not regulated (or charged fees) by the NRC. However, as the Commission explained in its FY 1993 fee rule, it is impracticable for this agency to evaluate the merits of such empirical claims regarding the ability of licensees to pass through fee costs to their customers. (See 58 FR 38666, 38667&hyph;68; July 20, 1993.) The Commission ``does not believe it has the expertise or information needed to undertake the subtle and complex inquiry whether in a market economy particular licensees can or cannot easily recapture the costs of annual fees from their customers.'' (58 FR 38667; July 20, 1993.) This statement applies equally to medical licensees as it does to all others whose products cannot be characterized as a ``public good.'' Addressing the petition's second major point, the Commission disagrees with those commenters who call for new individualized exemption criteria for medical licensees. The Commission believes that the current exemption process for materials licensees, as codified in 10 CFR 171.11(d), provides medical licensees with the opportunity to request an exemption by means of detailing their particularized circumstances.
