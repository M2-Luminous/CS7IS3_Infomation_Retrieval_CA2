This will be used in raising the question of the democratic system of Croatia, and even its stability. Let us remind readers that for a while Tudjman supported the faction that wanted to turn the HDZ from a movement into a Christian democrat-oriented party, but he later joined those headed by Manolic, who asked that the HDZ retain the original principles, that is, that of a movement, with the emphasis on national party. The HDZ movement has lately been executing Manolic in a way that all the movements have employed through history: by taking the conflict to the end. All the media are involved. Manolic's photographs no longer appear in certain papers, columnists who used to favor the movement, most often believing in it, are doing their best to blacken the name of the man who until recently was the closest associate of the movement leader. Manolic is no longer a person with different political positions; he has become a traitor, a Rankovic, a chetnik. No wonder -- a movement, whether it is called the HDZ or otherwise, functions as a community of holders of the same views, and as soon as an individual from within the community persists in his positions, the movement rejects them because they betrayed the community. The Movement and the Party By insisting at the last congress that the HDZ be a movement, and now deciding to persist in his position, Manolic himself created the conditions for this kind of breakup. If he had joined those now condemning him, and who then supported the transformation of the movement into a party, Manolic would now be leader of a HDZ faction, completely legal. Apart from his left faction, at least two more (right and center) would have emerged, which is the case in all the parties in all the European countries in which national movements for the liberation from the occupying forces or for the forming of the state had finished the job long ago, while time and observance of the democratic procedure have made them countries with a stable democratic system. The factors of this stability are political parties with legalized factions, and this way of dealing with those who do not share the same views is therefore impossible in their systems, as they are not considered traitors. If they change their views, they transfer from one faction to another, or from one party to another, and in the process no one gets excited. On the contrary, the party tries to persuade such individuals to stay, and if they do leave, the party expresses regrets about it. In the case of a movement, things are different: It sends such individuals away (the official statement said Manolic had been "expelled" from the HDZ), and tries to oust them politically (Manolic is meeting with Paraga), personally (Manolic is a member of Yugoslav State Security Service, as if he had not been one until two months ago), and morally (he is blackmailing Duka). Manolic has thus become a victim of his own political beliefs. Moreover, he is responsible for having used his influence -- indisputable at the time -- and preventing the movement from becoming a party, which is a guarantee for the establishment of democratic bases, which should, through the body of the party, gradually penetrate the entire body of society. Signs of lack of democratic procedure are not characteristic of only one party. Other parties have also been affected by the inauguration of nondemocratic procedures. Not only have they been affected, but, because of applying methods of the same kind, they are gradually being destroyed by it. They have been functioning less as parties and more as movements -- minor ones. Squaring Accounts in the Opposition Parties The way it has been done in the IDS [Istrian Democratic Congress] by the movement leader Jakovcic and the so-called Herak group is well known. Jakovcic has proclaimed them the "moles" of the HDZ, that is, betrayers of the movement, and, at a convenient time, when they were not present, expelled them from the movement. In fact, they did not have the same views; they were a faction, and now they are saying that they are devoted to the IDS, and that they will found a new one. The cause of the dissension is the same as in the HDZ: lack of democratic procedure within the party. A similar event took place in the HSS [Croatian Peasants Party] when a group of members with different views, gathered around Madjor, tried to overthrow Drago Stipac as president. They did not manage to do it, so he threw them out. Even if the reverse had happened, the nature of the conflict would not have been different. A similar situation has recently occurred in the HSLS [Croatian Social Liberal Party], the strongest opposition party. At the party conference in Kutina two factions were in conflict because of the recently forced syndrome of "Herzegovinian politics." One of the factions, headed by Vilfan and supported by Fizulic, asked that the party expel all the so-called Herzegovinian cadres from the politics of both Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. They gloated over the failure of the "Herceg-Bosna project," saying the worst possible things about the people there, forgetting that a young man from, for instance, Ljubuski, who was mobilized in a normal procedure and killed at, say, Gornji Vakuf, had nothing to do with high politics, where decisions about the forms of political organization were made. In the war with the Muslims he was just as much a patriot as when, at the beginning of the Serbian aggression against Bosnia-Herzegovina, he had stood before the Serbian tanks unarmed. Zoric, vice president of the party, opposed Vilfan and Fizulic's positions at the Kutina conference. A conflict occurred which, interpreted in political terms, means that two very different factions have been established: Vilfan's liberal and Zoric's social-liberal one. Budisa took Zoric's side, but in such a way as not to lose Vilfan. Connecting Vessels The HDZ democratic centralism, or, more clearly said: Lack of democratic procedures, has, through the principle of connecting vessels, spread to most of the major Croatian parties (the rest are at a standstill or about to break up). However, it did not stop there. It also spread to most of the media, and even to the Croatian state institutions. The stories about the election of the Zagreb University president, about the status of the Central Croatian Cultural and Publishing Society, or those about electing school principals, hospital principals, managers of public companies, which could be anything but models of democratic activities, are well known. One of the main culprits for this is Josip Manolic, because, not knowing political theory, he insisted that the movement remain. He will hardly be able to correct his delusions by legalizing his faction and founding a new party. However, the HDZ may be taking another direction as a movement, a new way toward becoming a party. The cause for this consideration is the statement of the HDZ head secretary and head of the President's office, Dr. Jure Radic (a person who, because of his position, should not only express his private views, but, more likely, those of the institution he is head of), in the last issue of DANAS, regarding the explosion at Duboki Jarak [reference to the explosion of a military warehouse near Sesvete]. "There are some who would like Gojko Susak not to be defense minister," said Radic and added: "What if it is established that those who want Susak to leave are responsible for the tragedy at Sesvete?" As part of the opposition wanted that, most of all the Manolic group, it is clear that Radic's statement, which was later published in all the papers, paved the way for a new political procedure. Although none of the committees investigating the reasons for the explosion has published the results of the investigation, Radic's pointing the finger at a possible culprit can also be an indication of new political relations in Croatia. Having been expelled from the HDZ, Manolic is no longer a betrayer of the movement; he is a possible terrorist, a person who plants bombs, mines. He wants to overthrow the legal authorities through terrorist activities. Clearly, he is not the only one; those gathered around him in stage one, and in stage two all those "on the other side," both from the HDZ and the opposition, can become "the Manolic people," therefore terrorists. Ultimately, anyone who is suspicious can be a terrorist. In all the political science textbooks this form of dealing with those who do not hold the same views is called civil war. First within the HDZ, and later, consequently, in the entire Croatian nation. Youth and Lack of Experience Ivic Pasalic, the President's adviser for internal politics, has, perhaps unintentionally, contributed to the HDZ growing into a hard movement rather than into a party with his announcement that the HDZ was soon "starting the process of decommunization." Considering the fact that the HDZ holds most of the authority in the state, it could so happen that this "decommunization" is not only implemented within the party, but, by the nature of things, in the entire state machinery. In view of the fact that a number of Croatian people were involved in the communist machinery, it is not difficult to imagine what that could mean. First of all, there could appear the danger of a certain number of Croats being pushed to the margin by politically nondemocratic means, by the creation of new divisions, and by the demand to prove suitability. This time the "right ones" could be those who did not write praises to socialism and were not part of the communist authorities. Legalizing the Factions Pasalic and Radic may have been led to these "radical" statements by their youth and lack of experience. Considering Tudjman's opus and his active idea of national conciliation, which is what led to the forming and defense of the Croatian state, it is important to point out the possible traps in these "interpretations." Instead of creating the preconditions for establishing a democratic political atmosphere, these "interpretations" lead to the brink of a conflict within the Croatian national corps. As if once was not enough, and as if the consequences of this division should not be enough of a warning about what danger the present Croatia is facing. However, we should hope that, despite the harsh words that are piling up on both sides, neither of the two sides, or the others, will cross the threshold where the limits of the legal state end and violence begins, because they do not want to enter a conflict that would turn into a civil war. According to one of the political analysts, there is a deep misunderstanding between Manolic and Tudjman. He proposes that two things be done to calm the situation, which even threatens to turn into a parliamentary crisis. He proposes that Manolic give up the idea of a movement and accept the HDZ as a Christian-democratic oriented party (in most of the European countries the former Communists go over to the Christian democrats), and that Tudjman accept the general rules concerning the possibility of factions existing within the HDZ as a party. The legalization of the factions means that the movement automatically becomes a party and that different forms of political behavior are in force. This would have a positive influence on the stability of the other Croatian parties to the degree that it has so far been negative. In any democratic system, the majority must protect the minority, provided the minority give up violence. This is a lesson that Manolic should have learned by now. Dictatorship or civil war are always a worse form of war, and they have more serious consequences than defense wars waged against an aggressor. Let us remember what Hitler told Pavelic a few weeks after the Independent State of Croatia was established: "Croatia emerged by accident. If the English had not staged the coup in Belgrade, we would still have supported Yugoslavia." Let us not forget Baker; the Americans also supported Yugoslavia at the beginning of the Serbian aggression. The fear of the renewal of Yugoslavia is still present. It would not be good if it is again built on Croat corpses. [Box, p 8] Interview With Drazen Budisa, HSLS President: "I Do Not Know What Manolic's Plans Are" [Barisic] What is your position regarding the "Manolic case"? [Budisa] The president of the Chamber of Counties has the right to hold a session of the Chamber of Counties whenever he decides it is necessary. The rules of procedure grant too much authority to the presidents of both the Chamber of Counties and the Chamber of Representatives; situations such as this were not taken into account. However, we consider that even laws we do not consider good should be obeyed, and our relation toward the rules of procedure is the same. At this moment I do not know how and when the session of the Chamber of Counties will be held. It is also logical that the positions of presidents of both chambers belong to the party in power, although I would like to point out that the HDZ representatives voted against my nomination for deputy parliament chairman at the Chamber of Representatives, and elected Mr. Djukic [president of the Serbian National Party] instead. I have not contacted Mr. Manolic since the talks of the presidents of the opposition parties, so I do not know what his plans are. I suppose that Manolic is trying to gain time so he can carry out preparations for the organization of the new party, which means putting together the program and the statute, and getting as many citizens and HDZ representatives as possible to start the new party. I will not conceal the fact that we in the HSLS consider this stratification useful for the democratic development of Croatia, since the role of the HDZ in Croat political life has been predominant, while at the last elections it (the HDZ) did not have the support of the electoral body that would justify this predominance. The HSLS did not start this parliamentary crisis -- to be honest, it could not have done so -- which, if it does emerge, will be a consequence of the conflict in the party in power. Since we consider Mr. Manolic to have done a good job as president of the Chamber of Counties, our representatives will vote against his replacement. If he is replaced, then the issue of the new president of the Chamber of Counties will certainly arise, and I suppose talks will be held. We believe that the party that has the most representatives is entitled to have its member as president of the Chamber of Counties. However, since this did not happen in a similar situation regarding the election of the deputy president at the Chamber of Representatives, we have the possibility, regarding the candidate, to take the position we decide is best during the election. [Barisic] How do you see the possibility of early elections? [Budisa] I think it is logical that any self-respecting opposition party wants elections to be held as soon as possible. Not only would we not oppose them -- we want them, but it is not up to the HSLS if they will be held or not. [Barisic] To what extent do you think the Manolic case has international implications? Namely, it can often be heard that he is an agent of certain Western circles. [Budisa] Every topical political event in Croatia has an international dimension. I think that the president's recent statement at the closed-door session of the Club of the HDZ Representatives has contributed to this. He pointed out two things: one was that one of the world powers had offered Croatia help in founding its defense system, on the condition that Manolic withdraw. The other was that the present official Croatian politics and authorities were coordinated with the Western interests, and that each attempt at destabilizing the authorities, including Manolic's attempt, had a background on the other side of the political spectrum, that is, in the East. I can answer your question if Manolic was carrying out the wishes of the West only by saying that this is completely contrary to what the president of the Republic said. These topics are so big that I think this discussion could not end without a conversation either during the discussion of Manolic's replacement, or through a parliamentary committee that would examine the basis of such positions. If the people from the top are called to account for promoting foreign interests, we ask that the parliamentary committee also evaluate the former activities of those who allegedly promoted somebody else's interests. It is certain that there are many foreign secret services in Croatia at present, but I think that there is no relevant political force or party in Croatia at present that is conducted from abroad. I would interpret these accusations primarily as a heritage from the communist past, when each political opponent was accused either of being a real or a potential foreign agent. [Box, p 9] Interview With Josip Manolic, President of the Chamber of Counties: "I Will Leave Upon Secret Vote" [Barisic] Mr. Manolic, you have refused to hold a session in spite of the demands of the HDZ representatives. You said that either a solution will be found in an agreement, or else there would be a parliamentary crisis. [Manolic] When a parliamentary crisis emerges in any of the multiparty systems, the resolution of the crisis is sought in the agreement of all the parliamentary factions -- if there is a wish to overcome the crisis. [Barisic] What do you mean by "agreement"? [Manolic] That is again a matter of agreement. I think that the crisis can be overcome in two ways: by electing a new president of the Chamber of Counties, or by keeping the old one. [Barisic] Do you think that is also a possibility? [Manolic] I think it is, as a certain regrouping of forces in that respect has already been carried out within the party in power. [Barisic] However, some of the representatives of whom it was said they would join you have publicly denied it. [Manolic] I have not said anyone would support me and vote for me. There was therefore nothing to deny. There are indications that there will not only be 1 percent of HDZ representatives who will join us, as the president was generously offering. The balance of powers regarding this issue is quite different. [Barisic] Do you know what position the opposition will take? [Manolic] The opposition parties have all supported me. They have thus expressed solidarity with the method of resolving the dispute concerning the position of president of the Chamber of Counties, not entering the dispute between me and the HDZ leadership. [Barisic] What is important about this method? [Manolic] The important thing is that in the process of replacing the former president or electing a new one the rules of procedure are observed, that the procedure is carried out through secret vote. The rules of procedure say that secret vote can be carried out in the elections if there is more than one candidate. I will accept that immediately if there is a multiparty agreement on it at the Chamber of Counties. Those who oppose the secret vote are not only opposing the rules of procedure, but the democratic procedure in general. [Barisic] When are you going to hold the session? [Manolic] I will do so when all the political elements necessary for the session to continue are present. [Barisic] When do you think that could be? [Manolic] As I have said, only when an agreement is previously made concerning the way to overcome this crisis. [Barisic] Is that an invitation for talks to the "other" side? [Manolic] It is a good chance for resolving the entire case by talking at the same level, observing the rules of procedure, rather than, as is the case here, by using nondemocratic methods.
