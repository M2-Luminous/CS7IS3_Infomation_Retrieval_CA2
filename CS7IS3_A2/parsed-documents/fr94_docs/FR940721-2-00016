ACTION: Extension of comment period. SUMMARY: On June 15, 1994, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``Commission'') published in the Federal Register a request for public comment on the National Futures Association's (``NFA's'') proposed amendment and Interpretive Notice to its Compliance Rule 2&hyph;13. 59 FR 30775 (June 15, 1994). The proposal would establish requirements regarding the use of break-even analyses in commodity pool disclosure documents. The original comment period expires on July 15, 1994. By letter to the Commission dated July 11, 1994, the Managed Futures Association (``MFA'') requested a thirty-three-day extension of the comment period to August 17, 1994. The MFA indicated that it had been meeting with its members frequently to consider the issues presented by the NFA's proposal. The MFA further indicated that that consultative process was continuing and that it believed that significant responsive comments were being developed. Acting pursuant to the authority delegated by Commission Regulation 140.96(b), the Director of the Division of Trading and Markets (``Division'') has determined that an extension of the period for the request for public comments on NFA's proposal is in the public interest and will assist the Commission in considering the view of interested persons. In order to ensure that all interested persons have an adequate opportunity to submit meaningful comments, the Division, on behalf of the Commission, is extending the comment period for an additional thirty-three days. DATES: The comment period will remain open through August 25, 1994. ADDRESSES: Interested persons should submit their views and comments to Jean A.
