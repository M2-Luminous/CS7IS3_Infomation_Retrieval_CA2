Spokesman Wu Jianmin said that China never takes exception to non-governmental contact between Taiwan and countries having diplomatic relations with China. "However," Wu said, "The relations between some of those countries and Taiwan have recently gone beyond that limit." The Chinese Government "firmly opposes any form of official contact between Taiwan and those countries having diplomatic relations with China," he added. Wu made the statement when commenting on the so-called "vacation diplomacy" by the Taiwan authorities as Lien Chan paid a visit to some countries having diplomatic relations with China in the name of "a private vacation". Wu pointed out that the so-called vacation diplomacy is but a new trick of "pragmatic and elastic diplomacy" of the Taiwan authorities whose aim is still to create "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan", which is against the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation including the Taiwan compatriots.
