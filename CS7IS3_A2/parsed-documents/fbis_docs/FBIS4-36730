The compulsory use of price tags on articles is an effective way of bringing some order in the market and it is being used for this purpose all over the world, TEHRAN TIMES wrote. The doubtful aspects of the present government scheme begin at the stage where the government apparently intends to assume an active role in determining prices, the daily said adding that this part of the scheme seems to be its least practicable aspect. As long as we have not reached a balanced economy and our production and distribution systems have not evolved into a coherent network, the practice of requiring producers to observe constant prices for any length of time would have very little chance of success, the article stressed. It further noted that another aspect of the scheme which deserves close examination is the supervisory role assigned to the Commerce Ministry and in particular to the association of guilds and is obviously in conflict with the role assigned to the consumers in the same scheme. In a guided free market economy such as now prevails in our society, the use of price tags could be useful only in regulating the market and enforces some sort of uniformity of prices in various part of a single city, the article said. But when the government decides to have an active role in determining prices, then the scheme will meet overt and hidden resistance from producers and distributors, it added. It concluded by saying that for this reason it is doubtful whether direct government role in price determination can produce any beneficial results for the economy.
