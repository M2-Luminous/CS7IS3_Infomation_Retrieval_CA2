The options in today's proposal would override the general prohibition in 40 CFR 141.101 on using bottled water which complies with EPA MCLs and point-of-use devices to achieve compliance with an MCL. This override would apply only to sulfate because of its unique characteristics. II. Background A. Statutory Authority The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA or ``the Act''), as amended in 1986 (Pub. L. No. 99&hyph;339, 100 Stat. 642), requires EPA to publish ``maximum contaminant level goals'' (MCLGs) for contaminants which, in the judgment of the Administrator, ``may have any adverse effect on the health of persons and which (are) known or anticipated to occur in public water systems'' (Section 1412(b)(3)(A)). MCLGs are to be set at a level at which ``no known or anticipated adverse effects on the health of persons occur and which allows an adequate margin of safety'' (Section 1412(b)(4)). Concurrent with EPA publishing an MCLG, which is a non-enforceable health goal, it must promulgate a National Primary Drinking Water Regulation (NPDWR) which includes either: (1) an MCL, or (2) a required treatment technique (Section 1401(1), 1412(a)(3), and 1412(b)(7)(A)). An MCL must be set as close to the MCLG as feasible (Section 1412(b)(4)). Under the Act, ``feasible'' means ``feasible with the use of the best technology, treatment techniques and other means which the Administrator finds, after examination for efficacy under field conditions and not solely under laboratory conditions (taking cost into consideration)'' (Section 1412(b)(5)). In setting MCLs, EPA considers the cost of treatment technology to large public water systems (i.e., > 1,000,000 people) with relatively clean source water supplies (132 Cong. Rec. S6287 (daily ed., May 21, 1986)). 1 Each NPDWR that establishes an MCL must list the best available technology, treatment techniques, and other means that are feasible for meeting the MCL (Section 1412(b)(6)). NPDWRs include monitoring, analytical and quality assurance requirements, specifically, ``criteria and procedures, to assure a supply of drinking water which dependably complies with such maximum contaminant levels␣*␣*␣*.'' (Section 1401(1)(D)). Section 1445 also authorizes EPA to promulgate monitoring requirements. 1 EPA also evaluates the costs to smaller systems in its analysis of economic impacts. A treatment technique may be required if it is not ``economically or technologically feasible'' to ascertain the level of a contaminant (Sections 1401(1) and 1412(b)(7)(A)). Section 1414(c) requires each owner or operator of a PWS to give notice to persons served by it of (1) any failure to comply with a maximum contaminant level, treatment technique, or testing procedure required by a NPDWR; (2) any failure to comply with any monitoring required pursuant to section 1445 of the Act; (3) the existence of a variance or exemption; and (4) any failure to comply with the requirements of any schedule prescribed pursuant to a variance or exemption. Under the 1986 Amendments to the SDWA, EPA was to complete the promulgation of NPDWRs for 83 listed contaminants, including sulfate, by June 19, 1989. After 1989, an additional 25 contaminants must be regulated every three years (section 1412(b)). In the 1986 Amendments to the SDWA, Congress required that MCLGs and MCLs be proposed and promulgated simultaneously (section 1412(a)(3)). This change streamlined development of drinking water standards by combining two steps in the regulation development process. Section 1412(a)(2) renamed recommended maximum contaminant levels (RMCLs) as maximum contaminant level goals (MCLGs). B. Regulatory History EPA is required by the 1986 amendments to the SDWA to issue a proposed and final standard for sulfate. EPA grouped sulfate with 23 other organic and inorganic compounds in the ``Phase V'' regulatory package proposal. The 24 contaminants were among the last of the original list of 83 to be regulated by the SDWA. On June 25, 1990 EPA proposed the Phase V regulation, including sulfate (published at 55 FR 30370, July 25, 1990). In the notice, EPA described the health effects associated with sulfate (see 55 FR 30382&hyph;83). The notice stated that the available scientific information suggests that an adverse health effect from ingesting high levels of sulfate is diarrhea and associated dehydration. Because local populations usually acclimate to high sulfate levels, the impact is primarily on infants, transient populations (e.g., business travelers, visitors and vacationers), and new residents. In the 1990 notice, EPA proposed alternative levels of 400 mg/L and 500 mg/L for the MCLG for sulfate.
