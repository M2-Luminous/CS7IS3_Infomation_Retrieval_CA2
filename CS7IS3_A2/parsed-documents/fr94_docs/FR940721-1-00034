FR940721-1-00034 FR940721-1-00011 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Office of Inspector General 42 CFR Part 1001 RIN 0991&hyph;AA74 Medicare and State Health Care Programs: Fraud and Abuse; Clarification of the OIG Safe Harbor Anti-Kickback Provisions AGENCY: Office of Inspector General (OIG), HHS. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: This proposed rule would clarify various aspects of safe harbor provisions originally published in the Federal Register on July 29, 1991 as a final rule (56 FR 35952). The safe harbor provisions have been specifically designed to set forth those payment practices and business arrangements that will be protected from criminal prosecution and civil sanctions under the anti-kickback provisions of the statute. This proposed rule would modify the original set of final safe harbor provisions to give greater clarity to the rulemaking's original intent.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Sandra Sands, Office of the General Counsel, (202) 619&hyph;1306 Joel Schaer, Office of Inspector General, (202) 619&hyph;3270 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background On July 29, 1991, we published in the Federal Register a final rule setting forth various safe harbor provisions to the Medicare and Medicaid anti-kickback statute (56 FR 35952). This regulation was authorized under section 14 of Public Law 100&hyph;93, the Medicare and Medicaid Patient and Program Protection Act of 1987. The final rule specified those payment practices that will not be subject to criminal prosecution under section 1128B(b) of the Social Security Act (the Act) (42 U.S.C. 1320a&hyph;7b(b)), and that will not provide a basis for exclusion from Medicare or the State health care programs under section 1128(b)(7) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1320a&hyph;7(b)(7)). Since publication of the final rule, we have become aware of a limited number of ambiguities that have created uncertainties for health care providers trying to comply with the safe harbor provisions. We have also become aware of certain instances where our intent, either to protect or preclude protection for particular business arrangements, is not fully reflected in the text of the regulation even though it is reflected in the preamble. This proposed rule would serve to modify the text of the July 29, 1991 final rule to conform to the rulemaking's original intent. The clarifications contained in this proposed rule do not represent an attempt to reevaluate the wisdom of the original safe-harbor decisions. Instead, the changes set forth in this proposed rule would serve only to protect business practices originally intended to be protected by removing ambiguities in the regulatory language. This clarity should aid the formation of legal business practices without establishing any new significant legal obligations on the parties affected by the regulations.
