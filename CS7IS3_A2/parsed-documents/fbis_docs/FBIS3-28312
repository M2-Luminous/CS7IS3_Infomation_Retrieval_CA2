But conspicuous consumpton is only one of the problems on which Hanoi's bureaucrats now need to keep an eye. They are quickly learning that the industrialised world has more to unload than champagne, computers and cars; it also has garbage. Vietnam's customs officers are the last line of defence in a country belatedly acknowledging the need to sort the rich world's waste from its other goods on offer. So when Tra Vinh Cereal and Foodstuff Co. asked the Customs Department to inspect.its 61- container shipment of "assorted, mixed plastic," customs officers became curious when the shipment failed to show up. Eventually, the missing containers were located in early January at the Anh Sang Private Enterprise in the suburbs of Ho Chi Minh City. What they found was shocking even to the department's seasoned veterans: the "assorted, mixed plastic" turned out to be 1,114 tonnes of filthy, used plastic bags. Fearing that Anh Sang would either try to recycle the bags-- causing serious air and water pollution--or bury them in a landfill, Ho Chi Minh City's environment committee promptly ordered the bags to be re-exported to their original owner. (The environment committee said that the containers originated in Germany but wouldn't identify the names of any foreign companies involved with the shipment.) Vietnamese officials say this incident marks the first known case of foreign waste materials arriving in the country. But the desire to do so is not new: government officials say many foreign companies have sought permission to dump their waste in Vietnam since Hanoi launched its free-market reforms seven years ago. "Foreign companies try to exploit the poor knowledge of local officials by telling them these imports won't hurt Vietnam," says Nguyen Ngoc Sinh, acting director of Vietnam's National Environmental Agency. "They try to prove we will earn much money and be able to resolve our unemployment problem." These arguments appear to have won at least some converts. During the debate on an environmental protection law, passed by the National Assembly in late December, some delegates argued that Vietnam should consider accepting some solid-waste imports. In the end, their proposal was defeated. The new environment law, Vietnam's first, seeks to prevent further degradation of the environment as the country rushes to develop in the wake of the communist party's retreat from command economics. But the law marks only the first halting step to protect an environment already battered by years of war, overcrowding and underdevelopment. The law aims to provide a general framework for environmental protection. The task of developing concrete regulations on environmental problems such as industrial discharge, toxic gas, air standards and water quality has been assigned to the premier's office and to the National Environmental Agency, which falls under the Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment. Hanoi already has adopted laws or promulgated decrees on the protection of forests, land and mineral resources. Sinh hopes his office will have some preliminary guidelines in place within two months. One of the first new requirements established under the law is for factories to complete environmental impact assessment studies. Factories that don't take measures to meet minimum environmental requirements within a certain time will be ordered to stop operating. Licence won't be granted to new factories unles they meet these standards, Sinh says. Although Vietnam's urban environ ment is still in better condition than those in most neighbouring countries, pollution is increasing rapidly in both Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. Virtually no industries in either city, including those financed through foreign investment, treat any of their waste. An estimated 250 factories in Hanoi discharge untreated waste, including chemicals, dyes and some heavy metals, directly into the city's canals, river and lakes. Hanoi has no plant to treat waste water and its ageing waste-water network, built by the former French colonial rulers more than 50 years ago, serves only the old part of the city. This creates serious environmental risk, especially during the rainy season, when the streets are often flooded with a mixture of domestic waste water, industrial effluent and storm water. In addition, Hanoi's factories pollute the air through the emission of coal particles sulphur dioxide and carbon monoxide. The heavily industrialised Thuong Dinh area in the southern suburbs suffers sulphur dioxide and carbor monoxide levels two to five times higher than permitted levels, according to an envi ronmental atlas completed in December by the city's Commission for Science, Technology and Environment and the Hanoi University of Civil Engineering. But as bad as the urban environment has become, Vietnam's densely populated rural areas are under even create environmental stress. Over the past five decades, the country's forest cover has declined from 44% of total land area to less than 24%, due to war, expansion of farmland, growing fuel needs and commercial logging. This massive deforestation has lead to large- scale soil erosion and increasing floods and drought. Gibbons, leaf monkeys, slow lorises and other animals listed as "extremely threatened" by the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species are for sale in Vietnam's markets and smuggled to China, Taiwan and Hong Kong. Hunters have wiped out some 200 species of birds over the past four decades. And in the coastal province of Khanh Hoa alone, an estimated 50 tonnes of coral reef, the habitat for a wide variety of marine life, are being destroyed each year to produce limestone for cement. Although Vietnamese and foreign environmentalists laud the new environmental protection law, they point out that it won't change much unless Vietnam establishes a mechanism to enforce the regulations. Sinh says his department has only 40 experts-- "one- tenth of what I need"--and another 250 officials in provincial offices to monitor the country's environment. He expects a budget of only Dong 60 billion (US$5.5 million) this year. Some observers wonder how effective environmental monitors will be unless their salaries are increased. "The people who destroy the forests now are the foresters," notes a foreign environmentalist. "If they're only paid US$15 a month, they have to find their own means of making a livelihood," he says, alluding to growing corruption among state employees. A recent World Bank report argues that environmental protection in Vietnam also will require clear lines of authority and the elimination of unnecessary duplication of responsibility. For example, nine different national agencies currently play a role in establishing rules for the use of water. Vietnam, like most of its neighbours, faces a dilemma: how to balance economic development with the cost of environmental protection. But unlike many other countries in Asia, Vietnam doesn't have the "luxury" of developing first and worrying about its environment later. Vietnam has "very little environmental capital, such as forests, left to waste," observes a foreign economist. "Thailand could destroy its forests as its economy grew, but Vietnam's forests are already depleted. Further neglect is not really an option." Vietnamese economists and environmentalists say the real underlying problem is that there is a limit to what they can do until the country achieves a higher level of economic development. "I often talk to farmers about the value of protecting mangroves and wildlife," says Le Dien Duc of Hanoi University's Centre for Natural Resources Management and Environmental Studies. "They smile at me and say, your talk is very interesting, but we're starving. We have nothing to eat'."
