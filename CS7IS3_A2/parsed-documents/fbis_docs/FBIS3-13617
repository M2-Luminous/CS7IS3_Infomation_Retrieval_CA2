In an exclusive statement to MENA, Subayh said that such remarks contradict every official position espoused by former U.S. Presidents and the U.S. commitment to the UN Security Council that holy Jerusalem is an occupied territory. He added: The Palestinian people and all the peoples of the Islamic nation are astonished and denounce the U.S. President's remarks, which come on the heels of the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. These remarks raise fears about U.S. credibility and commitment to the peace operation. Subayh noted that these remarks show total bias toward Israel, violate international law and UN and Security Council resolutions, and provoke the feelings of faithful Muslims and Christians worldwide, who can never accept the Judaization of this holy city.
