And These Keys Are Granted by the People. Let Us Remember That When Electing Parliament on 10 April and the President of Ukraine on 26 June: Ivan Plyushch: 'We Must Bring New Blood to Power As Quickly As Possible'"] [Text] As we know, Supreme Soviet Council Ivan Plyushch won the elections. And convincingly--he received more than 71 percent of the votes. But that was not the event that attracted general attention. What got people stirred up was Plyushch's appeal not to postpone the presidential elections but to conduct them, as decreed by the Supreme Council, on 26 June of this year. Before that, a different opinion had been expressed. Leonid Kravchuk, television, and many political figures had asserted and are still trying to prove that presidential elections on the scheduled date would be if not fatal then at least inexpedient. The unexpected statement from the head of parliament, understandably, elicited various interpretations. Aleksandr Sokol decided to go to him for clarification. [Sokol] Ivan Stepanovich! Having expressed your opinion about the presidential elections next to the ballot box, you then repeated it on television. Do you really think that under current conditions presidential elections are possible and necessary? [Plyushch] I do not think we can continue to mark time; we must finally carry out the reforms. Both political and economic. People involved with politics and economics understand that these spheres of activity are interconnected. Not so long ago we were saying: First political reforms and then economic. Today we are exclaiming: "The economy is the root of all evil!" But to an unprejudiced person it is clear that we have no national economy because we have not carried out political reforms. I am profoundly convinced that there is a limit to everything. There was one for the Supreme Council elected in 1990 as well. Because in addition to the fact that today's state of affairs caused the people to be dissatisfied with it, other problems arose as well: Who was elected how, at what time, under what system, in what state, etc., etc. I think the deputies adopted the only correct decision: to schedule the elections early. But this demand was also made to the executive power, to the president. Leonid Makarovych and I had no differences of opinion regarding the idea that we should adopt a decree concerning both the Supreme Council and the president simultaneously. As we know, it was duly adopted. And suddenly there is this turn. There is nothing surprising about the fact that the president's apparatus and his local structures are trying to stay as long as possible. That is a natural process. Something else is confusing. After the law on the formation of new regional organs of power was adopted, after this was ordered by the president, a frenzied campaign developed regarding this law. The were looking for flaws, dramatizing the fact that the time of the elections coincides with a busy time for agricultural work, sending telegrams, working on the structures. Things reached a point where the president's representative stated at an official conference: The person who put this law through is a criminal. Since the person in charge of the conference did not say anything, the speaker clarified: This was done by Plyushch... The rumor was spread that some kind of revenge was planned. But can we allow such a malicious fabrication?! This has to do with something altogether different. If we want reform, if we want to improve our lives, we need the appropriate people--from the chairman of the rural soviet to the head of parliament, from the brigade leader to the prime minister. And we must be concerned about people like that. And in the shortest amount of time, without getting bogged down in elections. Elections are not an end in themselves, not a means of settling scores. The authorities must be elected locally. They are the expression of the will of the people. From 27 March through 10 April they must entrust the power to the legislators, and on 26 June--to the executive structures. If this is done Ukraine will for the first time have a power actually created by the people. Those at the helm will be obligated to act and justify this confidence. Now let us imagine that nothing were to happen. The authorities would be sitting there in suspense... [Sokol] But what about the provision of the law that says that the presidential election campaign should begin four months before the elections? After all, it is too late for that. [Plyushch] This legal norm was written for normal life. We are living under the conditions of an ever deepening crisis. If we stick to formalities, then 26 June is indeed an unrealistic date for presidential elections. But if we are guided by higher interests and take reality into account, we can find a solution. All we have to do is want it. Moreover, the presidential election campaign began a long time ago, back when both inside and outside parliament there was the threatening demand: "Down with the Supreme Council!" "Down with the president!" There is quite enough time to nominate candidates and discuss them. But I do not want to link the need for forthcoming changes to the presidential elections alone. The authorities must be elected locally. That is the main thing. A situation like the one we have now should not be. And just look--they are blaming Kravchuk and Plyushch for everything. Because of them the buses are not running, there is no control over trade in medicine, they registered many unneeded small enterprises, they created a sea of booths, they reduced the people to poverty. And so forth and so on. They themselves did this, they used up their time, and now they are looking for someone to blame. They used to damn the party, the administrative system, and now they have decided to heap everything on the party in power even though they themselves belong to it... The longer the situation continues, the greater will be the uncertainty in the society, and irresponsibility and other negative phenomena will increase. [Sokol] If you do not object, let us return to the presidential elections. How can we elect one if we do not know his ultimate status and authority? [Plyushch] It is true, legislation does not clearly indicate what kind of future president and new government we should have. But the Supreme Council has already considered the constitutional foundations of the organization of power in Ukraine. They decided that the new members would dot all the i's. The newly elected deputies would determine, in particular, whether the prime minister would be the head of the executive power or if everything would remain as it is: The president both the head of the state and the head of the executive power. It would not take as much time to resolve this problem as some people think. The result will depend on the political forces that come to parliament. I am convinced that the executive power should be concentrated in one set of hands. The president could be in charge of it. But then he must head up the government. In this case there is no need for a prime minister. This is the presidential form of government chosen recently in Belarus. It exists in America as well, and it has for a long time. But we also have experience: Over two years we have seen that with the kind of system we have now nobody is responsible for the state of affairs in the country. Therefore I will repeat once again: There is no need to make a lot of noise and postpone the new elections; instead we should prepare for them. There is time enough for that. [Sokol] Ivan Stepanovich! But it is also possible to have a situation where Leonid Makarovych Kravchuk could say that the decision of the early elections was unconstitutional. There are grounds for such a statement. [Plyushch] But he signed the law on this... [Sokol] And the last thing. There is reason to think that the elections will not be held on 26 June anyway. By insisting on your position, are you not risking a certain amount of your authority? [Plyushch] I am. But that is not the essential thing. The main thing is to change the situation for the better. And as quickly as possible. The situation will depend on many factors. If I end up alone, it will be a voice howling in the desert. You are well aware of my position regarding the election of the new members of the Supreme Council. There was so much shouting: "The elections will not take place!" I will not even consider the idea that the people will not come to them. Even what we have today is an important political victory. All we have to do is bring things to completion. Today people have started saying that the people can make the best choice. Yes, they can. But they will never make the mistakes of which a single person is capable. If we allow an individual to have the power--there will be immeasurably more mistakes.
