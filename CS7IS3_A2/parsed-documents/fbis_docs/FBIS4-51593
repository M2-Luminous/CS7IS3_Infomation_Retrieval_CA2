On April 29 and 28, an overseas-based E-3 early warning plane made aerial espionage on the strategic in-depth areas of the northern half of Korea in the skies above Yangpyong, Umsong and Tanyang, South Korea. On April 27 and 22, an Okinawa-based RC-135 strategic reconnaissance plane flew to South Korea and carried out photographing and electronic espionage on the whole area of the northern half of Korea in the sky above the Military Demarcation Line. On April 29, a U-2 high-altitude strategic reconnaissance plane based in South Korea committed an aerial espionage on the strategic depth and inland areas of the northern half of Korea in the skies above Tokjok Islet, Yangpyong and Yangyang, South Korea. On April 22 and 21, over 30 spy planes including RV-1s, RC-12s and RF-4Cs staged round the clock aerial espionage. Aerial espionage of the U.S. imperialists have become more frequent with the start of the hwarang war game of the South Korean puppets. The espionage committed by the U.S. imperialists in April against the northern half of Korea numbered more than 250. Facts fully prove how desperately the U.S. imperialists are running about in their preparations for a war of aggression to stifle the DPRK with arms.
