In this regard, NODONG SINMUN today says his remarks fully revealed Japan's policy of nuclear armament which has reached the danger line. The analyst says: The Japanese reactionaries have accelerated nuclear arms development in secrecy, concealing a large quantity of plutonium under the cloak of "three non-nuclear principles." As Hata admitted, Japan has made all preparations and has now the capacity to massproduce nuclear weapons any time it wants. The nuclear armament of Japan is a matter of time. Japan intends to become a nuclear power and give vent to its bitter grievances for its past defeat, behaving like a big power, and revive its old empire. Now the Japanese ruling circles are claiming that the use of nuclear weapons is not contrary to the international law, thus revealing their intention to produce nuclear weapons and use them in overseas aggression. Their alleged "maintenance of the three non-nuclear principles" and "efforts for nuclear non-proliferation" are nothing but a smokescreen to cover up the nuclear armament of Japan. Japan is the only A-bomb victim in the world. For such a country to seek nuclear armament, forgetful of the lesson, is a foolish act inviting a nuclear holocaust.
