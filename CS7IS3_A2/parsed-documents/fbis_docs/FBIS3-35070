[Al-Agha] The position is good, although there are some minor problems. And our relations as a movement with the other forces are good. And we are doing our utmost to secure a minimum of coordination. And dialogues are continuing among us with a view to easing any tension that may emerge, especially in field positions. I can say that relations with the national forces inside the Strip are satisfactory so far. But the main problem is the hot security situation. The reason is the spread of weapons inside the strip with the encouragement of the Israeli authorities and under their eyes. This situation in turn creates numerous security problems and excesses against citizens. [Khashanah] How can this situation be brought under control? [Al-Agha] We are trying together with the other national forces to bring the security problem under control and to confront all the excesses taking place. However, the comprehensive solution to this situation will take place after the establishment of a Palestinian national authority that can bring an end to these regrettable aspects and guarantee the Palestinian citizens' security and safety. [Khashanah] Social and economic conditions in the Gaza Strip are worse than in the West Bank. What is the effect of that on the political situation? [Al-Agha] There are problems resulting from the bad economic situation, especially the spread of unemployment in the strip. Many Palestinian establishments are suffering severe financial straits, and their workers have not received their wages for several months. In addition, families of the martyrs and detainees have not received the allowances decided for them. This situation is attributable to the scarcity of the PLO's financial resources and the systematic Israeli economic policy against Palestinian citizens in the occupied territories. Furthermore, the delay in implementing the Declaration of Principles agreement between the PLO and Israel in addition to the obstacles created by the Israeli side during the negotiations to obstruct progress are all factors which have created a state of frustration and impatience among citizens -- which has led to psychological worry and tension and maybe some regrettable actions from time to time. [Khashanah] What are the potential effects of the agreement's implementation on the situation in the strip in the light of the meeting with President 'Arafat? [Al-Agha] We discussed political and organizational matters whose positive results I hope will emerge in the stage ahead. And I hope that the national authority will begin to play its role inside the occupied territories so that a new era in the Palestinian people's history will begin -- an era when the occupation will disappear.
