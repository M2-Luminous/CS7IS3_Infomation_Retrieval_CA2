Anyone who believes al-Asad can be satisfied with less, is living in illusion." These remarks were made yesterday by Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres in an address before members of kibbutzim in the Meggido Regional Council, held at Kibbutz 'En Hashofet. "Let us not fool ourselves with regard to al-Asad's demands. The precedent al-Sadat set in Sinai serves as a basis for his demands," Peres said. Peres added that in addition to their demand for a withdrawal, Syria also demands reciprocal demilitarization. That is, if Israel demands that part of the Golan Heights be demilitarized, the Syrians will demand that the Upper Galilee be demilitarized as well. "Naturally, such a demand is impractical. When I told Egyptian President Mubarak about it, he laughed and said that had Egypt presented such a demand, the entire territory of Israel would have been demilitarized," Peres said.
