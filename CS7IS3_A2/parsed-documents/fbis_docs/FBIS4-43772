[Paye] Regarding the issues of creating economic growth and employment opportunities, which are the largest tasks, the ministers, in addition to reaching an agreement in the financial area, were able to agree to buckle down to the task of structural reform. We were also able to agree to strengthen the multilateral trade system, eliminate protectionism, and strengthen dialogue with countries that are not OECD members. We were able to produce overall results. However, true results depend on each country's future effort. [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Ministers of European nations strongly expressed concern that low wages and low-cost goods from developing countries in Asia threaten the employment situation in Europe. [Paye] I think such a concern is wrong. Since the time of the industrial revolution, new employment opportunities have been created while some industries were forced into bankruptcy every time a new technological invention was made. Low-cost goods such as textiles created problems in Europe. However, it is a process of economic development. What we have to do to overcome this process is to renovate our technologies, educate capable people, and review our social systems to make them suit the high-tech era. Some people are worried that the issue of labor standards and competition -- or the issue of how far we should protect the rights of laborers in developing countries -- may be linked to protectionism in the developed countries. The OECD plans to make an objective analysis, which will not be affected by political pressure or diplomatic tension. [TOKYO SHIMBUN] The amount of Japan's trade surplus is huge. On the other hand, its economic recovery is slow. [Paye] Japan is an island, and the Japanese people still have insular views. Indeed, it is difficult for the United States and European countries to make inroads into the Japanese market. However, I do not think Japan is essentially a closed nation. Since it has a consistent social system and firm systems [as published], you need to exert efforts to understand its culture and how the Japanese people think if you want to do business in the Japanese market. It will become a most reliable partner once your efforts are recognized. [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Japan is buckling down to the task of political and economic reforms. There are many problems, however, which will require a considerable amount of time before being settled. [Paye] Japan's ability to adapt to a new environment and long-term viewpoints are highly valued. Japan is moving in the right direction, so we hope it will speed up the process of its political and economic reforms. We hope Japan will make changes in such areas as consumption and livelihood [shohi ya seikatsu] and the social system in a way that it can cooperate more than before with its trade partners, including the European countries and the United States. Some people insist on keeping things which are peculiar to Japan in various areas ranging from politics to the family system. However, I think it is also necessary for foreign countries occasionally to apply pressure on Japan to make its reforms progress more. Anyhow, the standard of living in Japan has reached the highest level in the world. I think Japan will change more. I am certain that it will be obvious to everybody that Japan is neither an isolated protectionist nation nor a closed one. [TOKYO SHIMBUN] What do you think of the Japan-U.S. comprehensive economic talks, in which the United States is assuming a stance of "emphasizing the importance of results?" [Paye] It is strange that the United States is displeased with Japan, because the United States is suffering from a huge trade deficit with Japan. U.S. markets are open to many countries. It seems, however, that the United States thinks it is difficult to make inroads into markets in Japan, which has strong competitive power. If I may express my private opinion, it is dangerous to insist on bilateral negotiations between Japan and the United States to settle trade issues. I am worried about the possibility that the benefits of each nation may be jeopardized. Negotiations between Japan and the United States in limited individual areas will not be linked to promotion of changes in Japan. [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Your second term of office will expire in September. Are you planning to remain in the post? [Paye] I expressed my hope a year ago to remain in this post one more term. I have enough experience, and this is an interesting time of change. I am ready for it.
