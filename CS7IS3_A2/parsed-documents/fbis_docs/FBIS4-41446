Addressing Vladimir Shumeyko's suggestion for an extension, for another two years, of both the president's and parliament's mandates, the anonymous source said Yeltsin stood the best chance to win presidential elections in 1996 and would be unlikely to allow the State Duma and Federation Council decide how long he was to stay in office. But, the source admitted that Shumeyko's initiative was logical and made sense. It would allow the mostly newcomer politicians to learn what was what and concentrate on law-making. The source said Shumeyko's initiative was a touchstone and the Administration's response to it would depend on whether it was endorsed by the lawmakers, leading political parties and movements and other influential forces.
