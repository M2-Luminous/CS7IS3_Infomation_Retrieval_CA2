"There is no hope for us if we don't practice real democracy," according to Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi, head of a seven-member delegation which held talks here with 'Arafat and close colleagues on Sunday and Monday. He told AFP it was too early to announce the results of the meetings which were to continue until Tuesday. "We want to broaden the decision-making structure so that it does not stay entirely in Abu-'Ammar's ('Arafat's) hands," 'Abd-al-Shafi, who led negotiations with Israel in Washington before the autonomy accord was signed in September, said after arriving in Tunis Sunday. He added he would call for a "collective leadership." 'Arafat agreed to meet the delegation representing 120 prominent Palestinians who two weeks ago sent the PLO leader and executive committee a petition calling for more democracy in the organization. It called for mapping out a strategy for the self-rule negotiations with Israel, setting up a committee for directing the talks, and choosing negotiators based on merit rather than on political considerations. The petition also demanded respect for human rights once the Palestine Liberation Organization assumes responsibility for affairs in the Gaza Strip and West Bank town of Jericho. At least six of the 12 executive committee members support the demands, according to a Palestinian official. 'Abd-al-Shafi, a founding PLO member who has for months demanded more democracy, said: "Committee appointments should not be made only on the basis of political and personal considerations." He stressed the need to use Palestinians of ability at this "decisive" time, when the PLO and Israel are failing to make headway in implementing an accord for limited self-rule in the Gaza Strip and West Bank town of Jericho. Three leading figures in the Palestinian uprising against the Israeli occupation resigned December 26 in protest at 'Arafat's decision to name a 13-member council to head Fatah operations in the Gaza Strip. 'Arafat said the resignations had stemmed from a misunderstanding and promised "serious changes will be carried out" in the Fatah leadership in Gaza in order to satisfy the three. But a draft constitution for the Palestinians during autonomy was published in Jerusalem last Thursday putting wide powers in 'Arafat's hands. 'Arafat is named as the president of a highly-centralized system with a five-year term in office, renewable once only, but there is no reference to elections. He controls the police and security forces, issues laws after ratification by the legislative authority, grants pardons and may hand out capital punishment. The constitution guarantees an independent judiciary under the rule of law and recognizes freedom of religion, opinion and the press and the right to work. On Saturday, 'Arafat's Fatah faction urged all Palestinian groups to help build a democratic state. In a statement to mark the 29th anniversary of its creation, Fatah said "democracy and political pluralism" would be at the foundation of a Palestinian state and he pledged to "defend" the principles of democracy. Talks on the final status of the occupied territories are to start in the third year of Palestinian self-rule. Opposed to the interim autonomy accord are several PLO factions and Moslem fundamentalist groups.
