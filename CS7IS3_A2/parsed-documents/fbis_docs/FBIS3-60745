In an interview with the weekly KAYHAN HAVAI, Sergey Tretyakov said an agreement had been reached with Iran ``in principle'' to set up the plant in Bushehr on the Gulf, and to complete another left unfinished by a German company. ``Despite opposition from Washington, we are determined to go ahead with the project,'' he was quoted as saying. ``We have an independent policy with respect to Iran.'' Tretyakov said negotiations were underway and the project would be implemented only if ``financial problems are sorted out,'' but he did not clarify what the problems were. Diplomats here said Iran, faced with a serious cash crisis, had asked Moscow to finance the project, but Russia had refused, due to its own economic problems. Discussions between Iran and Russia have been going on for more than a year over the purchase of two 440-megawatt VVER-440-213 nuclear reactors for the new plant. The German corporation Siemens launched the project when the late shah was in power, but broke off work during the Islamic revolution and the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war. The cost of the project has been put at 3.7 billion dollars. Iran has repeatedly called for work to resume but the German government has refused, amid concerns that it could be accused of aiding nuclear proliferation in a country suspected by the West of aiming to build nuclear weapons. The possibility of Russian involvement in finishing the plant, which is 80 percent complete, was discussed during a trip to Moscow by an Iranian delegation in the summer, Tretyakov said in an interview with the daily ABRAR in August. Iran and Russia signed an accord on civil nuclear cooperation earlier this year, but did not disclose details of the agreement. During a visit here in March, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said such cooperation would take place within the regulations set by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and under the supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Tehran has repeatedly accused Western countries, notably the United States, of preventing it from obtaining nuclear technology for civilian purposes. In February, Iran also signed an accord with China for the purchase of two 300-megawatt nuclear reactors for non-military use. The project with Beijing has also been delayed because of financial problems, according to Chinese diplomats in Tehran.
