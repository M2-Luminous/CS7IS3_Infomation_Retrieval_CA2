In the first armed confrontation between the people and terrorism, the inhabitants of Manfalut exchanged fire with three terrorists who were on their way to hiding on al-Ma'abidah Island. The three terrorists -- Khalid Quraysh, Muhammad 'Abd-al-'Al, and Sahsah al-Manfaluti -- were killed. In the ongoing struggle between the governor, the security organ, and the popular leaderships in the governorate, the latter are saying that the security organ has set up vigilante [al-matarid] groups and armed them with modern weapons to chase and kill the terrorists. They added that the Manfalut operation was the first one carried out by these groups. The Islamic Group in al-Minya last Sunday distributed its first statement in four years. Masked youngsters carrying swords and axes distributed the statement which declared an end to the truce agreed on by the Islamic Group and the security forces. AL-AHALI had published on 26 December 1993 the agreement between the Islamic Group and the security organ in al-Minya and Suhaj. Sunday's statement warned that the Islamic Group will resume the struggle.
