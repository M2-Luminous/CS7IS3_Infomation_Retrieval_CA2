An article written by Comrade Deputy Foreign Minister Vu Khoan entitled "Experience Obtained in the World and the Process of Industrialization and Modernization in our Country" reads in part as follows: It is not that industrialization can be carried out by any country at any time. Industrialization requires certain conditions and premises. Therefore, as we embark on the task of encouraging industrialization and modernization, it would be useful to study the experiences of other countries. What we need to study and how to apply it will, of course, depend on the specific conditions of our country and on the current international situation. Dealing with the basics for industrialization, the journal carries a number of articles critical of some incorrect views on market economy and socialism, the historic mandate of the working class, the issue of Marxist humanity, and so forth.
