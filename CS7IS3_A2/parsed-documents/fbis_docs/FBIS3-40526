I would like to take this opportunity to express my thanks to the journal for publishing my inaugural remarks upon becoming chairman of the foundation in the May issue of the journal last year. I plan to work even harder than before on making the Boei Gijutsu Journal a magazine that is for and by the members of the foundation, so I request the support, cooperation, and understanding of all members. It has been a little more than a year since I became chairman, and in that time the editorial staff working under the leadership of executive director Yasuo Imai has held numerous discussions about the magazine. We have also had help from people with previous editorial experience in the private sector who were kind enough to share their knowledge with us. The director of the foundation, Izumi Tomita, who took on his new job last year, also offered help in consolidating the new editorial policies and helping with the new layout. Once that was done, we started collecting manuscripts, and finally in August sent copies of the magazine to foundation members. We would like to see the magazine used not only as a resource for members to obtain a clear picture of defense technologies in Japan today, but also used as a forum for exchanging technical information between the public and private sector for the benefit of its members. We also would like to see it play a role in improving the technical potential for achieving qualitative superiority in defense hardware and equipment. From the mid-18th century until today, there has not been a single year in which there has not been an armed conflict of one kind or another in the world, and since the end of World War II there have been more than 100 such armed conflicts in one place or another around the world. The words spoken at the time of the Roman Empire that ``if you want peace, prepare for war'' are just as relevant today as they were back then. There have been signs recently of a full-scale debate taking place in Japan pertaining to Japan's security arrangement. I believe that this debate should also include a discussion of technology as well. From the view of security arrangements for the 21st century, I think we should welcome a clarification of the policies that go with maintaining and developing an industrial base and technology base for producing and developing defense arms and equipment. If this is done, a widespread consensus can be expected to emerge among the people of Japan. It is my hope that the members of the foundation will not only be actively involved in contributing articles to the newly formatted magazine but will also take time to express their opinions as well.
