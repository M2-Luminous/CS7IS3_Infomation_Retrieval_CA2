Alternation in the political sphere is also having its effect on French foreign policy. In a 180-degree change of course, the government is turning its back on Taiwan and normalizing relations with Beijing. It is thus putting behind it a Franco-Chinese estrangement stemming from the 1982 sale of 60 Mirage 2000-5 to Formosa, and is meeting the PRC's two conditions: recognition of Beijing as the "sole legal government of China, and recognition of Taiwan as an integral part of Chinese territory." In addition, it is promising "in future not to authorize French enterprises to participate in arming Taiwan." The Chinese for their part have not committed to much in return for all this "kowtowing" (or grovelling, as one expert in Franco-Chinese relations calls it). They merely declare that "French enterprises will be welcome to compete in the Chinese market on an equal footing." In other words, the Chinese agree to recognize as applying to France a trading privilege that exists with respect to every country with which our country maintains diplomatic relations. The news has had a mixed reception in aeronautical circles. Firms currently filling arms contracts with Taiwan are clearly somewhat nervous about how the Nationalists will react. But for the moment it appears they have nothing to fear. Taipei does not appear keen to retaliate by voiding current contracts, and Beijing is not insisting on their cancellation. Dassault, SNECMA, Thomson, and Matra will thus be able to fulfill their 30-billion-franc [Fr] contract. Similarly, arming of the six La Fayette class frigates built by DCN [Directorate of Naval Shipbuilding] at Lorient is expected to continue. The primary beneficiaries of that contract, valued at between Fr10-15 billion, are Thomson-CSF (battle system, Crotale naval missile), Matra (Mistral missile), and Aerospatiale (Exocet). But notwithstanding the government's assertion of the right to continue selling arms to Taiwan--so long as Beijing does not consider them "offensive"--doubts persist regarding the future of the big contract (an option for nine more frigates) and prospects for other deals such as submarines, armored vehicles, a second tranche of Mirage 2000, and a complement of Mica for Matra. However, the news was received with a measure of satisfaction in civil aeronautics circles. Particularly at Airbus Industrie, which has just expanded its Beijing office. As pointed out by the consortium and its French partner Aerospatiale, dialogue with the Chinese buyers will be greatly facilitated. The partners hope, for example, to close the gap with Boeing, which has already placed 250 of its commercial jets--compared to only about 30 Airbus (and some 20 to Taiwan)--in a market estimated at 600 aircraft between now and the year 2005. Louis Gallois, Aerospatiale's CEO, has a lot of hopes riding on the ATR-42/72 regional air transport, which he sees as "perfectly adapted to the Chinese market." All the same, it has not been ordered yet by any airline on the continent, despite the fact Beijing is participating in fabrication, whereas 18 of them are flying the colors of the Nationalists' Trans Asia Airways, formerly Foshing Airlines. Also in the civilian aeronautics sector, the robust growth in air traffic means air traffic control systems will have to be modernized and airports expanded, opening up major opportunities for Thomson-CSF and Aeroport de Paris. The Chinese have already purchased several dozen TB-20 from Socata for training their airline pilots. The situation is less clear in the defense sector. The few contracts signed in the past have not been renewed. There was an order for Rasit radars from Thomson, for 13 Super Frelon, for eight Super Puma (some of them put to civilian uses), for eight Ecureuils, eight Gazelles armed with Hot antitank missiles, several batteries of Crotale missiles (which some people believe were used to develop an equivalent indigenous system), and the first phase of modernization of the A-5 fighter-bombers (formerly MiG-19) by Thomsen and Sagem. The only success story to stand the test of time is the fabrication of 50 Dauphin under license, with Ariel engines provided by Turbomeca. The French opening is expected to give a boost to Eurocopter's current negotiations for a new series and strengthen cooperation on the EC-120 light helicopter.
