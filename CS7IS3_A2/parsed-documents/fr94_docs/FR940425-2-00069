FR940425-2-00069 FR940425-2-00049 Availability of Funds Approximately $2,700,000 is expected to be available in FY 1994 to fund all approved competing grants. It is expected that the average award will be $56,000, ranging from $5,000 to $900,000, beginning on or about July 1, 1994, for a 12-month budget period within a 5-year project period. Funding estimates may change. There is no statutory cost participation formula. In agreement with the Office of Refugee Resettlement, CDC will distribute available funds on an 80% formula and 20% discretionary basis. (Applicants will continue to submit budgets as in previous years, i.e., line item detail with a ``Grand Total'' amount of funding requested.) CDC will distribute 80% of the available funds (e.g., $2,160,000 of the $2,700,000) to grantees based on a formula using each State's proportion of refugee arrivals during the past two years (including a floor amount of $5,000 for States with a small number of refugee arrivals). All applicants with approved applications will receive formula funding. The remaining 20% of available funding (e.g., $540,000 of the $2,700,000) will be awarded on a discretionary basis. Use of Grant Funds Grant funds may be used for costs associated with planning, organizing, implementing, and evaluating public health and health assessment activities directed to refugees, in accordance with 45 CFR parts 74 and 92. Grant funds may not be used for construction costs or inpatient care. Except in special situations that are explained and justified, grant funds will not be available for direct curative or rehabilitative services. This restriction applies to subsequent diagnostic or treatment services provided directly to individual refugees for whom specific health problems have been identified. It is expected that other sources of support will generally be identified for these purposes. Exceptions will be considered for diagnostic and treatment services that are integral to the conduct of public health programs and are otherwise not available. However, tuberculosis preventive therapy outreach activities that are associated with locating refugees for diagnosis and the provision of treatment are permitted. If grant funds are used to support bilingual outreach staff, applicants should ensure appropriate language and culture compatibility. Applicants are encouraged to use contractual or similar mechanisms that will allow for maximum flexibility in making personnel changes due to changing language needs. Purpose The purpose of this program is to augment State and local resources and to assist States and localities in providing health assessments and follow-up activities to refugees for problems of public health concern. Health assessments of refugees are intended to identify and lead to the treatment of health conditions that could affect the public health or the personal well-being of refugees and impede their effective resettlement. Communities with the largest refugee populations will be principally targeted for assistance under this program. The term ``refugee'' is defined in section 101(a)(42) of the Immigration and Nationality Act [8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(42)]. These grants are made available in recognition of: A. The severe strain on public resources in high impact areas represented by the influx of refugees. B. Gaps in meeting the health needs of refugees through other forms of Federal assistance. C. The need for State level coordination of public health programs, general health assessments, and referrals for medical, mental, dental, rehabilitative, and social services. D. The need to intensify and maintain outreach efforts to improve upon the number of refugees starting and completing tuberculosis preventive therapy. Program Requirements In conducting the activities to achieve the purpose of the program, the Grantees must meet the following requirements: A. Identification Develop and implement a system to identify all officially arriving refugees. Use notification forms received from CDC port of entry quarantine stations to determine primary refugee arrivals. Include a mechanism to identify secondary refugee arrivals and give priority to recent arrivals in the United States who have not received an initial health assessment in their area of previous residence. B. Contacting Refugees Contact identified officially arriving refugees shortly after arrival and offer a health assessment. Carefully explain the importance of receiving a health assessment and where and how to get to a convenient health care provider, whenever possible, in the language spoken by the refugee. Efforts to contact the refugees should include: 1. Close coordination with voluntary agencies (VOLAGS) and other service agencies. 2. Assisting the refugee to overcome any special barriers to receiving the health assessment, e.g., lack of transportation. C. Health Assessment Provide or coordinate the provision of a health assessment to officially arriving refugees and identified secondary migrants who have not previously received a health assessment. Give priority to refugees with Class A and Class B medical conditions. Although it is expected that a standard protocol and recommended priorities for health assessments will be published at a later date, applicants may include the following components in the health assessment:
