[Boross] Naturally, the unfavorable economic situation could represent a basic danger. In addition, our domestic economy greatly depends on foreign developments. Irrespective of its causes, economic decline could have social consequences. In a deteriorating economic situation, one cannot calm the people by claiming the inevitability of such a deterioration, and the demands from the government in power become quite simplified. Of course, this is so not only in Hungary but all over Europe. We cannot exclude this danger either: If economic deterioration leads to strikes and demonstrations, there will be no inflow of capital. So much for the economy. I see an internal political danger if conditions for a coalition capable of forming a lasting government fail to materialize.... [NEPSZABADSAG] Can we count on the creation of a really stable government? [Boross] The obligatory pre-election optimism dictates that such a government could also emerge this time, after we succeeded in forming one four years ago. On the other hand, this is not certain, because a coalition made up of too many parties might also emerge; for example, a coalition made up of five parties is difficult to handle because its fate could depend on the smallest participant. [NEPSZABADSAG] How many parties could form a still workable coalition? What about a coalition made up of three parties? [Boross] Our coalition is also made up of three parties. The greater the number of parties in a coalition, the more unstable the situation. Government ineptitude can also lead to danger even in the case of a stable coalition. [NEPSZABADSAG] Do you think of external dangers? [Boross] There is no external danger threatening Hungary at the moment; at the same time, a certain level of political instability can be felt in three areas, those with Hungarian minority populations. There will be elections in Slovakia in the autumn, and we do not know what the results of these elections will be. A certain disadvantage is always involved here regarding steady contacts. Political life in Romania is also changing, and there is the small Yugoslavia to mention here too. However, in spite of all this, I do not feel a direct danger of events in any of these countries, events that could seriously threaten the situation of Hungarians. [passage omitted] [NEPSZABADSAG] There are various views of Hungary's international image and the national minority issue, which is indivisible from relations with our neighbors. According to some, there is a long-term solution: Animosity will stop with economic prosperity, which will hopefully take place in the region at more or less the same time. [Boross] Every country strives to present a favorable image. There are countries in the former Eastern bloc which do this more loudly than us. A certain type of rivalry is therefore inevitable. However, this does not have too much in common with our bilateral relations. Stable governments are essential for these contacts, because people are negotiating with people. It does not help if the relevant people on the other side keep changing. When we met in Prague, Meciar told me that we could solve all the problems in two hours if the two of us got together. And now, when we negotiate, we have to get together with someone else. Given that the issues also include a long-term solution of national minority contacts, I must mention that two neighboring countries received suggestions from the Council of Europe on membership. These suggestions are generally verified. [passage omitted] [NEPSZABADSAG] Mr. Boross, speaking of various government scenarios, one can hear of the possibility of a grand coalition government of experts. [Boross] I cannot evaluate a government of experts. My government has outstanding experts, and I do not know who could be better than us. Why would a former departmental head at the planning office be a better expert? [NEPSZABADSAG] What about a grand coalition? Does it stand a chance? [Boross] I do not see any chance or will for such a coalition. Even if the oft-mentioned elite were ready for something like this, they would not be able to do it because the party behind them would disappear. The political reality is that the members would not forgive the party for such an alliance. Therefore, this does not depend on five relatively wise people getting together and saying that, although they hate one another and make contradictory promises, they should form an alliance because there is trouble now. Such things only happen in fairy tales. [NEPSZABADSAG] Finland is such an example.... [Boross] That is true. But such a possibility only emerges after two decades of democracy, after many things have been tested, and a political concept and view has emerged that has different priorities. In Hungary, the priority to win still prevails. [passage omitted] [NEPSZABADSAG] Although there is publicity in Hungary, we also notice that it is not functioning. For example, Finance Minister Ivan Szabo announces one morning that 20 billion forints has disappeared from the banks. It was interesting and bitter to notice the lack of any public outcry and also that the apparatus ignored the issue. I could also mention privatization matters that were not dug out or stressed by the press.... Do you think that there is both political and moral apathy in Hungary? [Boross] We are now following a lengthy dictatorship, and every country in this region is complaining about low morality. One should not be surprised at this, given the precedents. On the other hand, distorted information has played a major role in the emergence of concrete affairs. As interior minister, I submitted an internal report to the government on banking affairs investigated by the police: A lot of things, from embezzling to stupidity, can be the reason for the disappearance of that 20 billion forints. Ivan Szabo did not participate in one part of the government session and issued a statement the next day, and this led to the "affair." I do not know how the population reacted to it, but the press reacted very strongly; however, the various commentaries failed to mention that this amount only made up 1 percent of the outstanding balance of some 2 trillion forints. [passage omitted] [NEPSZABADSAG] We have heard that you are ready to participate in a televised debate. NEPSZABADSAG would gladly participate in such a debate. Are there any plans for a television debate? [Boross] As far as I know, a televised debate with the participation of Orban, Peto, Horn, and Surjan will be aired on 2 May.
