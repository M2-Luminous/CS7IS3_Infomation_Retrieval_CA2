But, as Viktor Alsufyev, chairman of the Central Election Commission of Crimea, declared at a news conference on 28 March, elections were not held in five of the 66 districts because there was a turnout of less than half of the electorate. Repeat elections will be held in these districts. In 10 districts the deputies have already been elected, and they all represent the Russia bloc (it was this bloc, we would recall, that brought Yuriy Meshkov to power). It is mainly candidates of the Russia bloc that have gone on to the second round scheduled for 10 April, and it is they that have realistic changes of victory. The Russia bloc is leading in the vote by party slate also. The Kurultay of the Crimean Tatar People was the winner in the Crimean Tatar multiple-seat national district: According to preliminary figures, it has won 13 of the 14 seats in the Supreme Council of Crimea. One seat, evidently, will be gained by the opponent of the Kurultay--the Crimean Tatar National Movement, which, incidentally, supports the Russia bloc. Deputies for four single-seat national districts--Armenian, Greek, Bulgarian, and German--were elected also. Observers note that the most radical deputies in respect to Russia: Anatoliy Los, chairman of the Crimea Russian Society, and Aleksandr Kruglov, chairman of the Russian Party of Sevastopol and currently a deputy of the Supreme Council of Crimea and the Sevastopol City Council, did not make it to the second round. Sergey Shuvaynikov, chairman of the Russian Party of Crimea, and Viktor Mezha, chairman of the People's Party of Crimea, which is a member of the Russia bloc, made it through to the second round from a Simferopol district. It is assumed that Mezha has the best chance of being elected. As observers believe, representatives of the Russia bloc will obtain in the future parliament no fewer than two-thirds of the seats, which is entirely sufficient for the adoption of any constitutional decision. And if the representatives of the Kurultay in parliament boycott the adoption of this decision or the other, this will have no legal consequences. The Central Election Commission, which was appointed by the president of the Republic of Crimea, is tallying the results of the poll of inhabitants of the peninsula. As Sergey Nikulin, aide to the president of the Republic of Crimea, said in conversation with our NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent, "the poll was conducted under referendum conditions" (we would recall that questions concerning treaty relations of Crimea and Ukraine, dual citizenship, and on an edict of the president of Crimea having legislative force were asked in the poll). Sergey Nikulin informed our NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent that, according to preliminary figures, more than 60 percent of the electorate had taken part in the poll, as in the elections. "No fewer than 80 percent of those who took part in the ballot, possibly more, responded 'for' to all three questions." The figures for Simferopol are already final: 84 percent responded affirmatively to the first question, 87.8 percent to the second, and 83.6 percent to the third. And although the poll is not legally binding, observers are convinced that at the first session of the new Supreme Council of Crimea the deputies will recognize it as a referendum with all the ensuing consequences. It is hard to say as yet what Kiev would do in such a case. Much will depend on the new parliament of Ukraine. On 28 March a news conference for Crimean, Ukrainian, and foreign journalists was conducted by the leaders of the Crimean Tatar National Movement Organization, which supports the Kurultay of the Crimean Tatar People, the Ukrainian Citizens Congress of Crimea, the Crimea organization of the Ukrainian Republican Party, and the Crimea With Ukraine Committee. It spoke of the illegality of the poll of inhabitants of the peninsula, which, according to the organizers of the news conference, was boycotted by the majority of Crimean Tatars and Ukrainians. A joint statement was read out to the journalists, which said: "The greatest urgency is attached at this worrying time to the cooperation of the Crimean Tatar and pro-Ukraine organizations. The Ukrainian organizations will be even more scrupulous in their defense of the rights and interests of the Crimean Tatars via their central offices in Kiev and via their deputies in the Supreme Council of Ukraine. The Crimean Tatar National Movement Organization will support the Ukrainian organizations on questions of the preservation of the territorial integrity of Ukraine and the affirmation of Ukrainian statehood on the territory of Crimea." As already reported, Konstantin Zatulin, chairman of the State Duma of the Russian Federation CIS Committee, and Sergey Stankevich, member of the State Duma of the Russian Federation International Affairs Committee, are in Crimea as election observers. They are both part of the leadership of the Party of Russian Unity and Accord. In the evening of 28 March Zatulin and Stankevich declared that "Ukraine and Crimea are confronted with the need for a reform of power. The political elite of Ukraine is not wholly prepared for the challenge of the times, not wholly prepared for federalism." Stankevich declared that "resolution of the problem of the Black Sea Fleet is a matter of the next three months." Konstantin Zatulin and Sergey Stankevich met with Yuriy Meshkov, president of the Republic of Crimea, Viktor Semenov, chairman of the Sevastopol City Council, Mustafa Dzhemilev, chairman of the Majlis of the Crimean Tatar People, and his deputy, Refat Chubarov, who was elected, incidentally, deputy of the Supreme Council of Crimea for the Crimean Tatar single-seat national district. [Signed] Aleksandr Pilat There is nothing sensational about the results of the Crimean poll, come to that: It would have been odd had the inhabitants of the peninsula, who had quite recently elected Yuriy Meshkov their president, suddenly denied his first major initiative their trust. The question now is exclusively one of how the Crimean leadership wishes to dispose of the results of this poll--especially since it will now have at its disposal a controlled parliament, in which representatives of Meshkov's Russia bloc constitute the majority. On the eve of the second round of parliamentary elections in Ukraine and, particularly, before what are now entirely possible presidential elections, Leonid Kravchuk has found himself faced with a new insoluble problem. The tactics chosen in respect to the Crimean aspirations were fool-proof, seemingly: They were based on the cooperation of two bureaucratic teams. One of them, Kiev's, gave its Simferopol counterpart carte-blanche, demanding in exchange merely nondisruption of the territorial status quo. Thus in the place of Crimea Oblast appeared the Republic of Crimea, in the place of the oblast soviet, the Supreme Council, and provincial politicians began to call themselves ministers, speakers, presidents.... Nikolay Bagrov's fiasco confounded this protracted tightrope flirting. President Meshkov has obtained a fortunate opportunity to avail himself of the attributive achievements of his predecessor to acquire real power. Kiev, which is endeavoring to preserve the status quo, can hardly opt for some successful version of relations with the peninsula. But the development of events around Crimea could prove undesirable for Moscow also: It is, for all that, a question of a peninsula, not an island, and if Yuriy Meshkov suddenly conceives a desire to play his role through to the end and become a Simferopol Vladislav Ardzinba, a dangerous new conflict would then unfold not in the Caucasus but on Russia's European borders.
