We must have a good command of the overall situation, give prominence to focal points, and actually grasp well the three major events of reform, development, and stability to consolidate and develop the excellent situation. Shandong deputation to the second session of the eighth NPC discussed and examined in eight groups the government work report made by Premier Li Peng on behalf of the State Council. They unanimously expressed agreement and support to the report. In his speech to the group discussion, Jiang Chunyun emphatically dwelt on his opinions on the three major events of reform, development, and stability in line with Premier Li Peng's report and with Shandong's realities. Jiang Chunyun pointed out: We should go all out to carry out reform to tide over the barrier of reform. This year's reform is unprecedented in its scale, scope, depth, and difficulty. We should concentrate our energies on studying, promoting, and achieving success in reform. The reform of large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises should be regarded as the most important task. He said: To ensure the smooth progress of all reform measures, we must firmly embrace the overall concept, correctly handle the relations between the whole and the part and between the immediate interest and the long-term interest, consciously safeguard the authority of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, and maintain unanimity with the central authorities. We must fully mobilize and exploit the initiative and creativity of the broad masses of the people. Also, we must seek unity of understanding, clear the people from doubts and misgivings, and make concerted efforts to resolve the most difficult problems of reform this year. Jiang Chunyun stressed: In accelerating development, we must focus on improving quality and efficiency. In guiding ideology, we should define the following several issues: First, we should effect an improvement in both quantity and quality. Without the improvement in quantity, we will be unable to meet the increasingly expanded market demands; and without the improvement in quality, the improvement in quantity will be restricted. Under the condition of the market economy, we must win victory through quality and new products. Second, we should not only maintain a relatively high growth rate but also pay attention to improving economic efficiency. We should truly shift economic work to improving economic efficiency. Third, we should not only develop the processing industry but also strengthen basic industries. In macroeconomy, we should give both guarantee and pressure on the processing industry and initiate the deep processing of precision products. At the same time, we should exert great efforts in developing agriculture to ensure the steady increase in output of grain, cotton, and oil-bearing crops. We should pay attention to building such basic facilities as traffic and communications facilities and building energy resources and major raw materials projects in order to lay a solid foundation for increasing the momentum for further development. Fourth, we should not only pay attention to expanding the scale of production but also pay attention to carrying out technological transformation among old enterprises. Fifth, we should not only attach importance to the materials input but also strengthen scientific and technological input and development of intellectual resources. In policy and input, we should give special treatment to science, technology, and education to promote the great development of scientific, technological, and educational undertakings. Sixth, we should not only pay attention to production but also strive to expand markets, both domestic and international markets. Jiang Chunyun pointed out: Reform and development must be guaranteed by social and political stability. We should adopt powerful and effective measures to maintain social stability in order to create a fine environment for reform and development and ensure the smooth progress of the socialist modernization drive.
