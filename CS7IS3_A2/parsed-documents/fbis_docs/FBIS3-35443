"Political logic, morality, our own culture, and above all the situation in today's world does not allow us to have such deadly weapons." The commander of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) in an interview to be pulished Thursday, also said that political wisdom demands us not to go for the weapons which could cause devastation for humanity. "The eight-year-old Iraqi imposed war is proof of the real nature of our combatants who never violated the internationally recognized norms concerning wars," he added. "That Iran is trying to acquire nuclear weapons ...is just a baseless rumor," Rezaie said. Commenting on the Persian Gulf he said, the geographical situation of the waterway is such that the deep water is on Iran's side which enables the Islamic forces to keep alien warships under surveillance. Without going into details he said that there was a plot hatched by Britain, Israel and the United States to keep regional tensions high. "I tell my friends in the UAE to listen to my advice as Iran wants to continue friendly relations with all the sheikhdoms," he added. On the post-war role of the IRGC, Rezaie said that the IRGC was busy with extensive construction projects in the country.
