"The renewal of China's MFN status should not be linked to human rights or any other nontrade related conditions," said Liberal Party legislator James Tien who moved the motion. U.S. President Bill Clinton issued an executive order last year specifying that China's MFN status would only be renewed if it improved its human rights record. Mr Tien urged the government to call on Washington not to "politicise economic and trade issues" and to avoid trade wars that might jeopardise the economies of China, the U.S., and Hong Kong. It is estimated that Hong Kong will lose almost $200 billion in trade and 75,000 jobs if MFN is withdrawn. Liberal Party legislator Henry Tang called on the government to lobby for permanent MFN status for China instead of yearly renewal. But the United Democrats (UDHK), the second largest voting block in the legislature rejected the Liberal Party's proposal to decouple human rights and the MFN. UDHK legislator Huang Chen-ya moved an amendment urging the government to mount pressure on China to improve human rights to secure permanent MFN status. But that brought torrents of criticism from the Liberal Party and other pro-democracy factions, with Liberal Party legislator Selina Chow accusing the UDHK of double standards. "On the one hand, the UDHK urged the Chinese Government to separate economic issues and political ones. But on the other hand, they support the U.S. (in linking) human rights with trade issues." She condemned the UDHK for standing by the U.S. government over its use of human rights as a tool to interfere in the political affairs of other countries. Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood (ADPL) legislator Frederick Fung also opposed the UDHK move. "If MFN is not renewed this year, human rights conditions (in China) may even worsen because of the adverse impact on China's economy," he said. Meeting Point legislator Fred Li shared the ADPL view calling for unconditional MFN renewal. But UDHK legislator Cheung Man-kwong fended off the criticisms, accusing the Liberal Party of "turning a blind eye" to human rights in China. "If we keep silent... the Chinese Government will further abuse human rights," he said. Mr Cheung's ally, James To, said the U.S. Government had already spelt out that "the link between human rights and MFN was an undeniable fact. "We want MFN renewed. But we also want human rights to be improved," he said. The UDHK amendment was defeated by 29 votes to 13. Secretary for Trade and Industry Chau Tak-hay travels to Washington this month to relay Hong Kong's concerns. He said the government would lobby for unconditional MFN renewal for this year and rejected calls to mount pressure over human rights. "It would be tempting to think that such an appeal to China would be entirely logical." He added that it was wrong to mix politics with trade.
