He granted our paper an interview on the economic objectives of Moravcik's new Cabinet and the prospects of economic relations between Slovakia and the Czech Republic. [DENNI TELEGRAF] In what way will you improve the difficult economic situation in Slovakia? [Filkus] Every government has some limits. Our limits are determined by the time remaining until the early elections. We have to adopt this viewpoint when speaking about what the government can do and what it believes to be its main task. In my opinion, the government's main task is the political and economic stabilization of this country. We have to send signals abroad describing the extent to which the situation has stabilized. This is important in terms of the influx of foreign capital into the country. Of course, it is also important in terms of the domestic economy. There are no miraculous cures that would help us to do something great, if for no other reason than that our time span is limited. We have to take this factor into consideration. [DENNI TELEGRAF] Are you considering a devaluation of the Slovak koruna, a devaluation that would strengthen the export-stimulating policy, or are you going to orient yourselves toward protective measures, such as import certificates, for instance? [Filkus] First, I have to say that the finance minister should not have a say in devaluation. We are giving an opportunity here to those who are in charge of monetary policy--that is, the Central Bank. This bank is responsible for monetary stability and is entitled to decide, while taking economic criteria into account, whether to devalue or not. Of course, the bank governor can come to see the minister and ask him what he should do to improve the situation in the state budget, to decrease the pressure of the inflationary spiral, etc. I want to say that our people strongly believe, unfortunately, that the finance minister should decide whether to devalue. I repeat, this is a matter to be decided exclusively by the National Bank. [DENNI TELEGRAF] Devaluation can be replaced by an import surcharge. However, this is an inefficient measure. Are you going to maintain it? [Filkus] The protection of the market is a normal economic tool. I consider the surcharge that we have introduced to be a good economic measure because it can, at least theoretically, protect the market. At the same time, however, it is necessary to implement subsequent systemic measures not only to protect the domestic market, but also to help develop a proexport policy. I expected, for example, that import surcharge, particularly on food products from the Czech Republic, would help us to "clean" the market. The empty space thus created would be filled by our producers, which is usual in normally functioning economies. Unfortunately, this is not what is happening. On the contrary, prices went up following the introduction of the import surcharge. [DENNI TELEGRAF] What will happen to the "quality control" of Czech food then? [Filkus] On Monday [21 March], we discussed with Minister Kocarnik three open issues. They are food certificates, the customs union, and two clearing blocs [clearingovy blok]. As regards the certificates, you certainly know that an agreement, which is valid until the end of March, provides for mutual recognition of the Czech and Slovak certificates. This should change as of 1 April. I consider it to be a positive step by the Slovak side that we spoke openly about those problems. The validity of the certificates will not be abolished on 31 March but will be extended for at least one month. In this way, we will avoid the situation that recently arose on the Czech-Slovak borders. [DENNI TELEGRAF] People are saying that similar duty should be imposed on consumer goods. Can you confirm this? [Filkus] This is a matter to be decided in the future. Why should the quality of some products not be tested? I am of the opinion that this problem is different from the problems in trading relations with other countries. For many products, we have the same technology as the Czech Republic, the same standards, and the same quality. I do not see a large problem here. [DENNI TELEGRAF] The so-called clearing account plays an important role in Czech-Slovak relations. Slovakia has a large deficit on this account. Are you going to try to eliminate the old clearing bloc? [Filkus] This is very serious business. The old bloc has become a subject of various speculations, and many entrepreneurs have made money to the detriment of the state. I do not believe that this is an honest business. By antedating their claims, entrepreneurs made a profit based on the fact that they were sending money through the old bloc and receiving it from the new one. At present, this problem has accumulated, and debt has exceeded the limit of 130 million European Currency Units. The state had to pay it using not the old exchange rate but the current one. The state had to suffer a loss that is proportionate to the profit the speculators made on the clearing account. Because of this, the old bloc should be abolished as soon as possible--no later than 1 May. Of course, it will depend on both sides whether this bloc will be abolished. According to preliminary consultations, both sides are in favor of abolishing the old clearing bloc as soon as possible. [DENNI TELEGRAF] You said that several cases of fraud have been mentioned in connection with the old bloc. Do you believe they could be explained retrospectively? [Filkus] I do not believe that is possible. [DENNI TELEGRAF] Will there be a second wave of coupon privatization in Slovakia? [Filkus] Certainly. The fact that the privatization process, which is an important economic accomplishment, has become a tool for concentrating power makes us accelerate the privatization process, depoliticize it, and make it more understandable. In the fall, we want to prepare the second wave of coupon privatization. I believe that all of the privatization methods are equal. Coupon privatization is the fastest. We have promised our people: We are going to give you back a part of the property you lost in wages. Privatization has an ethical aspect, too.
