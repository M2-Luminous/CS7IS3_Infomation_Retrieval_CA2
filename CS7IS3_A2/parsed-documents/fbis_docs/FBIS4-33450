The central's mills were started after the recent torrential and extended rains. The central will also receive raw material from areas around the Brazil and Sierra de Cubitas Centrals, and zones where the rain has not delayed the harvest so much. Within the strategy, work is also underway in complexes located in the central and southern part of the province. Some of them will thus participate in the mill work by receiving sugarcane from their own areas and from neighboring areas. Within the principle of cutting sugarcane wherever possible and sending it to whichever central can mill it, Camaguey sugarcane workers have resumed the harvest operations because they are aware of the importance of contributing as much as they can for the country's economy.
