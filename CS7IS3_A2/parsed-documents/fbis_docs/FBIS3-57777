After considering the Downing Street peace declaration, the Ulster Freedom Fighters [UFF] said they retained the right to "respond militarily" in 1994. The outlawed organisation -- the UDA's [Ulster Defence Association] military wing and the largest of the Protestant paramilitary groups -- said it was difficult to give a comprehensive and final response to the deal, but added that they viewed it sceptically. A statement late last night said: "It is widely agreed that the declaration, despite its grand claims regarding consent freely given, is part of a wider agenda and once again ignores the reality that the status of Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom was substantially changed with the imposition of the Anglo-Irish diktat." The statement claimed the Government had abdicated its responsibilities to protect Northern Ireland and its citizens. In a final warning, the UFF statement added: "So long as pan-nationalist terror and political coercion continues, we retain the right to respond militarily in 1994."
