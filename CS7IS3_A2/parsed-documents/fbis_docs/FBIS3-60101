During the plenary session on Friday [19 November] 173 members of the Eduskunta absented themselves from the vote. The Eduskunta wants to retain drug use as a punishable act, but a heated debate was engaged in during the plenary session on Friday on the penalties prescribed by law. During the return debate two bills were proposed, through which drug violations would be transferred to the penal code. The government essentially wants to preserve the present penalties. Some members of the opposition would be willing to lighten the maximum penalties prescribed by law because they are simply not applied under current practice. The members of the the Parliamentary Laws Committee engaged in such a thorough debate on drugs that the other members of the Eduskunta managed to beat a hasty retreat to their home grounds. Fully 173 of the 200 members of the Eduskunta were absent from the last vote of the plenary session at 1635 hours. The vote related to the question as to whether the disputed agriculture fund should be taken up for preliminary debate on Monday or Tuesday. Some members of the Eduskunta would have preferred to postpone debate on the issue until Tuesday so that they would have time to obtain even more information on the matter. However, the Speaker's Council proposal that it be debated on Monday won out by a vote of 14 to 12. The government is proposing that the illegal manufacture, importing, exporting, transporting, distribution, possession, and use of drugs be written into the revised penal code. At the same time the minimum penalty for a drug felony would increased to one year in prison. Origin of Illegal Money Must Be Reported So-called money laundering would become a crime. Among other things, banks would be obligated to report to government officials if they suspect that a client is trying to conceal the origin of money obtained illegally. Justice Minister Hannele Pokka (Center Party) maintained during the debate that the kind of maximum penalty for drug use that is to be written into law is not a matter of indifference. In her opinion, former Justice Minister Tarja Halonen's (Social Democrat) "approach" to lowering the maximum penalty would be a clear message to international criminals, among others. She was supported by Conservative Kari Hakamies. "I am not willing to accept the proposition that a faulty sentencing practice is a good one," Halonen contended. In agreement with Halonen's position was the Greens' Satu Hassi, according to whom Pokka "is feigning ignorance" of the fact that the intent, in connection with revision of the penal code, is to write into law those penalties that are actually applied. According to Hassi, there are no differences of opinion on that point. On the other hand, according to him, there should be a sharper distinction between penalties for using and selling drugs. During the debate concern was also raised over whether drug users know that they can seek treatment without fear of being caught. Vesa Laukkanen, representing the Alternative for Finland group, thought that the threat of punishment influences those who are not using drugs. Users, however, can, of course, seek treatment if they want to. The government was also encouraged by the Eduskunta to look into how a stage of treatment could be included in sentences. Members of the Eduskunta representing the government parties and the opposition were united in their concern over the widespread use of drugs in prisons. [passage omitted]
