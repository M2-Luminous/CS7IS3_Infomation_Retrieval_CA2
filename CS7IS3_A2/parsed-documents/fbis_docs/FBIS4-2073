Speaking at the 50th session of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), which opened here today, Liu said that all regional economic organizations are equal. They should respect, open to and complement each other through enhanced cooperation. The historical experience over the past 47 years has demonstrated that the most important contributing factor for the sustained progress in the Asia-Pacific is the firm seizure of the historical opportunity to seek progress amidst stability and facilitate development through reform, Liu stressed. Over the past year, the Asia-Pacific region has enjoyed relative political stability, sustained economic growth, enhanced trading status, strong investment momentum and further expanded regional cooperation, Liu said. "While acknowledging the sustained economic growth in the Asia- Pacific, we should not lose sight of the widening gap between the North and the South and the serious problem of uneven development in this region," Liu said. According to statistics of the Asian Development Bank and ESCAP, the region, with as many as 800 million people in abject poverty, accounts for two-thirds of the world's poverty-stricken population, he said. In spite of the agreement reached in the Uruguay Round of GATT talks, trade protectionism, especially that against developing countries, has been on the rise, posing a threat to the healthy development of international trade, the Chinese vice foreign minister added. As a result of poverty and a shortage of capital and technology, their infrastructure is mostly inadequate to meet actual needs and has already become a "bottleneck" or another constraint seriously impeding their economic and social development, Liu said, adding that in this sense, to convene a session on "infrastructure development as key to economic growth and regional economic cooperation" is very timely and necessary. With a view to speeding up the infrastructure development and cooperation in this region, the Chinese delegation wishes to put forward the following propositions: 1. Infrastructure development should be tailored to national conditions. 2. Sources of finance should be explored further in order to raise funds for infrastructure development. 3. Infrastructure development calls for intensified efforts to develop human resources. 4. The international community and the developed countries in particular, should give vigorous support to infrastructure development. 5. Infrastructure development requires extensive regional cooperation. "We stand ready to have closer cooperation with others", Liu further said. "We hope to see China's reentry into GATT as contracting party at an earlier date, which will further promote trade and economic cooperation on the basis of equality and mutual benefit," he added.
