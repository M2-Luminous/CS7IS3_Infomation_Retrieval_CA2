Will Lula maintain market rules? What will he do with the foreign debt? What would the size of the state be during a possible PT administration? Will he be able to keep control of the different factions within his party? These are some of the questions that concern domestic and multinational companies, which have hired the services of consultants to draw up the profile for a possible PT administration. So far, the forecasts made by the companies are discouraging. Former Minister Mailson da Nobrega from MCM Consultants said: "We are working on two possible scenarios -- one in which there will be a centrist administration, and another one with a leftist administration. The scenario with Lula is the most negative one." Consultant firms are for the time being betting that the presidential election will be decided between the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democratic Party] candidate, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, and Lula. Consultant Walder de Goes said: "The succession has already polarized between Cardoso and Lula. All public opinion polls agree with this." According to the consultants' assessment, Lula's election as president could trigger a flight of capital. Da Nobrega foresees that "the banks that grant lines of credit ranging from $25 to $30 billion are the very ones on which Lula and his team are threatening to declare a moratorium. If Lula is elected president, those lines of credit will be considerably curtailed." The reasons underpinning the negative forecasts are manifold, and increase every time Lula changes his remarks and evinces ambiguity in his proposals. The PT platform, for example, proposes the rescheduling of Brazil's external debt. Yet the bankers who have heard Lula and Deputy Aloizio Mercadante [PT-SP] [Sao Paulo] in the United States were concerned. Da Nobrega stated that "Lula and Mercadante frightened their audience with their ignorance and defiant manner." Goes said: "The scenario portends difficulties, but if at a certain moment it becomes clear that Lula will win the elections, strategies to adapt to this situation will start to crop up. Nobody wants to destroy the country just because the PT won the elections." Another great concern is to try to fathom how the different PT factions will behave. Da Nobrega noted that "the fragmentation of the PT into so many factions gives rise to much confusion. Everybody is convinced that the apparent party union is only geared to winning the elections." Last week, Lula's remarks to justify the use of a sound truck from the ABC Metallurgic Trade Union for an election rally caused a rise in the temperature of mistrust. Moreover, among all the negative assessments of a possible PT administration, the forecast that Lula will not have a majority in Congress, and that he will find it difficult to make alliances with other parties, is the one that carries the most weight. Evaristo Dias, from Santafe Ideias, states that "from an ideological standpoint, there is no concern about Lula's administration. There is, however, real fear, which stems from his remarks rather than from what they represent."
