A group from the Khawlan tribe kidnapped the six on Tuesday in the Ma'rib region 100 kilometers (60 miles) east of here and are demanding the release of one of their own men in exchange, Hunt engineers said. Earlier reports said the kidnappers were from the Daham tribe. Political sources here said the government was in contact with several tribal leaders in a bid to persuade the kidnappers to free the six, a helicopter pilot and five engineers. They were kidnapped after flying to the Ma'rib area to inspect a leak at a pumping station, Hunt engineers said, adding that the helicopter was also seized. The Yemeni Socialist Party's AL-THAWRI newspaper reported that the oil workers were trying to defuse a bomb planted by the Khawlan on one of the company's pipelines. Hunt Oil did not confirm that report. Company engineers told AFP that the kidnappers wanted the authorities to free a tribesman who has been held for several weeks by Yemeni authorities in exchange for the six. Daham tribesmen kidnapped an American diplomat, Haynes Mahoney, in November and held him for a week. It also held two American engineers from Hunt Oil for five days last May. The Daham and Khawlan are part of the Bakil tribal group, which is generally loyal to Yemeni President 'Ali Abdallah Salih. But the Khawlan are known to support Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid's Socialist party. The two leaders, the first from the north and the second from the south, have been split since August over how to run the affairs of Yemen, united in May 1990 after three hundred years of separation. Several other foreigners have been abducted in recent months by tribes trying to exert pressure on the government, which is struggling to cope with serious economic and political problems. Ma'rib, where the six men are believed to be held, is a mountainous region with some peaks as high as 2,000 meters. It is controlled by the heavily armed Bakil, who have for long encroached on the central government's authority.
