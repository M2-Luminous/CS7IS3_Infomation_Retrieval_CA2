With the details Nikolay Mamuashvili. [Mamuashvili] Apart from the signing of a large, so-called Framework Treaty on friendship and good-neighborliness, the sides examined and signed a whole package of agreements envisaging cooperation between the countries in virtually all spheres and fields. I will remind you that before the official signing ceremony, Russian President Boris Yeltsin and the head of the Georgian state, Eduard Shevardnadze, had a one-on-one meeting. The heads of the Georgian and Russian foreign political departments -- Aleksandr Chikvaidze and Andrey Kozyrev -- also had talks and a discussion on questions of mutual interest behind closed doors. Otar Patsatsia, the republican prime minister, met with Oleg Soskovets, and Jaba Ioseliani, a Georgian parliament deputy, had talks with Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev. At the conclusion of these meetings the sides stressed that they were completely satisfied with the results achieved. In an interview for an IPRINDA agency correspondent, Andrey Kozyrev said, I quote: We see the Interstate Treaty as a symbol for settling the conflict in Abkhazia and South Ossetia, solving the problem of the republic's Russian-speaking population, and other no less important issues. The so-called military part of the talks is also evoking undoubted interest. Russian Defense Minister Grachev, after his meeting with Jaba Ioseliani, said that he was also happy with the talks. He said that it was possible that three Russian military bases would be deployed in Georgia. As far as the subunits of Russian troops stationed in Abkhazia are concerned, they are now subordinate to General Fedor Reut, the commander of the Transcaucasian Group of Troops -- all with the exception of the 345th Parachute Assault Regiment that remains subordinate to Moscow, and Jaba Ioseliani said that all that the sides are now doing is being done on mutually advantageous conditions without any encroachments [ushchemleniya].
