Hosokawa made the request for the birds to Chinese Premier Li Peng on Sunday [20 March]. Hosokawa told Li there is only one pair of ibis left in Japan and they are too old for artificial breeding, Japanese officials said. He asked China to lend Japan a pair for breeding as there are some 40 captive ibis in China that have either artificially or naturally produced offspring, they said. Hosokawa said State Planning Commission head Chen Jinhua told him on Monday morning in Beijing that China will dispatch the forestry minister, who is also in charge of environmental issues, to Japan in May for talks with his Japanese counterparts. Chen expressed China's readiness to help on the ibis breeding issue as a way of promoting China-Japan friendship and environmental cooperation, Hosokawa said.
