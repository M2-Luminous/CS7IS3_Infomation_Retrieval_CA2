Arab terrorists buy weapons on the Brazilian-Paraguayan border to perpetrate attacks that jeopardize the peace-seeking process between Israel and the PLO. This is not just the product of the imagination of an author. About 15 days ago foreign intelligence services agents in Foz de Iguacu (Parana) detected five Arabs, presumably Palestinians from Lebanon, contacting local weapon traffickers. They wanted to buy plastic explosives, and AR-15 and FAL rifles. News of the presence of these Arabs reached Brasilia. Brazilian intelligence services and Federal Police were placed on a state of alert. There is fear that an attack like the one on 17 March 1992 against the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires -- which resulted in 29 deaths -- may take place. Brazilian and foreign intelligence experts are working on the theory that fundamentalists linked to the Hizballah -- Party of God, a pro-Iranian organization headquartered in Lebanon -- are trying to obstruct the peace-seeking plan between Israelis and Palestinians. An attack would disqualify the PLO as a reliable interlocutor. Iran and some Arab extremist organizations are against any sort of agreement between Palestinians and the state of Israel. It is believed the five individuals may have entered Brazilian territory through Argentina or Paraguay, taking advantage of the Argentine-Brazil-Paraguay border region and, especially, of the possible logistic support they may have obtained from members of the important Arab community in the region. Federal Police Director Colonel Wilson Romao told ISTOE that "this is a potentially explosive situation and we are taking the necessary measures to identify these five individuals and prevent them from using Brazil as a springboard for international terrorism." Romao confirmed that since January he has been receiving reports from the border region on movements of suspicious members of the local Arab community. Romao said the terrorist threat is real in Foz de Iguacu. He asserted: "There are all the necessary facilities there to acquire weapons and the flights that may be used for terrorist actions." The existence of links between terrorists and sectors of the Arab communities in the south of Brazil was established when the intelligence services discovered that Quarai town in Rio Grande do Sul was used as a logistic base for the attack in Buenos Aires. An extremist cell was established here years ago to collect funds from the Arab communities established in Rio Grande do Sul and Parana States to finance sabotage operations against Israeli or Jewish targets in Argentina and Uruguay. ISTOE found out that weeks before the attack on the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires, the bodies of a Palestinian couple from Jordan were found inside a vehicle that went over a precipice in the town of Banhado do Taim (Rio Grande do Sul). The police found a large quantity of gold bars with the bodies. The case, at that time, was regarded as an unfortunate story of gold smuggling. It was even said that the gold belonged to the well-known dollar trader Najum Turner, who was involved in the so-called "Uruguay Operation," to cover a loan for Fernando Collor de Mello's electoral campaign. Turner, who is Jewish, was allegedly dealing with gold on the black market for Arab clients, unaware that those funds could be used to finance terrorist operations against Israel.
