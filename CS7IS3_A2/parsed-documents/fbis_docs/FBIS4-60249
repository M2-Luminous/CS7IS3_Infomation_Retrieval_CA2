The Clinton administration's foreign policy is currently under attack from all directions, mainly the Republican direction. Key officials of the previous administration -- President Bush, Defense Secretary Cheney, and Secretary of State Baker -- restrained themselves for several months. Nevertheless, with Clinton entering his second year in office and with the election season approaching -- congressional elections this year and presidential elections soon -- these former officials placed themselves at the spearhead of the onslaught on Clinton's and Christopher's hesitant and stuttering international conduct, from Korea, to Haiti, to Bosnia. Djerejian's notice that he is abandoning his post only four months after assuming it is a double blow. First, because he did not opt for a fat salary but is going to work for Christopher's negative image -- James Baker. Second, because his resignation makes one of the few areas in the world that Clinton and his aides portray as an American success -- the Arab-Israeli peace process -- look like a failure. The intrigues among the members of the team that was supposed to help Clinton and Christopher promote the process have been clearly visible for a long time. Djerejian, a former ambassador in Damascus and a Baker loyalist ever since he served as White House deputy spokesman for foreign affairs in the Reagan administration, was sidetracked despite the fact that Christopher kept him on as assistant secretary of state for Middle Eastern affairs. Dennis Ross, another aide to Baker during Bush's presidential campaign and at the State Department, survived and became closer to Christopher, at the expense of Djerejian and his no-less-competent successor Robert Pelletreau. Pelletreau decided to settle for and focus on the other half of his area of responsibility -- the Persian Gulf. Djerejian, who spent only four months in office here, decided that, since Christopher and Ross compartmentalized him out of the Israel-Syria track -- the main track of the process and his area of expertise -- there was no point in him staying on here. The resignation is regrettable because the Americans would have done better to give up on Christopher and his "peace team" than on Djerejian. The continuing weakness of the Tel Aviv Embassy started after the important years of Sam Lewis and Tom Pickering. The Bush administration sent the two Williams -- Brown and Harrop -- here. Clinton sent Brown as acting ambassador once again, and eventually sent Djerejian, but did not use him properly. Djerejian joins a list of senior defense and foreign affairs officials from the Clinton administration who resigned or were fired with a loud slam of the door: Deputy Secretary of State Wharton, Defense Secretary Aspin, defense secretary designate Inman, and Presidential Envoy to Haiti Pezzullo. The general impression is one of a crumbling administration. It is an U.S. problem, but it is also a global and mainly a regional problem because without U.S. encouragement, the peace process will be delayed for several more crucial months. It seems that Djerejian chose not to be on the failing team. This, however, is not necessarily the end of his involvement in foreign affairs in general and Israel-Arab affairs in particular: Should the Republicans return to power and Baker get a say on policies and appointments, it is reasonable to assume that Djerejian may return to a yet higher position at the State Department or on the National Security Council.
