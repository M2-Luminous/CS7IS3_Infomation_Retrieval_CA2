Valentic stressed that the Croatian Government was aware of its historic responsibility, stressing that all problems in former Yugoslavia could be solved only through negotiations. Valentic stressed that there is no alternative to negotiations, through which a settlement in the interest of both Croatia and Yugoslavia and of the Croatian and the Serb nations ought to be attained. He added that the return of refugees was of particular importance to Croatia. We should proceed step by step in negotiations. A final settlement cannot be reached immediately, Valentic said, recalling that Croatia would never agree to ceding any part of its territory. The Croatian prime minister also stressed that his government would help the work of the Bureau of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in Zagreb to a maximum degree. Knezevic said that the opening of the Bureau of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in Zagreb and the Office of the Republic of Croatia in Belgrade was an initial step in the normalization of relations. He also expressed the hope that Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic and his Yugoslav counterpart Zeljko Simic would meet soon. In response, Valentic said that certain conditions would have to be created first, one of which was the reopening of the Zagreb-Belgrade highway. Granic would travel to Belgrade on this highway. He asked Knezevic to use his influence through the Yugoslav Government so that the Serbs in Knin would continue talks with Croatian Government representatives. The Croatian prime minister reiterated a firm view that negotiations could be held only on the territory of the Republic of Croatia and nowhere else. The head of the Bureau of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in Croatia expressed his pleasure over the way he was received in Zagreb and over the working conditions, adding that the public in his country was very interested in the gradual normalization of relations with Croatia. Knezevic relayed his government's stance that Yugoslavia had no territorial claims to any part of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, outside the present-day Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. He also added that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia would agree with all the solutions achieved in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia on the basis of negotiations and in a peaceful way.
