This is timed to coincide with discussion of holding a North-South summit and with the North Korean side's pushing for a "15 August pannational meeting" as part of its united front strategy. If Hanchongnyon sends a delegation to Pyongyang, it will cause considerable disturbances to North-South relations. Hanchongnyon (chairman Kim Hyon-chun, president of General Student Association of Pusan University) on 22 June announced that "Hanchongnyon has been preparing to dispatch a delegation to North Korea for two months in compliance with the proposal of the joint secretariat in Berlin of the Pannational Alliance of Youth and Students for the Country's Reunification [Pomchonghangnyon]." Hanchongnyon also revealed that "since the atmosphere for a North-South summit has ripened recently, the decision to push for dispatching a delegation has been discussed cautiously." It was learned that Hanchongnyon has discussed in-depth the cancellation of sending its delegation to North Korea in consideration of the situation, which has changed significantly from last April, and criticism that its delegation's North Korean visit might possibly hinder the realization of a North-South summit. Hanchongnyon revealed that in the event that it finally decides to send a delegation to the North, it will dispatch Choe Chang-nam (25, co-secretary of Pomchonghangnyon and a Seoul National University student temporarily out of school) to North Korea to call for the holding of a North-South summit at an early date through talks with President Kim Il-song. As agenda items for the summit, he will propose an early settlement of the nuclear problem, methods for national reunification, and formulation of a North-South commonwealth before the reunification. Hanchongnyon is also pushing ahead with talks between Kim Hyon-chun, Hanchongnyon's chairman sought by the police, and President Kim Yong-sam, in which Kim Hyong-chu will explain positions of Hanchongnyon to the president. [passage omitted] According to material from the prosecutor's office, Pomchonghangnyon, where Choe Chang-nam is working as its co-secretary, has three headquarters, including the South side's headquarters, the North side's headquarters, and overseas headquarters. Each headquarters has a congress (composed of 200 members); central committee (25 members), and joint secretariat (5 members). The secretariat of Pomchonghangnyon is made up of Pak Song-hui and Song Yong-song, the South side's delegates who visited North Korea in 1991; Choe Kyong-chol, the North side's delegate; and Cho Son-o and Hwang Yong-chi, delegates from overseas headquarters who are living in Japan. Realizing that the Pak Song-hui--Song Yong-song team is too weak, Hanchongnyon additionally dispatched Choe Chang-nam to the secretariat. A relevant official from the prosecutor's office revealed that Pomchonghangnyon planned to hold a congress in Pyongyang from 27 to 29 May, timed with Hanchongnyon's inauguration ceremony, and to dispatch Choe Chang-nam to the North as the South side's delegate. However, in the wake of Hanchongnyon's inauguration ceremony, public law enforcement authorities blocked Hanchongnyon's contact with the North side through telephone and facsimile, and raised Hanchongnyon's nature as benefiting the enemy. As a result, there is an unfavorable attitude toward Hanchongnyon, and its congress has been postponed until 15 August. Choe Chang-nam left for Berlin without informing his parents and friends and sent a letter to his parents in Kwangju on 4 November 1993, writing that "he will grandly launch the work for national reunification," and informed them of his recent activities, writing that "he is attending an educational institute with Song Yong-sung to learn German." Hearing about his son's visit to North Korea, Kim Si-u (58), Choe's mother, said absent-mindedly that "all this would not have happened if he did not go to the college. I hope he comes home safely without visiting the North."
