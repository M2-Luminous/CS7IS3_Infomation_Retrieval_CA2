He added that if the mayors of the country's main department capitals present the respective plan, the government is willing to pay the diesel fuel price difference to prevent an increase in urban transportation fares. He said that ways are being sought to distribute in two or three days 50,000 gallons of diesel, which is consumed in the capital, to avoid the pretext to increase fares. Luna Troccoli explained that it is not exactly a subsidy because the differential payment of a few cents is a temporary measure, in view of the fact that future international fuel market prices are expected to drop. Luna said that the amount the state will cover will depend on the distribution mode and that the intention is to take advantage of the drop in the profit margin of certain distributors for diesel used for transportation. The official was asked what would happen once the price of diesel dropped to below what has been set as the reference price, and he replied that the government, logically, not only does not set the differential, but does not set the rates to allow a drop. Lastly, Luna Troccoli said that the use of state distributors has not been ruled out, but that a study of the most effective solution will be completed in the next few hours.
