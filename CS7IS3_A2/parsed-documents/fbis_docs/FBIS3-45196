Through a series of emergency intervention measures, including the macroeconomic regulation and control, the anticorruption struggle, the crackdown on criminals, and others, which were adopted in 1993, the central government has maintained social stability and economic growth. However, a number of internal structural contradictions and problems have not yet been resolved. As a result, many factors affecting social stability, such as overly rapid price rises and so on, were ready to create trouble at the end of 1993. What is more, due to the central government's repeatedly emphasizing that 1994 will be a crucial year for the "rapid advance of groups [ji tuan tu jin 7162 0957 4499 6651]" carrying out reform, the possible trend of the social situation in 1994 has attracted greater attention from people and has looked somewhat complicated and confusing. Although many factors affecting the trend of the social situation in 1994 are full of contingencies and uncertainties, the five major factors of reform, economic construction, the political situation, the public will, and the central government's authority are the most crucial ones, and are forecastable as well as understandable. 1. The acceleration of the reform process in 1994 will provide a further motive force for social and economic development, but reform will also produce a complicated impact on the trend of the social situation. The institution of a modern enterprise system and the structural reforms in prices, finance, taxation, investment, etc. will be the focal points of the "rapid advance of groups" next [as published] year. Their direct goal is to achieve the best allocation of natural resources in society. At the beginning of their being put into practice, however, they will bring about a series of social and economic consequences, some of which will emerge on the negative side. This raises the question -- discussed over the past 15 years but which has gained little attention in practice -- of the coordination [pei tao xing 6792 1152 1840] of reform. The reform of the modern enterprise system absolutely does not just involve the relationship between government administration and enterprises, the tax system, and the market, but it also involves such systems as labor and personnel, social insurance, trade unions, workers' representative conferences, as well as more sensitive social political relationships, social organizational relationships, and relevant value criteria. In this regard, we must make adequate forecasts and take corresponding technical countermeasures. Reform in such areas as commodity prices and taxation will exert strong pressure on people's tolerance when it touches the level of their daily lives. A new characteristic of changes revealed in people's tolerance has surfaced, that is, it is very difficult for people to consider increased income a guaranteed factor for the strengthening of tolerance. Many signs indicate that the general mood of the people in 1994 and the changes in their tolerance will be affected by social and economic factors, which are far more complicated than price rises, and the degree of their unpredictability is increasing. There are other meanings in the reform factors affecting the situation in society in 1994, among which the following two points are most important: 1) Will the political structural reform be suited to the economic structural reform? The economic structural reform has involved a rather deep-going level (such as the modern enterprise system, the market, and enterprise ownership and management). If the political reform remains only in the area of administrative structure in a general sense, it will entail two consequences -- reform will yield very few results (say, in solving the problem of overstaffing in organs); and the economic structural reform once again will be held back (as certain reform measures will lose shape because their practice is not guaranteed by necessary political mechanisms). 2) The political reform process with no reversal is a significant factor that will affect the trend of the social situation in 1994. Reform in the last 15 years has brought tremendous changes in the social economic foundation and structures, so a reversal would cause a loss of social economic vitality and confusion in people's minds. 2. Economic construction will enter a crucial year in 1994. Although the rapid growth that has continued for two years has brought vigor and vitality to the entire society, it has still been followed by a certain degree of confusion, disorder, and shortage of supplies. Optimizing structure and enhancing economic results should be the main theme of the economic construction in 1994. This is a correct implication. The practice of blindly pursuing high speed in disregard of a sound foundation will certainly lead to great ups and downs in the economy. The introduction of various economic structural reform plans in 1994 is a direct effort toward a healthy economy. Economic fluctuation will be a factor posing a direct threat to social stability. The prevention of great ups and downs in economic construction depends, to a considerable extent, on the appropriateness of macroeconomic policy decisions and the faithful performance of their duties by middle-level executive departments. Judging from the changes in the economic situation in the first and second halves of 1993, it was not purely an act of economic policy decisionmaking to put on the brakes (either for a soft landing or a hard landing). It had noticeable political implications, including the efforts made by the central government to stabilize the overall situation and to politically negate the orientation of expansion in localities. The problem was that various social, economic, and political mechanisms that led to the overheated economy were not removed, given the initial results scored by the macroeconomic regulation and control in 1993. This means that the social causes of the economic fluctuations will not be completely eliminated in 1994. This year, they probably will not manifest themselves in the form of expanded investment in localities, but in the form of "revising" a series of economic policies set by the central government. The economic fluctuations brought about by this will certainly lead to chaotic economic and even social order, so that the public feeling of life being unstable will be sharpened. 3. The authority of the central government will face multiple trials in 1994. Apart from the above-mentioned ability to exercise macroeconomic regulation and control, there are still two extremely crucial issues, as follows: First, whether or not the anticorruption struggle will achieve actual results will have a bearing on maintaining the public will and establishing the authority of the central government. As a result of the mass mobilization through public opinion and the initial actions taken in the second half of 1993, the anticorruption struggle has become an extremely sensitive focal point in society. Although the struggle was confronted with various difficult choices from the very outset, it enjoyed popular confidence once it gathered momentum and yielded actual results. This has covered two aspects -- whether the anticorruption struggle can be waged at the upper levels, and whether it can be conducted in localities. The progress of the struggle in various localities has been uneven, which is a fact universally acknowledged. It is anticipated that there will be little possibility of social unrest in 1994, which is directly affected by factors of the anticorruption struggle. However, various kinds of friction and conflicts triggered by the declining authority of the central government will be a hidden peril affecting social stability. Second, practicing a revenue-sharing system is a mission of priority in 1994. As viewed from the angle of intensifying the central government's ability and authority to absorb revenue, the said system should be put into practice, even though technical conditions have not entirely matured yet. As this system directly involves the redistribution of economic interests between the central government and localities, the partial interests of those localities with powerful economic strength will be lost temporarily, and whether they will accept such losses remains a question. In order to implement the above system smoothly, the central government should make adequate forecasts of various possible consequences (including the resurgence of local chauvinism, the intensification of local interests, tax pressures imposed by upper levels, and so on). On this issue, administrative, legal, and economic means should be employed simultaneously. At the present stage, however, only administrative means are the most perfect for contacts between the central and local authorities. This determines that stepping up administrative intervention sometimes cannot be avoided, which will bring forth a series of frictions and conflicts in the social, economic, and political areas. We should also note that the authority of the central government involves not only the issue of economic interest distribution with localities, but also a large number of social and political issues. For example, the central government will face the question of maintaining and strengthening this authority in the areas of investment policy, public security policy, the establishment of a unified market system, and so on. 4. Public will and opinion will become another major factor affecting the social situation in 1994. Since reform began 15 years ago, people from various quarters have come to understand, given support to, and participated in reform with unprecedentedly great enthusiasm. They have benefited a good deal from the reform achievements, as their personal development opportunities have been substantially increased, their fields of mental activities have been considerably broadened, and their means of entertainment and consumption have become diversified. In the meantime, people's tolerance has withstood continuous trials, heavier pressure has been added to their lives, and their sense of security has tended to decline. In recent years, people have acquired a much more distinct concept of interests and have had clearer feelings toward interest gains and losses. If reform and economic construction exert excessively heavy pressure -- in commodity prices in particular -- on people's daily lives in 1994, then the awareness of interest losses caused to some strata will be sharpened. In 1993, peasants' income grew slowly, the income of staff and workers was unsecured owing to the poor performance of enterprises, the living standard of retired people declined, and the reversed position of mental and physical laborers was not set right. All this has added weight to the pressures of living of considerable numbers of people, which increases the possibility of their unexpected response to particular specific economic policies. Another major characteristic of the changes in people's wills and opinions in 1994 is their concern for social affairs. For example, their expectations of the anticorruption struggle will directly affect their confidence in the justice of society and in the central government. In rural areas, the relationship between cadres and masses has been somewhat tense as a result of the disputes over peasants' burdens and other economic affairs. In urban enterprises, there have been contradictions centering around such issues as income, democratic management, and so on between managers and staff and workers. Along with the practice of the modern enterprise system in 1994, there will be new forms of expression for these contradictions. A host of facts have indicated that the work style of grass-roots cadres is at the core of the tension between cadres and staff and workers, and that its adverse impact on the people's will and opinion is no better than that of the spread of corrupt phenomena. 5. The stable political situation was the foundation for stabilizing the overall social situation in 1993. In 1994, the transfer of central power (i.e. from the second generation of the leading collective to the third generation of the leading collective) will enter a crucial period. Focused on defining the policies of reform, economic construction, and domestic and foreign affairs, this transfer has started to carry substantive content. History proves that in the variable of the political pattern in contemporary China, the issue of unity during the period of transference of power is the most difficult to tackle. Once an obstacle to unity arises, it will elicit massive personnel changes or even policy reversals, thus leading to turbulence in the social situation. During this year, a number of vital social interest relations are urgently awaiting a solution and, without a united and rational central government, it is impossible to fulfill the above missions. In particular, under the situation that the functional transformation of the central government and its subordinates, the manifestation of authority, and the ability to exercise regulation and control are confronted with many difficulties, inappropriateness in the course of transference of power will lead to disastrous consequences. At the present stage, the establishment of checking and balancing and compromise mechanisms of power within the central government is the only choice to maintain its unity and rationality. Under the condition of China's social structure at the present stage, the stability of the political situation is of particularly vital importance. However, a protracted and institutionalized stability must rely on a more flexible form of control in society, which can effectively mediate various acute social contradictions and remove factors for potential social conflict in a timely manner. Of course, a relatively long process is necessary for the establishment of this new form of control, but, if the first step is made in the area of transference of power during the crucial period, many costs can be avoided and the extent of social turbulence can be reduced. As far as 1994 is concerned, it is a historic opportunity to make decisions.
