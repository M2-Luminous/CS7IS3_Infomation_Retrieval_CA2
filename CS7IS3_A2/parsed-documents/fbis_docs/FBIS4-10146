We, Luis Sexto of the magazine BOHEMIA and Osvaldo Rodriguez of the newspaper JUVENTUD REBELDE, are going to talk about this today. Well, Luis, I think this is a subject that is out in the streets. I think that many of us -- in family gatherings and among friends -- have discussed this subject, what is for sale in certain stores within the network of stores that sell for hard currency, and about the way certain Cuban businessmen, who are seeking hard currency for the Cuban people, handle this matter. I think we should talk about this. We could delve more deeply into certain topics, and also into the intentions, but I think intentions have always been noble. As I said upon opening the program, I think a limit must be set, and that limit is to try to avoid offending the population's sensibilities. I wouldn't even say "try": the population's sensibilities simply must not be offended. [Sexto] I think, Osvaldo, that the limit has already been set, unless the news I have is false. You are referring to the fact that recently, in certain places, especially in the capital, certain medicines were being sold; in others, certain light foods, candies, sweets; even school uniforms came to be sold in certain hard currency stores. Of course this represented a huge contradiction, which was subsequently quickly caught and repudiated by the population. [Rodriguez] But you are speaking to me in the past tense. It makes it sound as if all that is over. [Sexto] Well, I understand that such a thing was not a government decision. I mean, you have to keep in mind that in this country, contrary to what some people both inside and outside the country think, power is shared. In Cuba, power is shared. But because of the cliches that have been established by propaganda, people always think that anything that happens in this country is a decision made at the highest level of government or by the [Communist] Party [of Cuba]. People do not take into account the fact that in this country, precisely, power is so widely shared, so broadly distributed, that there is enough margin for a businessman or an administrator at some store to take certain initiatives that are often not the most felicitous. I have sometimes wished, precisely, that that power were concentrated -- which does not mean centralization: wished to have a concentrated power capable of making decisions, decisions which would be obeyed, complied with, by everyone at once. Now, I understand that when the government learned about these things, the situation returned to normal and such sales were prohibited, disallowed. [Rodriguez] Well, yes, I think so. I believe you have mentioned a number of cases that were prohibited. And, well, I am thinking particulary about the sweet snacks for children, and certain essential medicines that were being sold for hard currency, but did not, at that particular moment, exist in the hospitals or the pharmacies of the people's network. However, I think there are other things that do a lot of damage to that image as well, and that contrary to what we meant to do -- give businessmen some autonomy -- we are realizing that certain businessmen, when given autonomy, do not know what to do with it, and begin taking initiatives that are irritating. In principle, we defend autonomy, and could discuss this in another program. We would have to draw the conclusion that ... [rephrases] in my opinion, the efficiency of our economy entails autonomy on the part of the enterprises in the economic sphere, to be precise. [Sexto] I agree. [Rodriguez] That's on the one hand. Now, I think that when our businessmen and administrators are given autonomy and don't know what to do with it, it is because they are still suffering the influence of a bureaucratic mentality to the maximum. It seems to me that the other day -- last week, if my memory serves me right -- Renato Recio touched on the subject of bureaucracy and the bureaucratic mentality on this very program. He reached the conclusion that bureacracy means losing sight of the end goal. As I was saying just a few moments ago, recalling Comrade Renato Recio: When a process has lost sight of its end goal, it has become bureaucratized. That means that its entire point has been lost, that the thing is being done for no reason at all. It is at that point that the purpose for which that action was created, founded, begun is forgotten, and the action gets so far off course that everything becomes distorted, and the man carrying out that action no longer knows when he is taking proper action and when he is taking improper action -- despite the fact that he may have the best of intentions. We could also talk about up to what point those intentions already... [rephrases] are good intentions. Well, intentions are intentions. It is said that the road to Hell is paved with good intentions. [Sexto] Indeed, with good intentions. Now, I want to tell you that, regardless of how flexible the economy and economic and political management in this country may become, and regardless of how much autonomy we may be able to give our institutions and enterprises, we must never allow ourselves to cease acting as political beings. The society, this particular society, this regime, the socialist regime -- at least the kind of socialism we in this country want to build -- can never be separated from the political vision of those who lead it. I mean: I cannot round up hard currency at any cost. I have... [rephrases] the country needs to round up hard currency. Indeed, the country has needed... [rephrases] very clearly, it has taken initiatives that, although... [rephrases] These initiatives may have bothered us in the beginning because we saw or anticipated that certain inequalities could arise. We could also see, however, that they were necessary, that the nation was (?sunken) in an extremely critical situation and needed to make bold decisions that could alleviate our situation. I think time has shown that the decision taken has been the right one. Decriminalizing hard currency has helped, somewhat, to alleviate certain tensions in the country. Now of course we must not lose sight of the fact that no management decision, administrative decision, can be allowed to aggravate the possible irritation over the fact that some people have access to hard currency while others do not. I mean that must not be allowed to be an ostensibly hurtful act. Of course, we cannot sell a medicine [for hard currency] because medicine is a political product. We cannot sell a medicine in one place for Cubans who possess hard currency and not sell it in a pharmacy where it can be bought in Cuban pesos. [Rodriguez] We must remind listeners that among the pillars, one of the major foundations of this Revolution is public health. Even under today's critical conditions, while it does have deficiencies, public health is still free to the population, and no one has yet died... [rephrases] there is not a single person who can say: A hospital has failed to provide care for me. [Sexto] Indeed. Look, because of its social import, its human import, medicine is an eminently political product -- in addition to everything else that it is, which I am not going to get into defining here. [Rodriguez] Of course. [Sexto] And whoever sells medicine has to keep in mind, above all, its political implications. It would be... [rephrases] I think it is unjust from the very foundation for us to allow the absence of a medicine on the national currency market, but allow it on the hard currency market. [Rodriguez] Especially those medicines... [rephrases] for example, asthma medicines. I remember that that was one of the cases most talked about -- the fact that there was a spray [preceding word in English] for asthma on certain markets. And asthmatic people, at a period when... [rephrases] Everyone knows that this time of year, winter, with its constant cold fronts, is a time when asthma sufferers experience many attacks. Asthma sufferers did not have that medicine available to them -- and I think that was a very serious mistake on the part of whoever made that decision. I think that, as you say, it was probably some administrator, maybe some director of one of the many enterprises supplying this network of stores, because no single enterprise does it. Several enterprises service this network of stores. [Sexto] Osvaldo, in order to avoid becoming bureaucratic, to avoid repeating hollow, harmful schemes, the first thing an official has to do is not lose sight of the social purpose of all his actions -- at least in our society. [Rodriguez] Of course. [Sexto] I mean: Why do I want to round up hard currency? What goal am I pursuing (?in rounding up) hard currency? The end established in this country, of course, is a noble one, a noble end. [Rodriguez] We -- Luis Sexto, of BOHEMIA, and Osvaldo Rodriguez of JUVENTUD REBELDE -- are discussing the matter of rounding up hard currency inside Cuba. We have already established the limit: not to offend the population's sensibilities. [Sexto] Indeed, that is the basic boundary. How far should the manager's, administrator's, action go? To what extent can management, or commercial flexibility and initiative be positive? At what point does it begin to be negative? At what point does it become impolitic? At what point does it begin to cause irritation on the part of our citizens because of the shortages they are already being affected by? [Rodriguez] Of course this -- all these attitudes -- is also to a certain extent related to the so-called depoliticizing of the economy. I think that yes, one can to a certain extent speak of economics alone, without relation to politics. When those economics are put into practice, however... [rephrases] I mean: You can talk about ideas, and about economic laws that operate independently of will or of the social system. However, when you go looking for that economy's end goal, that is when politics merges with economics, and that is where these businessmen have to act, taking into account not only economic ideas -- the ideas of businessmen -- but also political ideas. [Sexto] I think what you are saying is obvious: In a society based on social justice -- that is, equitable distribution of wealth and a standard of security for all -- indidputably, for the majority of the population, economics can never be divorced from politics. I think that is one of the many taboos that have arisen recently in certain places in the world; and, in fact, we already know where such a divorce -- that artificial divorce between economics and politics -- is leading. Socialist societies are profoundly humane societies, and in my opinion, politics is nothing more than the art of getting human beings to live together in harmony. Therefore, we cannot forget the political implications of all our economic actions. That is what I am talking about, Osvaldo. However, I think that we also have to talk about other things here, in the few moments left to us. I think there are many Cubans who indeed may have hard currency available to them today, for one reason or another. But I also think that those Cubans who today have access to -- or rather, the right to use -- that hard currency must try to be very careful not to offend the sensibilities of their fellow citizens, because that problem too is occurring. We are not going to criticize, here on our program, only officials who, by making certain decisions, have made a mistake. I think that this society must also seek harmony on the basis of us, ourselves, on the basis of each and every one of its members. I know, for example, of schools where compared to the snack of a child whose family receives hard currency, the snack of a child whose family doesn't, is awful. I mean: Although we have had to accept these relationships because of the situation, because of the circumstances, let us at least not make them worse by using... [rephrases] vanities that are, in the last analysis, puerile vanities, vanities that try to create artificial differences. In the last analysis, this country was founded for us all, and we must all contribute our share so we can manage to live together in social harmony. I believe -- and continue to repeat -- that at the present time, morality is far more important than under any other circumstances. In times of crisis, morality is fundamental. And that is what I am talking about right now, Osvaldo. I am saying that we must try not to be ostentatious. [Rodriguez] To avoid offending the sensibilities of the population -- that is the boundary to keep in mind in rounding up hard currency inside Cuba. I think that we have spoken out quite clearly on this matter, Luis Sexto of the magazine BOHEMIA and I, Osvaldo Rodriguez of JUVENTUD REBELDE. Luis, all that is left for us to say to our listeners is that we should continue talking about this subject. I don't think we have exhausted this topic here. We could discuss it further in later programs.
