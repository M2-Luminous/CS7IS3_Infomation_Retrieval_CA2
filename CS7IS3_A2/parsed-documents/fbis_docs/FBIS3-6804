They are escaping from North Korea, individually or in family groups, to take refuge in China. Sometimes the number of escapees reaches dozens per day. They cross the border suffering from unbearable hunger, and they seek freedom. In China, however, they do not find the freedom they sought or even a comfortable place to rest. Most of them are captured, taken back to North Korea, and executed. Reporter Pak Son-kyu of the mobile news coverage department has this report: [Male escapee] I escaped to China about two months ago. Hiding in the daytime, I came to an area near the border to determine when the guard change took place. I decided that 0630 would be the most suitable time for my escape and crossed the Yalu River by way of Huchang. [Reporter Pak Son-kyu] Desiring freedom and food, they flee, risking their lives. The area you see behind me is Tumen in Yanbian. Further in the distance is Namyang in North Korea. The escapees from North Korea find their way into China via border towns like Tumen. The number of escapees living scattered in various areas of China is reported to be around 2,000. In Dalian, a port area, some 800 of them are living in hiding. A considerable number of them are living scattered about northeastern China in such places as Yanji, Hunchun, and Dandong, according to the escapees and the residents of these areas. Escapees began coming to China about 10 years ago. Their numbers started to increase some three years ago, and beginning last October, the influx became even heavier, with representation from more walks of life, the residents say. [Unidentified Tumen resident] Many are coming. When the Tumen River is frozen, the escapees come in family groups. There are senior cadre members among them. [Reporter Pak] How are the escapees living in China? This shabby office room on the outskirts of Yanji is where two escapees lived in hiding until recently. The owner of this office, who gave them a hiding place at the risk of banishment, had to put them out recently. [Office owner] I urged them to learn Chinese, but it was not easy for them. Therefore, people could easily tell they were from North Korea. So they had to leave. If they could stay without being noticed by the neighbors, they would not have to leave. But since this was not possible, they were restless and I was restless. [Reporter Pak] So they had to leave here after all, and no one knows their whereabouts. Most of the escapees would prefer to seek asylum in the ROK or a third country rather than to live in China, which is ready to arrest them and hand them over to North Korea, under an agreement with that country, instead of protecting them. The escapees seek assistance from the ROK Embassy through various channels, but few manage to get help. [Unidentified escapee] When we visited the ROK Embassy, we were certain that they would receive us with compatriotic love. But the reality was to the contrary. We do not think them cold -- they may be bound by some limitations. [Reporter Pak] The reason the ROK Government is not actively dealing with this problem is that it wants to avoid adverse effects on inter-Korean relations and adverse influences on our relations with the Chinese Government. For this reason, the escapees have to live in hiding in China. However, under the watchful eye of the Chinese public security authorities, they find it very difficult to find a place to live in seclusion. The reason for this is that North Korean nationals living in China, commonly called chogyo, are making desperate efforts to find them. There are some 2,000 chogyo in the Yanbian area alone. [Male escapee] There is a chogyo committee in Yanji. There are many of them in various places in China. There is one in every town, including Heilongjiang. The escapees are arrested because of chogyos. Many a poor compatriot was arrested in China and taken away because of these chaps. [Reporter Pak] For this reason, the escapees, not knowing what to do, are in imminent danger. In this process, many of them are arrested and taken away. [Unidentified North Korean residing in China] We have heard that many of them have been arrested. [Unidentified witness] I saw a woman being taken away. She resisted so hard that most of her hair was pulled from her scalp. She said that she would rather die than be taken back to North Korea. Although she would be killed in North Korea anyway, she would rather die right there in China than in North Korea. She was very tough. [Reporter Pak] Because they know how painful it would be to be taken away and cruelly executed in North Korea, the escapees feel all the more miserable. [Unidentified escapee] This is rat poison. I would much rather kill myself than be arrested. [Reporter Pak] Taking advantage of the escapees' urgent plight, there are criminal gangs that use them to smuggle goods in exchange for providing a hiding place for them. There are also impostors who cheat the escapees out of their money. [Unidentified escapee] I can hardly sustain myself in China any longer. They cheated me out of 3,500 won. I got this money with the help of an ROK man. The impostor cheated me, saying he would give me a permit to reside in China. [Reporter Pak] In some port areas, like Dalian, there are organizations that let escapees board ocean-going vessels to travel overseas. For this, they charge 10,000 Chinese yuan, about 1 million ROK won. Some Chinese residents and Korean residents in China extend a helping hand to them out of compassion, but the risk is too great for them to do so as much as they wish. [Reporter Pak] I am now standing on the Tumen River which forms the border between China and North Korea. As you see, the entire river is frozen hard. Only 20 percent of those who attempt to escape succeed. The remaining 80 percent are captured and executed, the escapees testify. Some 2,000 escapees will have to live in endless, cautious seclusion even if they cross the border. And others are waiting for an opportunity, which may or may not come, to cross the border for freedom and food. Will there be no humanitarian measures to relieve them of their pain?
