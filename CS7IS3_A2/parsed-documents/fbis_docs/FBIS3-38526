New names from various sectors are joining it. Is this real change or is it just for show? [Erbakan] This is called development. While on its way to becoming the party that will come to power on its own, and since its basic principle is to embrace the 60 million people in this country without discrimination and to bring them happiness, this embrace is beginning to cover all the sectors of the nation. Not only do we embrace them, but we include them in our party and work together. Our main principle remains the same: While the other, West-imitating parties hold force to be supreme, just as the West does, we hold God to be supreme. Those who join us, therefore, believe in this principle. [Dundar] Yet some of the people who join your party have nothing to do with God. It is as if they are doing this for publicity purposes. [Erbakan] The door to repentance is always open. Every person can make mistakes; however, every person has enough common sense to see God. [passage omitted] [Dundar] Former U.S. Ambassador in Ankara Abrahamowitz recently said that the Prosperity Party [PP] could come to power if it were led by a younger, more moderate leader. As you know, when the United States speaks about something, it usually turns out to be not so auspicious. [laughs] How do you feel about that? [Erbakan] You know what Ali Pasha used to say: If he wanted to find out the truth, he would go ask the Russian ambassador. The truth would be exactly the opposite of what the ambassador said. Now the world has changed. It is not Russia but the United States that is filling this role. So that is how we should relate to this. [laughs] [Birand] The most important thing on Turkey's agenda is the southeast. Your approach to the Kurdish problem differs from the other parties. You are more moderate. You are not opposed to the use of the Kurdish language, for example. Your campaign is: Either the PP or terrorism in the southeast. Democratic Left Party leader Bulent Ecevit is critical of your policy regarding this issue. [Erbakan] The PP and the southeast -- that is an important issue. Ecevit is not important. Let us put him aside. All the parties are trying to discredit the PP today. Ecevit harps on this issue. He has published certain things which were found in his party offices. We are suing him. The PP is the party that strives for the happiness of the 60 million people in this country -- in fact, of 6 billion people. Approximately 60 million brothers live in this country. We have lived as brothers -- in fact, as one body -- for 1,400 years. The country reached its current situation as a result of the wrong policies of the West-imitating parties. [passage omitted] [Birand] You are saying that you have a different policy toward the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan]. [Erbakan] We do not have a policy toward the PKK. The PKK is not important to us. There are 60 million people in this country. We want to bring all of them peace, freedom, prosperity, dignity, and self-respect. To achieve this, we must first stop being the satellites of foreign forces. It is impossible to have Poised Hammer imposed on us on one hand and to prevent terrorism on the other. [Birand] You mean you will first get rid of Poised Hammer? [Erbakan] Of course. We will send it back where it came from. Are we a colony? What is this? What is a foreign power doing in our land? Then, of course, we will lift the embargo against brotherly Iraq. Why should we continue to paralyze the economy of southeastern Anatolia? All these things, of course, are details. Our real mission is to give the 60 million people in this country a sense of love and brotherhood. [Birand] All this is very abstract. [Erbakan] That is not true. When a Muslim from Turkey who goes on Haj meets a Muslim from Uganda, he feels an affinity and a sympathy for him. The Muslim religion is such a tie. We have lived with this tie for 1,400 years. If you break this tie, the real tie, then foreign forces can divide you easily. That is why the tie of religion should never be neglected; its development should not be prevented; it should be encouraged, even revived. Faith is the strongest tie that connects a country to itself. [Birand] I want to go back to a previous question. You say either the PP or terrorism in the southeast. Also, only the PP can work and produce candidates in the southeast, none of the other parties can. How is this possible? [Erbakan] The PP used to be the strongest party in the southeast before the terrorist incidents flared up. Now, the PP is stronger in the whole country. From being the largest party it is moving toward becoming the only party. The same situation is also true in the southeast. Our brothers in the southeast can also see the reality. They all want to be our citizens, and for the country to be united. Being a citizen of a dignified 60 million strong Turkey will bring happiness to everyone. They have things they complain about: They claim that they have been treated as second class citizens, that their economic development has been neglected, and that their human rights have not been recognized. Their human rights should have been recognized. [Birand] What about the PKK? [Erbakan] The PKK is a tool of outside forces. Outside forces are using it to create trouble in the area. The PKK is merely a tool of exclusively Western forces. [Birand] Why does it not hurt the PP then? [Erbakan] The PKK declared us its greatest enemy. [Birand] Of course, but it is not doing anything to your candidates. [Erbakan] The people there love us. The people are with us. The PP is therefore open and can announce its candidates. The PKK is afraid of the people and is trying to bring the people to its side against the government. However, the people are on our side. [Dundar] There is also Hizbullah. It is also based on religious faith. How do you view that organization? [Erbakan] Some stories are being concocted. Nobody knows the truth behind this organization. The way we view it is that certain elements create trouble among our people in the southeast. As you know, we want peace, brotherhood, peace of mind, unity, and solidarity. [Dundar] Is it possible that the Hizbullah is a continuation of the (gladio)? [Erbakan] It is possible, because certain very suspicious persons are among them. It is unbelieve the things that happen there. As you know, we have many deputies in the southeast, and a PP southeastern committee. We study the developments in the region in great detail. Certain unbelievable things are happening there. Certain CIA agents and provocateurs go there and do certain things, sometimes even under the guise of the state, and cause the people to move away from the state. The agents of all the foreign forces.... [pauses] Didn't the former governor of the state of emergency region say that the place is full of CIA agents? [Birand] What is the conclusion we should be drawing from your statements? You are saying that you do not like the approach of the current government to the southeast problem. Is that what you mean? Mainly the security issue is being dealt with. [Erbakan] They know nothing but violence. This is the first issue. Secondly, there is the issue of materialism. They claim to be brothers but the foundations of this brotherhood do not exist. They are only paying lip service. [Birand] When you come to power.... [Erbakan, interrupting] When we come to power all the citizens in Turkey will actually feel the bonds of brotherhood. We are the symbol of brotherhood. [Birand] Will the PKK feel these bonds of brotherhood as well? [Erbakan] The PKK is an outside factor. The actual factor is the people and the people are with us. We will definitely wage a much more effective struggle against those who come and kill our innocent children of this region. When we come to power, however, they will not be able to base themselves in the region and they will disappear. [Dundar] You are trying to say that you will be replacing the Turkish-Kurdish conflict with Islamic unity. [Erbakan] We will have bonds of brotherhood. There is nothing more absurd than ethnic differentiation among Muslim brothers. [Birand] In the past you would not visit the Ataturk Mausoleum. You, especially your party, would not refer to Ataturk. Now you claim that were Ataturk alive he would prefer your party. What has changed? [Erbakan] Now the parties that imitate the West are only exploiting Ataturk. We are only disarming them. None of these parties actually abide by the principles of Ataturk. We have pointed this out repeatedly. Let us have a look at the first years of the republic. Were we trying to borrow from other countries or were we more interested in being self reliant and building our own industry? What is this? This is the national view. It is the PP program. Did we go and beg the West or did we pursue a dignified foreign policy? In other words, the PP policies were carefully applied during the first years of the republic. Only afterwards did the imitators of the West come on the scene and degenerate everything. Now they are knocking on the doors of the West and begging. [passage omitted] Now let us discuss the issue of laicism. There cannot be an Ataturkist laicism or any other kind of laicism based on someone else's views. This is a foreign word. We have always said that. There is an unprecedented contradiction in our current constitution. On the one hand it states that the official language is Turkish and on the other it has foreign words. We should be suspicious of it. What is the intention of those who want to preserve this? Now let us leave the issue of intention aside and let us deal with the scientific aspect. There are close to 200 countries in the world. We have analyzed the constitutions of all these countries and have presented a paper on the issue to the Assembly chairman. Only two of these countries use the word laicism in their constitutions, namely France and Turkey. No other country uses this word. More than half of these countries state their official religion in their constitutions. For example, the British constitution states that the official religion is the Anglican Church. [passage omitted] All countries do that with the exception of Turkey. Laicism is based on three fundamental principles. The first one is that there is the freedom of belief. The second one states that one cannot resort to force to impose his beliefs on others. There should be tolerance and views should be expressed in an atmosphere of tranquillity. The third principle notes that the church administration will not interfere with the state administration. This is a reaction to the Middle Ages when the church remained in power for a long time in Western countries. It is stated that the church administration will not interfere in the state administration and vice versa. This is a delicate differentiation. It does not say that religion and the state are separate. [passage omitted] [Birand] There has been a very interesting development. There has been a rapprochement between the PP and the Alawites. You have even had contacts with Prof. Izzettin Dogan. There has been talk of cooperation, mutual support in various municipalities. The Alawites have reacted to this cooperation. The Sivas incidents have not yet been forgotten. Can you explain this rapprochement? How far will it go? [Erbakan] Let me first refer to the Sivas incidents. Those incidents were the ploy of foreign forces aimed at creating an Alawite-Sunni conflict. [passage omitted] Our Alawite brothers are Muslims. We believe in the same God, the same Prophet and the Koran. Sectarian differences are just details. We should, therefore, not become the tools of foreign forces in their efforts to create an Alawite-Sunni rift. The PP is against the Turkish-Kurdish rift. The PP has the ideology to create the bonds of brotherhood among our 60 million citizens. It also has the ideology to eliminate the Alawite-Sunni rift. [Dundar] What kind of a cooperation is being envisaged? [Erbakan] In a symbolic ceremony held last week, we accepted 200 Alawite brothers as members of our party. Certain persons with ulterior motives have been waging this propaganda for years now. Now our Alawite citizens are asking themselves. They are saying: We have, for years, been voting for the SDPP [Social Democratic Populist Party]. What have we achieved? Are we still not hungry? Are we not oppressed? Having seen these realities they now see salvation in the PP just as the 60 million citizens of our country. [Dundar] How will you cooperate? [Erbakan] No doubt, in regions where there is a large Alawite population we will ask them who they want to nominate for the municipal elections. We will ask them to nominate their own candidates. Of course, the work to be carried out will be in line with our principles. What does this mean? It means the equal treatment of all. It means the recognition of human rights for everyone. [Birand] So long as they abide by your principles. [Erbakan] They are not our principles alone they are the principles of all humanity. We do not have special principles. As I stated earlier, we advocate equal treatment of all, bonds of brotherhood for all. [Dundar] In an interview with a daily you were quoted as saying that it is not difficult to come to power but that what frightens you is to come to power and be impotent. What do you mean by that? [Erbakan] There are many institutes of strategy in the United States. These institutes conduct research in line with their own basic plans. Many people we know there send us reports on this research. They say that most of the institutes there regret their research. In other words, they brought about revolutions in certain Muslim countries and these revolutions have not brought any happiness to the people. They had to foot the bill for these revolutions. One can cite Algeria. The revolutions in Turkey were also greatly influenced by them. It is not important whether those who made the revolutions are aware of it. [Dundar] You are saying that they were used? [Erbakan] Of course, they were used. We have repeatedly stated this. They are the directors. They prepare the ground and then they push the button. Those who make the revolutions are not aware of what they are doing. None of the problems are solved. Realizing this U.S. interference and involvement the people become furious. This has been confirmed. Now they propose to do it differently. They propose not to interfere in the elections. Let the people elect whomever they choose. If the elected administration does not suit them, if it does not fit in with their exploitation and world supremacy, if an administration favoring equality, independence, peace, tranquility, and justice instead of force is elected then they will try and render that administration unsuccessful. [Dundar] Then they are no longer in favor of coups. [Erbakan] That is true. They prefer to cause that administration to fail. [Birand] That is not what they did in Algeria. [Erbakan] And what happened there? There is no tranquillity. Algeria will revert to its former situation. They realize that this is not a solution. Now they are trying to devise new methods. I would like to refer to an important point. I allocated a significant section to this point in our party congress. They might think that the PP will come to power. I am sure that when we come to power they will be revising their policies. Why? Because the PP is not against anyone. We are not prejudiced against any country. We want happiness for the 6 billion people of this world. We want good relations with everyone. We will be establishing these good ties. For example, the United States will change its stand towards Turkey. How will it change? Instead of giving orders over the phone it will show us the respect befitting a country that is the leader and nucleus of the new world. [passage omitted] [end recording]
