When one-half the specified number of fruit in a sample results in a number ending with one-half a fruit, the smaller full number of fruit shall be used to determine the sample weight. If a sample fails with respect to minimum size requirements on the basis of an 8-pound sample, a 16-pound sample shall be used to determine if the fruit meets the minimum size requirements.
