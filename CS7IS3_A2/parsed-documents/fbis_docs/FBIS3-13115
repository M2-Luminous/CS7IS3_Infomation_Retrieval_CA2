I am honored to convey to you and through you to all strugglers of our great party and all Arab strugglers wherever they are, the congratulations of the leader of the victorious march of party and people, comrade struggler President Hafiz al-Asad [applause], secretary general of the ASBP and president of the Syrian Arab Republic. I also convey his greetings and wishes for further success in our steady militant march toward the achievement of the objectives of the party and masses, represented by unity, freedom, and socialism [applause]. I also convey to you the congratulations of the command of our great party, the initiator and leader of the revolution, and its greetings and warm wishes on this cherished occasion. [passage omitted] A simple comparison between Syria now and Syria before the revolution provides clear evidence of the great miracle that the revolution has achieved after the Corrective Movement and under the leadership and guidance of great leader Hafiz al-Asad [applause]. Achievements surround us everywhere we look, and they are constantly increasing, complementing each other in quality and quantity. These achievements speak for themselves, and show that the Syria of the revolution, the Syria of al-Asad, is no longer a backward, marginal country, but a modern state and a society that is firmly proceeding toward further progress and prosperity. [passage omitted] All this has established a solid basis for political stability and security that is considered an exception in a tense region and a turbulent world that has recently been shaken by major events. This stability has contributed to the consolidation of a major, ambitious development process within the framework of a multi-sector economic system based on cooperation and participation within the state's plan. This plan is aimed at ensuring the country's progress and advancement within the instructions of the ASBP to build a new society. It will be a society based on equality and the eradication of exploitation, poverty, illiteracy, and diseases by improving the people's living standards and by increasing the state's capabilities on the basis of self-reliance. In this brief address, we cannot cover all of last year's indications of growth. However, we will run through some of them to show the continuity of the battle for an advanced society. Comrades, we notice that in less than one year the production and distribution of electricity has stabilized. This has been a great qualitative success that could not have been realized had it not been for the direct instructions of the leader of the homeland, comrade struggler President Hafiz al-Asad [applause]. Last year's economic growth rates registered satisfactory figures and showed steady development in qualitative and quantitative progress. If we take the gross national production [GNP] as the most comprehensive indication, we find that in comparison with 1992, the GNP grew at a rate of 17.5 percent in 1993 in current prices. This growth rate becomes 10 percent if it is measured with fixed prices. This is a high and satisfactory rate. In the same context, all sectors have registered good growth rates. The agricultural sector has registered a growth rate of 17 percent, which signifies the importance of the revolution's strategy promoting the agricultural sector through enhancing the process of building the infrastructure of this sector and applying appropriate pricing policies that do justice to the human effort and encourage production. As for the mineral and manufacturing industries sector, a growth rate of 4 percent has been registered. The service sector registered a growth rate of 22 percent. This helps raise citizens' living standards through the various general services that are offered to them for free. Among the very positive phenomena that has been noted has been the rise in total investment capital by approximately 9 percent. This capital's contribution to the GNP has risen from 7 percent, versus 93 percent of the final consumption, in 1992 to 13 percent, versus 87 percent of the final consumption, in 1993. In view of the measures that have been taken to boost economic plurality, promote individual initiatives, and encourage citizens to invest their funds in economic activities, total private capital has risen from 57 billion Syrian pounds in 1992 to 86 billion Syrian pounds in 1993. Perhaps what was most conspicuous last year was the increase in goods production, which constitutes a source of market value in the economy. Improvements in the mechanisms and volume of economic trade with the world have taken place. Positive qualitative developments have taken place through the codification of economic cooperation with some sisterly countries, such as Lebanon, Egypt and Saudi Arabia. Stable and developed formulas for this cooperation have been agreed upon. This cooperation falls within the framework of a comprehensive economic Arab integration, which is in the interest of all Arabs. But, the major changes and achievements under the revolution in all sectors and throughout Syria and its governorates do not constitute the final picture of what we plan to achieve. Nor do they represent all our aspirations. Rather, they are steps along the road ahead of us within the limits of available resources. They provide an incentive for continuing the process of work and construction to arrive at our final goals. The past few years have not been void of difficulties. Throughout the years of the revolution, we have faced difficulties and obstacles of various types. We have managed to overcome many of them, and we will overcome all difficulties that will face us in the future. We are optimistic and hopeful. We are determined and resolved to continue the march until we arrive at our pan-Arab objectives and defeat all the obstacles along this road. Comrades, brother citizens: The Arab Socialist Ba'th Party believes that the Arabs have no existence outside their pan-Arab entity. It is a pan-Arab party in ideology, practice, and organization. This is why it has put unity at the head of its objectives and given it first priority, considering it the most sublime objective of the contemporary struggle and the common denominator of all Arabs. All the events and developments on the pan-Arab and world level prove that the Arabs will never be able to play their role in full in the march of world civilization unless they are able to achieve comprehensive unity. Unity is one of their rights as a nation. It is also their duty as messengers of a humanitarian civilization that has lit the darkness of history at several stages. Comrades, the March Revolution took the objective of unity as a model that guides all its actions in the pan-Arab arena. Since the Corrective Movement, the hero of the Corrective Movement, leader struggler President Hafiz al-Asad [applause] has been exerting every effort to urge the Arabs to close their ranks and to entrench their solidarity, even at its minimum level, especially since Arab solidarity reduces the possibility for pan-Arab tragedies such as the Iraq-Iran war, the Iraqi regime's occupation of Kuwait, and other tragedies and crises. Solidarity enables the Arabs to achieve their transitional objectives, liberate their land, restore their rights, and reinforce their position in the world. Arab solidarity also creates a positive atmosphere that paves the way for the promotion of comprehensive cooperation among Arabs, that allows them to make large strides toward their comprehensive unity, and that allows the establishment of unity between two or more of the Arab states that are ready to do so. The Yemeni unity experiment has delighted the Arabs who aspire for unity. However, the difficulties and crises that have recently afflicted this unity have created a wave of frustration and pain for the sons of the Yemeni people and for all Arabs. They have all called on the Yemeni leadership to work to overcome the current crisis, reactivate joint institutions, entrench democracy, and to meet the people's demands to safeguard unity and bolster its march. [passage omitted] O comrades; O brothers; O masses of our militant nation: Since its inception, the Ba'th Party has been known as Palestine's party. Likewise, since its inception, the revolution has viewed the Arab-Zionist conflict as a top priority, given that it is the paramount issue concerning all Arabs, from the Atlantic Ocean to the Arabian Gulf. Syria has been making dear sacrifices and spending a great deal of its revenue to confront the continuous Israeli aggression, defend the Arabs' pan-Arab rights, and liberate their occupied territories. It is working with all fraternal Arabs to mobilize their potential and unify their positions to settle the conflict in a manner that will ensure the restoration of Arab territories and rights, and that will also result in a just and comprehensive peace in the region--a decent and honorable peace that will be enjoyed by all, and that will allow the countries and peoples of the region to live free from aggressions, expansionist policies, and domination. Thanks to this pan-Arab understanding of the Arab-Israeli conflict, Syria's pan-Arab role has grown immensely. Syria now speaks on behalf of all Arabs. As for its leader, struggler President Hafiz al-Asad, [applause] he is meeting the leaders of the big powers on behalf of all Arabs. Likewise, they hold talks with him in this capacity. This confirms that Syria's pan-Arab role now enjoys the recognition of everyone in the region and the world at large. The peace process was unleashed more than two years ago to serve as a vehicle to achieve a clear objective, namely, a comprehensive and just peace that will return the territories and rights to their Arab owners and consecrate security and stability in the region. Syria has taken part in this process on the basis of this formula. Syria's participation was instrumental in paving the way for the peace process. Under no circumstances will Syria accept any distortion of the Madrid formula, or any deviation from this formula. This is because it is impossible to achieve peace unless it is based on the essence, foundations, principles, and objectives of this process, which constitute an embodiment of international legitimacy. The honoring of the essence, foundations, principles, and objectives of this process must result in the implementation of the resolutions of international legitimacy. Since the convocation of the Madrid conference, Israel, which was compelled to enter the peace process in the first place, has used various means to obstruct this process. That is why it decided to torpedo it from within. It has made several attempts to achieve this objective. It started with procrastination, with a failure to discuss substantive issues, and with an attempt to render the Washington talks devoid of any meaningful content to turn them into a marginal and insignificant parley in the hope that it will buy time to promote its expansionist objectives. Faced with these attempts, Syria has underlined its adherence to the principles and bases of the peace process. Similarly, it has underscored coordination with the Arab sides, given that this coordination is conducive to Arab strength and cohesion. This time, Israel sought to strike at inter-Arab coordination and weaken the Arab sides by dealing with them one at a time and offering them fragile, separate, and partial solutions, which are designed to achieve Israel's expansionist ambitions, circumvent the bases of the peace process, and wriggle out of its obligations as enshrined in the relevant international resolutions, as the course of events has shown. Nonetheless, Syria has confronted Israel's attempts to deal with the Arab sides one at a time and isolate Syria in preparation for nullifying its pioneering pan-Arab role in the peace process. It is true that Israel has managed to conclude a unilateral deal with the Palestinians. However, Syria has striven to enhance coordination with the Arab parties to the Washington talks, particularly fraternal Lebanon, because coordination and joint action are necessary if the Arabs are to regain their rights. Syria's efforts in confronting the Israeli maneuvers were crowned with great success. This was clearly manifested in the Geneva summit between struggler President Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. President Clinton. Observers were unanimous in describing this summit as the most important event in both the Middle East and the international arenas, saying it was a summit between the leader of a great nation, the Arab nation, and the leader of the most powerful state in the world. It was the summit between equals and the summit that restated Arab rights and Arab constants. The summit effectively reconfirmed that the solution, a just and comprehensive peace, must be based on the Madrid formula and the implementation of international legitimacy resolutions 242, 338, and 425. In Geneva, President al-Asad said: I do not differentiate between the Golan and southern Lebanon, between what is occupied from Palestine or Jordan. When I ask for one part I ask for the whole. This is elementary because, to me, they all constitute the same Arab land. Within this pan-Arab concept lies the secret of the success of his Excellency President Hafiz al-Asad and the failure of separate solutions to settle the conflict. Faced with this success scored by Syria's pan-Arab policy, Israel found itself cornered and unable to maneuver. That's why it carried out a concentrated media campaign before and after the Geneva summit to minimize the importance of this summit and to try to marginalize its results. It did so in an attempt to obstruct the peace process and hamper the U.S. role, which moved, though a bit late, to push the peace process ahead and render it a success after the Geneva summit. After the failure of all these attempts, Israel returned to its aggressive nature. It escalated its systematic terrorist operations, starting with the escalation of its operations in southern Lebanon. It then perpetrated its odious crime in the blessed Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron, a crime that is unequaled in atrocity, ugliness, and the flouting of human values and international laws and norms. This crime brings back to mind the picture of Israeli terrorism in all its vilest forms, particularly since Israel's stamp appeared in another terrorist crime, the explosion at the Sayyidat al-Najah in Beirut, simply to divert the world's attention from the Ibrahimi mosque crime and to try to return Lebanon to a whirlpool of violence and internecine fighting. The international reaction to these Israeli crimes has not gone beyond condemnation. In order to tackle these actions and confront Israel's scorn for human life, the condemnations and denunciations must be linked to specific deterring actions taken under the aegis of the United Nations and international law. Comrades, we notice that the more the Israeli repression in the occupied territories intensifies, the more the heroic intifadah escalates, the more brave the heroic intifadah becomes, the more the Palestinian struggle in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip intensifies, and the more the steadfastness of the kinsfolk in the Golan and the resistance of our people in southern Lebanon increases. Israel's odious crimes confirm that the settlement issue, which represents the direct and specific features of Israel's expansionism and aggression, stands as a basic and important obstacle in the face of the peace process. It also violates international laws and norms because it entails geographic and demographic changes in the occupied territories. Thus, it is imperative to tackle the issue of settlements and view it as a focal point of the peace process. [passage omitted]
