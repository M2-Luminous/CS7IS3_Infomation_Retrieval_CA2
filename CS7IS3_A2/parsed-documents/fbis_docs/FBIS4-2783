"Under the project, 8 million to 10 million farmers will be trained to be qualified Green-Certificate holders by 2000," said Deputy Agriculture Minister Zhang Yanxi at a press conference over the weekend that announced the programme's expansion. The project's goal is to ensure that one in every 20 households in rural China has a professional farmer with some scientific knowledge and technical expertise, becoming a backbone for local agricultural production and economic development. The training project is significant for the entire country's agriculture advancement, said Zhang. The new corps of trained farmers will help the government to reach its goal of putting 60 percent of agricultural research results into practical applications by the end of the century. Currently, less than 40 percent of results get applied. The Green Certificate is considered proof of a farmer's knowledge and expertise for a designated technical job in agriculture. China initiated its training project experimentally in 1990. So far, it has involved 362 pilot counties in 28 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions across China. The vocational training has been given to more than 300,000 farmers, of whom 80,000 have obtained certificates, Zhang said. The training project covers such subjects as cultivation, animal husbandry and veterinary science, aquaculture, agricultural machinery, management of the rural cooperative economy and rural environmental protection. As stipulated by the projects the certificate is issued by the Ministry of Agriculture to a farmer who has successfully completed theoretical study and practical training in a specific subject and who has demonstrated accomplishments in practical skills. The training normally takes two years, but for some specialties-- such as cultivation and animal husbandry--the study period will be longer. "The implementation of the Green Certificate project is not only necessary for the ongoing bid to promote high-yield, good-quality and high-efficiency agriculture, but it is imperative for the country's rural modernization drive," Zhang noted. According to the project, the certificate holders will be in a better position to obtain contracts and loans, technical instruction, and other necessary government support. As the country with the world's largest rural population of 900 million, China has more than 430 million people engaged in its rural labour force. However, two-thirds of these farmers are illiterate or poorly educated. Their low level of education in science and technology is regarded by the government as a major obstacle to the development of China's agricultural productivity and rural economic progress. A new generation of farmers, with both high school and vocational education in scientific knowledge and technical expertise, is vital for rural economic growth
