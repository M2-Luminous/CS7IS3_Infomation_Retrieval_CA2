Patterton] [Text] Johannesburg, March 4 SAPA -- It was not the Afrikaner Volksfront's [AVF, Afrikaner National Front] policy to become involved in hit squad activites, AVF leader Gen Constand Viljoen said on Friday [4 March]. He was speaking against the background of a SOWETAN newspaper report of an alleged rightwing plot to murder African National Congress Secretary-General Cyril Ramaphosa. Gen Viljoen said the story was probably aimed at discrediting the rightwing. The unfortunate assassination of SA Communist Party General Secretary Chris Hani was a clear example of an incident from which the country, and especially the AVF, had not benefited at all. "On the contrary, it caused more damage. "I as a person am not involved in the alleged activities and play no role in such planning. "If I should become aware of such planning I would report it to the police and do everything possible to prevent such a dangerous deed." Mr Ramaphosa said on Radio 702 he had been left numb by the reports. "It causes a great deal of concern that there could be a bunch of people out there who want to eliminate one." The WEEKLY MAIL on Friday ran a story about an alleged rightwing war plan to hijack the SA Defence Force's Rapid Deployment Force and strategic installations and to "neutralise" hostile generals at the outbreak of hypothetical hostilities.
