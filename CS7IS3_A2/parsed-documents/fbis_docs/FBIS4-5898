South Korea announced it will no longer demand an envoy exchange with North Korea as a precondition to the next Pyongyang-Washington high-level talks. In effect, Seoul has cut itself out and left North Korea and the United States to deal with the nuclear problem. Reactions are split on whether Seoul made the right call. Some say it is a correction of what was a wrong-headed policy. Others say Seoul threw in the towel when there was no need to. Critics point out that inter-Korean dialogue was not the real stumbling block to resolving the nuclear impasse. There is no guarantee that North Korea will open its nuclear program to outside inspection just because Seoul withdrew the dialogue demand, they insist. Furthermore, the Kim Yong-sam administration has lost face by rescinding the principle held for years by his predecessors that for North Korea, "the road to Washington goes through Seoul." What Seoul risks with Friday's decision is that much greater. The critics have a point when they say Pyongyang succeeded in cornering Seoul to get what it always wanted -- dialogue with, and only with, the United States that takes South Korea completely out of the picture. But Seoul was more concerned with steering the nuclear problem away from a tense situation at the United Nations. Officials here explained they no longer felt an envoy exchange would help defuse the controversy and decided to let it go. "Envoys were a means to a solution, not the final objective," said Kim Sam-hun, ambassador in charge of North Korean nuclear affairs. Defenders of the new strategy say this was the only available incentive Seoul could give to North Korea to break the stalemate. China, North Korea's staunchest ally, made clear to President Kim Yong-sam at last month's summit that it would exercise its veto power, not even abstain, if a resolution on imposing sanctions against Pyongyang came up at the security council. In the face of such blatant opposition from a country whose support is the pillar of coordinated international action, Seoul had no choice but to yield in order to prove that it had done all it could to solve the problem diplomatically. The government's tone has softened considerably compared to just last month when it kept talking about UN sanctions and hard-line action. High-level officials were declaring that Washington had to "show Pyongyang at least something" to make it comply with nuclear inspection demands. "We can't say 'do this, do that.' We have to offer some incentives," said Kim, suggesting that Seoul and Washington were ready to make conciliatory gestures. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is considering an early-May deadline for North Korea to permit additional inspections. Friday's announcement will significantly quicken the pace to meet that deadline. The IAEA's first move is to propose negotiations to North Korea on discussing checks of facilities where access was denied during last month's visit. Meanwhile, the United States will reopen contact with North Korea to discuss holding the next round of high-level talks. Once the inspections and high-level talks are agreed, Seoul will propose a new form of inter-Korean dialogue. The type of dialogue will depend on the progress of nuclear negotiations. Officials say the prime ministers' talks, suspended because of the nuclear row, or the inter-Korean joint nuclear control commission are favorable channels. North Korean-U.S. high-level talks are also expected to gain speed. There are specific sites the IAEA wants to see -- those closed off to inspectors at last month's visit and the two nuclear storage sites. The IAEA also has to be present when North Korea changes the nuclear rods at its five-megawatt reactor. In return for the above, Washington will take various steps toward improving relations. It will take some time before the two sides can agree on diplomatic normalization. Washington is reminding Pyongyang of other stumbling blocks such as human rights, return of the remains of missing American soldiers from the 1950-53 Korean war and terrorism. In any event, various stages lie in between -- a liaison office for one, a formula that Washington applied with China.
