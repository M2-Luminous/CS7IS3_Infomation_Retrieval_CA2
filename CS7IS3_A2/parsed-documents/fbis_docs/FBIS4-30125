Spectacular economic growth of fast developing countries of the region has been an inspiration and sometimes the envy of the rest of the world. However, this fortunate position should make the Pacific community inward-looking and discriminating against the other regions. As the prime minister, Dr. Mahathir Mohamed, told the Pacific Basin Economic Council at its general meeting in Kuala Lumpur recently, we would be foolish if we of the Pacific got together in order to circle our wagons to raise barriers and to keep everyone else out. The Malaysian leader knew what he was talking about. The Pacific Basin owes it to themselves and the global community to build upon the first foundation of a liberalizing economic system that will eliminate the obstacles to the flow of goods and services worldwide. That is the objective of the new world economic order as enunciated in the Uruguay Round. That spirit must be maintained at all times if the world is to progress harmoniously together. There are bound to be differences in approach towards achieving that goal. But there is a wealth of opportunities to work with those whose interest vary from one to the other. There are possibilities for agreements to be reached without creating insurmountable stumbling blocks in the way of progress and prosperity. The Pacific era must be one in which areas of cooperation must be identified and utilized for the common good. These can include fields of communication, infrastructure development, banking and financial services, telecommunications, energy utilization, technology transfer, joint business ventures and above all, increase trade with and among each other. Malaysia has drawn praise from the EEC secretary general for its positive support for the speedy conclusion of the Uruguay Round. What is crucially important in this era of tension and conflict in different parts of the world is for peace, stability and security to prevail in the Asia-Pacific region. Everyone is aware that there is conflict potential in some areas of this region. If this is allowed to get beyond control, the entire strategic picture and future of the Pacific may be changed. But fortunately for the Pacific countries, the atmosphere has been made conducive for peace through political, social, and economic stability. The important thing for the countries in this region to pursue is to maintain this trend in order to replace enmity, confrontation, suspicion, and hatred wherever they may exist with a spirit of cooperative peace. The Pacific era has dawned. The basin must strive toward open regionalism not only in the Pacific itself but at a global level as well.
