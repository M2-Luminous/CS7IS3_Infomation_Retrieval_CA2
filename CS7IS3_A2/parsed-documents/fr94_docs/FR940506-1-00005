The Proposal The FAA is considering an amendment to part 73 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 73) to establish Restricted Area, R&hyph;6302E, Fort Hood, TX, above the existing Restricted Areas R&hyph;6302A, B, C, and D, to accommodate the firing of heatseeker missiles at the Fort Hood AAF weapons complex. The maximum altitude of the existing Fort Hood restricted area is 30,000 feet mean sea level (MSL). The proposed Restricted Area R&hyph;6302E would coincide with the existing lateral boundaries of Restricted Areas R&hyph;6302A, B, C, and D, and would extend from 30,000 feet MSL to 45,000 feet MSL. This action is a result of a Special Use Airspace Review conducted at the Fort Hood AAF in May 1993. The proposed Restricted Area R&hyph;6302E would be a joint-use restricted area, activated by NOTAM 48 hours in advance, not to exceed 90 days per year, weather makeup days included. The airspace would be returned to the controlling agency when not required for military activities. The U.S. Army does not expect any increase in the total annual usage of the area as a result of this proposal. The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Environmental Review This proposal will be reviewed for environmental impact prior to any final regulatory action. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 73 Airspace, Navigation (air).
