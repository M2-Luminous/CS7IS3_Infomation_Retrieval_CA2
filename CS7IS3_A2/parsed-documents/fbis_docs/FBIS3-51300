The letter was published today by the local newspaper EL TIEMPO. Signed by Subcommander Marcos, who explained that there will be a delay in delivery with the package of documents issued from 7 to 13 January--the texts of which referred to the cease-fire--to Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho, they reject any charges that they attacked "civilian objectives," among other things. In an 11 January text, the EZLN stated "it does not know Camacho Solis, but if this gentleman truly and honestly wants to find a political and fair solution, we hail his appointment as peace commissioner and we reiterate to him our willingness to dialogue." Camacho stated on Monday that he received a new message from the Zapatistas, which is why he went to the capital to brief Carlos Salinas on, with the certainty that there would be a response for them by 18 January. Salinas announced on 16 January that he will send to Congress "a draft law granting general amnesty" to EZLN members who rebelled in Chiapas 15 days ago. This was considered by political and social sectors as a new step toward peace. In a 6 January communique, the EZLN requested, among other things for dialogue, its recognition as a belligerent force, a cease-fire, the withdrawal of government troops from Chiapas, and democratic and social benefits. In the message to Clinton, the U.S. Congress and people, the EZLN asked if they "approved this military and economic aid to combat narcotrafficking and to kill Indians in the southeastern part of Mexico." "Troops, aircraft, helicopters, radar and communications equipment, firearms, and military weapons are now used not against narcotraffickers and the big drug lords of the drug mafias, but to repress the just struggles of the people of Mexico," it added. The Zapatists claim "we have nothing to do with narcotrafficking or national or international terrorism," and they say that "with the support the U.S. Government and people offer to the federal government they are only staining their hands with the blood of Indians." "Do not stain your hands with our blood, becoming an accomplice of the Mexican Government," because "our wish is for all the peoples of the world: true liberty and democracy," the message to the U.S. president concluded. In a 13 January communique, the EZLN said that "no way will we turn over our weapons or surrender our forces to the evil government. The cease-fire is aimed at alleviating the situation of the civilian population in the combat zone and paves the way for dialogue with all the progressive and democratic sectors of Mexico."
