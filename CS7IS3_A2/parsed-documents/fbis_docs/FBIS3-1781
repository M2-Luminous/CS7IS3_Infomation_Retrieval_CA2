The new policies aim to protect `sound' economic investment but still curb inflation, said Zhou Zhengqing, vice-governor of the People's Bank of China (PBC). PBC views this as its primary role this year. Meanwhile, China will also consider allowing foreign banks to do business in renminbi, Zhou said. But that will not come until domestic and foreign banks have equal tax systems. The State Council has targeted fixed-asset investment, urging government departments to impose strict control over the ballooning sector. "Without the government's approval, any specialized bank and financial institution will not be allowed to exceed their quota of fixed assets investment this year," Zhou noted. And starting this year, the Finance Ministry is prohibited from overdrawing its PBC accounts or borrowing money from the bank to finance debt. Deficits should now be met through issuing treasury bonds to the public, he added. PBC will also strictly control loans to specialty banks and financial institutions. China will try to diversify its loan system by broadening banks to include mortgage and discount loans. Zhou said these measures will further serve the bank's effective control of the money market. PBC will increase efforts to write rules governing commercial banks as part of the major task of converting the specialty banks, Zhou said. But it still has a long way to go towards achieving this end, he added. However, as the first step, three policy-lending banks will be created this year. They include the State Long-Term Credit Development Bank, the Import and Export Bank and the Agricultural Development Bank. These banks will supply low-interest loans to support key industrial and agricultural projects, infrastructure construction programmes, and the purchase of grain, cotton and edible oil from farmers. Zhou said that while implementing the State's demand of low-interest financing, these banks must be careful not to run in the red. After the three banks are established, the Industrial and Commercial Bank, the Bank of China, the Construction Bank and the Agricultural Bank of China will further commercialize their business. Once these four specialized banks go commercial, they will compete directly with foreign banks in renminbi business. Since the unification of the foreign exchange rate on January 1, the renminbi's exchange rate against U.S. dollar has been stable at around 8.69 to 8.71.
