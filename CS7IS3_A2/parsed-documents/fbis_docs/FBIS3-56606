The president's annual meeting with foreign diplomats in Vilnius Monday [17 January] was attended by 29 ambassadors and charges d'affaires residing both in Lithuania and other countries. Commenting on Lithuania's steps toward European political, economic and cultural systems, Brazauskas said his country does not want a borderline to be drawn between blocs either "to the east or to the west of Lithuania." He said Lithuania's official request to be admitted to NATO does not mean that the present state of relations with Russia and other Eastern countries would be altered. The president said "some things were done to improve relations with Russia" last year, but a number of problems still await solutions. Brazauskas said he categorically opposes suggestions to review the decisions made at the Potsdam conference, especially those concerning the Kaliningrad region. As regards the region, Lithuanian-Russian relations are good, he said, but added that Kaliningrad must be demilitarized by "that country" (Russia). Discussing Lithuania's domestic policy, Brazauskas expressed hope that a stable government will be preserved because there have been no serious arguments for holding early parliamentary elections. In his opinion, the country's economy has stabilized and some success has been achieved in the struggle against crime. During his discussion with Reinhard Kraus, German ambassador to Lithuania, the president mentioned his intention to visit Germany this year. Brazauskas also announced his intention to invite the Ukrainian president to Lithuania and to visit Minsk himself. A letter from the Italian president was presented to Brazauskas by Franco Tempesta, Italian ambassador to Lithuania, but the Lithuanian president's press service was unable to say anything about its contents.
