The flight in the direction of France of the Algerian elite (which has already started). The reinforcement of fundamentalist networks in France ensured of logistical support from Algiers. The multiplication of Syrian, Libyan, Iranian threat, that is, of state terrorism. It is not our pathetic return to Tehran of two Iranians claimed in vain by Swiss justice that will reassure us. Because, faced with terrorism, democracies, too, are afraid. I lack the means or the intention to discuss the validity of a "reason of state" that freed the culprits. On the other hand, what is certain is that continuing to slide on this slope leads to an abyss. One would like that another "reason of state" deal with the real means to "terrorize the terrorists." Against a secret and pitiless war, democracies must endow themselves with the means of a secret and pitiless war. And one should not do like the ostrich when faced with the threat, but find the political will to resist. No little Munichs of the mind should be allowed. Nowadays, there is no worse misfortune, in politics, than the decline of courage. We have enough cunning to sell some. But what about courage? [passage omitted]
