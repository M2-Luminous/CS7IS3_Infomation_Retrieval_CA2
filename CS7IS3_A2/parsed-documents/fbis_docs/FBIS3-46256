Although the two sides fell short of specifying how flexible they might be in the amount of equity injection and debt ceiling, a leading pro-China party yesterday announced its counter-proposal for the Government to inject a total of $89.2 billion to fund the $99.2 billion airport and railway projects. Yesterday's revelation of the counter-proposal by the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong (DAB) came amid an argument between the two sides on whether China had three months ago put forward a new set of proposals to finance the airport and the rail link. Government sources yesterday stressed that the last proposal on the table was that sent by the British side at the end of last June and which rejected China's repeated claim that Beijing had sent its counter-proposals to the British side. "The ball is in China's court," a source said. But a mainland official asserted: "We have made a set of proposals to the British about three months ago. "They gave no response. Instead, it has time and again sought fundings [from the Legislative Council.] Aren't they going too far?" The official said that China remained committed to the confidentiality rule but it was considering whether to publicise its counter-proposals on the financial package, claiming that the Hong Kong Government had ignored their demands and blatantly violated the airport accord. But the official also offered a note of conciliation, saying that China was willing to agree to relax the debt ceiling of $5 billion outlined in the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on the new airport plan, despite the tough statement issued by the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office. Financial Secretary Sir Hamish Macleod also stressed that the Government was ready to show further flexibility in altering it latest financing package to facilitate a final accord. Expressing disappointment at China's statement that financial or legal obligations not approved by Beijing would be invalid after 1997. Sir Hamish, however said he was encouraged by remarks that China was still open to further talks in the Joint Liaison Group Airport Committee. "In suggesting a meeting of the Airport Committee [last week] we did make clear at the time to the Chinese side that we were ready to show further flexibility," he said. Although Sir Hamish fell short of elaborating what flexibility the Government might offer, sources said that the British side was prepared to consider further in creasing the level of equity injections, which stands at $45.3 billion under the third financing package into the airport and railway plans. At present, Hong Kong's reserves already topped the $130 billion mark, said a source. The sources last night rejected the DAB proposal as unrealistic even given Hong Kong's present financial strength. But DAB chairman Tsang Yok-shing will fly to Beijing today and forward their counter-proposal to Chinese authority, confident that China would accept the party's suggestion. Chinese officials have repeatedly called on the Government to inject more funds to the PAA [Provisional Airport Authority] and MTRC [Mass Transit Railway Corporation] to reduce the debts level, especially in the light of the huge reserves the Government will accumulate in the run-up to 1997. A mainland official, who preferred anonymity, said: "Our demand is reasonable. The Government is fully capable of increasing the fundings without any difficulty." He said Beijing has clearly told the British side that they were "willing to negotiate" on the level of government borrowings adding the $5 billion ceiling laid down in the MOU "can always be negotiated". The official questioned the motives behind the insistence of the Government not to increase its level of injections in spite of the surge in reserves in the next few years. "Certainly they will continue to make massive spendings. We will tacitly let them make some gains. But they have to have a responsible and reasonable attitude," he said. The official said the Chinese side has already turned a blind eye to the previous fundings for the PAA because "we cannot simply let the PAA dissolve". "Now they are asking for another $4 billion. Just look at the items in the funding proposals such as navigation system. Are they so urgently needed?" he asked. But a government source said yesterday that while the British side was prepared to consider further raising the capital injection from the $45.3 billion it proposed under the third financing package, such a position did not mean the extra investment should be unlimited. In considering any further amount of capital injection, the Government had to assess its impact on the reserves and whether it would result in putting excessive funds to the two corporations, thus undermining their alertness in operating with proper financial disciplines, the source said.
