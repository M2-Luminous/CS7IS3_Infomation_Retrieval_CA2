ACTION: Closure. SUMMARY: NMFS is closing the directed fishery for pollock in Statistical Area 63 in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA). This action is necessary to prevent exceeding the first quarter total allowable catch (TAC) for pollock in this area. EFFECTIVE DATE: 12 noon, Alaska local time (A.l.t.), February 18, 1994, until the second quarter's allowance becomes available. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Andrew N. Smoker, Resource Management Specialist, Fisheries Management Division, NMFS, (907) 586&hyph;7228. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The groundfish fishery in the GOA exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the GOA (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 672. The first quarterly allowance of pollock TAC in Statistical Area 63 is 14,000 metric tons (mt), determined in accordance with ยง672.20(a)(2)(iv). The Director of the Alaska Region, NMFS (Regional Director), has determined, in accordance with ยง672.20(c)(2)(ii), that the 1994 first quarterly allowance of pollock TAC in Statistical Area 63 soon will be reached. The Regional Director established a directed fishing allowance of 13,500 mt, and has set aside the remaining 500 mt as bycatch to support other anticipated groundfish fisheries. The Regional Director has determined that the directed fishing allowance has been reached. Consequently, NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for pollock in Statistical Area 63, effective from 12 noon, A.l.t., February 18, 1994, until the second quarter's allowance becomes available. Directed fishing standards for applicable gear types may be found in the regulations at ยง672.20(g). Classification This action is taken under 50 CFR 672.20.
