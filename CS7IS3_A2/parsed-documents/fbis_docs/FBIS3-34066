If, in the past, the compulsions of the cold war created many a hurdle in the consolidation of freedom won by the third world countries, the transition to a new international world order has also not freed them from all anxiety about their future. This is a time not just of promise but also of potential pitfalls. It is in this sombre background that President Shanker Dayal Sharma has found it necessary to sound a note of caution. In his Republic Day message to the nation, he has referred to the danger of foreign interference in India's internal affairs. He has clearly in mind not merely the continuing sustenance of terrorism in Kashmir by Pakistan and evidence of a foreign hand in insurgent activity in the north-east but also instances of US-based terrorist outfits being blessed with words of solace from the White House itself. It may not be a deliberate policy of the US to promote destabilisation in India. But New Delhi cannot be indifferent to the disturbing fact that separatists have found it easy to maintain a channel of communication with President Clinton's aides. They have played on the American concern for human rights for their own nefarious purposes. White House officials have refused to be wary of the way they are allowing themselves to be manipulated to harm India's interests. This suggests a continuation of the essence of the four-decades- old American policy towards Indo-Pakistan problems. In the past it consisted of humouring Pakistan just because the latter helped strengthen the American anti-Soviet strategy. Even if, in recent years, Washington has claimed to have been guided by a so-called evenhanded approach to this subcontinent, its practice has not ceased to be overly influenced by a sympathetic view of Pakistan's causes. The Pressler amendment, as the name itself signifies, was not the result of the administration's initiative. The administration has actually found it an inconvenient constraint. American praise for the democratic system in India from time to time cannot blind its policy-makers to the constant threat of its interests being compromised by the instinctive American habit of tilting towards Pakistan on all contentious issues. The best way of countering this threat would certainly be to invest Indian diplomacy with some punch. The traditional way of trying to convince others of the justness of any Indian cause will not suffice. Every time the Americans say or do things which palpably go against this country's interests, no punches should be pulled in exposing their mischief. This style, sadly, is still alien to Indian diplomacy as was amply clear from the defensive ring of protests against the latest anti-Indian manoeuvres in the White House.
