The possibilities are the signature of a free trade bilateral treaty or the incorporation of Chile into NAFTA, of which the United States, Mexico, and Canada are members. According to Insulza, Finance Minister Eduardo Aninat informed U.S. Trade Representative Michael Kantor of these alternatives during his visit to Chile to attend Frei's presidential inauguration. Insulza said the two countries' trade representatives will define an agenda to begin talks soon. For this, it must first be decided whether Chile will use the bilateral agreement or NAFTA. He added that the United States has not decided which countries will join the "fast track" [preceding two words in English] to begin the negotiations. This mechanism consists of an authorization granted by the U.S. Congress to the executive branch to negotiate quickly and then present a general agreement to the legislative branch for its approval. The acting foreign minister said the two alternatives have advantages and disadvantages. He said a bilateral agreement is quicker because it does not include all the items of NAFTA, which foresees more complex trade relations between the United States, Mexico, and Canada. As for NAFTA, Insulza said the advantage is that Chile could join a broader trade association and the items to be negotiated are already known and defined. Another aspect of bilateral relations between Chile and the United States is connected with the case of cyanide-poisoned grapes, which caused an embargo of Chilean fruit in March 1989. Regarding this subject, Insulza said the diplomatic negotiations are compatible with the lawsuit filed by Chilean fruit exporters. He added that some of the negotiation's elements could change according to the status of the lawsuit. Regarding the approval of the ambassadors named by Chile, Insulza said that so far Argentina, Peru, and Mexico have given the "agreement" [preceding word in English] for Eduardo Rodriguez, Carlos Martinez Sotomayor, and Carlos Portales, respectively. He said this is due not only to the good relations maintained with these countries, but also to the expeditious processing of the documents, which sometimes is complex. He cited as an example the fact that in Europe the approval of ambassadors is made by a council of state and in some Latin American countries it is made by the Foreign Ministry, which grants the "agreement" directly and without delay.
