FBIS4-21058 "jptdd015__l94019" JPRS-TDD-94-015-L JPRS Narcotics 8 March 1994 LATIN AMERICA BRAZIL Arrested Trafficker Reveals New Alliance in Rio Arrested Trafficker Reveals New Alliance in Rio 94WD0288A Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL in Portuguese 8 Mar 94 p 16--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 94WD0288A Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL Portuguese CSO [Article: "Police Clear up Slaughters in Vigario Geral"] [Text] The first arrest of a participant in the massacre of four military police [PM] officers in Catole do Rocha Square--a crime that led to the slaughter of 21 persons in the Vigario Geral shantytown in the early morning hours on 30 August 1993--occurred last Saturday. Alexandre Santana ("Caninana"), who is a lieutenant of trafficker Flavio Pires da Silva ("Flavio Negao"), also confessed to the execution of two PM officers last 19 February near the Iraja Cemetery, participation in the robbing of an armored car owned by Transpev on 24 February, and participation in the killing of 14 individuals on Mangueira Hill during a battle between traffickers on Carnival Sunday. "Caninana" was arrested along with Monica Nazareth Moco, wife of "Flavio Negao's" chief lieutenant, Ulissiano do Nascimento ("Ulisses"), during a raid that took 32 officers from the Drug Enforcement Division (DRE) to Vigario Geral. According to Walter Alves de Oliveira, head of the DRE, the arrest of "Caninana" confirms that Marcelo Carlos do Nascimento ("Arregalado"), "Flavio Negao," and "Ulisses" took part in killing the four PM officers in Vigario Geral on the night of 28 August 1993. "`Caninana' said that the PM officers were killed because traffickers in the shantytown have a radio on which they listen to Military Police transmissions. So `Flavio Negao' knew that the police officers were headed for Catole do Rocha Square," the police chief said. According to Oliveira, the only motive given by "Caninana" for slaughtering the PM officers was "an order from `Flavio Negao.'" Monica, the wife of "Ulisses," had helped her husband escape during the raid on Saturday. She was released after giving a statement. Trafficking Bosses Form Alliance According to Police Chief Walter Alves de Oliveira, head of the DRE, a new alliance among traffickers in Rio de Janeiro's shantytowns was revealed in statements by Alexandre Santana ("Caninana"), a killer who is one of the lieutenants in the gang headed by "Flavio Negao," head of the drug traffic in Vigario Geral. "He said that traffickers from the shantytowns of Vigario Geral, Varginha, and Turano took part in the `war' that claimed 14 victims (`Caninana' took part in six of those murders) during Carnival. They were supporting trafficker `Polegar' of Mangueira Hill," the police chief said. Here are the other crimes in which "Caninana" confessed to having participated: Sergeant Ailton Benedito Ferreira, Corporal Irapuan Calixto Caetano, and Privates Jose Carlos Santana and Luis Mendonca Santos, all of the 9th BPM [Military Police Battalion], were massacred with AR-15 rifle fire--by men working for trafficker "Flavio Negao"--in Catole do Rocha Square in Vigario Geral on the night of 28 August last year. Two PM officers, Robson Barros da Silva and Jose Carlos Cardoso, were murdered near the Iraja Cemetery last 19 February. According to "Caninana," those deaths were the work of the gang headed by trafficker "Flavio Negao." Trafficker Marcio Glacie da Rocha ("Socrates") also died during that slaughter. According to the head of the DRE, "Caninana" said that the body of "Socrates" was taken to the Vigario Geral shantytown, where a death certificate for the trafficker was arranged. He was then given a discreet burial in the Iraja Cemetery. On 24 February, 20 men from a "backwoods commando unit," armed with AR-15 and FAL rifles, shotguns, and submachineguns, intercepted a Transpev armored car (license No. OK 1399) on the Presidente Dutra Highway in the Jardim America neighborhood and stole two small trunks containing 4.5 million cruzeiros and checks. According to "Caninana," that operation was also carried out by "Flavio Negao's" gang.
