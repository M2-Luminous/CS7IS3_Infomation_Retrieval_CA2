Miguel Martinez, Cuba's acting charge d'affaires in this capital, said in statements [words indistinct] during a meeting he held yesterday with him. Martinez said he asked to meet with Mulino following the publication of an alleged report from the Cuban Embassy on activities to support the opposition Democratic Revolutionary Party [words indistinct], a favorite to win next Sunday's elections. Our position is to state very clearly that it is a false document. Cuba has not been involved in, nor will it be involved in the electoral campaign, and it will not support any of the parties participating in the same, Martinez asserted. Martinez said he told the Panamanian foreign minister of his concern because irresponsible actions of this kind could endanger relations between the two nations. The incident has been widely publicized since last Tuesday, when progovernment Legislator Leo Gonzalez held a surprising news conference and said he had documents implicating Cuban diplomats in alleged illegal actions, although he refused to provide details on the origin of his information. The head of the Cuban mission here explained that the existence of the reports, which are completely false, was reported to him by a top Panamanian official, Antonio Dominguez, director of the National Immigration Department. Dominguez even told the local press he had received an offer from persons he did not identify who wanted to sell him the documents for approximately $20,000. Meanwhile, Martinez indicated that since he learned of [words indistinct] to manipulate in a specific manner the Cuban position, he presented the Foreign Ministry on 26 April with evidence showing the falsity of the alleged official Cuban documents. [Words indistinct] cited the cheap forgeries of diplomats' signatures and a word choice and style completely different from the Cuban style, even the use of typical Panamanian expressions and phrases.
