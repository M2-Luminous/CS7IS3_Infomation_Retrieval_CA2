Masaru Hayami, chairman of the Japan Association of Corporate Executives (Keizai Doyukai), told a news conference it is strange that the Diet proceeding has been held up because of an affair that took place 10 years ago. He referred to an opposition demand that Hosokawa submit a detailed report on 100 million yen which he said was borrowed from Sagawa Kyubin trucking company. Hayami's remark reflected worries in the business community that the stalled debate on the budget proposal may affect the domestic economy, which has shown signs of recovery.
