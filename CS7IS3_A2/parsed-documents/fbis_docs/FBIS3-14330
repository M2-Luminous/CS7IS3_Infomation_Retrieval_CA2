During his visits, his majesty and his brother Sultan Qabus Bin Sa'id, and his brother his Highness Qatari Amir Shaykh Khalifah Bin-Hamad Al Thani, exchanged views on various current Arab and international issues, in addition to the unqiue relations between Jordan and each of the Sultanate of Oman and the State of Qatar, and the latest developments in the peace process in the wake of UN Security Council Resolution No. 904. His Majesty King Husayn spoke to the press about the visits following his return to the homeland: [Begin recording] [Husayn] In the name of God, the merciful, the compasionate. The visit to the Sultanate of Oman, the meeting with the brother sultan and the relatives there was excellent. It is a continuation of the solid relations between us; relations among brothers. Also, my visit to fraternal Qatar was a very good visit. It gave us the opportunity to discuss all matters that interest us in the Arab homeland, and the course of events, such as the peace process and the situation in the occupied territories with respect to the past and the present. Thank God, the solid groundwork on which we established our relations years ago are still solid. [Unidentified reporter] Sir, how do you view the scope of joint Arab action in light of your visit to the fraternal countries? [Husayn] We have every hope that God almighty will guide the Arab leaders so they realize the importance of these circumstances and the need for work to confront these challenges in a manner that satisfies all of us. It goes without saying that these are fateful challenges. As for the brothers I visited, it seems to me, or I am confident, that we proceed in the same direction and adopt the same approach toward all that has taken place. [Reporter] What about your talks with Sultan Qabus about Jordanian-Omani joint efforts on Yemeni reconciliation. Is there anything new in this respect? [Husayn] The new thing is that, thanks to God, there has been an effort that was successful from the beginning. We have been working for many months. This is our duty in response to a Yemeni and Arab request, and out of our duty toward our brothers. Then came the document, and Yemen, with all its representatives meeting here, ratified the document. We were then surprised by the painful and disturbing reports. A joint military delegation left and assumed its role as best it can. Thanks be to God, they completed their task. With respect to the future, I am confident that we will always be ready to carry out any duty. However, the basic job should be done by the brothers in Yemen toward what they ratified and what reflects, in my opinion, the aspirations and wishes of all the sons of Yemen. We ask God for the success of the task we and the brothers in Oman have carried out. [Reporter] Your majesty, there are resolutions that preceded resolution 904 on Jerusalem, saying that it is occupied Arab land. How do you view Jordan's stand in this direction? [Husayn] We now seek clarifications on the stand. But, all the UN Security Council resolutions view Jerusalem as part of the Arab lands that were occupied in 1967. It seems that a few years ago, there was a warning from the U.S. side that if the question of Jerusalem was raised, then the stand would be the one that has taken place, or they said that their stand would be firmer with respect to using the veto. Actually, and as I said a fews days ago, I was taken by surprise by the situation on Friday. I was in the south, and I immediately returned. Perhaps, for certain considerations, it was a mistake to raise the issue of Jerusalem. The world at large knows Jerusalem is part of the ocupied Arab territories. In any case, we seek to obtain assurances that the stand on this reality and situation has not changed. [end recording] [passage omitted]
