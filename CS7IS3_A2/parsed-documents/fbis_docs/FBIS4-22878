Yakhin, Scientific Research Institute of Thermal Instruments; UDC 62-5.681.2] [Abstract] As the lead organization, the Scientific Research Institute of Thermal Instruments is developing the Kvint computer system for computerizing the engineering processes at heat-and- electric power stations. Kvint represents one of the first functionally complex domestic systems of its kind and computerizes the collection and preliminary processing of information, engineering process control, logic-program control, priority control, locking, online control, alarming, information archival, event recording, calculations offline, and information transfer. The system is based on a problem-oriented approach, distributed automatic control, centralized monitoring, object-oriented control, production programming, self-diagnosis and sample redundancy, and project configuration. Kvint has a four-level architecture -- field, controller, systems, and production -- each level of which uses its own local network or several similar networks. The development is proceeding in two stages, with design bureaus from Ivano-Frankovsk, Cheboksary, and Moscow taking part. The Moscow- based All-Russian Heat-Engineering Institute is developing the hardware requirements for the Seriya 200, the first stage of the development. Figures 3.
