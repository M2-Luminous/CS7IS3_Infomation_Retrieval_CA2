The subject of the talks were issues related to Poland's and Ukraine's participation in the "Partnership for Peace" program and the implementation of the "Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe." The talks were presided over by Lieutenant Colonel Jerzy Milewski and Anton Buteyko, who are the chairmen of the Consultation Committee. During the consultations the participants stressed the need for closer cooperation in the area of security policy of both states. The "Partnership for Peace" program is supposed to become a new important element of the all-European (Euro-Atlantic) system of stability and security, which is being established. It ensures all participants equal rights, as well as excludes the possibility of obtaining special rights by any state. The "Partnership for Peace" opens new possibilities for bilateral cooperation of the countries that take part in the program. Poland looks upon its participation in the "Partnership..." as a step leading to full membership in NATO. Ukraine approaches this striving of Poland with understanding. The Ukrainian party sees in the "Partnership for Peace" a possibility for forming national peacekeeping rapid deployment forces that might better cooperate with the NATO forces and forces of other states. They would, among others, conduct peacekeeping operations under the auspices of the UN or the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. The commission noted with satisfaction the cooperation of our countries during the preparation of the presentation documents within the framework of the "Partnership for Peace." The parties stressed that military relations between the Polish Republic and Ukraine are developing on the basis of mutual understanding, respect, and partnership-like cooperation. This is confirmed in working contacts between the Defense Ministries, General Staffs, commanders of the various types of the Armed Forces and military districts. The Experts' Commission recommended to the Consultation Committee that further initiatives aimed at strengthening contacts between our countries within the framework of the "Partnership..." program be backed. The session of the Experts' Commission for Security Policy was another stage in the implementation of the decisions of the Consultation Committee; it was also a phase for implementing the direction, set by the presidents of the Polish Republic and Ukraine, for intensifying and deepening the Polish-Ukrainian political and military cooperation.
