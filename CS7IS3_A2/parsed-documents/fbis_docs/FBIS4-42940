Ambassador Inal Batu, Turkey's permanent representative to the United Nations, described this new report as a text by the UN secretary general that ignores the wishes of the Turkish side on the island. Osman Ertug, TRNC representative in New York, said that the report pours salt on the wounds. Turkish Cypriot officials say that the report, like the previous one, is politically oriented, whereas it should have been primarily a technical report. Ertug said: In our view, the fact that the accusation concerning the lack of political will is directed -- even though only by implication -- against the Turkish Cypriot side constitutes the most dangerous factor in the report.
