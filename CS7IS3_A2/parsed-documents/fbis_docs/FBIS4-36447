A source close to the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan [PUK] (led by Talabani) has told AL-HAYAH that "forces of the Kurdistan Democratic Party [KDP] (led by Barzani) as well as Islamic Movement forces and Iranian forces launched a major attack at dawn on the city of Qal'at Dizah" which is under the control of the PUK forces. Meanwhile, Major General Hasan al-Naqib, member of the Presidential Council of the Iraqi National Congress [INC], has rejected Presidential Council Member Barzani's proposal calling for Iraqi Kurdistan to be declared a demilitarized "UN protectorate." In a statement to AL-HAYAH from his headquarters in Salah-al-Din, al-Naqib said that "any international trusteeship over any part of Iraq would not solve the internal problems, even if it did not further complicate these problems." He emphasized that "the real solution to the Kurdish question must be within a national unified Iraqi framework." [passage omitted] Al-Naqib said that "the recent regrettable incidents between the Kurdish brothers prove that the only way to solve problems is dialogue and negotiation. That is one of the lessons which must be learned about settling differences between Kurdish and non-Kurdish patriotic opposition forces." He urged the Kurds to "show wisdom and farsightedness, let reason and logic prevail, and give priority to the main struggle against the dictatorial regime over the secondary conflicts." [passage omitted] In al-Naqib's view, "the real solution to the Kurdish question must be within a national unified Iraqi framework acceptable to the Iraqi people -- Arabs, Kurds, and minorities -- and enjoying regional and international support." [passage omitted] On the fighting which flared up again yesterday, a source close to the PUK said that "the joint attack launched by the KDP, the Islamic Movement, and Iranian Revolutionary Guard forces is supported by artillery batteries and rocket launchers in the Iranian area of Sar Dasht. The PUK forces have succeeded in recapturing the city of Qal'at Dizah (5 km from the Iraqi-Iranian border) whose inhabitants had to move out as a result of heavy shelling." He added that "the three forces on Monday attacked the cities of Sayyid Sadiq and Banjwin east of al-Sulaymaniyah and were defeated by the PUK forces." He admitted that "the fierce battles" threaten to torpedo the reconciliation agreement reached between Barzani and Talabani after last month's fighting between their parties.
