Chairman Masaru Hayami made the request during a breakfast meeting with International Trade and Industry Minister Eijiro Hata and other trade ministry officials. Electorate seat redistribution, as part of political reforms, should be completed during the current parliamentary session while a tax reform package containing tax cuts and an offsetting consumption tax increase two or three years later should be formulated soon, Hayami said, echoing the voice of about 35 other corporate executives present at the breakfast meeting. Hayami also urged the government to take concrete measures to narrow a price gap between home and abroad, reduce Japan's huge current account surplus, upgrade the labor market and revise a spending plan for public works projects for an efficient fund allocation. Trade Minister Hata replied that the government will do its utmost to address the requests but refrained from making clear commitments on specific requests.
