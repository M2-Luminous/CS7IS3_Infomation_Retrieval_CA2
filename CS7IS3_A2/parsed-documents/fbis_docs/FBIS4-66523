Mizrahi, Hapo'el Hamizrahi, and the National Religious Party [NRP] viewed the close ties to the secular Zionist parties as a vital commandment to advance the central needs of the state and the nation. Despite the differences of opinion on certain matters, especially in the religious realm, the NRP was willing to compromise with the secular Zionist parties in order to establish a constructive national partnership. Even when the NRP did not get satisfaction in religious legislation, it continued to cooperate with secular Zionism, fully aware that this partnership was vital and necessary for the construction of government institutions and an exclusively Jewish way of life in the State of Israel. The NRP, therefore, cooperated with governments headed by Mapai [forerunner of Labor], headed by the Labor Party, headed by Likud, and headed by the National Unity government, as well. The NRP representatives believed that active partnership with the governments of Israel would increase understanding among the Zionist camps and strengthen national life in the State of Israel. The NRP was able to exert influence in fateful courses of events such as on embarking on the various wars, on decisions having to do with settlement in all parts of the Land of Israel, on central educational, ethical, and social issues, and on the Jewish flavor of the State of Israel. Certainly not all Israeli governments were happy with the policy lines adopted by the NRP in various areas, and occasionally real or imagined crises arose between the ruling secular parties and the NRP, but most of the time the NRP was a full and wanted partner in all Israeli governments and was able to express the desires of the national-religious community with pride and resolve from its seat in the various Israeli governments. Since the 1992 elections, it turns out that the NRP is no longer a desired partner. The secular parties that make up the present coalition--Labor, RATZ [Citizens Rights Movement], Shinui, and MAPAM [United Workers Party]--have adopted an ideological line that collides head on with that of the NRP, representing the national-religious community. The parties in the government coalition espouse the rights of the individual--as opposed to the approach of the NRP, which espouses an approach calling for realization of the obligations of the individual to people and country. The rights of the individual, according to the coalition parties, are divorced entirely from his obligations to community and country, while the NRP avers that the individual's rights flow directly from the fulfillment of his obligations to state and community. The contempt that the coalition parties display toward traditional religious and social-ethical values stirs up the national-religious community and its representatives. A significant abyss has opened between the values that serve the coalition parties and those that characterize the NRP as a party representing the national-religious community. It is now clear that anyone who is concerned about all that is dear to the national-religious community cannot work together politically with the secular parties that make up the present government coalition. It may be that the time has come for the national-religious community and its political representatives in the NRP to do some soul searching to find out whether it is preferable in the present situation to exchange the historic partnership with the secular Zionist parties for a partnership with the ultra-Orthodox parties that are considered non-Zionist and even anti-Zionist. It turns out that on purely religious issues there is almost full agreement between the NRP and SHAS [Torah Observing Sephardim] and Agudat Israel. On educational, socioeconomic, and ethical issues there is close proximity between the national-religious community and the ultra-Orthodox community. The sharp disagreement that exists between the national-religious community and the ultra-Orthodox community centers on the governmental character of the State of Israel. There is also disagreement on central government prerogatives such as military service and the drafting of seminary students into the IDF [Israel Defense Forces]. These are substantive, ethical disagreements, but the sharp disagreements existing between the national-religious community and the secular community are no less sharp or relevant to the Jewish nature of the country. It may be that in serious, rational, principled negotiations between the NRP and the ultra-Orthodox parties it will be possible to bridge the gap on various governmental issues, which would facilitate close cooperation between the religious parties to the point of establishing a broad religious front. The present emergency requires new thinking and new creative measures to produce a unified ethical, social-religious front that can stand up to the erosion in education, in values, and in the Jewish nature of the country. It is worthwhile to examine the possibility of cooperation with the ultra-Orthodox, who show greater understanding of the needs of the national religious community in terms of settler image and the settlements in all parts of the Land of Israel. Recently it turns out that a not insignificant number of ultra-Orthodox have participated actively in the demonstrations against submission to the Arab demands and in support for settlement on the Golan and in Judea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip. It is incumbent upon the NRP leaders to open regular channels for negotiation with the ultra-Orthodox parties in order to achieve a unified front that will stand tall against the secular coalition parties that are endangering the ethical, national, and Jewish fortitude of the people of Israel in the State of Israel.
