Viktor Klimov, head of the organization and methods department, explained that over two-thirds of the deputy corps of the legislative assemblies -- or oblast dumas as the new bodies of representative power in the regions are mostly called -- had been elected in these regions. That is just the number of deputies necessary for the body to be considered capable, for it to convene and start working. The rest of its members in the regions will be elected in repeated elections, the dates for which will be set locally. Viktor Klimov said "the elections had given 100 per cent results" only in three parts of the federation -- the Aginsk, Buryat, and Komi-Permyak autonomous okrugs. In each of the three parts, deputies had been elected from all 15 okrugs and their representative bodies were at full strength. In three parts of the federation the elections have been deemed invalid. In St.Petersburg they have been prolonged to today by the decision of the mayor.
