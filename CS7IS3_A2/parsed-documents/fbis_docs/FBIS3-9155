I have learned from the 14 March 1994 issue of EVENIMENTUL ZILEI that I have a new capacity -- besides being a KGB and GRU agent, about which I also learned from the press, and that news was also carried by EVENIMENTUL ZILEI as well -- namely that now I am also "a spy for the French secret service." Owing to the fact that the remuneration I am entitled to from that secret service to which you referred has yet not been remitted to me, I am asking for your support in my efforts to collect the amount the French secret service owes me in exchange for the information I offered them about the sessions of the Supreme Defense Council of the country, and which, according to EVENIMENTUL ZILEI, were "channeled" there via your hero, Radu Petrica Popa, whom the daily you head presented not as a crook, but rather as a victim of deception. I am counting on your "good will," because as far as I can see, you have already specialized in investigating and clearing up cases such as mine, although, considering that this is an espionage case, you should have kept total secrecy and "whisper about it solely in my ears," and then we might have been able to find a mutually profitable formula to "secludedly" split the reward I am entitled to from the French secret service and which, I presume, must be a very substantial one, given especially my high capacity, rank, and value. However, owing to the fact that your daily has already aired the issue in public, we now have to obey the rules of consistency, because now we cannot afford to hide anything and therefore I hope that you will accept that our mutual "cooperation" should be done also in public, although in this case, I ought to warn you, I am not ready to split the dollars with you. Hoping that you will publish this letter and thanking you in advance for your support, yours, THE SECRETARY OF THE SUPREME DEFENSE COUNCIL OF THE COUNTRY [title in capital letters as published], Lieutenant General Marin Pancea
