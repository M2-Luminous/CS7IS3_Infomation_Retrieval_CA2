"We have authorized the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) to prepare for a working-level meeting with its mainland Chinese counterpart as part of our efforts to promote cross-strait dialogue and rapprochement," said Kao Koong-lien, vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC). It will be the fifth working-level meeting between the SEF and the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) since the heads of the two semi-official conduits for cross- strait exchanges met in Singapore in April 1993. The meeting will focus on issues related to the repatriation of mainland hijackers and illegal immigrants as well as to cross-strait fishing disputes, Kao said. SEF and ARATS officials have met four times to discuss these issues since the second half of last year, but no definite results have been reached because of Beijing's reluctance to recognize Taiwan's jurisdiction over territories now under its control. Kao said the fifth round of talks will also discuss ways to protect the safety of Taiwan travelers on the mainland. "The issue has become pressing after the March 31 Qiandao lake travel disaster in which 24 Taiwan tourists were murdered," Kao noted. The meeting will be held after the July 4-5 national meeting on mainland affairs, but the exact date has yet to be decided, kao said. "We hope it will take place before late July or early August," he added. The SEF is expected to inform ARATS of its intention to hold the fifth-round working-level meeting in the next few days. Kao said the SEF will also arrange for a meeting between its Vice Chairman and Secretary-General, Chiao Jen-ho, and ARATS Vice President Tang Shubei in the near future. "The time, venue and agenda for the proposed Chiao-tang meeting will be decided after further discussion by SEF and ARATS officials," Kao said. He added that he does not rule out the possibility that the Chiao-Tang meeting will be held in Taiwan. Chiao and Tang met for the first time in Beijing last November. Kao said the Mainland Affairs Council, which oversees SEF operations, has never tied the holding of a second Chiao-Tang meeting to the satisfactory conclusion of the fifth working-level meeting between the two organizations. "We hope the planned Chiao-Tang meeting will help create a favorable environment for a new round of talks between SEF Chairman C.F. Koo and ARATS President Wang Daohan," Kao noted. He denied that the presidential office has ordered the MAC not to approve a Koo-Wang meeting within this year. "We have never received any such instruction," he stressed. During the first Koo-Wang meeting, several agreements were signed to lay a framework for institutionalized dialogue and communications between the SEF and ARATS. As cross-strait relations have plunged to a low ebb in the aftermath of the Qiandao lake tragedy, Kao said Taiwan hopes to create a better atmosphere before a second Koo-Wang meeting takes place.
