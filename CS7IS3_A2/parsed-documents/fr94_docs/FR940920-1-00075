FR940920-1-00075 FR940920-1-00008 The GCP levels remain unchanged from the February 11, 1991 guidelines. For modular starved-air and modular excess-air types of MWC's, the CO emission limit would be 50 ppmv (at 7 percent O 2 , dry basis) on a 4-hour block average basis. For mass burn waterwall, mass burn fixed-wall refractory, and fluidized-bed types of MWC's, the CO emission limit would be 100 ppmv (at 7 percent O 2 , dry basis) on a 4-hour block average basis. For mass burn rotary refractory MWC's, the CO emission limit would be 100 ppmv (at 7 percent O 2 , dry basis) on a 24-hour block average basis. For mass burn rotary waterwall MWC's, the CO emission limit would be 250 ppmv (at 7 percent O 2 , dry basis) on a 24-hour block average basis. For RDF-stoker MWC's, the CO limit would be 200 ppmv (at 7 percent O 2 , dry basis) on a 24-hour block average basis. For coal/RDF mixed fuel-fired MWC's, the CO limit would be 150 ppmv (at 7 percent O 2 , dry basis) on a 4-hour block average basis. Municipal waste combustors would be allowed to operate up to 110 percent of the maximum capacity, as achieved during the most recent dioxin/furan compliance test. Maximum capacity would be based on the steam flow rate, which would be continuously monitored according to the ASME Power Test Code (PTC) for Steam Generating Units (PTC4.1 and PTC19.5). This requirement is unchanged from the February 11, 1991 emission guidelines. The EPA requests comments on this method of measuring load for steam-generating MWC's. Specifically, the EPA has questions regarding the requirement for calibration of the measuring device (e.g., orifice plate) before and after each dioxin/furan compliance test. The EPA is concerned that this calibration requirement may be overly burdensome because the main steam line that contains the orifice plate may need to be cut in order to access the orifice plate for recalibration. Also, the EPA requests comments on whether the ASME PTC adequately addresses the need for calibrating the signal from the flow meter. Additionally, the EPA requests comments on the use of boiler feed water flow as an alternative method for continuously monitoring load for steam-generating MWC's. Furthermore, the EPA is considering allowing the use of the continuous flue gas volumetric flow rate to measure maximum capacity for both steam-generating MWC's, as well as those MWC's that do not generate steam. These types of monitors are based on ultrasonic, thermal, or differential pressure methods, and are now being required as part of the EPA's Acid Rain Program (40 CFR part 75). The EPA requests comments on whether continuous flue gas volumetric flow rate monitors are adequately demonstrated and accurate methods for determining compliance with the load level requirements, and if they should be allowed as an alternative to the use of the ASME PTC. Under the guidelines, MWC's would establish a site-specific maximum flue gas temperature at the final PM control device inlet demonstrated during their most recent dioxin/furan compliance test. Similar to the provisions for establishing a maximum load level measurement, the maximum demonstrated PM control device inlet temperature is established as the maximum 4-hour block average temperature measured during the most recent dioxin/furan compliance test. The MWC must then be operated so that the temperature at the final PM control device inlet does not exceed this level by more than 17 ○C (30 ○F) (4-hour block average basis). 5. Operator Certification and Training The proposed emission guidelines would require full certification of all MWC shift supervisors and MWC chief facility operators by the ASME or a State program. The proposed guidelines would also require that at least one of the following persons be on duty at the MWC at all times during which the MWC is combusting waste: A fully certified MWC chief facility operator, a fully certified shift supervisor, or a provisionally certified control room operator. A provisionally certified control room operator would be allowed to ``stand in'' during times that a fully certified chief facility operator or shift supervisor is offsite. In addition, the proposed emission guidelines would require each owner or operator of an MWC with an aggregate capacity greater than 35 Mg/day to develop and maintain a site-specific training manual and to review it with all employees associated with the operation of the MWC (including MWC maintenance personnel, crane/load operators, and ash handlers). The manual and training would be updated annually. Section 129 of the Act of 1990 requires the EPA to develop and promote a model State program for the training and certification of MWC operators. Section 129 specifies that ``any person with control over processes affecting emissions from a unit'' must successfully complete an acceptable training program. Consistent with section 129, today's proposed emission guidelines would require all MWC chief facility operators, shift supervisors, and control room operators at MWC plants with capacities above 35 Mg/day to complete the MWC operator training course developed by the EPA or a State program. The EPA has developed a model training program and has distributed it to State air pollution control agencies, EPA regional offices, and MWC industry groups. This model training program could be used to fulfill this requirement and prepare for the ASME certification. 6. Nitrogen Oxides Emissions The proposed emission guidelines would require MWC's at large plants, except refractory MWC's, to control NO X emissions to a level of 180 ppmv (corrected to 7 percent O 2 , dry basis, on a 24-hour daily average basis). A ``no control'' NO X emission guideline level for MWC's at small plants and refractory MWC's at large plants is proposed and discussed in section VIII of this preamble.
