No longer than that, or we will lose control of the country." For Mikhail Maley, a former member of the military-industrial complex who was Boris Yeltsin's adviser before supervising the conversion of the defense industry for the Russian Security Council, the composition of the new government does not give rise to optimism: "The new team has no notion of the country which it is supposed to govern. It is acting accordingly." Yet Mikhail Maley was a fierce opponent of Yegor Gaydar's monetary stabilization policy. But he admits that the former government "at least had the advantage of basing itself on an idea, one which was certainly wrong but which was real." All the signs of an imminent disaster exist, he warned: "Agriculture no longer has fertilizer or fuel. Unless we take emergency measures, the sowing will not take place in time." "In the railroads, I predict a crisis in the spring. There will be nothing to pay the salaries..." The crisis in the energy sector is such that Mikhail Maley fears that the electricity cuts might spread, because the power stations have not been paid for their services and have no more money for their energy suppliers. Unemployment also worries the Russian official: "The next set of graduates and students will not find work. They have hitherto found jobs in commerce, in the criminal world. But every niche is occupied... In the current atmosphere of damaged pride, lack of heating and electricity, the demonstrators will not just be angry grandmothers..." Last Asset The West is mistaken therefore in abandoning Boris Yeltsin at the very moment when the situation is becoming really critical: "You forget that we are still a big nuclear power, even if we have become an economic pygmy. We must have access to the international arms market. Otherwise, we will no longer be able to respect the rules set by a well-fed and self-important West. We are being strangled." Only the military-industrial complex can still save the country from the crisis, he concluded. With its 6 million men and its network of enterprises capable of producing almost any goods, "it is the only organized force which remains in Russia, the country's last asset." Judging from what he says, President Yeltsin is beginning to understand the importance of the issue and supported the defense industry's plans in the last two meetings of the Security Council. But he is still too "disorientated" to really commit himself. "Boris Nikolayevich feels he has chosen the wrong model of reform, but he is still reluctant to change it," Mikhail Maley suggested. The president may not fully share the certainties of his former adviser on the role of "magic potion" which the defense complex could play. Indeed, it is far from being monolithic. It is seriously affected by the crisis. The defense industry sector has not been spared by the problem of mounting debts. It is suffering the effects of government nonpayment amounting to $1.5 billion. IZEVESTIYA this week devoted the front page of its edition to the explosive situation in the military enterprises in Siberia. According to the Russian daily, the Krasmash misile factory has not been paid by the state for the 11.3 billion rubles worth of orders it supplied in 1993, and it has not been able to pay any salaries for four months. The angry workers are furious and marched on the residence of the region's governor to demand their due. The governor had to flee to Moscow where he was promised money. "But the money has still not arrived and there is no more work," IZVESTIYA reports.
