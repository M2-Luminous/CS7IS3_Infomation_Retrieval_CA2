In an exclusive interview with INTERFAX he stressed that if Russia wished, the civil war in Tajikistan could be stopped in a month. He did not rule out the possibility that the opposition might exert military pressure on Dushanbe to speed up the inter-Tajik talks. According to Turajonzoda, this was told to the Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Albert Chernyshev. He said Moscow on which the future of the country largely depends underestimates the opposition. "We do not want war or bloodshed, though we are quite strong even in Dushanbe," he said. In the opinion of Turajonzoda to prevent the inter-Tajik dialogue from following the pattern of the Georgian-Abkhaz talks the Kulyab clan that controls all key posts in the cabinet should be invited to it. He said Tajikistan should be a democratic secular state with the church separated from the state. According to Turajonzoda, the opposition does not intend to build an Islamic state because "we shall soon be entering the 21st century." He thinks Muslim traditions can be revived only with public will through referendums. "Even if we come to power through elections, we are not going to change fundamental constitutional norms, such as the freedom of the press and the functioning of parties," he said. The chief of the information department of the Tajik Foreign Ministry Zafar Saidov told INTERFAX that Dushanbe is aware of "plans of hostile actions" made by the irreconcilable wing of the armed opposition in the border zone. "Their purpose is to destabilize the situation in the country by escalating armed confrontation on the frontier," he said. Quoting reliable sources Saidov claimed that military advisors and instructors from several foreign countries have come to border areas of Afghanistan to help the Tajik armed opposition. The Tajik Foreign Ministry is also aware of the concentration of armed groups of the Islamic Renaissance Party in the immediate vicinity of the border across the Pyandzh section. According to Saidov, the ministry has reliable information about Afghan military commanders helping Tajik opposition groups carry out their hostile plans.
