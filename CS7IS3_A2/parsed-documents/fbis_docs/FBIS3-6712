The Livestock Industry Promotion Council, an advisory panel for the farm minister, is also expected to feed supply plans for the year. The panel will study the problems at sections specializing in each field, and is expected to compile recommendations by the end of the month, the officials added. As for the government-guaranteed price of milk for processing, now at 76.75 yen per kilogram, the Agricultural, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry says it can be cut, noting production costs have been falling in real terms. But producers' organizations demand an increase, asserting that a further reduction will force farmers to change jobs. In fiscal 1993, strong opposition from the Liberal Democratic Party, then ruling party, helped the price remain unchanged from the preceding year, despite the ministry's intention to lower it. Japan decides minimum prices of milk for processing and such meat as beef and pork every year. When those prices fall on the market, the government buys up those products to prevent further declines.
