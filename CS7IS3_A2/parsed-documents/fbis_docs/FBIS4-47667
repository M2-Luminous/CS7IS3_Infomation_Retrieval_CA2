Here is a report on the cabinet session, read by government spokesman N'gongo Luwowo, minister of communication and press. [Begin Luwowo recording] Under the chairmanship of His Excellency Mr. Faustin Birindwa, the prime minister and head of government, the members of the transitional executive met today, 29 April, at the Hotel du Conseil, for their weekly meeting. The following items were examined: 1. The state of the nation. 2. The situation within the High Council of the Republic- Transitional Parliament [HCR-PT]. 3. The situation in Rwanda. Moving to examine the first item, government members were informed about an increasingly greater influx of Rwandan and foreign refugees moving towards Zaire, who were searching for a haven of peace and tranquility. Goma in North Kivu and all the border towns with Rwanda are particularly affected by this influx of people -- men, women, and children -- completely in disarray and fleeing the atrocities which the various rival Rwandan factions are engaged in. Today's cabinet meeting also examined the unfortunate incidents which took place on the night of 26 April in Mbanza-Ngungu in Bas-Zaire, during which undisciplined men in uniform engaged in certain reprehensible acts. The cold storage facilities of some shops in Manza-Ngungu were looted of their contents. After rapidly bringing these undisciplined soldiers under control, the military hierarchy -- immediately after bringing the situation under control -- dispatched to Mbanza-Ngungu the chief of staff of the Army, the deputy chief of staff of the National Gendarmerie, and an intelligence officer from the General Chief of Staff Headquarters. All these officers were charged with conducting a thorough investigation into the authors behind these incidents. The same team is charged with determining the level of responsibility of all those involved, before sending them to a military tribunal for exemplary and appropriate punishment. In this regard, the Government of the Republic wants to strongly denounce the misinformation campaign recently launched by some politicians who, it says, have intentionally spread lies and false rumors, with the aim of inciting our uniformed countrymen to engage in actions that run counter to military duty and discipline. The minister in charge of relations with the HCR-PT briefed the government team on an unfortunate incident which took place yesterday at the People's Palace, where a group of parliamentary members belonging to the Sacred Union of the Radical Opposition and allies [USOR], prevented the plenary session of the transitional legislative organ from taking place. Shouting, whistling, chanting songs, and making a great amount of noise in the room, these transitional parliamentarians, some of which wore sporting outfits, pushed their irresponsibility to the point of tearing the attendance form to pieces on two occasions. There is every indication that the parliamentarians had planned this action -- they do not seem to grasp the magnitude of the nobility of their mission and the importance of the great task they shoulder. At a time when a serious economic and political crisis is hitting the country, the Zairian people have a right to expect different behavior from the assemblymen, and a different attitude within this transitional institution. In every respectable parliament other methods and language exist that are better fitted to situations which may crop up. Also, there are other means of expressing one's opinions within a parliamentary house. Until the contrary is proven, whistling, chants, and the attitudes demonstrated yesterday at the People's Palace, are not what the sovereign people of our country expect of their representatives. The search for solutions to the ills plaguing Zaire calls for a display of a minimum amount of tolerance, civility, and courtesy to those who do not share the same ideas. In conclusion, the executive members of the Transition Executive deliberated on the prevailing situation in neighboring Rwanda -- a brotherly, friendly country. The Government of the Republic is keenly following developments in Kigali, as well as in other towns and communities in Rwanda, and bitterly deplores the undescribable horrors and massacres perpetrated with impunity by armed political and military factions. The government also deplores the unexplainable indifference shown by the international community, which seems to have opted to turn its back on the immense Rwandan tragedy, while under other skies huge resources have been deployed to reduce prevailing tensions and to extinguish the fires of conflict. The Republic of Zaire calls on all peace and justice loving countries to coordinate their efforts to bring Rwandans back to understanding, concord, and peace. Zaire asks all the nations of the world to use every means at their disposal to persuade the Rwandan brothers to turn their backs on the dark path of war and tread back on the bright path of dialogue and discussion, which is the token of a just and lasting peace. The meeting started at 1000 and ended at 1500. Thank you. [end recording]
