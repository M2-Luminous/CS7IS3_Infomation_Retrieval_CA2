These activities go under the name of "The Ad Hoc Stockholm Group." In addition to Sweden, the United States, Canada, Britain, Italy, France, Germany, Denmark, Norway, Finland, and the EU [European Union] Commission take part in the group's regular meetings. The group was formed in the summer of 1992 after the CSCE meeting in Helsinki. At the meeting the Russian troop retreat had been an internal Baltic bone of contention and had been resolved through the mediation of Prime Minister Carl Bildt. How the Russian withdrawal is to be facilitated through support for retraining and homes for Russian officers has been just one of the topics on the group's agenda. All questions with a Baltic connection are discussed -- for example, the position of the Russian-speaking population in the three Baltic states, economic and social development, and environmental problems. When Prime Minister Carl Bildt declared on 17 November 1993 that Sweden could not remain neutral in a crisis in which Russia threatened the Balts' freedom, his statement must been seen against the background of the informal responsibility which Sweden has assumed. The message was that the Baltic region is not only Russia's "nearby foreign countries," it is also West Europe's "nearby foreign countries." From the Swedish viewpoint, Sweden has a very strong interest of its own in involving other Western countries in the Baltic region. "The important thing is that through this group we can make sure that Sweden and Finland are not left alone with the Baltic states in a crisis. We have now built up a working network of those dealing with the Baltic region in various countries; they simply have to lift the telephone receiver to consult each other," a Swedish government source said. The "interim" Stockholm group's meetings are held at least quarterly. Diplomats of head of department rank from the countries' foreign ministries take part in the meetings. Sweden is represented by the Foreign Ministry's political department and Carl Bildt's Cabinet Office. The existence of the group has never been acknowledged in public. Representatives of the Swedish Government confirmed its existence only after SVENSKA DAGBLADET learned about the group through foreign sources. The existence of the group has not even been common knowledge at the Foreign Ministry; from the beginning, the information was kept to a very limited circle. This high level of secrecy is in strong contrast to the government's policy of constantly stressing its active involvement on behalf of the Baltic region. The government is unwilling to comment on the group: "We do not want too much fuss about this," said one of SVENSKA DAGBLADET's sources. Another source explained why: "This is work that is being done on a very informal basis. It is supposed to be consultative and to leave a free hand for initiatives, and not be anything more official. ``Through the exchange of information, the group is a source of productive cooperation for the actions of the various countries: What talks people want to try to hold, how to proceed on certain issues, and how to act in various international forums.'' While one person in the Cabinet Office has stated that the group is a purely consultative body and does not coordinate policy, another centrally placed source says that in practice the group has drawn up the tactics for Western action. On the Swedish side, the view is that Moscow too takes a positive view of the Stockholm group, in part because of the interest in the Russian-speaking population in the Baltic states. "On the Russian side too the Swedish involvement is viewed as natural. We are not interested in pursuing a provocative policy. Our interest is to make a contribution to stability in our immediate environs," is the summary of one Swede with a knowledge of the group's work. The Stockholm group also functions as a complement to the talks Carl Bildt has with the heads of state and government of other countries. One example of this is his contacts with U.S. President Bill Clinton over the Russian troop retreat from Latvia. In February, the leaders of all eight parties in the Latvian parliament visited Washington and were received at the very highest level. This was done to persuade the Latvians to accept a U.S. compromise on the Russian troop retreat and on the Russian radar station in Skrunda (as they subsequently did). The Latvians traveled home through Stockholm. At the Swedish Government's information briefing for the mass media on 3 February, no mention was made of the fact that Assistant Under Secretary Lars Freden, the prime minister's expert on the Baltic region, had accompanied the Latvians to Washington at the invitation of the United States. Neither was there mention on that occasion of the fact that the Latvians used their stopover in Sweden to discuss their situation with 10 Western diplomats from the Stockholm group.
