This has emerged from alliance circles after the meeting of the NATO Cooperation Council in Brussels on Wednesday [25 May]. Germany had agreed with the former victorious nations that its troops in the former GDR should remain outside the integrated NATO military structure at first. After the withdrawal of the Russian troops from eastern Germany, Germany will be free to decide. The details still need to be agreed upon with NATO. Another open question is which locations will be available to the Western alliance. The number of joint maneuvers will also have to be decided.
