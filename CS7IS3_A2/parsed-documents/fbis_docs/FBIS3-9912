The federal government must urgently invest more funds in this sector, or it will be difficult for Mexico to achieve sustained economic development. According to the Association's study, the infrastructure in its current state will require sufficient funds, a desire to produce, and time to develop projects. This represents a challenge for the public and private sectors as they must play a more active role in this area. The report added that despite the advancements made by the current government, it is necessary to redouble efforts. As we approach the 21st century, there will be approximately 100 million Mexicans whose demands for infrastructure and communications services will rapidly grow. "Much remains to be done to expand investments and improve services. Federal, state, and municipal authorities, businessmen, and workers must share the responsibility. Neither the government nor the private sector can carry out the modernization alone, the report noted. In assessing the condition of the highway system, the Canacintra document said that maintenance of that system and of rural roads has been lagging for years. It adds that there are not enough roads in some parts of the country, there is lack of security in cargo and passenger transportation, and high tolls keep traffic flow on the largest freeways below capacity. There are plans to channel sufficient and timely fiscal resources to the maintenance of prioritized stretches of the federal highway system. There are also plans to improve concession guidelines based on "realistic financial analyses," in addition to reinforcing the training and moralization of the Federal Highway Police and supplying adequate equipment. In analyzing public transportation, the report notes that the equipment is obsolete, the service lacks "overall quality," very little is known about the contents of the new regulation on weights and measures, and there is limited standardization of cargo handling. In view of the importance of this activity, Canacintra has recommended that the federal government encourage equipment upgrades and reconsider the deadlines for implementing the regulations on weights and dimensions, which should then be published. The analysis also included railroads, ports, telecommunications, and the national electricity service, areas in which we are lagging behind and which therefore require attention so the productivity of enterprises is not negatively affected when they are facing international competition. The report added that expanding the infrastructure will encourage the proper use of competitive advantages already enjoyed by some productive activities in the country and will reduce inequalities in regional development. Finally, the analysis says that focusing on areas where we are behind, deregulating various areas, allowing private capital to play a more active role with the public sector, improving regulations, and expanding channeled fiscal resources are key factors in modernizing the infrastructure to strengthen Mexico's competitive position in the international community.
