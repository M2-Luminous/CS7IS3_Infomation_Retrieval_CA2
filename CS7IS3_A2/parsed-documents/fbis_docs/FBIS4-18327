This also applies to the recent irritation between Germany and France that was cleared up after some discussion. Those who were involved in Paris and Bonn are being reminded of the importance of cooperation that proved its worth in the past three decades. Yet, the two partners are also becoming aware of the difference in interests. Trying to analyze the ill feelings that have been revealed by the controversial statements of the French ambassador in Bonn brings back to mind former concerns in connection with German unification and the emergence of a larger Germany that could be heard from the political class in France after the fall of the wall. It was the old fear of the "German uncertainties" and a special German course toward the East. Those who are looking for confirmation for this latent fear in France will have no trouble finding it. Foreign Minister Genscher's pressing for international recognition of the constituent republics of the disintegrating Yugoslavia was seen as German efforts to acquire a status of supremacy in the Balkans. Similarly, one could challenge the federal chancellor's efforts to facilitate the Central and East European countries' move to get closer to the West: Where Germany pleads for cooperation on behalf of European stability, it might be trying to protect its own "lebensraum" on the basis of institutions. The discussion on enlargement and/or deepening of the European Union [EU], which is also being conducted between Bonn and Paris, is more than splitting hairs. It indicates differences in the dynamism. After the shock caused by unification, the terrified French found solace in the fact that the cost of it had a greater impact on Germany's economic strength than they had envisaged, and that they were hence left with fewer means for economic-political expansion. Those who looked further ahead realized very soon that such a consolation would become less significant as the years went by, and that what started out as a handicap would be transformed into a competitive advantage before long. Even now, trade with the East accounts for 6-7 percent of German foreign trade, while in the case of France, it is only 2.5 percent. The hesitation of the French oil concern, Elf Aquitaine, to tackle the reconstruction of the Leuna refinery, the biggest foreign investment in the new laender, is only one example of the difficulties on the new markets. France lacks the economic possibilities of restimulating the "Little Entente," the French sphere of influence between the German Reich and the Soviet Union in the era between the two wars. Independent of historic experiences and sympathies, governments and enterprises in the former East bloc are principally banking on the Germans. In this unusual situation after the end of the bipartition of Europe, the German Government has only one chance of weakening latent distrust, which exists not only in France: the readiness for close cooperation with the partners, especially with our neighbor France. Foreign Minister Kinkel emphasized this readiness in a programmatic speech in Paris and rejected "solo actions and special paths" and "thinking in terms of spheres of influence." The four-year-old offer for Franco-German coordination in the sphere of ostpolitik, which has not been sufficiently used so far, was extended by the German foreign minister to the EU: a rewarding task for the desired identity of united Europe, which is to go beyond the level of trade. What has been defined as the horizon by the German planners in careful agreement with Paris is not limited to the Central European reformist states and the Baltic Republics but, taking economic facts into account, also includes Russia and Ukraine. Time is short. The year in which Germany and then France will have the presidency in the Union provides the timeframe. With some exaggeration, one could conclude that de Gaulle's vision of a Europe "from the Atlantic to the Urals" is being taken more seriously today in Bonn than in Paris. Still, the German side is trying to avoid the impression of being fixed too much on ostpolitik. The federal foreign minister has, therefore, called for an active European policy in the Mediterranean, which was the declared objective of President Mitterrand when he first took office. The Islamic danger in Algeria shows that this cause is most urgent but also very risky. It is one of the good sides in the Franco-German relationship that the worries about the effects of German ostpolitik, which date back to the era of Bismarck, also have a positive effect for France: the understanding that Germany may pursue interests of its own in the East without bad intentions. Out of "reason of state" and a sense for "realpolitik," French politicians, based on their own experience, do show understanding, even with a slight connotation of resignation. The fact that the German view has changed since the dissolution of the East bloc is a matter of course for the French and has been accepted. In the view of the French, joint action has become very important, particularly because new possibilities have emerged for the Germans.
