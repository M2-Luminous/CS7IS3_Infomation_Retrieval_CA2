Meeting here today with John Chalsty, president of the Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette Securities Corporation, Rong said China has a huge market and its investment environment is improving, adding that from both present and long-term points of view, the prospect of trade and cooperation in economy and technology between the two countries is promising. The Chinese vice-president considered it wise that President Clinton recently declared the extension of China's MFN [most-favored nation] status and the termination of linking the MFN issue to human rights, saying that this decision is in line with fundamental interests of the two peoples and is beneficial to promoting Sino-U.S. trade and improving the two countries' relations. Rong expressed his thanks for the work that Chalsty's firm had done in extending China's MFN status. He told Chalsty that the measures China has adopted this year in the reform of finance, taxes, planning, investments and foreign trade are going smoothly. The state revenue has increased and foreign exchange rate is stable, he said. Although prices have risen, Rong said, the Chinese Government has taken effective measures to control the prices. Rong pointed out that the current work of the government is focusing on handling well the relations between reform, development and stability. Chalsty said he had held successful talks with relevant Chinese departments.
