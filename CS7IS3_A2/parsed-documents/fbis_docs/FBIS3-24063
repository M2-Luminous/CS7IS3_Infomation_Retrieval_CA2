Ganeyeva; place and date not given: "The Deal Here Was Opportune"] [Text] The topic of the day throughout the past week continued to be the treaty "Delineation of Terms of Reference and Mutual Delegation of Authority Between Organs of State Power of the Russian Federation and Organs of State Power of the Republic of Tatarstan," which was signed by the presidents of Russia and Tatarstan. This exceptional event is being evaluated by the world community positively, in the main, but within our republic there are various opinions with regard to the document that has been signed. We looked for comment in this connection from Aleksandr Tarkayev, chairman of the Trade and Industry Chamber of the Tatarstan Administrative Council and director of Dialog--one of Kazan's most important joint ventures. "I believe that the signing of the treaty by the two presidents was a most important event in the relations of Russia and Tatarstan, more important even than it would appear to all of us, perhaps. I had a call today from a director of our affiliate in Yekaterinburg; he had read about the signing of the treaty in the newspaper. His reaction was as follows: 'How good an example you have set everyone of how it is possible to resolve the most difficult problems in civilized and peaceful fashion and within the framework of legality.' This has, truly, occurred in the CIS for the first time. "This is the opinion of a person who understands pretty well, but who is not directly involved in political processes. "The treaty is an example of the victory of common sense. Generally speaking, for me and business people it is not so much the content of the treaty as the mere fact of its appearance that is important. Business people have acquired firm ground beneath their feet, when there are, finally, no questions about separation and secession from the Russian Federation. "We have truly achieved for ourselves that degree of freedom that we wanted, although with certain cuts, of course, inasmuch as this is a compromise. We would have liked somewhat more, perhaps. But ultimately each side obtained as much as it was able to bargain for itself in the course of the protracted negotiating process. And there should be no embarrassment at this word, because negotiations are, truly, bargaining. I believe that the treaty will represent a very sound basis for the further rapprochement of Russia and Tatarstan." [Ganeyeva] What, in your view, will this treaty do for the economy of Tatarstan? [Tarkayev] Deciding many questions will be far simpler for us now on the basis of this treaty. Today international organizations are investing enormous sums along the lines of every conceivable Western investment fund--the Bank of Reconstruction and Development, the World Bank, and others. And they are moving via the Russian Government--and almost all these resources are passing Tatarstan by. And it is not only a question of money here, but of involvement in particular processes of European structures also. I have observed repeatedly that Tatarstan is a republic with very strong ties to the defense industry. Our military-industrial complex is, in any event, inseparably tied to Russia's "defense." The settlement of relations with Russia by this treaty will, in addition, provide a base for the future of tens of thousands of people who work in the defense industry. And how their children are fed and clothed will depend to a large extent on the state of the defense industry and, consequently, relations with Russia. [Ganeyeva] Calling for a boycott of the coming elections, deputies of the Supreme Soviet of Tatarstan from national parties and movements are explaining this by the fact that there cannot be real sovereignty when the leadership of one republic is part of the leadership of another state. What is your attitude toward the elections? [Tarkayev] I have a positive attitude toward the elections, because Tatarstan has never imagined itself separate from Russia. When the leaders of the national movement tell me that in a separate republic we would create our own Kuwait, I tell them quite sharply: They would, at best, create a Lesotho or Transkei. Never would they create a Kuwait inside Russia and as part of Russia. I view the treaty positively for the added reason that I believe that it should be on the one hand truly a real subject of election debate and that, on the other, we will see with our own eyes what kind of support the nationalists have in reality. And, finally, what is most important from the legal standpoint. What is sovereignty? It is the supremacy of the say of a particular part of the people. If this people approves the treaty and votes in favor of representatives of the republic being part of the Federal Assembly, and if it sends Shaymiyev, Mukhametshin, or Lozovoy there, what is there more to be said in this connection by Bayramova or Tarkayev? So the coming elections should clear up a great deal and put things in their place.
