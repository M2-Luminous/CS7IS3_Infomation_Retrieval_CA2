FBIS4-15836 "drsov070_u_94004" FBIS-SOV-94-070 Daily Report 11 Apr 1994 Latvia Alteration of Yeltsin Edict Sought Alteration of Yeltsin Edict Sought LD1104182194 Riga Radio Riga Network in Latvian 1400 GMT 11 Apr 94 LD1104182194 Riga Radio Riga Network Latvian BFN [Text] Russian officials consider that with the apology for the incident that has arisen from President Boris Yeltsin's order on the creation of military bases in Latvia, the conflict has been resolved. However, Latvian officials' views are different, and Latvia intends to request the alteration of the text of the presidential order. Immediately after Russia's explanation the Latvian Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that, as Russia has already partly withdrawn Yeltsin's order, it would be logical to repeal or alter it. This was told to the Baltic News Service [BNS] by (Peteris Inkelis), first secretary at the Latvian Embassy in Moscow, today. According to Russian legislation, the published order will come into force on 13 April, which is obviously not acceptable to Latvia. According to information at the disposal of BNS, Russia intends, nevertheless, to draft an altered version of the text of Yeltsin's order. Though the alteration of the text is difficult, because neither the head of the Defense Ministry nor the Foreign Ministry nor Yeltsin himself are in Moscow at the moment. The Russian president's structures also intend to ascertain reasons for the error creeping into the presidential order. Sergey Krasavchenko, deputy head of the Yeltsin administration, even deems it possible that that was not a mere technical error, but rather a political act aimed at the disruption of the meeting between the Russian and Latvian presidents.
