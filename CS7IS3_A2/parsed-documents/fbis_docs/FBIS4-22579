At a press conference in Kiev on 30 March Levko Lukyanenko, cochairman of the Ukraine coalition of democratic forces (a total of 41 public and political organizations), said that of the 49 new people's deputies elected in the first round, 24 were nominated by democrats. From what he said we learned that before the elections Ukraine coordinated the list of candidates in 360 districts, and that overall the democrats have been able to field candidates in 430 out of 450 districts. Of those who will run in the second round, 88 are candidates agreed upon by all representatives of the Ukraine coalition, and 94 are candidates whom the democratic forces nominated as a safeguard and whom Ukraine now will support. The main criteria of democratic credentials of the candidates, according to Levko Lukyanenko, is loyalty to the idea of Ukrainian statehood, adherence to radical economic reforms, active struggle against organized crime and ecological crimes, as well as acknowledging the need for social protection of low-income strata. On the same day, a "roundtable" of leading sociologists, political scientists, and journalists was held in Kiev; its participants analyzed all available data on the candidates in the 401 remaining districts and obtained the following picture: of 801 candidates, 182 were nominated by democrats, 183--by communists, about 30--by socialists, and 83--by the Peasants Party. About 40 candidates were fielded by Leonid Kuchma and Vladimir Grinev's Interregional Reform Bloc (IBR); 140 candidates were nominated by various bodies of authority and administrative structures--both soviet and presidential (this is the so-called "power party"). Another approximately 140 candidates were either nominated by commercial structures or are, as they are called, "dark horses" behind whom there are no visibly identifiable influence groups and about whom one can only guess. At the aforementioned press conference Levko Lukyanenko said: "These elections are a lesson of the past. In the future all democratic forces must radicalize their position with respect to the authorities and become a real opposition, which could serve as a normal mechanism of cooperation in society." This sort of statement coming from one of the most influential leaders of the Ukrainian opposition and a similar position on the part of People's Rukh and other national-democratic organizations are very important for Ukraine. They inspire hope for the removal of two main shortcomings which to a large extent have defined the development of political processes over the past two to three years and have led to a protracted political crisis that threatens to grow into a constitutional one. First, close cooperation between the national-democratic and other opposition with postcommunist structures have created among the people an illusion of a "rejuvenated authority," which, in the circumstances of the absence of any significant political and economic reforms, resulted in the discrediting of the very idea of an independent Ukraine. Second, uncertainty in the ranks of the opposition created the absence of clear alternative reference points in society and scenarios for future development. This is especially true with respect to the question of economic reform. For instance, the slow "grabization" of state property by the nomenklatura and the obstacles on the road to private entrepreneurship prevented the creation of an attractive image of economic reforms, while business in the public mind today is firmly associated with the mafia or other manifestations of criminal activities. All these circumstances have led to the spread in the society of pessimism, apathy, and lack of confidence both in people's own abilities and the ability of the state and its political-economic institutions to change anything, which, naturally, creates a nourishing environment for the activities of various sorts of extremists offering the simplest forcible means of solving problems, and populists promising everything to everybody. It was during this time that the situation emerged whereby official Kiev, which keeps society from resolving conflicts by radical methods, became the center under attack both from the left--from communists, and the right--the national-radicals--while national-democrats and liberals of all colorations altogether stopped playing any perceptible role and influencing the pace of reforming society. The emergence of a well-defined opposition, which proposes its way of development based on faster reforms will help to structure both the parliament and society along the main principle: either for fast and productive reforms, or against them. Meanwhile we have learned that many district commissions--for instance, in Kharkov Oblast--set the date for the second round of voting as early as 3 April, which, on one hand, does not help a more conscious choice, but on the other, accelerates Ukraine's choice on many points.
