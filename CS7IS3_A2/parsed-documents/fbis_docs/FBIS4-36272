Seven fighter bombers flew mock raids over the al-Biqa' valley villages of al-Nabi Shit and Janta, where Hizballah has training camps, police said. Janta is located eight kilometers (around five miles) from the border with Syria. Israeli warplanes carried out reconnaissance flights over the al-Biqa' overnight Monday, less than a week after killing 32 guerrillas in a devastating raid on a Hizballah training camp in the region. Israel mounted the raid less than two weeks after its commandos snatched Moslem fundamentalist guerrilla chief al-Mustafa Dirani from his home in the al-Biqa' valley to obtain information on missing Israeli airman Ron Arad. After the air strike, guerrillas fired katyusha rockets on northern Israeli prompting the Jewish state to mass troops on its border with Lebanon and to threaten a land operation unless the rocketing stopped. Lebanon protested to the United Nations, branding the abduction and the raid acts of piracy that violated its sovereignty and called for an emergency meeting of the Security Council. But US opposition defeated a draft council resolution on Monday condemning the Israeli raid. Tension has gripped south Lebanon and dozens of families fled north fearing an Israeli operation as Beirut, Damascus and Tehran discussed ways of preventing any action which could give Israel pretext to retaliate. Hizballah, which spearheads anti-Israeli operations in south Lebanon, has vowed to avenge the blood of its "martyrs" and said the fight with Israel was open on all fronts. On Tuesday guerrillas fired 14 katyusha rockets into Israel's self-declared "security zone" in south Lebanon, causing neither casualties nor damage. Ten rockets fell on the outskirts of Marj 'Uyun, headquarters of the Israeli army and its proxy South Lebanon Army, in south Lebanon. Hizballah did not claim responsibility for the rocketing but said its guerrillas had fired around 30 mortar shells at an SLA [South Lebanon Army] outpost on the edge of the zone.
