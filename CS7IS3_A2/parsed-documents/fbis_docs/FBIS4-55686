During this visit, Russian Federation representative Churkin was informed about the views of the SKV that the Bosnian issue can be solved through political negotiations. The best evidence of that is the agreement signed in Washington, stressed Mirko Pejanovic, member of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency and SKV chairman. The Russian Federation is firmly committed to the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina within its internationally recognized borders, and the unity of the city of Sarajevo, he said. During their visit to the Russian Federation, the members of the SKV had meetings with the representatives of the Russian Orthodox Church, and informed them about the extent of destruction of the Bosniak religious shrines in Bosnia-Herzegovina. An invitation was extended to Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin during their stay in Moscow to visit Sarajevo.
