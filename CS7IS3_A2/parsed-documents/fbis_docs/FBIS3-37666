Baturin and S. Gryzunov of RIA-NOVOSTI for IZVESTIYA under the general heading "Russian Diplomacy Spares NATO the Use of Force in Bosnia and Gives Serbs a Chance"] [Text] Belgrade -- The mission of Vitaliy Churkin, the Russian President's special representative at the talks on the former Yugoslavia, has ended in success. The Bosnian Serbs have agreed to fulfill Russia's request and withdraw the heavy weapons from Sarajevo as quickly as possible in the interests of ending the bloodshed. The Russian battalion will advance to Sarajevo if the Bosnian Serbs keep their word. That is stipulated in Boris Yeltsin's message to Slobodan Milosevic, president of Serbia, and also sent to Radovan Karadzic, leader of the Bosnian Serbs, other Serb leaders, and the Serbian people. Although Serbia is not taking part in the Bosnian war, according to the assurances of its leaders, it is no secret that the Bosnian Serbs could hardly have achieved military superiority and territorial advantages without Belgrade's support. Can Moscow's latest gesture be called a slide toward a "pro-Serbian position?" Today's breakthrough by Russian diplomacy is a logical and consistent continuation of its Balkans policy, which has done far more good than the actions and statements of any other Russian organ, party, or grouping. The military from various countries operating as UN peacemaking forces in the Bosnian war are well aware that so far not a single agreement has been fulfilled here and not a single cease-fire agreement has held for long. As for what will happen this time, we shall find that out on Monday -- the day that the NATO ultimatum expires. The Russian president's message makes no mention of how far the artillery and tanks should be withdrawn, it speaks only of the "earliest possible deadline" for the withdrawal, and it is that aspect which is now the cause of disagreement between the participants in the conflict and the blue helmets. General Sir Michael Rose, the British commander of the blue helmets in Bosnia-Herzegovina, is categorical: The condition that heavy weapons be withdrawn 20 km from the center of Sarajevo must be fulfilled. At the moment, however, it is not being observed. Even now, when an unusual calm is reigning in Sarajevo, you can hardly call the Russian airborne forces' new place of deployment a holiday camp. The Muslim side stated immediately that it is not ecstatic about the contact between the Russians and the Serbs. In addition, Vitaliy Churkin has stressed that if the accords are violated and any of the Russian soldiers or any other country's servicemen are placed in danger air support [aviatsia] will immediately be summoned to their aid. Even if things work out well, the resolution of the crisis around Sarajevo is an important step but only the first step toward ending the war and achieving a political settlement in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
