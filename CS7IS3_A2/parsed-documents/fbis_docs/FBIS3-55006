Electronic devices have already replaced the traditional barbed wire in many countries. Estonia also intends to protect itself in this way. Italy, Sweden, France, and Israel have offered it their electronic systems. The government discussed these offers together with the conclusions of experts. As Prime Minister Mart Laar announced at a press conference, the only scheme for guarding the land border which deserved any attention was the one Israel had put forward. It is with Israel that negotiations will be held. According to the prime minister, electronic equipment will be set up along the full length of the border for a certain time. But the border with Latvia will in the future become unprotected. All equipment from it will be transferred to the Estonian-Russian border. Israel has also concluded a contract to supply Estonia with arms worth $50 million on credit. There are enough of them for the whole Estonian Army.
