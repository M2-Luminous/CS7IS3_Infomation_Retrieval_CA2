They said the men, all Thais, were hiding on the 8,854-ton Thai-registered cargo ship Jutha-Pariyanat, which docked at Miike Port in Omuta, Fukuoka Prefecture, at 8 P.M. Thursday. None of the 24 were crew members, the officials said. The ship is owned by the same Thai company whose cargo ship the Jutha-Jessica brought 19 Thais illegally to a port in Kumamoto, south of Fukuoka, without proper visas on January 5, they said. The 19 were arrested at a railroad station in Kumamoto early Thursday morning for not having passports with them, along with two crew members suspected of helping them get ashore. The officials said they are investigating the 24 found hiding on the Jutha-Pariyanat, which left Bangkok on January 4, on suspicion of trying to enter Japan in violation of the immigration law.
