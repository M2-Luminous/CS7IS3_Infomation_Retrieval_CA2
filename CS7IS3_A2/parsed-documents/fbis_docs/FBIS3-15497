In a speech to the Yeltsin-sponsored public chamber discussing the plight of Russian-speaking communities in Baltic states, Churkin said that in international law, Russia was perfectly right to link any economic cooperation with those countries to the treatment of Russian residents there. "Of course, economic blockades or sanctions is not the best of options, but it will be unrealistic to expect that Russia will meet those countries half-way in the face of their deliberate policy of discrimination against our compatriots", he said. Churkin said that any show of respect for members of the Russian-speaking communities there would be met with "understanding and response" in Russia. In his words, Moscow works on the assumption that ensuring human rights regardless of citizenship is a key element of internationally-recognized standards. He pointed to LIthuania's human rights record as an example. Speaking in an interview with Interfax, Churkin stressed the need to speed up the formation of a special government body responsible for solving the problem of Russian communities in former Soviet republics. He said the need for such a structure was caused by the dimension of the problem itself and necessity to rally effort by various departments. Churkin believes such a body can operate under the wing of the foreign ministry though as an independent organization.
