It expresses skepticism about the speed and progress on the path toward the targets. It says that the prior return of the European currencies to narrow fluctuation ranges, which were broken down in mid-1993 in the course of speculation waves, would be superfluous. In its business report the Bundesbank once again deals with the European Monetary system (EMS) crisis, which was mastered by considerably expanding the fluctuation ranges in the summer of 1993. It calls this solution an "idea that has been advocated by the Bundesbank in principle in internal discussions for some time." As advantages of this regulation the Bundesbank cites the isolation of hard-currency countries from a disturbing influx of money and the discouragement of currency speculation. The relatively wide fluctuation ranges were determined by those countries who want to avoid excessive intervention debts if possible in the future, because a strong decline in net currency reserves would damage their credibility. In view of the efficient and strongly integrated financial markets, a system of firm, though adjustable exchange rates is always in danger of being tested. Conversely, extended periods of stable exchange rates are better for the cohesion of the monetary union, because the potential harmony in stability can be better and more quickly observed. This also includes a rapprochement in the financial sector. As an "impressive example" for the different "financial culture" in Europe, the Bundesbank cited the British and the Germans. While in Great Britain loans with variable interest rates are widespread, in Germany there is a preference for longer-term fixed interest rates. Therefore, in Great Britain, changes in short-term interest rates, which are influenced by the central bank, have a relatively strong influence on available income, in particular since private households have relatively high debts. This has consequences for monetary policy, as the experience of the EMS crisis in 1992 show. The experiences gained so far with the wider fluctuation ranges have shown that the divergence of the exchange rates stays within narrow limits. Initial exchange rate losses in the expanded fluctuation ranges have meanwhile been largely compensated. "Whether and when" narrower fluctuation ranges can be justified again cannot yet be predicted, in the Bundesbank's opinion. First of all, it is necessary to observe over a longer test period how the market courses develop without narrow "safety fences." The risk of new turbulences should not be underestimated. One also has to ask whether a formal narrowing of fluctuation ranges is necessary at all to handle the transition toward the monetary union. Nevertheless, the Bundesbank is skeptical regarding the target of an economic and monetary union before the end of this century. It refers to the report by the EC Commission, which shows rather disappointing progress in the member countries. The situation of public finances has considerably deteriorated in all countries because of strong slumps in the economic development, reduced tax revenues, and additional state expenditures. In 11 of 12 member countries -- including the FRG -- the budgets did not fulfill the criteria of the monetary union in 1993. The Bundesbank expressed relief about the failure of the new "Union loans" to procure money in Brussels for infrastructure and environmental projects. This would have opened the door to financing the EC budget via loans in the longer term and would have undermined the urgently necessary budget discipline. "The goal of establishing a monetary union in Europe within the foreseeable future would thus be seriously endangered," the Bundesbank says.
