Looking at the sea through a window of the meeting hall, Mr. Lamassoure said that the seascape reminded him of the Atlantic coast of France. There the sea is rough but the land tranquil. Here the sea is calm but the land restless. Prime Minister Edouard Balladur has therefore asked him to visit the Baltic states in precisely this situation which has evolved after the elections in Russia. The elections brought about insecurity, to a certain extent even threats to the Baltic states, therefore, (?the minister said), France expresses support for Latvia. Speaking about relations with the European Union, Alain Lamassoure stressed that France and Germany are in favor of Latvia becoming an associate member of that organization. He indicated that France fully supports Latvia's demand for the unconditional withdrawal of the Russian army, because Latvia is a sovereign state. An acceptable timescale should be laid down for the dismantling of the Skrunda radar station; this has nothing to do with the Russian community in Latvia. President Guntis Ulmanis emphasized the security issue in Latvia and all the Baltic states, which has come to the fore due to the events of recent days. (?Therefore), the cooperation which has already started with France is of special significance for strengthening the Latvian defense forces. Alain Lamassoure reported that he will confer with the French defense minister within the next few days to prepare a document for signing on cooperation between the two countries in the sphere of defense. Speaking about the NATO Partnership for Peace plan and Latvia's involvement in this program, the minister noted that for countries which are not NATO member states this offers the possibility for obtaining new security guarantees. Touching on the issue of minorities, the French minister stressed that if the Latvian Government relies on recommendations made by the CSCE, France will be able to render more palpable support. At the end of the meeting the president recalled that France has not yet resolved the issue of the Latvian Embassy. The minister replied that action would begin quite soon to get out of the deadlock. Alain Lamassoure handed to Latvia's Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs a letter from French Prime Minister Eduard Balladur with an invitation to visit the French capital in the near future. During the talks Mr. Birkavs stressed that Latvian security has become the main priority of state policy and expressed support for the draft of the European stability pact worked out by the French prime minister.
