FR940202-2-00155 FR940202-2-00072 It may help to have various activities linked with a common theme. For example, in a victims' assistance program, participants might be engaged in the following activities: _Supporting victim services within the court, notify victims of court dates and procedures, meet and accompany victims to courtrooms, staff child care centers, follow-up on restitution orders, etc.; _Accompanying law enforcement on calls to provide immediate crisis intervention support, accompany victims to hospital or police department, make social services referrals (including to battered women's shelters), arrange lock/home repairs, assist with emergency funds, lost documents, public assistance, etc.; _Maintaining follow-up contact with victims to help identify longer-term needs; and _Assisting in operation of a victim service program; i.e., work in a family violence shelter providing child care, tutoring, transportation, vocational help; serve with a sexual assault crisis center/hotline or abused children's center. It is also possible that, within a Summer of Safety Program, there may be a number of different service activities which can positively impact the safety of the community. But make sure that the activities you are contemplating are realistic. Will they make a real difference in your communities within the short time frame of the summer? Clearly, not every problem can be solved in one summer, but appropriate responses can be developed that identify the parties responsible for necessary actions, specify and take initial steps, and evidence impact. While the range of possible effective activities is potentially limitless, below are additional examples of activities that can be started and have appreciable impact in a short time: _Involving neighborhood youth in a senior escort service; _Conducting and disseminating crime prevention surveys and information/advice; _Undertaking community clean-up efforts, focusing on graffiti, vacant lots, alleys, and other sites where fear of crime and disorder are evident; _Identifying and boarding-up abandoned properties in which drug use/trade may be occurring; _Organizing neighborhood watch-type programs; _Initiating or enhancing relationships between law enforcement and local youth organizations; _Developing a network of ``Safe Houses'' or ``Safe Corridors'' in neighborhood, and training parents and children about the program; _Developing and conducting anti-violence presentations for youth groups; _Joining with senior volunteers in intergenerational efforts designed around youth safety themes; _Developing and supervising youth activities that incorporate age-appropriate personal safety/violence prevention training; e.g., illicit drug use, impaired driving, etc.; _Establishing conflict resolution programs, including outreach, training, and ongoing activities for youth through schools and community-based youth organizations; and _Leading public safety-related field trips for youth, with appropriate orientation; e.g., to jails/prisons, police stations, courts, hospitals, family violence shelters, etc. Appendix 2 The other components of 1994 Summer of Safety which are sponsored by the Corporation for National and Community Service are briefly described below.
