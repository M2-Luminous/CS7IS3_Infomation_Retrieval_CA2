FR940920-1-00096 FR940920-1-00008 h. MACT for Mercury for Small MWC Plants. The MACT floor for Hg for small MWC plants is 1.2 mg/dscm, which is above typical uncontrolled Hg emission levels for MWC's. Therefore, no Hg control is needed to meet the MACT floor. Because acid gas/PM control systems (DSI/ESP) will be needed at small plants to meet other MACT requirements, activated carbon injection could be added to the acid gas/PM control system to achieve Hg control. The incremental cost to add activated carbon injection to control Hg at small MWC plants already equipped with acid gas/PM control is about $1.40/Mg of MSW combusted. The EPA believes that this cost is reasonable given the concerns over the bioaccumulation of Hg in the environment. In addition to the EPA's test programs to study Hg removal using SD-based scrubbing systems with activated carbon injection, the EPA has also conducted Hg performance tests of DSI-based scrubbing systems with activated carbon injection at small MWI's (Borgess, Michigan, MWI). The use of activated carbon injection with either SD-based scrubbing systems or DSI-based scrubbing systems has demonstrated greater than 85-percent Hg control. In combination, DSI/ESP systems with activated carbon injection can achieve Hg emission levels of 0.080 mg/dscm or an 85-percent reduction in Hg emissions. Therefore, the proposed MACT guideline for Hg for small MWC plants is 0.080 mg/dscm or an 85-percent reduction, whichever is less stringent. i. MACT for Dioxins/Furans for Small MWC Plants. The MACT floor for total dioxins/furans is 1,700 ng/dscm, which is above typical uncontrolled levels of about 1,000 ng/dscm. Although the MACT floor for dioxins/furans would be based on no control, DSI/ESP is already needed to meet MACT for other pollutants, and GCP are needed to meet MWC operational and CO requirements. The combination of GCP and DSI/ESP can achieve total dioxin/furan levels of less than 125 ng/dscm. As discussed above, MACT for Hg for small plants would be based on using activated carbon injection. Activated carbon injection provides additional removal of dioxins/furans beyond that achieved by the acid gas/PM control system, as discussed in the rationale for MACT for dioxins/furans for large plants. Recent tests at small MWI's using DSI systems with activated carbon injection have also shown that additional dioxin/furan removal is achieved with activated carbon injection (greater than a 50-percent reduction over levels achieved by the acid gas/PM control system). Based on the use of activated carbon injection with GCP and DSI/ESP systems, a level of 60 ng/dscm would be achievable. The EPA is proposing MACT for dioxins/furans on both a TEQ basis and a total mass basis. Based on EPA's analysis, a total dioxin/furan level of 60 ng/dscm is equivalent to 1.0 ng/dscm of dioxin/furan TEQ. Therefore, the proposed MACT guideline for MWC's at small plants is 1.0 ng/dscm of dioxin/furan TEQ or 60 ng/dscm total mass dioxins/furans.
