This was reported by company exports manager Rubem Faggiano. The .12-gauge Pomba-230 shotguns will be inspected on 21 March by the Royal Thai Army-Bangkok, and will be shipped immediately from the Port of Rio Grande. The payment will be made in cash through a letter of credit, Faggiano reported. This is the first sale Rossi has made to Thailand after winning an international bid last October. Rossi Inc. manufactures nearly 20,000 Pomba-230 shotguns per year, 7,000 of which are exported to Argentina. "New markets for this kind of weapon are opening in Africa and the Middle East," Faggiano said. Five hundred shotguns, which will be shipped in April, were sold to Papua New Guinea for $30,000, Faggiano said. Long-barrel weapons are responsible for less than 20 percent of Rossi's sales. About 3,500 of these weapons are manufactured per month. The $30 million sales Rossi made in 1993 were principally obtained through the sale of handguns, of which Rossi manufactures 20,000 to 22,000 per month. Handgun exports amounted to $18 million last year in comparison with $14 million in 1992 and $9 million in 1991. From 40 to 45 percent of the export production is sold in the U.S. market. Last January, the special Rossi 720 .44-caliber with a four-inch barrel for five shots, received an award as "the best imported handgun" from the American Fire Arms Institute [preceding four words in English] made up of U.S. weapons manufacturers. This year, Rossi will launch a .22-caliber Magnum revolver and the entire .357-caliber Magnum line with ventilated ribs and stainless steel parts. Rossi also will launch the six-bullet Snubby revolver, a .38-caliber special (SPL) small gun that weighs nearly 700 grams and which is being manufactured for five bullets so far.
