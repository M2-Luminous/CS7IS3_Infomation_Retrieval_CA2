In a statement made after his meeting with Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa today, he said that this plan will be issued as a separate resolution on Bosnia calling for an international peace conference under UN auspices. Ljubijankic expressed his hope that this resolution will enjoy international support, particularly because it receives major support from the Nonaligned Movement and the Islamic countries. Discussing the statement released by the Yugoslav Foreign Ministry regarding Egypt's refusal to invite Serbia and Montenegro to attend the conference, Ljubijankic said that Serbia is an aggressive country and it is only natural not to invite it to attend this gathering. He noted that the refusal to send an invitation was in line with the agreement reached among the nonaligned countries in New York. He said that there is an agreement among these countries not to invite Serbia. The proof of this is that none of the conference committees raised the issue, he said. Ljubijankic said that he held amicable talks with Musa on the situation in Bosnia and the topics on the summit's agenda. He pointed out that Musa affirmed Egypt's support for Bosnia, noting that an agreement was reached to open an Egyptian Embassy in Sarajevo. He expressed his satisfaction that his country was invited to participate in the Nonaligned Movement Conference. He said that Bosnia is the legal heir of the former Yugoslavia.
