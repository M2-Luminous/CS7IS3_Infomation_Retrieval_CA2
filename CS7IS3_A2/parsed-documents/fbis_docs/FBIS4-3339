This decision of the central bank was taken in view of soaring prices, said Vice-President Dai Xianglong of the bank. As some state-owned enterprises are facing increasing financial difficulties, banks will extend loans for operational funds on a case-to-case basis while continuing to tighten the control over investment in fixed assets, Dai added. Speaking at a national conference now in session here, the bank official described China's financial situation as "generally good" while "problems do exist." By the end of March, he noted, three billion yuan had been withdrawn from circulation in the spring festival shopping spree, meaning that the total amount of newly issued bank notes in circulation was 25 billion yuan less than a year ago. In the first quarter of this year, savings deposits by urban and rural residents throughout the country was 117 billion yuan more than the same 1993 period. Bank deposits by enterprises last month was 26 billion yuan more. Also in the first quarter, banks and rural credit cooperatives extended an additional 15.7 billion yuan in agricultural loans, 3.8 billion yuan more than a year ago. Key construction projects "have had better-than-expected access to funds," he said. Meanwhile, the PBC vice-president warned that investment in fixed assets, taken as a whole, was still "too large" and inflation "was showing no sign of improvement." "We must remain cool-headed," he said, asserting that the central bank would continue focusing on stabilizing the currency to ensure "an appropriate rate of economic growth."
