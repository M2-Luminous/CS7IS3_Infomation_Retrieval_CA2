Viezzoli was one of 33 persons placed in preventive custody on January 18-19 as part of investigations into contracts for the power station at Gioia Tauro on Calabria's western coast, in an area where the presence of 'Ndrangheta and some Mafia organised crime gangs is heavy. Other top ENEL executives were also detained in connection with kickbacks allegedly paid for contracts at the still unfinished plant. Charges levelled against some of their co-defendants include Mafia association and ties because most of the contracts were handed out to alleged Mafia companies. Monday's communique said the Treasury, Industry and Budget ministers met at the Treasury on Thursday and decided that Viezzoli's judicial position was "not compatible" with his position at the helm of the electricity agency -- now a joint-stock company with the Treasury as the sole shareholder and set for a market flotation some time in the not-so-distant future. For the near future, current plans see the signing of a convention with ENEL SPA to regulate its role as heir to old government agency. This would involve a new licencing arrangement with the government and would pave the way for creating a new authority to regulate electricity production. The door would then be open for the placement of the first stock, perhaps early next year, although some sources are still hoping for the end of this year. The removal of Viezzoli is just one step in this complex process. Viezzoli entered IRI [Institute for Industrial Reconstruction] in 1950 with a degree in economics and commerce and rose to be the public-sector holding company's director-general in 1964. In July 1976, he became chairman and managing-director of Finmeccanica, the IRI manufacturing and engineering arm, picking up a strategy to relaunch it in the field of advanced technologies by aeronautical agreements linking up with Boeing and Aerospatiale and energy production cooperation with Westinghouse and General Electric. At Finmeccanica, he was also responsible for the much-disputed sale of Alfa Romeo to Fiat, the first case in which a major public-sector company was sold off to the private sector. He became ENEL's chairman in January 1987 and has run it ever since, steering what is billed as the world's second-largest producer of electrical energy through shoals such as tariff policy and the difficulties of building new power-stations in a country where environmental feeling is strong enough to have imposed a moratorium by referendum on the construction of nuclear power-stations and other forms of power generation also come under close scrutiny. In a statement, Viezzoli said he was "obviously available" to fall in with whatever the government should see fit as regards the top posts in the body.
