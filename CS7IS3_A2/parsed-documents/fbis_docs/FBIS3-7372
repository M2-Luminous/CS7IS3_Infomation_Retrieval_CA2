The term refers to members of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The council has called on Australia's 200,000 Macedonians to oppose the federal government's move. The council wants members filling out official forms to use only the term Macedonia when describing their country of birth and for appeals to be lodged if government agencies failed to recognize the term. South Australia's spokesman for the Macedonian Council, Alexander Glevchev, admits the campaign may force hardship upon members of the community. [Begin Glevchev recording] Hardship is a relative term when you are a Macedonian person. We came out here many years ago -- our people escaping prosecution, starvation, and war. This hardship could be minor in relevance to that. [end recording]
