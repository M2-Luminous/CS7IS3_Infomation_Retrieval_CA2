Color TFT, the leader, has abruptly changed the market, panel technology, and materials and components technologies. If the last four to five years were the start-up phase of the first generation, the next few years will be second generation which will be an active period. In the market, the spread of new useful situations like mobile computing and green personal computers has a strong affect on the spread of liquid crystal. Liquid crystals will also be widely spread by the full-scale realization of small-sized video games and car navigation. To respond to these demands, there will be rapid progress in lowering the power consumption, widening the visual field, and lowering the reflectance of the panels. Power consumption will be 1W per VGA panel, wide viewing angle technology will become mass production technology, and products with vertical viewing angles of 80� will become common. A 2% surface reflectance has been achieved. Term 2 lines bet on by leading major panel manufacturers will begin operation in 1994 with the goal of three times the productivity as term 1 lines. Components and materials will move towards lower prices and get into full gear. New technologies like unpolished glass substrates will appear one after another. CONTENTS Part 1.

Trends and the Market Expanding the Applications Market Takes the Lead and the Technology Revolution in Panels, Components, and Materials Agreement on the market needs of thin sizes, light weights, and low power consumption LCD production is rushing headlong into the new phase called the second generation. The applications market, the panel technology, and the components and materials technologies have all changed dramatically. In addition to conventional notebook computers in the applications market, the performance of TFT color LCDs matches the new trends of mobile computing and green PCs. Moreover, the market base for the full-scale realization of car navigation will expand. Therefore, the development of panel technology for these applications is very active. Low power consumption, wide viewing angle, and low reflectance technologies are beginning to be applied to mass-produced panels. In order to expand the market, price reductions will continue for components and materials to reach ¥50,000 for 10-inch models by 1995. According to Isamu Washizuka, Sharp's executive director, LCD production is ``at the brink of rushing headlong into the second generation.'' The formation of a business base centered on TFT LCDs was completed in 1993. Hiroshi Shiba, NEC's executive director, believes the ``period of rapid progress'' will finally arrive in 1994. The production line for the second generation is starting and will, according to Koichi Suzuki, manager of Toshiba's Liquid Crystal Department, ``give form to new applications'' that will certainly reach one billion yen in production. LCD production began a few years before 1993.[.sup]1[/] If those years are designated the first generation of TFT color LCDs, the next few years beginning in 1994 will be the era of the second generation. The reason is the abrupt change in the applications market, panel technology, and components and materials technologies. Dramatic change in the market, panel technology, and components and materials technologies In the applications market, in addition to laptop and notebook personal computers and compact portable televisions, the core of the TFT color LCD market in the first generation, the market is strongly advancing with products that incorporate new ideas about mobile computing in the second generation (Figs. 1 and 2). The market will expand for TFT LCD camera video and portable game devices, as well as for vehicle-installed market through the realization of car navigation. In order to provide energy savings in offices and to avoid the spread of electromagnetic radiation that is becoming a problem of CRTs, desktop personal computers that use TFT LCDs have appeared in accordance with the Energy Star Program in the United States. Even in the desktop world where CRTs are unrivaled, the conversion to color TFTs will gain headway in the future. According to a survey conducted by the Japan Electronic Machinery Manufacturer's Association, if the price of color TFTs for 10-inch VGA (640x480 pixels) becomes ¥60,000, the scale of that year's demand will approach ¥800 billion.[.sup]2[/] Only TFT color LCDs will reach one trillion yen in 1996. In addition to advancing towards mobility, panel technology will improve the visibility and enhance the portability, then it will be applied to mass production (Fig. 3). Advances in low power consumption are continuing to realize portability and in wider viewing angles and lower reflectance for better visibility. To expand the market, panel manufacturers will start term 2 lines which are full-scale mass production lines in 1994 (Table 1). To lower the costs of the panels to be produced, in addition to improving line productivity and yield, lowering the prices of parts and materials will become decisive. These hard to decrease prices will finally begin to fall in 1994 (Fig. 4). ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 1.

[.sup]*[/]The investment, the beginning of const-| |ruction, the operating period, and the level of mass production by San-| |sei Denshi is estimated for this article. | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- The LCD market opened up by mobile and green PCs In the future, information devices that can be used ``anytime, anywhere, by anyone'' will open up a large market directed at individuals. A concrete image of the mobile computing to accomplish this has appeared. Regardless of whether thinness, light weight, low consumption power, and rich expressive power for implementing portability are obtained, there will be no expansion without color LCD panels. Improving the portability of conventional personal computers was clearly shown in the marketing of subnotebook computers which are more compact than notebook computers. IBM Japan began to manufacture ThinkPad 220 last May. It uses a 7.7-inch, VGA-compatible STN-monochrome LCD manufactured by Kyocera. As a result, Chikara Maruyama, executive director of the Personal Systems Division of IBM Japan Information Systems, stated the true meaning is the move into high-level personal computers that can be carried around. Of course, the Windows operating system and applications used on desktop personal computers will be used unchanged and the office environment can be reproduced anywhere. LCD panels somewhat smaller than conventional 10-inch class are used. In the 10-inch class, the 8.4-inch panel from Sharp can be diverted unchanged for use in subnotebooks. On the other hand, personal digital assistants (PDA), the electronic notebooks, also were beginning to appear on the market in 1993. MessagePad from Apple Computer, Inc. in the US seems to be getting underway favorably with orders for several thousand a week since they went on sale in August.[.sup]3[/] Sharp's PI-3000 is a portable information device for everyday use. The ¥65,000 price will be cheaper than those of conventional products and enter the same price range as advanced system notebooks.[.sup]4[/] Although it can be only used as at close distances, an infrared data communication function is also supplied. Still, STN-monochrome displays are the only displays used in the PDA field. If viewed by eyes accustomed to the office environment that is moving towards color, Katsuichi Tomida, sales promotion manager at NEC Personal Computer Sales Promotion, feels it is obvious that ``these monochrome displays will become unsatisfactory within the next one to two years.'' Even with price concessions, Sharp's Mr. Washizuka believes ``the wave towards color TFTs will even advance into portable information devices.'' The trend of green computers that considers energy savings in offices and improved environmental conservation is strong motivation for converting the CRTs in desktop computers to TFT color LCDs.[.sup]5[/] In the future, Mr. Maruyama of IBM Japan's Information Systems sees these trends ``gradually expanding and permeating'' throughout the world under government direction. This is a model market example capable of demonstrating the true value of LCD panels. In addition, new proposals are also appearing where LCDs will eat into the desktop market but not as replacements (see pp. 74-75 for details). Outdoor measures that adopt new technologies Even in the amusement field, the demand for carrying displays outdoors has become strong. The demand for color was strong from the beginning. In contrast to character-based PDAs that transmit information, the objective is to enjoy images and graphics. In addition to portability, moving images and full-color screens are demanded. TFT color LCDs are being advanced by PDAs at this time. New technologies were installed in the LCD ViewCam made by Sharp for full-scale outdoor use. One technology is antireflective processing of the screen's surface by multilayer film to prevent the reflection of external light.[.sup]6[/] According to Yoshio Okano, Sharp's A1176 Project team leader, anti-flare processing in conventional OA ``cannot handle strong sunlight.''[.sup]7[/] Also, a semihot tube with low power consumption was used in the backlight lamp for high luminance; an Ushio Denki product is used. The realization of the car navigation market was apparent. The market scale was 150,000 to 160,000 units/year in 1993; this will rapidly expand to about 500,000 units/year in 1995 and one million units/year in 2000 (Matsushita Communications Industries). Since a prerequisite of navigation systems is use will be in narrow vehicles and highly accurate color is required in displays of map information, TFT color LCDs will be used. Although today the only function available confirms the position of the vehicle on a screen, in addition to the infrastructure provisions of traffic information like vehicle information and communication systems (VICS), more varied service can be provided.[.sup]8[/] Based on this, market expansion can be expected by opening the market beyond the conventional navigation function. Furthermore, by combining with the cellular phone network, individual data communication becomes possible and the car becomes a ``moving office'' (Susumu Nakata, business manager of Automotive Devices Division of Matsushita Communications). Because the developments for information systems that accomplish the uses of personal computers can be expected, the market expansion effect will be huge for TFT color LCDs. Advances in portable technology and lower costs In panel technology aimed at these markets, low power consumption that reached 1W in VGA-compatible panels and a 2% screen reflectance made outdoor use possible (for details see ``Rapid Advances of TFT in the Second Generation: Reflective Color To Be Marketed by 1996,'' pp. 76-82). Term 2 lines of major panel manufacturers will finally start up one after another beginning in 1994 (see the article on pp. 71-73). In these lines, productivity will be three times better than term 1 lines. In addition, the mother glass will be larger and the processing capacity of the production equipment will be increased substantially. In order to achieve the ¥50,000 goal for 10-inch panels in 1995, the prices of materials and components which were difficult to decrease from 1991 to 1993 will finally begin to decrease by 20% annually. The material manufacturers will introduce new technology that can decrease costs in each field (see ``Successive Technologies Like Unpolished Glass Target ¥50,000 Panels'' on pp. 83-87). The application to mass production will begin sometime in 1994. Footnotes 1. After the triumph of TFT color LCDs over the various types of flat-panel displays in 1990, investments were made to begin operating large-scale mass production factories. The ability to obtain over 50% yield in large-scale lines was confirmed by 1992. The market rapidly expanded in 1993 primarily because of notebook personal computers. The 1993 production costs for TFT LCDs at Sharp, the largest LCD maker, are ¥100 billion. This was the first sign of a reversal from simple matrix models centered for STNs costing on 75 billion yen. 2. ``R&D Report on the Year 2000 Vision for Electronic Display Production,'' Japan Electronic Machinery Manufacturers Association, pp. 1-26, July 1993. 3.

This is the name of the series of low-power consumption personal computers developed at IBM Co. in the US in accordance with the Energy Star Program of the US Environmental Protection Agency. 6. This method prevents reflection by forming multiple films on a polarizer of the liquid crystal module by vapor deposition and lowers the reflection of external light. 7. Although this method prevents the reflection of external light as in antireflective processing, the unevenness on the surface of the screen in this method and scatters reflected light. Therefore, production is less costly, but there are the problems of a decrease in the effect of decreasing reflected light, lower panel transmittance, and lower resolution of the screen. 8. This system supplies in real-time traffic information to drivers and is promoted by the National Police Agency, Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, and the Ministry of Construction. Traffic congestion information, accident information, regulation information, and parking information are included in the data. Information is supplied by radio by beacons, multiplexed FM transmission, and tele-terminals. A navigation system equipped with a communication terminal is required at the receiver. With the objective of full-scale operation in 1995, the related ministries and agencies are consulting with each other. Rapid Advances of TFT in the Second Generation: Reflective Color To Be Marketed by 1996 Isamu Washizuka, Executive Director at Sharp LCDs have entered the second generation. During the first generation which began in 1988, TFT color LCDs matured while contributing to STN LCDs. In the future, TFTs will advance rapidly not as simple parts, but for widespread use as important components in products (Fig. A). In 1996, the TFT market will exceed ¥700 billion. Seventy percent will be VGA or half VGA (320x240 pixels) screens. The price of 10-inch models will without a doubt become ¥50,000 by the end of 1995 to 1996, and a total of 10 million units will be sold annually. There are two major sources of energy at work in the LCD industry as we move towards this 1996 market. The first is development to replace CRT monitors larger than 10.4 inches. Because of activity to promote energy conservation by office automation equipment in Europe and in the United States, using LCDs in desktop monitors has become important. Since it is possible both VGA and XGA will be required, the preparation of XGA panels must be guaranteed. The second source is the development of reflective color for portable information terminals, like PDAs. To ensure portability, backlights must not be used and power consumption must be on the order of milliwatts. The development of internal drivers by low temperature polycrystalline Si is indispensable. Even in areas where 6- or 7-inch VGA or half VGA panels are used, TFTs are likely winners. Reviving LSI Technology Supporting Both High Image Quality and Low Cost Hiroshi Shiba, Executive Director at NEC TFT color LCDs will become a major product for the next dozen years and the future is truly looked forward to. While laying the foundation of the business lasted through 1993, the plan is to launch stabilization and expansion in 1994 (Fig. B). Since personal computers are steadily becoming notebook sized and gaining color, the urgency is great. The term 2 line at Kagoshima was settled in three months and operations began in December 1993. Investment up to 1996 will total 110 billion yen and a system will be established for a monthly production of 170 to 180 thousand panels at the shipping base. Next, effort will be made to develop audio visual equipment using analog full-color technology. Since polishing is performed in conventional LCD technology, the business of panels for OA equipment has shrunk. In the future, the image field including multimedia will be reclaimed. For example, 6.5-inch VGA panels for use in subnotebooks can also be used in high-resolution personal televisions. Basically, LSI technology that has been fostered is used freely and will coexist with lowering costs while pursuing highest image quality. Therefore, when the panel has as simple a structure as possible, the burden of improving the images is on LSI. Since the price of an LSI is determined by its chip area, no matter how good the circuitry's performance is, costs can be reduced if size is reduced. Although the reliance on parts is the same at other companies, LSI is a unique field where as much invention as possible occurs. Three Times the Productivity Confirmed for the Term 2 Line: Largest Panel Size with 4 Bevels Koichi Suzuki, Manager in Toshiba's LCD Division In 1994, LCD panels will begin to directly respond to new demands. The second generation line will start and a new market will be created (Fig. C). The established goal was to realize three times the productivity in the term 2 line. Verification took place in the prototype line at the Fukaya Works. By improving productivity, 1.5 million 9.4-inch panels can be shipped annually by DTI's term 2 line. The term 3 line will have larger glass substrates and five times the productivity of the term 1 line is expected. However, the operating period will probably be 1997 at the earliest. Equipment development will not catch up. The term 2.5 line is designed to fill the gap. Glass substrate dimensions are not changed from the term 2 line. The 1995 target of ¥50,000 for only the 10-inch class has the productivity of the term 2 line. Moreover, its realization is possible with the added condition of a decrease in the price of color filters. In fact, the prices of color filters are not decreasing at all. Therefore, purchasing from outside is also expected in the future. As expected, 9.4-inch VGA panels for notebook personal computers will continue to be the royal road. But users demand large panels like the 10.4-inch panel in IBM's ThinkPad. In order to have panels that are as large as possible within an A4-sized frame, the largest panel size having 4 bevels from 360x465 mm[.sup]2[/] is also being studied. The Multiple Display System: Proposal for a New Use of LCD Panels Norihiko Naono A display system is proposed that is flexibly expandable by software. The objective is to satisfy the demands of the users of operating system with multitasking environments like Windows. Multiple applications can be used simultaneously in multiple windows in a multitasking environment. However, a large area, high resolution display is required and the price of this kind of CRT monitor remains high. We come to only think of the form of one display in one computer. This display is suited to the desk in a GUI environment. If many documents are opened on a narrow desk, work efficiency drops. Buying a large desk as a replacement is good, however, a high price must be tolerated. The fundamental idea behind this system is to provide a winged desk corresponding to the task. Thin, lightweight LCDs are suited to this task. Fig. D shows a specific product conception. In this system, work is possible while simultaneously looking at displays of different windows. The program manager, calculator, and schedule management is normally displayed on a small display. The wordprocessor and spreadsheet can be displayed in separate windows, and a both can be referenced when documents and graphs are created. By buying a large monitor, new area can be obtained inexpensively. This system does not require particularly new technology. An interface card equipped with multiple display controllers and Windows display drivers is acceptable. Only board design and building drivers are required. The huge desktop PC AT market will immediately become a new application market for LCD panels. Memory and hard disks can be expanded in response to need, only excluding the display is unreasonable. If this system is accepted, I believe an extremely large market can be cultivated. Note. This proposal is currently being investigated. For a detailed discussion, see Flat Panel Displays 1994 (Nikkei BP) and the report from the Nomura Research Institute to be published in February. Part 2. Panel Technology The Push to 1W Power Consumption and Wide Viewing Angles in Mass-Produced Products Term 2 line targets three times the productivity Hiroshi Asakura By combining TFT color LCDs with the second generation application environment that stresses portability and high visibility, lower power consumption, wider viewing angles, and lower reflection are rapidly advancing. VGA panels with a low 1.5W power consumption have been implemented and is entering the stage where portable use is possible. Wide viewing angle technology that achieves about twice the conventional viewing angle is increasingly being installed in mass-produced panels. Low reflectance reached 2%, one-tenth the conventional reflectance. The objective was to achieve the goal of increasing the productivity of the mass production line to three times that of the term 1 line. The evaluation of the wafer processing equipment that handles the 4-beveled glass substrate has ended and an 80% yield seems possible. TFT color LCD panel technology will be dramatically different in the second generation. With the appearance of mobile computing, the use environment is changing from the fixed environment on a desk to the mobile environment that is carried outdoors. TFT panels are spurring portability and improved visibility (Fig. 1). To improve portability, lower power consumption is being advanced to extend the battery drive time in particular. The power consumption of TFT panels is cut in half by using one backlight instead of two. Cuts of 2W in VGA panels are appearing. The technology revolution in wider viewing angles and lower reflectance for improving visual confirmation is remarkable. Since a wider viewing angle is ``required in portable devices where the viewing angle differs with the use,'' asserts Seiya Hijikawa, a director at Sharp, each company is quickly moving to the mass production of panels. Without accelerating the process, mass production of technology that doubles the visual angle will follow in 1994. Lowering the reflectance will be indispensable technology particularly for use in an outdoor environment. The technology to lower the surface reflectance to 1/10 is suited to products. The term 2 lines of major panel manufacturers that include these technologies will finally be operating in 1994 (Fig. 2). The industry objective of ¥50,000 10-inch VGA panels in 1995 will be achieved and productivity will improve significantly. The aim was a three-fold improvement in productivity over the term 1 lines. From one backlight to reflective color The TFT panel's backlight is being converted to one fluorescent light; this will cut power consumption in half in second generation panels. By pursuing better image quality, luminance is sacrificed, but designs that stress low power consumption are encouraged. Sharp has a 6.4-inch, VGA-compatible color panel with a converging lens film that produces an image luminance of 70 cd/m[.sup]2[/] using only 1.5W. The vignetting factor of a TFT panel is 35%. Mass production will begin in the middle of 1994. In the future, Sharp will increase the vignetting factor to 40%. Given the objective of a less than 1W reflective STN-monochrome that can be driven by a genuine dry cell battery drive, Isamu Washizuka, Sharp's executive director, has handed down the order to ``quickly develop a reflective color panel that does not use backlights.'' He expressed the desire ``to see its realization using the TFT method by 1996.'' Casio Computer attracted attention by exhibiting a reflective color panel at Electronics Show '93. Since the reverse of the coloring effect is used by the double diffraction effect of an STN LCD, colors are changed by the magnitude of the voltage. According to Susumu Mineo, executive director of Casio Computer, a 64x64 dot matrix display has already been implemented (Fig. 3) and will be marketed in the fall of 1994. Its power consumption is that same as that of reflective STN-monochrome. Mass production at each company moves towards wide viewing angle panels After 1994, the mass production of wide viewing angle panels will follow. Until now, techniques where the production process becomes complex were applied to a portion of high quality panels. However, processes that are not processes added in the second generation have been developed for mass-produced panels (Table 1). Table 1.

Both Sharp and Sanyo Denki used conventional equipment unchanged and developed technology to widen the viewing angle without expanding the process. Sharp only changed the molding process conditions for oriented film and increased the vertical viewing angle to 80�. Beginning in the spring of 1994, this process will be adopted in products (see article on p. 79). Sanyo Denki uses a method to expand the vertical viewing angle to 100� by only changing the opposing poles' mask patterns. Panel reflectance will be instantly lowered to 1/10 in the second generation. Processing was developed to prevent reflection by the black matrix that produced the largest reflectance so far and by the polarizer. The black matrix was one layer of conventional chromium (Cr), but has a lower reflectance in a two-layered structure with Cr oxidized film. Reflection prevention for the polarizer is an effective method where an inorganic film is formed by multilayered vapor deposition. A method to remove the protective layer on the front surface was also fabricated (see article on p. 80). Since the multilayered vapor deposition process is a batch process, the manufacturing cost of the polarizer jumps up three- to ten-fold depending on the production quantity. Future development of the coating method for the multilayered film will be active from the cost side. Three-fold productivity improvement realized in term 2 line Term 2 lines for TFT panels that will operate in 1994 will immediately improve productivity by three fold. The evaluation of equipment where the 9.4-inch panel has 4 bevels is almost finished. Koichi Suzuki, manager in Toshiba's Liquid Crystal Department, is confident that the three-fold improvement in productivity can be proven in the prototype line. Then, in the term 3 lines, the objectives will be for each company to make larger substrates and line fabrication with 6 to 9 bevels for the 10-inch class (see pp. 81-82 for details). Technology To Widen Viewing Angle Stressed Productivity and Multi Domain Model Doubled the Vertical Viewing Angle Shigemitsu Mizushima, Sharp Liquid Crystal Division, TFT Development Center Technology is being developed to widen the viewing angle of TFT color LCD panels that maintain exceptional productivity with the goal of implementing them by the spring of 1994. A vertical viewing angle of 80�, which is twice the conventional angle, was achieved. Specifically, the method developed this time uses the conventional TN display mode. The viewing angle characteristic was improved by nonuniformly orienting the liquid crystal molecules that had been uniformly oriented. Since fluctuations in the electro-optical characteristics that arise by the nonuniform orientation of liquid crystal molecules are visually averaged in one pixel, the viewing angle characteristic can be improved. By designing this kind of nonuniform liquid crystal molecule orientation, a wide viewing angle characteristic is obtained. In the actual process, the coating process for a conventional oriented film is used and only the material preparation for the preceding and following processes and the process conditions are changed. In this method, an oriented film with a nonuniform orientation direction is fabricated and the orientation of the liquid crystal molecules are nonuniform. There is no additional processing like exposure and the rubbing process is performed once. Since the wait process which is the source of impurities is not needed, the increase in production cost is small and the reliability does not decrease. Moreover, since existing production facilities can be used with almost no changes and the process is slightly changed, the effect is small on the production process that has been mastered. The display performance obtained by this process does not deteriorate the basic electro-optical characteristics compared to previous products, but only the viewing angle characteristics can be improved (Fig. 4, Table 2). In addition, the design specifications for the module power consumption and driving voltage are not affected. The data in Table 2 are examples of the TFT panel characteristics used in this method. By changing the orientation design of the liquid crystal, a viewing angle characteristic suited to the use can be obtained. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 2.

By changing the LCD orientation design, a wide viewing | |angle feature suited to practical use can by obtained. | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- Technology for wider viewing angles is basically considered to be technology that must be installed in all TFT panels. This technology does not expand the full-scale process, use special materials, lower quality, or lower reliability. A wide viewing angle technology is desired in the basic specification that doesn't require a major revision of existing lines constructed with substantial investments. Of the various proposed methods that are advancing development towards realization, which will be the one to take the lead depends on future research and development. Currently, this method has advantages over other methods. Surface Reflectance Lowered to 1/10 by AR Processing, Making Outdoor Use of TFT Panels Possible Hideki Yakushigawa, Sharp Liquid Crystal Division, TFT Development Center By lowering the reflectance and increasing the luminance of TFT color LCD panels, their visibility outdoors will improve markedly. They can be used outdoors even without a hood. The liquid crystal ViewCam would probably never have been born without this technology. In a conventional TFT color LCD, incident light is reflected at the interface between the front protective layer and the air layer and at the surface of the polarizer (Fig. 5). In terms of the transmittance of the polarizer, light that reaches the glass on the color filter side becomes about 44% of all the incident light on the panel. Since the reflectance is about 30% because of the black matrix, the reflected light is again returned to the display's surface. The total amount of reflected light that reaches the display's surface that included the light reflected at each interface reaches 23.3% of the incident light. The characteristics of low reflectance panel (Fig. 6) developed here are lower reflectance of the black matrix and a polarizer processed with low reflectance coating, and the elimination of the air layer interface where reflectance takes place by removing the front protective layer. The low reflectance coating is called antireflective (AR) processing. The principle used is reflected light is absorbed by interference of the light in multiple layers of film. The antireflective process is widely used in panels intended for OA to prevent reflections. The antireflective process simply scatters the incident light and reduces reflection by directly decreasing the reflection of the illumination and sunlight. By using these antireflective processing in the liquid crystal ViewCam, the reflectance of the whole display was reduced to 2.6%. The current reflectance which is close to 10% made using TFT LCDs outdoors possible. However, this is considered to be unsatisfactory with the reflections of direct sunlight on clear days. The goal is reflectance below 1%. 300% Productivity Achieved in Term 2 Line with Larger Substrates and Equipment with Improved Processing Performance Yoshiaki Kobayashi, Toshiba LCD Technology Division Productivity in term 2 mass production line for TFT color LCDs improved 300% over the term 1 line (Fig. 7). There were a number of indications of the many problems found in the term 1 line. The TFT array process in particular is a process that created one million transistors in the 10-inch LCD panel and that process equipment is significantly inferior to LSI (Table 3). ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |Table 3.

Growing equipment, especially, had to be drasticall-| |y improved. Through joint development with the equipment manufacturers, the | |small-scale wafer equipment for the term 2 line achieved resource conservat-| |ion, energy savings, and space savings. | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Productivity in term 2 line increased 300% Along with expanding the market for TFT color LCDs, positioning the term 2 line can be viewed as the production line on which hangs the survival of each company. By pursuing performance and costs in color CRTs that already exist, the market for TFT color LCDs will be more certain. The construction of a line with 300% improved productivity was the aim of the term 2 line. First, the productivity index per equipment investment increased 300% in the array process that commanded a large investment (Fig. 8). Next, in the cell process that advances the development of the line, the productivity index per hour increased 300%. In module processes requiring many workers, the productivity index per worker increased 300%. Here, the productivity index represents the product of the number of panel bevels per mother glass substrate, the number of glass substrates processed per hour, the operating rate, and the yield. This equals the product of the number of processed panels per hour and the yield. Making larger glass substrates and saving space The specific measure to improve to 300% began by first increasing the size of the glass substrate that can double the number of bevels from 2 bevels in the conventional 9.4-inch to 4 bevels. Second, the equipment for growing film represented by CVD equipment and sputter equipment is replaced by more compact wafer equipment with improved operating rates, more stable performance, particle suppression, improved maintenance, and decreased running costs. The result enabled resource conservation, energy savings, and space savings. Third, the focus of the lithography process is the importance of improving the transport method and the line duct with revamped processing. Fourth, various inline inspection devices, such as optical pattern inspection devices and dust monitors, were developed and introduced. These are essential tools for the process to have auto-termination. Fifth, CIM that includes monitoring the process conditions and lot tracking is active and the yield was improved. While the equipment still has a low degree of completion, it is crucial to suppress fluctuations in the process conditions. Sixth, in expanding the types of manufactured products, automation of the cell and module processes to improve productivity is critical. In order to handle a variety of products in the module process, in particular, equipment that takes plan changes into consideration was developed. Larger substrates in the term 3 line The 500% improvement in productivity, which is target for the term 3 line will be achieved by (a) increasing the substrate size from the 2 bevels of the 9.4-inch panel to 6 bevels, (b) improving the throughput by increasing the tact time and improving equipment performance like improved yield, and (c) decreasing the number of process steps with the intent of decreasing the total investment. Specifically, the first result of (a) is over 300% productivity, and (b) and (c) each increase productivity by 130%, for a total improvement in productivity of 500%. To decrease the total production cost, the costs of components and materials will also decrease. In the development of equipment for the term 2 line, the technology development for the term 3 line and the specific investigations have begun. The main points are (1) increasing productivity by using large-scale substrates, (2) decreasing initial investments and running costs by effectively using clean room, (3) decreasing the power, indirect materials, and chemical expenses, (4) decreasing the number of process steps and integrating the processes, (5) introducing low cost processes and decreasing equipment prices, (6) improving equipment reliability and maintaining a high operating rate, (7) overall development of CIM and AGV, and (8) application to a large variety of cell and module processes. In the term 2 line, a 360x465 mm[.sup]2[/] glass substrate that has a 9.4-inch panel with 4 bevels was selected. The substrate size will be made larger in the term 3 line depending on which panel size is optimum. After developing equipment using the 360x465 mm[.sup]2[/] for the term 2 line, the substrate size in the term 3 line will be determined based on when the equipment manufacturer can develop equipment for the substrate size. The problem is how will the panel manufacturers standardize the next term's substrate size. Although one candidate is 500x600mm[.sup]2[/], recently, the change will probably be to 360x465 mm[.sup]2[/], the size used in term 2. Part 3. Parts and Materials Technologies Successive Technologies Like Unpolished Glass Target ¥50,000 Panels Solving the problem of standardizing various specifications Katsuhiro Nozaki The prices of components and materials for TFT color panels, that were hard to bring down from 1991 to 1993, have started to move towards the goal of ¥50,000 in 1995. Added to the effect of mass production by expanding the market, large price decreases can be expected by introducing new technology. The glass substrate is not subjected to polishing or annealing, for a target cost decrease of 40%. The color filter also introduces a printing process and electrodeposition to move towards a 40% cost decrease and a productivity improvement. Now, one backlight with a brighter lamp improved the transmittance of the unit. Advances are being made in the direction of cutting ¥2,000 during 1994. On the other hand, the trail of high additional costs was discovered, for instance, the nonreflecting polarizer. The prices of components and materials used to build the second generation TFT color LCD panels are moving the panel price to ¥50,000 for 10-inch models in 1995 (Fig. 1). Starting in 1994, panel manufacturers will charge headlong into full-scale production. Parts manufacturers who are confident of an expanding market will finally begin to decrease costs. However, ¥50,000 cannot be reached only by the effect of mass production. New technologies must be developed in each field that will make price cuts possible. Many prototype components and materials introduced by new technologies in 1993 will be incorporated into products during 1994. Glass substrates that further no polishing First, the prices of glass substrates will start to move. The direction is towards shortening the process by eliminating polishing the glass in order to lower prices and to increase the melting and molding yield. While each company adopts both, the established targets are a price of ¥3,000 for 10-inch models in 1992 and reach half that price, ¥1,500, in 1994 and 1995. Corning, Inc., the largest manufacturer, and NH Technoglass have put effort into eliminating polishing. At the beginning of 1993, Corning already began to apply this technique to mass production. By improving the melting and molding processes, flat, clean surfaces were obtained immediately after molding. Koya Iwai, business and planning manager at Corning Japan believes the process that eliminated the annealing process will be applied to mass production at the end of 1994. Overall, costs can be decreased 40%. At the earliest, NH Technoglass will also use unpolished glass in mass production in the spring of 1994. Takao Sakamoto, executive director of technology at NEC Glass, states that NEC Glass effectively decreased costs by improving glass melting and molding yield. The yield that was usually less than 50% will be increased to about 60 to 70%. Therefore, a multihead furnace for melting and molding was developed. Since the large furnace can handle all models in contrast to the small furnace that differs with each conventional model, the contact area with the furnace wall becomes small and there are few defects. Activity has begun to introduce a printing method (see p. 85) and electrodeposition. The goal is to decrease production costs by 40%. Masatake Nagao, executive director of Dai Nippon Printing, would like to see the current cost of ¥20,000 for a 10-inch model fall to ¥7,000 sometime in 1995 or 1996. The application to mass production will proceed in 1994. According to the business division of Toppan Printing Electronics, another direction is towards decreasing the costs in the pigment dispersion process. The cost of materials and the quantity used will decrease. Also, by cleaning, the yield will be increased from 60% to 80%; this will be 10% of the panel's price in 1995. Backlight unit converts to one light The plan is to lower the ¥3,000 price of the 10-inch model in the backlight unit to below ¥2,000 sometime in 1994. The whole unit will convert to one light. The effect of increasing the unit's transmittance and the lamp's luminance will be significant. Masahiro Tomatsu, deputy manager of technology at Fujitsu Kasei, states a 30% decrease in cost is possible by using one light. The mainstream of light conducting planes is moving towards the molding process. This is already beginning to be applied to mass-produced products for small 4-inch panels. Koichi Matsui, deputy director at Meitaku Systems, states that 10-inch molded products will be rushed to market during 1994. However, because production efficiency is low, by standardizing the size and shape, according to Hiroshi Kikuchi, manager of the Backlight Department at Empress Optonics, the lot is collected and there is an effect on large-scale mass production. There is also a manufacturer who will eliminate the light conducting plate (see p. 86). The polarizer which affects the transmittance of the whole panel is being increased in price by efforts to lower its reflectance (see p. 87). Since there is a 3- to 10-fold jump in unit cost, lower costs will be introduced into the coating process. Reducing the Average Cost Targeting a 40% Production Cost Reduction by Introducing a Printing Process Takuya Hamaguchi, Micro Products Division, Dai Nippon Printing The goal is to reduce production costs by 40% by changing the manufacturing process for color filters to a printing method. The characteristics and costs of the currently popular pigment dispersion method were compared to the printing method (Table 1). Although the printing method is inferior in terms of quality and precision than the pigment dispersion method, when productivity is considered, the possibility of lowering costs is highest. The currently popular offset method is made practical by planographic printing and engraved printing (Fig. 2). ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 1. Features of Printing Methods for Color Filters | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Item | |Printing Method |Pigment Dispersio-| | | | |n Method | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Quality |Spectral Characte-|O |O | | |ristic | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Resolution |_D_ |O | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Dimension Pitch A-|_D_ |O | | |ccuracy | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Surface Shape |_D_ |O | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Durability, light |O |O | | |resistance, chemi-| | | | |cal resistance | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Process Equipment |Equipment Cost |O |_D_ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Number of Process-|O |_D_ | | |es | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Materials Costs |O |_D_ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Handles Large Sub-|O |_D_-O | | |strates | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |The pigment dispersion method which is currently popular as the color filt-| |er manufacturing method was compared in terms of features and cost. The pr-| |inting method is still worse than the pigment dispersion method in term of | |quality, but it possesses many advantages on the production side. | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- In terms of precision, although the printing method can have a resolution of 15 to 30�m patterns, problems remain in dimensional stability and linearity of patterns in each printing. If the line width is about 100�m, precision below 8% can be guaranteed. In addition, since a rubber blanket cylinder is introduced in offset printing, the transfer pattern expands and contracts. Because the pitch accuracy is changed from several tens of micrometers per 400mm. However, the application to fine patterns is still difficult. A remaining problem is the cross-sectional shapes of striped patterns become semicylindrical. Therefore, after RGB printing, the processes of flattening with a roll, polishing, and applying an overcoat layer are performed. From the perspective of quality, exterior defects like bumps, unevenness, pin holes are problems. Since these originate in the printing process, materials, and operating precision of the printing machinery, they are handled by improving precision. Dealing with lower material costs and standardization To lower costs, first, the number of process are increased to flatten the surface shape. However, this leads to concern about cost increases and lower yields. So the costs for leveling and processing of the ink material are lowered. Secondly, overall there are improvements in the precision of processes, materials, and printing machines with respect to defects that influence the yield. Thirdly, an advance towards the standardization of glass plate sizes and characteristics is required. The substrate size in the term 2 line is moving in the direction of unification. However, the light distribution characteristics and film will differ with each manufacturer. Standardization by the main panel manufacturers are desired. Fourth, decreasing the cost of the black matrix will become important. Plans must be put into place to decrease the cost of the whole filter by combining with a low cost black matrix. Decisive Development of a Thin, Lightweight, Low Cost Backlight with No Light Conductor Ken Kojima, SBC Business Division, Chatani Industries Because of the stringent demands for decreasing power, lowering costs, and making thinner and lighter TFT color LCD panels, the development of new backlight units is demanded. As a result, by developing a structure that eliminates the light conductor, the aim is to reduce costs by simplifying the structure and making it thinner and lighter. At the same time, the manufacturing process can be shortened since printing the dot pattern on the light conductor will be eliminated. A backlight unit without the light conductor consists of a reflector that has a diffused reflector and a cold-cathode tube on the unit's side (Fig. 3). Light emitted from the cold-cathode tube is diffusely reflected in the air layer by the diffused reflective layer. Special ink which is uneven and has a high density is used by the embossing process on the inside surface of the reflector to form a diffuse reflective layer. In the region near the cold-cathode tube, the luminance of the backlight surface by direct illumination is brighter than in other parts. This lessens the uniformity of the illumination on the surface and causes bright lines to appear. Therefore, a semi-transparent or nontransparent reflector is provided near the cold-cathode tube. Light dispersed by the diffused reflective layer on the bottom is converged by a special converging lens on the top. The converging lens consists of one or two lenses. The lens used in the prototype has less directionality than conventional prisms, lenses, or films. Rather, it has light convergence and light diffusion close to those of current diffusers. Together with making a thinner and lighter weight backlight unit that does not contain a conductor, there can be little attenuation of light by the light conductor. About one-tenth of light output by the cold-cathode tube can be obtained as the surface luminance of the backlight unit. This backlight unit is one-third the weight of a conventional unit and two-thirds its thickness. The luminance can be increased 20 to 40% and power consumption can be suppressed to a low 10 to 20% (Table 2). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 2.

Compared to a conventional unit, t-| |he weight is one-third; the thickness, two-thirds; and the luminance is 20| |-40% higher. | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- When luminance is the same as current levels, power consumption can be decreased to below 1.5W in the TFT panel and 2.5W in the STN panel. At this time, the transmittance of the TFT panel was assumed to be 6% and the transmittance of the STN panel to be 3%. The plan is to implement this kind of backlight unit without a conductor in the fall of 1994. Reflectance of Polarizer Reduced to 1/10 in a Vapor-Deposited Multi Coat Tadashi Matsuo, Technology Dept., Polatechno By adding antireflective to the polarizer, the loss of the amount of light transmitted is decreased and scattering of the reflected light by external light reflection is prevented. In a typical glass plate and polarizer, about 4% surface reflection arises for each light that passes through the air interface. When external light multiplied by 4% of the amount of light is added to the image light, the visibility of the image is markedly decreased. The surface reflectance required for outdoor use will become one standard of less then 0.4% which corresponds to 1/10 the reflectance of a normal polarizer and the glass plate (Fig. 4). Methods to grow the antireflective layer are roughly classified into vapor-deposited multi coats and applied coats. By performing vapor deposition in a vacuum for the vapor-deposited multi coating, materials that have different refractive indices are grown in layers on the film's surface. This method can suppress the lowest surface reflectance. Established technology for molded products, primarily optical products, have problems with low productivity and high costs in batch processing. Inorganic compounds like SiO[.sup]2[/], TiO[.sup]2[/], or ZrO[.sub]2[/] with various refractive indices are each 0.1 to 0.2�m thick which corresponds to 1/4 the wavelength of visible light. Applied coating coats a material with a low refractive index onto a polarizer and a supporting film. This technique suits the continuous roll film processing and is being adopted in mass production. Additionally, its cost is below that of the vapor deposition. On the other hand, the properties of surface reflectance and hardness are usually somewhat worse than the vapor deposition. Inorganic and organic fluoride compounds are used in the materials. The two processes of indirect and direct methods are being developed as film growing processing. In the first process of indirect methods, an antireflective process treats a transparent hard coat support film. This forms the antireflective polarizer that is affixed to the polarizer with an adhesive. The direct method is an antireflective coating that is directly applied to the surface of the hard coat polarizer. In addition to a thinner shape, a shorter process is also advantageous in terms of cost. Fingerprints on the surface are a problem in the antireflective process (Table 3). By including water repellant processing in the vapor deposition and the dipping process on the film's external side, an anti-soiling effect is produced. Currently, however, the level where absolutely no fingerprints remain has not been reached. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 3.
