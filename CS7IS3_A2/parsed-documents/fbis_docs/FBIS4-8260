"Of course a more moderate candidate won," he said, adding that it was not really up to the government to make such an evaluation. Congress delegates today voted down a suggestion to withdraw from the General Agreement between the unions, government, and employers as a "last resort" to President Vaclav Havel's signature of the new labor law amendment, which the unions had strongly opposed.
