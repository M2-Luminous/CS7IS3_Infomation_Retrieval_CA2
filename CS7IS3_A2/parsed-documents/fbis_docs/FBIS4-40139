(SNARK) -- By-elections to the Georgian Parliament, which took place on June 12, passed with gross violation of the Law on Elections. Such declaration was made today by Vice-speaker of the Georgian Parliament Vakhtang Rcheulishvili. He informed SNARK of the facts which put in question the legitimacy of the elections. The Chairman of one of the Electoral Commissions and his Assistant had to leave their places to save their lives. Serious collisions took place at some election districts, at two of them arms were used. The candidates began blaming each other in using military detachments to get additional votes. Mr. Rcheulishvili said in the towns of Zugdidi, Chkhorotsku and Salendzhikha 60-65 per cent of all the voters took part in the elections, when in Rustavi - only 10 per cent. "Presumably, the Central Electoral Committee will find illegal the results of the by-elections in the towns of Western Georgia", declared the Georgian Vice-speaker.
