Major General Pranowo, commander of the Bukit Barisan Regional Military Command, said this to reporters in Medan today after tens of thousands of workers yesterday staged violent demonstrations, during which they destroyed dozens of houses, four cars, and one motorcycle. He said the authorities will not tolerate any protest rallies staged by workers in the future because such rallies will lead to destructive actions. Besides, the workers' demands no longer represent the true wishes of the workers themselves due to the interference of irresponsible elements which may undermine national unity and stability. [Hong Kong AFP in a Jakarta datelined item at 1201 GMT adds the following: "Indonesian security authorities in North Sumatera Friday clashed with 40,000 workers demanding better conditions and arrested at least six of the demonstrators, a lawyer said. "The demonstration occurred on the outskirts of the North Sumateran city of Medan, and the number of participants was double that who protested on Thursday, said Hasbi Ansori, an attorney with the Indonesian Legal Aid Institute (LBH). "Ansori, who was at the demonstration, said security forces attempted to break up some 40,000 workers from around 40 factories in an industrial area north of the city. "But an officer at the North Sumatera Police said the demonstration involved only 10,000 workers in the three industrial zones of Mabar, Pulau Brayan and Gelugur. He said the workers had been completely dispersed in the afternoon and that 70 people were under questioning. "As the demonstrators were marching towards the city, Ansori said he saw at least six people being hauled away by security forces after the rally turned violent. "Security forces began to break up the protest as demonstrators threw stones at factories and passing cars. "The officer, who declined to be named, said that police forces in the Medan area had been put on 'first alert' Friday, but that the status might fall back to 'second alert' Saturday. "North Sumatera military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Marjono said on the telephone from Medan that security authorities 'will not tolerate (this type of activity) and will take firm action against labor protests because they have stepped out of limit.' "Marjono, however, denied that any arrests had been made. "Ansori said shops and offices had closed Friday in Medan, the third largest city in Indonesia, for fear of trouble. The city's streets were deserted. "He said he believed the workers staged Friday's rally because they had failed to obtain a meeting with North Sumatera Governor Raja Inal Siregar during their rally Thursday. "'It might become bigger and bigger should the authorities ignore their demand,' Ansori said, adding that at least two isolated groups of workers were still protesting in the industrial area. "The workers urged the government to improve employee conditions and grant them the freedom to organize and improve wages. They also wanted an investigation into the death of one of their fellow workers who died last month in the wake of a labor protest. "The battered body of Rusli, a worker of rubber industry PT Industri Karet Deli, was found in a local river one day after he had led a workers protest last month. But no investigation into his death had been undertaken, Ansori said. "Earlier this month, Indonesia's largest independent trade union postponed its planned nationwide strike that had been scheduled for early April to protest worker conditions, saying that discussions with the government were underway. "The US government has threatened to revoke Indonesia's 600 million dollars worth of annual trade privileges unless it improves worker conditions, and temporarily extended the privileges for another six months."]
