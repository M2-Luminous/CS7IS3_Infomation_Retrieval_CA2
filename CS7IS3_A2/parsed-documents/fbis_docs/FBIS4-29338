Christopher called at around 5 A.M. [2000 GMT] to report in advance the contents of U.S. President Bill Clinton's announcement giving a tentative go-ahead to the reopening of diplomatic talks with North Korea, Kakizawa said at a press conference. Kakizawa said he told Christopher Japan welcomes Washington seeking dialogue with Pyongyang and hopes North Korea will respond to the U.S. offer and accept and carry out international inspections of nuclear facilities. Japan also hopes North Korea would offer a "sincere" reply to the call from the United States on Friday when former U.S. President Jimmy Carter meets North Korean Leader Kim Il-song again because this is an important turning point toward sanctions, Kakizawa said. Clinton announced U.S. willingness to open the third round of negotiations with Pyongyang at a press conference Thursday, saying there was "promising development" in Carter's personal mission in Pyongyang. Carter, speaking on the CNN cable network from Pyongyang after a meeting Thursday with Kim, said he has received a personal commitment from the North Korean leader that international inspectors will be allowed to continue monitoring a controversial nuclear reactor in Yongbyon north of the North Korean capital. Kakizawa quoted Christopher as saying the U.S. can not yet determine whether North Korea's latest overtures were "sincere" or a strategy to procrastinate moves toward imposing sanctions on Pyongyang. Christopher was quoted as saying that negotiations at the United Nations on the proposed sanctions will continue. Kakizawa said he telephoned Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata after the 30-minute call with Christopher.
