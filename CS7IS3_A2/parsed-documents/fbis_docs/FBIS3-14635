When those youths stopped near a gas station, the army patrols and Arabic-speaking elements of the Israeli intelligence immediately opened fire on them, killing the six youths, as well as a woman and a man while passing by the place. This new massacre -- which is being added to the series of the massacres committed by the Israeli Army and the armed settlers against the children of our people since the terrible massacre of the al-Ibrahimi Mosque, and before that since their occupation of our land and their attacks on our sanctities, freedom, and dignity and on our right in a dignified, free and independent life -- all these reveal the depth of the premeditated conspiracy in which some Israeli Army units and the armed settlers are implicated against our masses, our sanctities and land, which, in their totality, constitute hideous crimes and vile conspiracies against humanity, against our people and against the whole of the peace process. This massacre will only increase our people's determination and adherence to obtain their legitimate rights. It is regrettable that all these crimes and violations are taking place at the same time when false crocodile tears are being shed over lost opportunities for a solution, and evasive talk is being heard on good intentions and on a desire for peace. Genuine peace comes about by protecting the Palestinian people, their sanctities, lives and properties in accordance with international legitimacy, the last of which was declared in UN Security Council Resolution 904. This resolution calls for ensuring international protection for our people by providing an international presence in the Palestinian territories, disarming settlers, and evacuating the settlements which lie in the heart of our towns and amidst our people.
