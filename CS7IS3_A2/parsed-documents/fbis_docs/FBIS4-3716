The statement severely denounces the British side for crudely interfering in China's internal affairs. The following is the full text of the spokesman's statement: Since the beginning of last year, the British Parliament's House of Commons External Affairs Committee has held several hearings on the so-called China issue. On 13 April the committee published a report: "British-Sino Relations Before and After 1997." The report openly advocated [gu chui 7849 0706] the adoption of a policy of further confrontation against China on the Hong Kong issue and preposterously commented on China's domestic affairs, thus crudely interfering in China's internal affairs. In this regard we express our strong indignation and regret. On the Hong Kong issue, the report actually admitted that the British side, proceeding from its erroneous appraisal of the prospects for the development of the situation in China, indeed changed its policy toward Hong Kong, supported Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten's erroneous way of doing things on the Hong Kong issue, continued to pursue confrontation against China, and even agitated for [gu dong 7849 0520] "international support" on the Hong Kong issue. We are shocked by the British Parliament's House of Commons External Affairs Committee's actually issuing such a document and adopting such a position on the Hong Kong issue at a time when the truth of the controversy between China and Britain over the question of the political system in Hong Kong is being understood by more and more people and when the British side indicated time and again its desire to cooperate with China in other spheres. The report preposterously claimed that by 1997 China may not necessarily change the framework for the three-level political system established according to the Hong Kong governor's "three violations" program. The Chinese Government has stated many times that in order to safeguard the dignity of the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law, the Legislative Council and regional organizations established according to the Hong Kong governor's program can exist only until 30 June 1997. After that, the first government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [SAR], its Legislative Council, and regional organizations must be established according to the Basic Law. We resolutely support this solemn position of the Chinese Government. The report went so far as to attack Article 18 and Article 158 of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR of the People's Republic of China, claiming that these articles are "a serious potential threat to the autonomy of the Hong Kong SAR and to the implementation of the joint declaration." In accordance with the provisions of Article 18 of the Basic Law, the NPC Standing Committee has the power to decide, when necessary, to place Hong Kong SAR in a state of emergency. Article 158 of the Basic Law stipulates that the power of interpretation of this law shall be vested in the NPC Standing Committee. These provisions are concrete expressions that the Chinese Government resumes the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong beginning on 1 July 1997. The report's attack on these provisions is utterly unjustifiable; it only reveals British true motive to attempt to extend its control over and influence on Hong Kong. The report takes great pains to advocate promotion of democracy and safeguard of human rights in Hong Kong. This only makes people see through more clearly British hypocrisy and ulterior motives on the Hong Kong issue. The Chinese Government has pointed out on numerous occasions that the essence of controversy over Hong Kong's political structure is not a question of, indeed, whether to develop democracy or not; rather it is a question of whether to observe international commitment and whether to bring about the convergence with the Basic Law and achieve Hong Kong's stable transition. Facts speak louder than words. It was the Chinese Government which, in accordance with the policy of "one country, two systems," at the earliest proposed practicing "a high degree of autonomy" in Hong Kong and "Hong Kong be governed by the Hong Kong people themselves." The Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR also has adequate, specific provisions on the development of democracy and the rights and freedom to be enjoyed by the Hong Kong people after Hong Kong's return to the embrace of the motherland. Under the British rule of more than 100 years, when did Hong Kong enjoy democracy and human rights? Even today, Britain still uses "Letters Patent," "Royal Instructions," and similar statutes of colonial rule to govern Hong Kong. What qualifications does it have to talk glibly about Hong Kong's democracy and human rights? Now that only a few years before its withdrawal from Hong Kong, Britain hypocritically and hurriedly talks volubly about what it calls democracy and human rights. Its true motives are like "Sima Zhao's ill intent known to all" [the villain's design is obvious]. It merely tries to divide Hong Kong people and create chaos there. The British House of Commons External Affairs Committee's report proposes the establishment of so-called human rights commission and human rights monitoring organization in Hong Kong. The goal is nothing other than to place new obstacles to Hong Kong's smooth transition. The British should understand that as in the case of the political framework, any decision unilaterally made by the British side during the transitional period on major matters spanning beyond 1997 will not be recognized by the Chinese side. The report also brazenly attempted to meddle and interfere in China's internal affairs by openly advocating Tibet's self- determination. As is known to all, Tibet has been an inalienable part of the Chinese territory since ancient times. Before 1959, a feudal serf system was practiced there, which went even further than the system practiced in the Middle Ages in Europe in terms of darkness and cruelty. It is safe to say that old Tibet was one of the regions in the world where human rights were infringed upon most seriously. After abolishing the feudal serf system, Tibet has taken the broad road of national unity and economic development, with people living and working in peace and contentment. This is a change of epoch-making significance in safeguarding human rights and promoting social progress. The writer of the report dislikes such change but extols those serf owners who trampled on human rights as "defenders of human rights." This greatly ridicules human rights. In fact, they did that in order to sabotage the unification and national unity of China. May we offer a piece of advice to the writer of the report -- that it would be better to take a prudent attitude on the issue of Tibet because of Britain's historical role in the past. We want to sternly point out that all attempts to interfere in China's internal affairs by using the so-called Tibet issue will be resolutely opposed by the entire Chinese people, including the compatriots of Tibetan nationality, and that their attempts can never succeed. The External Affairs Committee of the British House of Commons has also suggested that the British parliament should make contacts with Taiwan's "Legislative Yuan" and has asked the British Government to relax its restrictions toward Taiwan. It should be pointed out that there is only one China in the world, that Taiwan is a part of China, and that the People's Republic of China is the sole legitimate government representing the whole China. This has long been publicly recognized by the international society. The absurd remarks made by the Foreign Affairs Committee of the British House of Commons related to the Taiwan issue runs counter to the principle for the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the United Kingdom. The real intention of the committee is to create "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan." This will be resolutely opposed by the entire Chinese people, including people in Taiwan. The report of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the British House of Commons also publicized "the Chinese threat" with an ulterior motive in order to sow dissension between China and her neighboring countries. All people know that China has always followed an independent, peaceful foreign policy. China is a positive factor in safeguarding peace and stability in the world. Those who fabricate "the Chinese threat" are totally groundless and their efforts will be futile. The External Affairs Committee of the Chinese NPC has attached great importance to maintaining and developing friendly relations and cooperation with the Foreign Affairs Committee of the British parliament. The Chinese side has never done anything which would harm the United Kingdom, the British parliament, or relations between the two countries. However, recently some people of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the British House of Commons have repeatedly done things which will harm relations between the two countries, while they have also stressed the need to maintain and develop Sino-British relations. People cannot but ask: What is their intention? Where do they want to lead relations between the two countries? We can say with certainty that the viewpoints and suggestions which are hostile to China put forward in the report are not only extremely harmful to Sino-British relations but will also bring harm to the long-term interests of the United Kingdom. We believe that those things will be disliked [bu yuan kan dao di 0008 1959 4170 0451 4104] by those who truly show concern for and protect the traditional friendly relations between China and the United Kingdom.
