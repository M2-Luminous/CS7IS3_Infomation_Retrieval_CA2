Russian special presidential representative Vitaliy Churkin told journalists this after his consultations on Wednesday [16 March] evening with Croatian President Franjo Tudjman. "We had previously been studying with President Tudjman and other Croatian officials the matter of the meeting that has been announced. It was therefore nothing unexpected for him," V. Churkin said. In his opinion, it is necessary next week above all to sign a document on ceasing hostile actions, which would guarantee the non-resumption of conflicts in and around the areas of Croatia that are under UN control. "Recently we have been working really hard to make it possible. Agreement in principle to sign such a treaty was reached previously, but it did not happen for reasons of a political and emotional character," V. Churkin noted. "The Croatian side is ready for a dialogue and will take part in the talks at the Russian Embassy," Vesna Skare-Ozbolt, the Croatin president's press assistant, told the ITAR-TASS correspondent today. Meanwhile, the ITAR-TASS correspondent learned today from well- informed diplomatic sources in Zagreb, that by no means all the obstacles capable of preventing the signing of the document next Tuesday have yet been removed. V. Churkin will continue discussion of the problems of the Croatian territories under UN control in Washington, for which he left by air this morning.
