The Russian president spoke at it. Touching upon problems of the military reform, Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin said the following: [Begin Yeltsin recording] The main area of our military policy is reform of the armed forces. They should meet the actual requirements needed for sufficient national defene. Gradually, and I stress here, gradually, the strength of the army will be reduced and brought down to 1.5 million servicemen. The mechanism for building the army up to its required strength will also undergo gradual changes. There is talk about increasing the share of servicemen undergoing military service on contracts. We will continue to devote much attention to developing the new military infrastructure in Russia and providing it with everything necessary as quickly as possible. We need to learn how to implement a balanced military-technical policy. The root of the problem is that tasks we tackle should correspond to the actual possibilities of the country's economy. It is no secret that today our funds are limited and that this is sharply reflected on the army. This is why it is even more important to allocate these funds wisely. We will have to reduce the number of various types of weapons and their modifications, material support for them, the range of ammunition, supplies, and spare parts. Multiplicity is an unacceptable luxury right now. We need unification. At the same time, it is also categorically unacceptable to waste in the name of arms reduction a unique scientific and technical potential created by the armed forces. There are international treaties and agreements, and we will honestly fulfill the responsibilities which we had taken upon ourselves. But any so-called overdoing on our part is totally out of question. This is a clear position taken by the president, and the supreme commander in chief, and this is a demand of principle to the leadership of the armed forces. [end recording]
