He described the recent EU Council of Foreign Ministers's evaluation as particularly encouraging. According to the evaluation, the Twelve blamed Turkish intransigence. EU Commissioner Hans Van Den Broek reiterated this position in Ankara. Venizelos said it is becoming a common view that the procedure for Cyprus' accession to the EU and the speed of this procedure cannot be held hostage by the Turkish occupation of the island and by Turkish Cypriot and Turkish intransigence. Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou will meet European Commission President Jacques Delors and Cypriot President Glavkos Kliridhis tomorrow night.
