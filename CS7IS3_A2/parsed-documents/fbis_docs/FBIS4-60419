He also lashed at the demand that Prime Minister Rabin send the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] into the Gaza Strip. Dr. al-Tibi demanded that the interim period be shortened because he believes five years is too long a period during which to form the permanent solution. According to him, circumstances on the ground will force the parties to immediately begin negotiating the permanent solution. Speaking at a seminar on the peace process at the Ben-Gurion University in Beersheba, Dr. al-Tibi said that the Palestinian goal is to establish an independent state, the capital of which will be East Jerusalem. According to him, there are cabinet ministers who support the establishment of an independent Palestinian state. He believes that the settlements can be kept in place and, after they are evacuated by the settlers, they could be populated by the Palestinian refugees.
