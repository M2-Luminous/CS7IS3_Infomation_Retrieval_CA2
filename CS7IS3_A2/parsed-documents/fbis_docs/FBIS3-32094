In a press release published 31 January, CONACOM called for the holding of a true national conference and proposed a schedule, including five steps, for the holding of this conference. CONACOM says that such a conference must be preceded by: A. The formation of a political coalition among the political groups that agree to work jointly for a way out of the crisis; B. The designation by President Aristide of a new prime minister; C. The formation of a government of national concord; D. The holding of a sociopolitical rally; and E. The holding of a national conference following Aristide's return to Haiti. CONACOM rejects an arrangement precipitated in form and time [as heard] and invites all the country's sons to be aware of the seriousness of the crisis.
