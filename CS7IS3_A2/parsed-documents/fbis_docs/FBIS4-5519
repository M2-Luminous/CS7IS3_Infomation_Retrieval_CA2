In the first part, the article says respected Comrade Kim Il-song is a great leader of the revolution who has performed immortal exploits, which will shine through centuries, pushing his way through raging storms of revolution with his iron will and rare leadership ability. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is quoted as saying: "Although manifold grim tests hard to overcome cropped up in the way of our revolution including the anti-Japanese revolutionary war, the Fatherland Liberation War and postwar reconstruction, our leader met them with the iron will that the sky could fall and he would not care, and led the revolution and construction to a constant upswing with his extraordinary leadership ability." The respected leader Comrade Kim Il-song enjoys undisputed trust and praise from the revolutionary people of the world as the most veteran leader of the revolution in our time. Our leader's high authority and prestige are attributable to the immortal exploits he has performed for the time and revolution, victoriously leading the protracted and arduous Korean revolution. What is most important in his leadership of the Korean revolution is that he has valiantly pushed through countless difficulties and trials standing in the way of revolution with a matchless iron will. His will is an iron will which wavers not a bit in any thunderbolt, an unexcelled offensive spirit of courageously meeting manifold difficulties and trials and an indomitable fighting spirit. It is a great mental power unrivalled in resoluteness, staunchness and principle. Thanks to his iron will, the Korean people today win victory after victory in an acute confrontation with the imperialists. What is also important in his leadership of the Korean revolution through grim trials of history is that he has victoriously led the revolution and construction, always full of confidence in victory and revolutionary optimism. The just cause of revolution for the independence of the people is sure to win victory. This is an unshakable will and optimism which the great leader has maintained since the beginning of his revolutionary activities. When some people who had been aspiring after socialism lost confidence after the collapse of socialism in some countries in recent years, the great leader instructed that the course of the change of the present situation must be viewed optimistically, not pessimistically. Thanks to this revolutionary position and leadership of the great leader, the Korean people continue fighting staunchly for the accomplishment of the socialist cause of chuche, full of confidence in victory and optimism. The great leader's leadership is also fully demonstrated in that he firmly believes in the people under the difficult and complex situation and unreservedly mobilizes their inexhaustible strength to push through the difficulties. When you firmly believe in the people and rely on them at all times, you always emerge victorious; if you are forsaken by them, you always fail. This is the maxim the great leader has kept in his struggle and life since he embarked on the road of revolution. With the noble idea of "believing in the people as in heaven" and wise guidance of the great leader who pushes ahead with the revolution and construction with absolute trust in the people and in reliance on them at all times, our socialist cause will constantly advance and emerge victorious, pushing through any storm and stress, with the great strength of chuche. In the second part, the article says the proud history of our revolution which has emerged victorious through the rigorous storms of history under the wise guidance of the great leader teaches the people the precious truth of revolution. The truth is that when the people fight, deeply trusting a great leader as their mental support, they can overcome any adversity and ordeal and win victory in the revolution, and that the unity of the leader and the people in a harmonious whole is a decisive guarantee for victory in the revolution. Our people have been able to win a great victory in the revolution and construction, through so difficult and arduous struggles, because they have lived and fought staunchly with the great leader as their mental support at all times. In our revolutionary ranks, the leader and the people are not merely in relation between the leader and the led, but they form a solid community, an integral whole of one ideology and will, breathing the same breath. The might of this integral whole is a main factor which has produced the singlehearted unity of the revolutionary ranks, strengthened our party and trained our revolutionary Armed Forces into an invincible combat unit. Our people have a firm guarantee for victoriously advancing and accomplishing our revolutionary cause in any test and difficulty. Our people are the most proud and happiest people in that they are under the wise guidance of the great leader and the dear leader who are victoriously leading our revolution through grim trials. We have a solid singlehearted unity, impregnable party and government, invincible revolutionary Armed Forces and a powerful independent economy with which we can advance the revolution and accomplish it with our own strength under whatever situation. The history of revolutionary struggle of our party and people will shine forever as an ever-victorious history because the entire people are staunchly fighting in singlehearted unity with the great pride and honor of making revolution under the great leader and the dear leader.
