Around 13,500 people left the country and only some 2,200 came to Lithuania over the past eight months, the Lithuanian Statistics Department reports. A majority of those leaving are Russians, Ukrainians and Belorus sans. Most of the emigrants are aged 40 and over. They also include pensioners whose departure does not affect the Lithuanian labor market. The highest wave of emigration was registered in 1992 when 22,200 people left the country. Among the 13,500 emigrants of this year, 550 people were Lithuanians. Around 30% of them went to live in the West. Around 800 Lithuanians came back to their homeland, mainly from Siberia, northern regions of Russia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and Belarus. Approximately the same amount of Russians, descendants of mixed families of deported Lithuanians and locals, have decided to come and live in Lithuania. The state covers traveling expenses for ex-political prisoners and exiles. These people also have the right to participate in the privatization of state property and to get housing on preferential terms.
