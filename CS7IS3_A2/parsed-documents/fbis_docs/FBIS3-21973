Ryabov: "Immediate, but Not Medical Attention: What Russian Drug Addicts Receive Instead of Medical Care"] [Text] The militia is arousing alarm publishing its reports about the number of drug addicts and crimes connected with drug dealing. Already it appears that the influx of harmful substances into Russia cannot be restrained. However, Russian laws are oriented toward making the same mistakes that have already been made in Western countries, harshly punishing drug users. The state shows little mercy for those who suffer from drug addiction. ...Four years ago he sat on the dirty stones of the Arbat, burying his face between his knees. People emerged from the drug store, huddling themselves up from the piercing autumn wind, not even trying to help him to his feet. He was in complete despair. The last of his money had been spent on "grass." His bills were already past due a month before, and his friends had turned their backs on him. The watchful pharmacy staff absolutely refused to issue him the drug he needed without a prescription. He was on the needle, a heroin addict. All he had left was to die. Near "Natasha" ...The stereotype of drug dealers and users has been somewhat shaken. Usually the images of these type people are just the opposite, but... In a self-assured gait a young man in a long coat approached three importune teenagers in torn dirty jeans. It was eight o'clock in the evening, a Sunday. They stood two meters from me in a stairway leading to an underground passage on Pushkin Square near the "Natasha" store. After a few seconds of negotiation, the most enlivened "grungy-looking" youth made up his mind: -- I know him, in fact. Everything is O.K., we can take a walk, and he nudged his companions in the back. They were not the only ones, however, who had turned into the archway near the theater ticket booth. A middle-aged man, who up until then had been standing unnoticed near a telephone booth, lit a cigarette and set out after the four. Two of them walked ahead, apparently talking about some good high. They were soon overtaken by the buyer and dealer "on duty," who were slipping on the worn icy slope. I did not follow them down, but I could clearly see them standing at the bottom of the decline. The ritual of selling several match boxes of hash, as hashish is sometimes called, was not of interest. What interested me was this new character. I had heard about informants in plain clothes hired by the militia to trail people. The dealers and their client went down to the end of the street and disappeared into an entry way. Near drug trafficking "points" there are always apartments where the drugs for sale are kept. The client, of course, does not go in, but waits for the goods nearby. In order not to let the buyer out of their sight, dealers do not work alone. Most likely, the "spy" had grown tired after a long day's work. Having gone halfway, he turned around and went back to where he had come. Was his workday over? Having returned to his original position, he met up with two policemen on patrol, who had been distracted in the passageway, shooing away some old women peddling all sorts of junk. -- I just got through calling. The chief let me off. Can I go home? Tomorrow I will be back at 10 a.m. sharp, he told the policemen. Dreary from the cold, the civil servants gave their "colleague" a disdainful glance and let him go. He was not the only one of his kind at their service. While walking along the passage they stopped several times, first to have a little word with two big men with shaven heads, then with a heavily made-up prostitute. The young lady told the civil guardians about the movements of some "chick in a fur coat." Several minutes later, as though friends, they both sat on an iron box near the escalator and, while dangling their boots, shelled seeds... A Racket in Uniform The militia is fighting against the social order. The police sergeant stops anyone that seems suspicious to him, of which there are many on Pushkin Square. Ilya lives close by. His outer appearance unfortunately arouses an inexplicable tension in policemen. It seems to them that the reason he frequently stands at the metro entrance is not that he lives close by, but something else. -- Every other day they stop me. What am I guilty of, having a suspicious appearance? During curfew hours, imposed not long after the events in October, the militia organizes round-ups at all the suspicious places where non-conformists gather. An entire detachment of OMON officers [Special Purpose Militia Detachment], arriving on a bus late in the evening searched the apartments where the followers of Petlyura live, the designer and charismatic leader of the youth underground. They found nothing. How did they know that drugs were there? It is incomprehensible. The militia is doing its duty. Our legislation makes no distinction between those dealing drugs and those using them. Anyone found with drugs during a search can end up in jail. In any quantity. So the militia searches. The more people they stop the greater chance of guessing right... Not all who are caught go to the police station, however. The Law frequently resorts to being an official racket; if there is no money, identification information is taken down and threats are made to "take them in" if no money appears. Chances of finding the needed drug dealer or user on the street are great for the militia. According to infrequent polls, the number of occasional drug users in the CIS at the beginning of last year neared 8 million. A year before that there were approximately 1.5 million. These figures were arrived at after estimating the volume of drugs in circulation within the borders of the former USSR. Life -- No High It is well known that the majority of narcotic substances come into Russia from Central Asia and Afghanistan. The Tajik-Afghanistan borders represent the same line of fire for Russian security services as the U.S.-Mexican border does for Americans. However, aside from organic drugs in Russia, there are a large number of synthetic substances. When borders were still tight, amateur chemists filled the drug void with their inexpensive goods. Today their experience is not going to waste. There are quite a lot of underground laboratories in St. Petersburg. They are closely tied to the market in Moscow. One of the most productive laboratories of LSD in the northern capital had to shut down, (according to rumors, "limos with six doors rolled up to the person in charge, and out slid enlivened youths who announced that instead of homemade acid, they were going to bring in real American acid, nicknamed "California Sunshine [Kaliforniyskoye solnyshko])," whereupon a deficit of this particular drug formed in Moscow. At fashionable, although not altogether young parties, almost everyone has access to dealers of all types of drugs. LSD and "grass" are especially popular in this environment, however. Heroin, which is considered a crude drug, is used by the most unfortunate. Cocaine is the preferred drug of both the mafia, and people wishing to give the pretense of being part of the establishment, as well as those who just "get lucky." The militia's fight against drug dealing in Russia boils down to catching any violator with drugs in his or her possession, in any amount. It matters not what kind. They are all considered criminals, even the drug addict, that is, a person who physically cannot live without doing drugs. The militia is least interested in the medical aspects of the problem. A young man, free of prejudice and with a mind of his own, told me: -- Drugs will always be around. They are a harmful temptation, which a certain segment of the population will never be able to give up. The fight against drugs is fruitless as long as there are these kinds of people. And they will be around, because life will never be like a drug high. ...The crisis for the young man in front of the drug store fortunately passed. He recovered. He did not resort to crime. It was medical care that saved him, however, not the punitive sword of the law, with which he clashed during his fall into the abyss.
