"The boom of rural townships has greatly helped boost local economic and social development," said Minister of Construction Hou Jie yesterday. He spoke at a national meeting held by the ministry, in which 25 rural township heads from around the country were invited to be advisers on rural township construction. The rapid development of rural reform over the past years has brought an unprecedented surge of townships and small cities in the country's vast rural areas. Some 40,000 villages have expanded to become towns since 1978, when China launched its reform drive in rural areas, according to ministry sources. Another 14,500 small or medium cities have also sprung up, with their own administrative, cultural, and economic structures, modern public services and advanced living facilities. In 1979, there were only 2,850 such entities--most of them established by the government. The newly-emerged towns have accommodated more than 150 million residents, of whom 100 million are former farmers. Most of the new towns have been founded on the success of rural industry, especially in economically developed rural areas such as south China's Pearl River Delta, east China's Yangtze [Chang Jiang] River Delta, and the Jiaodong and Liaodong Peninsulas. In East China's Anhui Province, some 40 new rural towns have mushroomed in recent years. Hou pointed out that these boom towns play an important role in absorbing the excessive rural labour force, furthering the rural market economy, and helping to restructure and reform rural production. The development of small towns also means residents can enjoy improved living conditions with more roads, water supply facilities, communications and other public service facilities, and special districts for industry and commerce, Hou said. The towns have increasingly become political, economic, cultural, scientific and technological, educational, and information centres in the country's rural areas, said the minister.
