Presenting the certificates for the renewal to the advisers including Fok Ying-tung were Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office under the State Council, and Zhou Nan, director of XINHUA news agency Hong Kong branch. At the ceremony, Lu Ping spoke highly of the valuable opinions and suggestions the advisers made over the past two years for Hong Kong's transition and the transfer of government in 1997. "This shows your sense of responsibility for realizing the 'one country, two systems' concept, achieving the smooth transition, and maintaining prosperity and stability in Hong Kong," Lu said. Analyzing the current situation in Hong Kong, he said that a series of unilateral actions the Hong Kong British authorities took recently demonstrated their determination to continue the policy of confrontation with China in three years odds [as received] before 1997. This will help all kindhearted people have a clearer knowledge about the British side, cast away the illusion for "cooperation", a lip service by the British side, and strengthen "our resolve to guarantee Hong Kong's smooth transition together with our Hong Kong compatriots," Lu said.
