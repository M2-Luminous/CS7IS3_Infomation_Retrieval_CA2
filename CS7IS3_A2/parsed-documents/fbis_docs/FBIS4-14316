The House of Representatives has been following the exacerbating political crisis since the beginning, and has been exerting intensive efforts to end it. In the meantime, the House provided successive chances for coalition parties and direct dialogue to find solutions to the crisis in a manner that satisfies all parties. The House, along with the masses of our people, used to believe that the drafting and signing of the pledge and accord document would end the political crisis, which has negatively affected every aspect of citizens' daily lives. Having followed the regrettable military incidents in 'Imran at noon yesterday, Wednesday, 27 April 1994, leaving many of our people's sons in the Armed Forces dead, the House expresses extreme regret and concern for those incidents. It instructs the Defense Ministry and the command of the Armed Forces to immediately stop the use of weapons between the brother members of the same people and same army. It instructs all of them to abide by the instructions of legitimate constitutional authority, which represents the people, and to abide by their constitutional duty to safeguard national sovereignty and legitimacy. It appeals to everyone to immediately stop using weapons and to abolish all military manifestations which lead to disputes at the camps and outlying [formerly border] areas. The House, along with all the sons of our people, condemns the use of force and all those who directly or indirectly fomented the sedition among the sons of the same homeland. The House demands that the executive authority take the instigators to court as soon as investigations are concluded, within one week. The House instructs the Defense and Security Committee to move to 'Imran to investigate what has taken place and to submit an urgent report to the House. [passage omitted]
