Over 60 countries signed this agreement late last year while Belgium abstained. The government has decided to sign the convention but wants to find a solution before the end of the year so that radioactive waste can be disposed of on land. De Vadder: [video shows dumping of radioactiuve waste] Belgium was one of five countries last year that did not sign the international ban on the dumping of nuclear waste into the sea. France, China, Great Britain, and Russia also abstained. Until 1982, Belgium dumped low levels of radioactive waste in the Gulf of Biscay [off the Spanish coast]. A moratorium was introduced a year later and imposed a halt for 10 years. When 67 countries declared themselves in favor of a ban on such dumping late last year in London, the Belgian Government decided to extend the moratorium until the year 2000. This decision was dictated by the problems of nuclear waste processing with which the Belgoprocess plant in Dessel [northern Belgium] is now dealing. The objective is to get rid of part of the nuclear waste for good somewhere in our country. As long as no decision had been made on this subject, the government hesitated in signing a ban on sea dumping, not because it intended to resume dumping waste into the sea but because it did not want to rule out this option. Belgium will now adhere to the ban and Environment Minister Sentkin wants to find a final solution to the disposal of low-yield radioactive waste in our country by the end of the year.
