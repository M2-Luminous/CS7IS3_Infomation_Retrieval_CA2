The vice-president made the call when meeting with C.R. Sitter, president of Exxon Corporation and Lord Prior, chairman of General Electric Company here this morning. From the long run, the Chinese vice-president said during his meeting with Lord Prior, the series of fundamental reform measures introduced in taxation, banking and foreign trade at the beginning of this year, which were designed to promote a socialist market economic structure best suited to Chinese conditions, will make it more convenient and more favorable for foreign investors to invest and conduct economic and technical cooperation in China. Despite the fact that China was not familiar with market economy, Rong said, China has adopted all possible measures in the course of deepening reform and opening-up and these have laid a solid foundation for Sino-foreign cooperation in all domains. The vice-president said that the strengthening of cooperation between developed and developing countries will facilitate economic recovery and growth of developed countries. In a certain sense, he noted, it is the best way of promoting the development of the world economy by strengthening "South-North cooperation. [no closing quote as received] Rong told Mr. C.R. Sitter that China has always attached much importance to the development of energy industry. Although tremendous progress has been made over the past decade in China's energy industry, he added, it is still unable to keep pace with the development of the entire national economy. He said that China hopes that all internationally known corporations such as Exxon would take further steps to strengthen cooperation with China in energy and petro-chemicals, including the utilization of funds and advanced technologies of these corporations. He told Mr. Sitter that all the reform measures introduced in China have yielded significant results as shown in the increase of state revenue, stable foreign exchanges rates, and rising foreign exchange reserves. It is rather normal that some problems may occur in the course of reform, the Chinese vice-president said. What is most important is discover and solve them by taking practicable measures. Lord Prior and Mr. Sitter came to China at the invitation of the China International Trust and Investment Corporation and the China National Petrochemical Corporation. Their corporations are ready to conduct a new round of cooperation with Chinese departments in the development of the power industry and the exploration and development of land and offshore oil.
