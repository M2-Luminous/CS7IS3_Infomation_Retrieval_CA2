Prime Minister Chuan Likphai said that the policy on weapons purchases is just a matter of principle involving certain cases where it is possible for Thailand to negotiate with its trading partners to sell its products in exchange. The prime minister thinks that the Commerce Ministry should be allowed to take part in the negotiation since the Defense Ministry is not very good at it. [Begin recording] [Chuan] The minister in charge of the deal, such as the defense minister when it concerns the Defense Ministry, would look after the matter. [Unidentified reporter] Was the decision adopted by the cabinet motivated by the issue of commissions? [Chuan] Not directly. It was not directly aimed at barring the business of brokers. It rather concerns the case of the Defense Ministry buying weapons from a country which, we think, can buy our products in exchange. [Reporter] Did the Defense Ministry bring up possible problems which may arise? [Chuan] The Defense Ministry often told us that it is not enthusiastic about trade. [Reporter] Even though it could prevent the paying of commissions [words indistinct]? [Chuan] I think that is a different matter. [end recording]
