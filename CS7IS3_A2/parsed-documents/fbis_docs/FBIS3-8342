Koljevic and Redman today talked for about an hour in Belgrade. They stated that they had discussed a method of resuming negotiations so as to bring about an acceptable and comprehensive solution rather than any concrete proposals. Their press statements convey their shared view that peace is more certain in the wake of the Washington talks, with an increasing possibility of reaching a global agreement. Koljevic stressed that "this plan recognizes the Serb people as being a constituent people with all rights, and that it will be involved in the further peace process." According to Koljevic, the Serb side has no political proposal as yet, whereas whether and how the Bosnian Serbs will join the Muslim-Croat federal agreement will be decided by the Srpska republic's parliament. Asked what the United States would do if the Serbs refused the Washington plan, Redman said: "We will be working with all sides to reach something that will be accepted and not refused." Although the Serbs were not involved in the first stage of negotiations on the plan, they nevertheless, in Redman's words, "received some information and were given some documents. We hope that in the second phase we will maintain close contacts with the Serbs in the same way we have done with the Bosnian Government and the Croats," Redman said. In this context he noted that the aim of the first phase was to secure an agreement between the Muslims and the Croats, whereas in the second phase all three sides must be brought together. "What we have done so far was focused on speeding up the process leading to a global agreement. It seems to me that now we are in a better position to do so. We will continue to be actively involved; the United States the European Union, the Russian Federation, all three sides in Bosnia, and all countries in the region. This will require huge efforts on the part of all of us," the special U.S. envoy said. Redman stressed that the peace process must not drag on for months. "We are trying to do something within the next few weeks," he said. The Bosnian Serb vice president said that the first phase of the Washington agreement was about eliminating flash points of fighting and establishing a lasting peace. "If you ask yourself what is the essence of the Washington agreement between the Muslims and the Croats, the answer is that it is the elimination of the flash points of fighting. Sarajevo has been eliminated as a flash point of fighting between the Serbs and the Muslims. Neum, as a contentious issue between the Muslims and Croats, has been removed. Central Bosnia, as a fighting flash point, has been eliminated or is in the process of being eliminated," Koljevic said. "All moves that are being made are aimed more at achieving peace than imposing a solution. We will have to find a political solution ourselves," he explained and added that the right of a people to participate in this process and to make decisions about itself cannot be denied by anyone. Asked if the issue of the Bosnian Serbs joining the Bosnian Federation, agreed on by the Croats and Muslims, was discussed, Koljevic said that this, as well as the maps and other concrete questions, would be discussed in the second phase of the peace process. He noted that the Serbs would raise the issue of the lifting of sanctions as a precondition for embarking on the second phase of the peace process. He recalled that the Serbs had accepted the peace plan in Geneva which implied the lifting of sanctions, and that everyone but the Muslims agreed to that plan. Koljevic said the lifting of sanctions was linked to the peace process and was very important for several reasons, two of which were most important: "Only the lifting of sanctions can completely discourage the militant groups in the Muslim leadership, who are still planning a spring offensive. It would also be a signal to the Serbs and Russians that the war flash points are not going to spread, and that no military advantages are trying to be achieved, but that the intention is really to reach peace," Koljevic said. The talks will resume at Sarajevo airport in two days, he said. Redman has left Belgrade for Zagreb and is also expected to go to Sarajevo.
