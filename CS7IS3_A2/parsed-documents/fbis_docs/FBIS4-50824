We should not neglect agriculture at any time and under any circumstances and instead should try every possible means to ensure its even more rapid and greater development. From 19 through 30 April, Song Ping successively inspected work in nine counties under Weifang and Zibo Cities in the separate company of CPC Central Committee Political Bureau Member and Shandong Provincial CPC Committee Secretary Jiang Chunyun, provincial CPC Committee Deputy Secretary and Governor Zhao Zhihao, provincial CPC Committee Deputy Secretary and Secretary General Han Xikai. He went deep into enterprises, villages, peasant families, and paddy fields to talk with grass-roots cadres and the masses of peasants. Song Ping said: To strengthen agriculture's status as the foundation of the economy, we must keep on increasing investment; great development will not come without considerable investment. It is necessary to establish and improve a new agricultural investment mechanism to increase investment in agriculture through a variety of channels. The state will increase investment, but this alone will not be enough. We should make full use of surplus labor in the rural area and attach importance to accumulation of labor results. At the same time, we should guide village and town enterprises into supplementing agriculture with industry and institutionalize and standardize this practice as early as possible to guarantee actual extension of funds for supporting agriculture. Song Ping went straight to villages and peasant families every time he arrived at a county. When inspecting village and town enterprises, he said: Developing village and town enterprises is an important way for the rural area to march toward a comparatively well-off standard of living. Sole reliance on farming is not enough to bring about a comparatively well-off standard of living in the countryside; you must vigorously develop village and town enterprises. Shandong's village and town enterprises have been enjoying rapid and healthy development since reform and opening up to the outside world and have now developed into a major sector. For the period ahead, Shandong should continue to make full use of village and town enterprises' flexible mechanisms and center on the main objective of establishing a socialist market economy to intensify reform and promote improvement in the standard, product quality, and operating scale of village and town enterprises. During his inspection, Song Ping also stated his views on issues such as strengthening the development of grass-roots party organizations and developing household garden farming.
