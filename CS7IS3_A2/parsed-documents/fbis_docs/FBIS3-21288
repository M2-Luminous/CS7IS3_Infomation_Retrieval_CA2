He said that the [unemployment] rate rose to 14 percent last year and that there are 10 million unemployed workers, mostly in densely populated countries such as Egypt, Sudan, Morocco, and Algeria, but also in sparsely populated states such as Jordan. He further warned that the oil producers, even though they are sparsely populated, are also threatened by [unemployment] because of numerous programs for Asian immigrants and migrant workers. Bakr Rasul added that unemployment is most rampant among degreed recent entrants into the labor market, and said: "Some 2.5 million [workers] enter the Arab labor force annually with no chance of providing them with employment opportunities." He said that economic reform programs in the Arab world may help correct the imbalances in domestic and external general balances and reduce the burden of debt, but they do not address unemployment. Bakr Rasul pointed out that there are short, medium, and long-term solutions to unemployment problems and that the latter would depend on the success of existing economic reform programs and on making progress toward Arab cooperation based on mutual and entwined interests. He added that such Arab cooperation should be calculated, comprehensive, and rewarding to all parties, since it would also contribute to the success of reform programs that depend on export policies, broad market economies, expanded competition, and successful technological assimilation. He said that the Arab employment strategy, approved by the Arab states at last April's meeting of labor ministers, could be the means to resolve the unemployment crisis. On the Organization's contributions to the success of the self-rule experiment in Gaza, Bakr Rasul said that "the Arab Labor Organization held an educational symposium last month for some 50 Palestinian union and labor leaders from the occupied territories. The meeting touched on all aspects of labor such as legislation, as well as laws and regulations dealing with social security, health security, shop safety, the work environment, labor unions and their role, labor education, and the right to organize. The forum also touched on the Palestinian economy and its components, unemployment in Palestine and how to deal with it, and the impetus for the Palestinian labor force and ways of stimulating it." He added that the meeting was worthwhile in that it enables Palestinian labor leaders to carry out their future responsibilities and help build the Palestinian state. He said that the Arab Labor Organization's plan for 1994/95 involves programmed activities as an initial step to benefit the parties to production in Palestine. He said that the Organization's specialized experts drafted a Palestinian labor law, which was submitted to Palestinian authorities for their review and comments before the Organization puts it in its final form. Bakr Mahmud Rasul criticized the extent of Arab commitment to joint Arab labor agreements and said that "since its inception and until its last meeting in Amman last year, the Organization has been able to reach and ratify 14 Arab labor agreements dealing with such issues as transport of Arab labor, protection for women and minors, vocational training, labor culture, union freedoms, guarantees, and social security. Even though all these agreements underwent lengthy procedures, and even though they were passed unanimously with no reservations by any party, the rate of approval that would commit a state to an agreement remains low. Some Arab countries have ratified no Arab labor agreement at all. Other countries, even though they are founding members of the Organization, have ratified only one or two agreements. A third group of countries ratified the agreements, but took positions that proved contradictory to their provisions. He added that commitment to the agreements is a matter of moral, cultural, and national obligation. Bakr Rasul said that the agenda of the upcoming Cairo session to be held early next April, involves discussion of the secretary general's report, in which he debates the subject of small industries and traditional crafts. This matter is of special interest because it is closely linked to the social and economic changes taking place in most of the Arab states as a result of economic restructuring that impacts employment and the war on unemployment as well as the optimum utilization of natural, technical, and human resources. Another important item on the upcoming meeting's agenda deals with economic reform programs and restructuring and their impact on labor issues. The agenda also includes items on union freedoms and rights in the Arab nations and the ratification of the Arab plan of action at the 81st session of the International Labor Congress scheduled for Geneva next June.
