The attackers, operating just hours before the start of a Togolese legislative election campaign, managed to escape in a mini- bus before soldiers could return fire, the source said, adding that no one had been injured in the shooting. Elections are scheduled for February 6 and 20 and opposition parties have expressed fears that the poll will not be organised fairly. Earlier this month 67 people were killed in fighting that broke out after an attack on Togolese President Gnassingbe Eyadema and the barracks where he has his official residence. The government attributed the January 5 attack to opposition members in exile in neighbouring Ghana, who it alleged were being backed by Ghanaian authorities. Ghanaian leaders have repeatedly denied the allegations and on Friday Ghana's foreign minister, Obed Asamoah, warned Togo that his country would retaliate if Lome continued to accuse Accra of supporting the assassination attempt. "Any future deliberate and unprovoked aggression on Ghana by Togo will be met with a commensurate response," Asamoah warned during a meeting with diplomats and reporters. "There is an extent to which Ghana can be patient to these attacks by Togo."
