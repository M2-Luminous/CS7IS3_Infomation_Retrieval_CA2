FBIS4-10454 "drlat071_m_94004" FBIS-LAT-94-071 Daily Report 12 Apr 1994 Brazil Lula: Party To Change Abortion Position Lula: Party To Change Abortion Position PY1304033194 Sao Paulo O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO in Portuguese 12 Apr 94 p A4 PY1304033194 Sao Paulo O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO Portuguese BFN [Article by Lucia Helena Gazzola] [Text] Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, presidential candidate for the Workers Party [PT], on 11 April promised Bishop Luciano Mendes de Almeida, chairman of the National Conference of Brazilian Bishops (CNBB), that two controversial proposals that irritated the church will be withdrawn from the PT government platform: the legalization of abortion and marriage between homosexuals. Lula and Bishop Mendes de Almeida met in Sao Paulo at Lula's request. "I told Bishop Luciano that the final decision on this subject will be made at the national party convention, but I am sure, just like the rest of my party, that although these problems must be discussed by society, they must not be part of our government platform," Lula said. Lula is thus attempting to eliminate the discomfort created in the relations with one of the PT's traditional allies -- the so-called progressive church. Lula has guaranteed Bishop Luciano that he is against abortion and that the PT's greatest concern is "the defense of the lives of millions of Brazilians who are alive and about to be born. Issues like these are not a priority in a country where millions of people are starving or unemployed. The priority is the distribution of wealth and the agricultural and employment policies." Lula discussed with Bishop Mendes de Almeida the document "Brazil: Alternatives and Protagonists," which is an analysis of the current situation prepared by the CNBB for its annual meeting that will begin on 13 April in Itaici, Sao Paulo. "We will speak with all the presidential candidates because it is our duty as a church to bring suggestions to help solve the national crisis," Bishop Mendes de Almeida said. He clearly established that the church expects the PT to reconsider its position regarding abortion and marriage between homosexuals. "The key, for us, is the defense of life," he said. "A fetus is defenseless and it is our duty to defend its rights." As for the document that will be discussed in Itaici, the CNBB chairman said: "We want a firmer stance by the democratic state, an economy centered on society, and the elimination of corruption in public administration."
