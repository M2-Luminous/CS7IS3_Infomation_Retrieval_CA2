The sides intend in the very near future to make adjustments to their positions before U.S. President Bill Clinton's coming visit to Moscow and Minsk, and also to discuss the major problems of Belarusian-Russian relations. Stanislaw Shushkevich said the state of our economy is critical. Moreover, I do not support suggestions that joining a single ruble zone will solve all our problems. [Words indistinct] sick and must be cured. We ourselves must find ways of restoring our economy on market relations. If that does not happen, the republic will be threatened with a terrible collapse. Speaking about Bill Clinton's coming visit to Minsk, Shushkevich noted that if we solve theoretically such problems as disarmament, conversion, and monetary questions, then signing the corresponding agreements after that will be essentially just a technicality. So it is hardly likely that many specific documents will be signed in Minsk. That will have to be done in the future. Stanislaw Shushkevich's statement also dealt with the INTERFAX report quoting Vyachaslaw Kebich as saying that after Russia joins NATO, Belarus may also become a member of that bloc. The point is, the speaker explained, that all Belarus's most important documents, including the constitutional law, indicate that Belarus adheres to a path of neutrality and of not adhering to any blocs. We have a completely different foreign policy doctrine, at whose center lies neutrality. Belarus never officially declared its desire to enter the North Atlantic union. This statement is no way connected with the CIS countries' collective security treaty, which Vyachaslaw Frantsavich [Kebich] has always supported. Perhaps this is some sort of mistake by journalists, Stanislaw Shushkevich concluded.
