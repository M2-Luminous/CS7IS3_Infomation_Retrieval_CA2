Returning from a three-day official visit to Turkey, Baudys said the only thing for which he could be reprimanded was that he used two military air attaches, in Brussels and Washington, to distribute the initiative. "Dismissal of a minister is within the premier's jurisdiction and I see no reason to resign," he said, adding that he would make no further statements on the initiative today. Baudys will meet with Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec later tonight. Baudys told journalists that Turkish Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin spoke shortly with him before his departure, which proves that "in Turkey, at least, the Czech Republic's interests have not been harmed by my initiative proposal."
