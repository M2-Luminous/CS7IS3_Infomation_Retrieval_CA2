The unpleasant thing is that in such cases the curtain falls by itself and then the public notices the fact that the main political actors are nude, long before they themselves realize it. They are helpless as children in the present situation. The leaders of the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP], for example, unanimously plead with Professor Berov to return to his post as soon as possible. Performing medical miracles they try to make the public believe in the political revival of the cabinet, which long ago exhausted the formula of its formation as a result of its insolvency. Naturally, the BSP will do this only until the moment it serves its interest, and in any case not before an agreement with the international finance institutions is signed, something which will serve as the main claim of the Socialists in the forthcoming elections. As far as the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS] is concerned, the present situation is another gift from heaven. The question is how will the SDS utilize it. After the 15 March meeting of its National Coordinating Council, the SDS called upon the president to begin consultations with the political forces. What could one expect from such a proposal? First of all, after the recent attacks on the presidency the proposal is more than an admission of the president's role in political life. The idea to begin consultations with the political forces is the best way of finding a solution to the current crisis, which soon will develop from a cabinet into a parliamentary crisis. The increasing fluctuation of deputies from one faction to another will only prepare the ground for this development. Our society is talking about new elections. Now someone should take the initiative, which will produce practical results. The five no-confidence proposals failed, but now the situation is rather different. Deputies of the New Alliance for Democracy categorically stated that they will not support the cabinet. Deputies from other factions, including the BSP, will most probably do the same. Now is the moment for the SDS to assume the initiative. Instead of waiting for the president to do the job of all other political factors in the country, the SDS now should propose a formula for beginning political consultations. Today this means a readiness to assume responsibility.
