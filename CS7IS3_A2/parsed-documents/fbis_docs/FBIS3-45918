At the same time, 1,000 copies of QINGXIANG [TENDENCY] magazine, published by Bei Ling, were also confiscated by the public security authorities. Bei Ling is a famous Chinese poet. He emigrated and settled in the United States in 1988. He is now a U.S. green card holder. He was writer in residence at Brown University in the United States for a time. Reportedly, Bei Ling recently published a new literature and humanities quarterly named QINGXIANG in the United States. Famous Chinese writer Bing Xing was invited to be an adviser for the magazine, and she also wrote the magazine's name. [passage omitted] Yesterday, Bei Ling told MING PAO that last Friday [21 January], he was detained by public security officers for three hours at the airport in Shanghai. The security officers thoroughly examined and searched his luggage and also questioned him. After Bei Ling went to Shenzhen, he was searched again by local public security officers, and 1,000 copies of the first issue of QINGXIANG were taken away by the security officers, who said that they would destroy them. Bei Ling said that seven local public security officers began to question him last Saturday and continued to do so every day in an attempt to discover the background of the magazine. The public security authorities also prohibited him from leaving China and warned that if he tried to forcefully cross the border today, they would "arrange another place" for him to live. Bei Ling said that QINGXIANG had not been distributed in China, but was printed in Shenzhen. He did not understand why such a literary and humanities quarterly would cause so much trouble as it was only aimed at expressing writers' wishes for creative freedom and publishing freedom. On the other hand, Qin Yongmin, a dissident in Wuhan, was accused of "creating turmoil" and was sentenced by the authorities to two years' of reeducation-through-labor. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Justice both said that they did not know about a rumored plan to release three political prisoners. UPI quoted a Beijing source saying that Qin Yongmin, a dissident in Wuhan who became well-known for his opposition to Beijing's bid to host the 2000 Olympic Games, was sentenced by the Wuhan authorities to two years' reeducation-through-labor obviously because he had joined other comrades in launching the "Peace Charter." The sources said: "The Wuhan Public Security Bureau accused him of creating social turmoil and sentenced him to two years' detention in a labor camp." Qin Yongmin, 40, was formerly a worker in a steel works in Wuhan. He was also the founder of ZHONGSHENG [BELL SOUND] magazine. Last November, nine pro-democracy activists headed by Qin jointly signed the "Peace Charter" in Beijing, demanding that the Beijing authorities accept multiparty politics, and called on the people to give the government the opportunity for reform. As a result, he was detained by the authorities for a short time and sent back to Wuhan. On the other hand, a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that he knew nothing about a rumored plan to release three political prisoners. REUTERS quoted the spokesman as saying: "To my knowledge, there is no such thing." The Chinese Ministry of Justice also said that there was no such plan.
