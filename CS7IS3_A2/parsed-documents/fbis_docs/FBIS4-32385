He visited the International Bank for Investment and Development and met with Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov, Defence Minister Valentin Aleksandrov, the leaders of the parliamentary National Security Committee and President Zhelyu Zhelev. The bilateral relations, Bulgaria's participation in the Partnership for Peace initiative and the crisis in the former Yugoslavia were the key issues on the agenda. Admiral Owens is visiting here at the invitation of the Defence Ministry and the General Staff of the Bulgarian Army. He delivered a lecture at the Atlantic Club. President Zhelev elaborated on Bulgaria's position of non-interference in the conflict in the former Yugoslavia and non- participation in the peacekeeping forces there. It is skeptical about the participation of Turkish "blue helmets." There is transparency about Bulgaria's relations with its neighbours Greece and Turkey, the military sphere included, he said. In his opinion, however, Bulgaria is in a difficult position because of the lack of balance in the region, Greece and Turkey being much better armed. [passage omitted] Defence Secretary William Perry will arrive here July 18, Admiral Owens said. Mr. Daskalov familiarized Admiral Owens with the progress in the development of an individual cooperation programme and emphasized the significance that Bulgaria attributes to its long-term relations with NATO, Foreign Ministry spokesman Radko Vlaykov reported. They both praised UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] for preventing the expansion of the conflict. Defence Minister Valentin Aleksandrov thanked for the chance given to Bulgarian officers to study in U.S. military schools. He said Bulgaria was hoping to have at least one battalion armed according to NATO standards, so that Bulgaria can take part in UN peacekeeping missions. The leaders of the Parliamentary National Security Committee pointed out the political forces' consensus on Bulgaria's integration with the European and Euro-Atlantic structures, the parliamentary press office reported. They pointed out that Bulgaria needs more guarantees for its national security from its Western partners. At the International Bank for Investment and Development Admiral Owens was familiarized with the progress of business contacts between Bulgarian and U.S. groups. This bank is the first Bulgarian-U.S. joint venture in the banking sphere in which the Bulgarian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and Parmont Capital Investments have equal shares.
