No details were given about the issue discussed by Gen. Eyadema and Mr. Kwajo. Their talks might not be unconnected with the shelling of our Aflao border post yesterday with gunfire from Ghana. The border post was shelled with automatic weapons. Togolese soldiers have received instructions not to return fire against any attack from that neighboring country.
