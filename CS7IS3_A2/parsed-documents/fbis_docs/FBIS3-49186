The government presented reports by three international commissions asked to check out the safety of the plant, and Jazbinsek said they had "found no critical shortcoming that would justify halting the nuclear plant." One of the commissions was from the International Atomic Energy Agency, the second from the International Commission for Independent Safety Analysis, and the third from the European Commission in Brussels (the executive arm of the European Community). Jazbinsek noted that the reports acknowledged that there were "considerable financial problems" in upgrading the plant's safety. The power station, 30 kms (19 miles) from the Croatian capital of Zagreb, was built by the U.S. firm Westinghouse and went into operation in 1984. Its capacity is 632 MW, and it sends half of its output to Slovenia and the other half to Croatia. Slovenia has criticized Croatia for irregular contributions to operating costs and its refusal to store part of the nuclear waste. As to improved safety, the experts point particularly to fire protection, replacing steam generators, and seismic dangers in the area.
