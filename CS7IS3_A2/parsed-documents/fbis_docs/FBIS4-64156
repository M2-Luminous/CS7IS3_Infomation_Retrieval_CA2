The government has failed to work out a national reform program which could have become a basis for the consolidation of society. This made the constructive interaction of the branches of power impossible. It also made it impossible to carry out an integral and logically complete legislative policy. In this connection the democratically elected Supreme Kenges, reflecting the will of the majority of voters expressed by the latter during many preelection meetings, must express a lack of confidence in the government's social, economic, and legal policy. In this situation the only possibility of avoiding a complete paralysis of power is to hold constructive dialogue between all of its branches, and with social and political forces in order to set up a national program of reform and to form a government capable of fulfilling this program. Before the adoption of an agreed program, the Supreme Kenges must focus its attention on the following issues: First, examination of the president's decrees adopted in absentia of the legislative body of power. Second, implementation of the budget and confirmation of the current fiscal year budget. Third, implementation of the control function. Fourth, international agreement subject to ratification. Fifth, expansion and strengthening of interparliamentary relations. Sixth, examination of laws adopted in the first reading by the Supreme Kenges of the 12th convocation and returned by the president for reexamination. The Supreme Kenges considers as a priority the task of immediate and maximum possible protection of the population, the more accurate targetting and efficiency of this protection. The Supreme Kenges intends to take a number of legal measures in order resolutely to protect the producers of goods, to restrict by law the authority of the executive power over state property, to expand the independence of enterprises of all forms of ownership. These measures are necessary only to decrease the consequences of the crisis for the population and the economy, to remove the lack of a systematic approach to law making which is harming the state, and to ensure stability for law making in the Republic of Kazakhstan. The Supreme Kenges expresses its hope of agreement between the branches of power and social and political forces. The Supreme Kenges proposes immediately to begin consultations between representatives of the president, the Supreme Kenges, and other state organs, political parties, and other social associations in order to work out conditions of work on a concerted program of reform.
