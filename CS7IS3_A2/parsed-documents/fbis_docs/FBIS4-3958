"We plan to ease restrictions on foreign investment in local financial-service industries, including banking, insurance and investment trust," Li explained. Taiwan already allows the establishment of fully foreign-owned securities brokerage houses, but still bans foreign investment in its banking industry. Meanwhile, foreign investment in local insurance firms cannot exceed 49 percent, and foreign capital in investment trust companies cannot exceed 40 percent. Li said the ceilings for foreign investment in insurance and trust companies will be raised to more than 50 percent in the future. The Ministry of Finance is preparing a position paper detailing Taiwan's stance on financial liberalization in line with the General Agreement on Trade and Services, which is associated with GATT, Li said. Such a paper is a prerequisite for Taiwan's GATT accession. As Taiwan hopes to join GATT by the end of this year, Li said, "We'll draft short- and mid-term timetables for financial liberalization to win foreign support for our GATT bid." Li said that since many GATT members still limit foreign investment in their banking industry to less than 50 percent, Taiwan may follow suit. As the General Agreement on Trade and Services stipulates that foreign investors in financial and other service industries must be given "national treatment," Li said Taiwan will allow the introduction of more financial products into the local market and give foreign investors a freer hand in operations. At present, Taiwan only permits American insurance firms to open branches here. After Taiwan joins GATT, Li said, insurers from other countries will also be allowed to enter the Taiwan market. Taiwan applied to join the Geneva-based world trade regulatory body as a separate customs territory in 1990 and was granted observer status in 1992. It expects to become a full member before GATT is superseded by the World Trade Organization next January.
