This is the government's latest move to safeguard the repayment of bank loans and investment capital while guiding investment to flow in the desired direction. China National Investment and Guaranty Corporation (CNIGC), with a registered capital of 500 million yuan and 18 million U.S. dollars in its foreign currency fund, is poised to provide credit guarantees for investments required by new and hi-tech industry and for technical renovation. In addition, the corporation will invest directly in industrial projects and provide feasibility studies and consulting services. The guarantee business will be more or less policy-oriented, said Jiang Lemin, CNIGC's president, as new and hi-tech projects in any case need strong support from the government. But the rest of the corporation's business will be conducted to make profits, to ensure that CNIGC will have greater guarantee powers. At present, CNIGC can only provide credit guarantees for a maximum 5 billion yuan, or ten times the amount of its capital fund, Jiang noted. He stressed that CNIGC's potential clients will encompass all kinds of enterprises, including foreign-funded and private ones.
