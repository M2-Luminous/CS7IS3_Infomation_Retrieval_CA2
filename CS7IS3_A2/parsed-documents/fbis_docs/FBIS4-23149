FBIS4-23149 "drafr104_d_94020" FBIS-AFR-94-104 Daily Report 29 May 1994 SOUTHERN AFRICA Zimbabwe FPZ Opposition Party Said Torn by In-Fighting FPZ Opposition Party Said Torn by In-Fighting Leader Expelled From Party Post MB2905095594 Johannesburg SAPA in English 0843 GMT 29 May 94 MB2905095594 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [Text] Harare May 29 SAPA -- The capacity for Zimbabwe's fragile political opposition to take on President Robert Mugabe's ruling ZANU-PF [Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front] party in elections next year appeared to deteriorate sharply this weekend as the squabble-torn Forum Party of Zimbabwe [FPZ] expelled its leader, former Chief Justice Enoch Dumbutshena. Reports in the local press on Sunday said the 75-year-old lawyer had been voted out at a stormy meeting here on Saturday where he was accused of incompetence, selfishness and a lack of respect for other party officials. He was replaced by the party's secretary-general, Mr Themba Dhlodlo. It was not clear if Mr Dumbutshena was present at the meeting of 300 delegates from five of the party's provincial organisastions. Attempts to reach the ousted leader were unsuccessful. Observers say Saturday's action may well ring the death knell for the FPZ, torn by in-fighting almost since its inception two years [ago]. FPZ was launched amid great hopes that its leadership of respected figures could at last present a strong challenge to Mr Mugabe. Of the 120 elected seats in Zimbabwe's Parliament, only three are held by opposition MPs. Much of the rest of the opposition is headed by failed elderly politicians. Two months ago, a group of FPZ officials staged a demonstration against Mr Dumbutshena, and he had 22 of them expelled for indiscipline. The incident occurred almost simultaneously as Mr Mugabe tried to fire his party's youth league with enthusiasm on Saturday. He urged them at their congress here to start a house-to-house campaign to "send a message to those little parties that think the opportunity is ripe to take over and destroy the revolution".
