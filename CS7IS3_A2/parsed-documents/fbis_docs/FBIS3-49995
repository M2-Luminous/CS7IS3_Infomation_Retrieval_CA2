Regarding this statement, ATA reporters asked explanations from the vice chairman of the SP, Servet Pellumbi, and Deputy Bashkim Zeneli, who repeated they support the conclusion they have declared. But, according to them, the blockade of the information has been more evident in other mass media than the ATA. Asked for concrete facts related to their conclusion, the SP officials mentioned only two cases, that of the rally in Kucove and the case when some people in Shkoder didn't allow some deputies of the SP to have a rally they had previously announced, both events have taken place 7-8 months ago. For these two cases, since its correspondents have not been present in the spot for lack of transportation means, ATA has made the report referring to the spokesman of the Ministry of Public Order, since incidents took place in these events. Mr. Pellumbi and Mr. Zeneli admitted that reports of the SP sent to ATA have been few. According to them, the SP spokesman has not known the practice of sending reports to main mass media and secondly, in some cases, proceeding from the former practice of not giving reports, it has been prejudiced that these institutions have made a continuous blockade to reports. For further explanations about their claims regarding the ATA, Mr. Pellumbi and Mr. Zeneli said they will discuss about it the next day.
