However, as President Yeltsin remarked, the fact that we are not invited is no reason to take umbrage and perceive this as evidence of mistrust of Russia on the part of its former allies in the anti-Hitler coalition. A situation where "you have your celebrations and we will have ours" would have been more appropriate during the previous Berlin Wall era.

However, just as nothing came of the idea of a "common European home," so nothing is coming of Russia's stately "entry" into Europe. Our partners periodically hint that Russia can be described as a European power only in the geographical context. But not in the political context. The celebration of the Allied forces' Normandy landings -- like, moreover the ceremony marking the withdrawal of the Allies' troops from German territory -- has shown us that once again....
