It says the private sectors in those countries were responsible for piracy of books, software, movies, and discs resulting in a loss of some 200,000 million baht to them. It is a pity the complaint did not give a specific figure about the damage caused by Thailand alone. It is quite understandable why American companies complained -- they wanted their government to apply Section 301 of the U.S. Trade Act to penalize Thailand. Thailand is one of the countries on the priority watch list facing U.S. trade retaliation. It is possible the United States would take action against them the way it is doing with Japan for rejecting conditions offered by the United States to solve the problem of trade surplus -- Japan agreed to solve the problem, but not the way dictated by the United States. It also indicated it would take action before the G-7 meeting, or the meeting of the seven industrialized countries. That was Japan's condition. As for Thailand, it has no choice but to wait and see what decision the United States makes. This depends on how sincere and how serious Thailand is concerning its efforts to suppress copyright violations. We think the Commerce Ministry has been trying hard to suppress copyright violations. There have been raids and seizures of pirated cassettes, and the products are destroyed. Legal actions have been taken against imitators. However, the rate of arrests might not be big enough for the American companies; otherwise they would not have complained to the U.S. Trade Representative. So we think that to avoid U.S. trade retaliation Thailand, through the Commerce Ministry, should take action more seriously and consistently to stop copyright piracy. We must show to the United States that we did not remain oblivious to the problem, and thus the proposal by the American companies is not justified. The government must protect the interest of the nation against negative impacts caused by a handful of law violators. Anyway, we would like to appeal to the United States to be fair. As Thailand is cracking down on the illegals, certain countries are abusing the copyright law to a greater extent. The United States did not show any concern. If this is allowed to continue, it would be unfair for those with their names on the U.S. priority watch list. The United States realized what was going on, but it was reluctant to react because this involves a big country with a large population and a gross human rights violation. The United States closes its eyes and pretends not knowing what is going on. Can this be called a discrimination by the United States? If the answer is no, that means the United States applies different rules to different countries.
