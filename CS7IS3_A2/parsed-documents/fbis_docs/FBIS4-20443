Using antibody to F peptide and monoclonal antibody to HA, the corresponding proteins were detected in the lysate of infected cells by Western blot, showing that the expressed products were similar to the authentic measles virus proteins. Both recombinants produced a high level of antibodies to measles virus in rabbits, which were able to both inhibit the hemolysis activity and neutralize the measles virus in cell culture. In addition, animals vaccinated with vCmH also developed hemagglutinin-inhibiting antibody.
