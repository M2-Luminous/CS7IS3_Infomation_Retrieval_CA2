FBIS4-53831 "dreas100_c_94008" FBIS-EAS-94-100 Daily Report 23 May 1994 North Korea WPC Urged To Expose ROK's Nuclear Development WPC Urged To Expose ROK's Nuclear Development SK2305154494 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1534 GMT 23 May 94 SK2305154494 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, May 23 (KCNA) -- The Korean National Peace Committee sent a letter to the World Peace Council on May 18, which called upon the council to take a serious view of the criminal nuclear development by the South Korean authorities and lift up the voice informing the world community of it. Noting that the United States invented "nuclear suspicion" against the DPRK, describing its 5 megawatt experimental nuclear power station as one for the development of nuclear arms, and has escalated the anti-DPRK campaign over the "nuclear issue," the letter said: The one posing a nuclear threat on the Korean peninsula is not the DPRK, a non-nuclear state, but the United States which deployed over 1,000 nuclear weapons in South Korea and is hell bent on nuclear war exercises directed against the North. What is used for nuclear development is not the North's 5-megawatt experimental nuclear power station but the heavy water reactor and the multipurpose research reactor in South Korea. As South Korean officials in charge of nuclear development confessed, the Wolsong heavy water reactor disguised as a reactor for "commercial use" and the Taedok multipurpose atomic reactor disguised as one for "research", were introduced for the purpose of developing nuclear weapons. South Korea is now producing a large quantity of plutonium through those reactors. The Wolsong heavy water reactor has produced plutonium enough to make 370 or more nuclear bombs after it started operation in 1983. Nevertheless, the nuclear development in South Korea has not been taken seriously in the international community. This is because of the deliberate connivance of the United States and the International Atomic Energy Agency and their biased act aimed at stifling the DPRK. We consider that the South Korean authorities' nuclear arms development can never be tolerated in view of peace in Asia and the rest of the world or of the World Peace Council's idea of building a nuclear-free world. It is the primary requisite to the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula for the South Korean authorities to give up their nuclear arms development and dismantle the heavy water reactor and the multipurpose research reactor designed for the development of nuclear arms. Since the DPRK Government expressed its willingness to replace its graphite-moderated experimental power reactor with a light-water reactor, they must clearly state to the world public their willingness to scrap the heavy water reactor and the multipurpose research reactor which are being used in developing nuclear weapons. For the Korean peninsula to be turned into a nuclear-free zone and a durable peace to be ensured there, it is essential to get the U.S. forces and nuclear weapons withdrawn from South Korea unconditionally and totally. This is the main question which must be solved in removing the danger of a nuclear war on the Korean peninsula over which the world is now concerned, and guaranteeing peace. We believe that the council will take a serious view of the criminal nuclear arms development by the South Korean authorities, which is being feverishly promoted behind the scene of the U.S. nuclear smear campaign, and lift up voices exposing it to the international community. We also express the hope that you will continue to extend unstinting support to the Korean people's just cause of peace on the Korean peninsula and its peaceful reunification.
