He and members of the provincial legislature addressed the police in the region. [Begin recording] [Correspondent Veronica Van der Westhuizen] Throughout the years policemen have been regarded as thugs by the majority of South Africans due to the political situation in the country. Mr. Sexwale said that policemen had been used by politicians to enforce unpopular laws such as the Group Areas Act and the Immorality Act. He today asked the police to leave politics in the hands of the government and to make the protection of the public its primary task. [Sexwale, in English] Let us strategize together. Let us begin to find ways of addressing all the problems that we have together. I must tell you, you are some of the most underpaid people in this country [applause]. [Van der Westhuizen] Mr. Sexwale said the PWV's executive council will support the police in all respects so that it can regain lost respectability in the region. He spoke out against attacks on policemen. [Sexwale] We won't stand back to see policemen being killed in the street -- honest, loyal people who are prepared to uphold the law as professional police. [Van der Westhuizen] Mr. Sexwale appealed to policemen, and to those who, as he put it, did not deserve to wear a blue uniform, to create a police service that will be trusted and respected.
