The atrocities committed in former Yugoslavia are likely to be discussed at length during this six-week session. The 53 participating countries will also consider the human rights situation in Burma, Iran, Iraq, and Afghanistan. A priority concern will also be the right to development and women's rights. The Commission began by electing its new president, Pieter van Wulfften Palthe, a Dutch diplomat and lawyer. Ibrahim Fall, director of the human rights center, denounced the enduring violations of human rights. He nevertherless welcomed some progress that has been made in the fight against these shortcomings, and he mentioned in particular the appointment in the near future of a United Nations high commissioner for human rights. Progress As Well The decision to create such a post was taken at the World Conference in Vienna in August 1993. The high commissioner will be Ecuadorean Ambassador to the UN Jose Ayala Lasso, whose appointment is to be officially announced within the next few days by UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali. Over these last twelve months, a number of complex situations have been resolved, declared Mr. Fall. This should lead to substantial improvements in human rights. The agreements between the Israelis and the Palestinians, the political developments in South Africa, and the founding of a court of justice to investigate war crimes in the former Yugoslavia are all examples of this progress. Mr. Fall also considered that the appointment of a special rapporteur on women's questions will help guarantee women's rights. He also stressed the importance of the right to development and regretted the insufficient attention so far paid to social, economic, and cultural rights. Lack of Money According to Gerhard Baum, former German interior minister, Western countries are going to press for the condemnation of China. China has always succeeded in preventing any resolution regarding itself from being adopted. Mr. Baum called for more financial resources for the human rights center. He felt it was unable to acquit itself of its tasks with the resources that are currently at its disposal. On the Commission's agenda are Tuesday's visit by PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat, together with Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou. On Wednesday, the former Federal Council member Rene Felber will submit his report on the human rights situation in the Israeli occupied territories. Shim'on Peres, Israeli foreign minister, will be addressing the Commission on 10 February.
