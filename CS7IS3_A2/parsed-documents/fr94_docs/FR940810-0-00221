(7) Coverage under this standard shall be based on the nature of the work operation involving asbestos exposure. (b) Definitions. Aggressive method means removal or disturbance of building/vessel materials by sanding, abrading, grinding, or other method that breaks, crumbles, or otherwise disintegrates intact ACM. Amended water means water to which surfactant (wetting agent) has been added to increase the ability of the liquid to penetrate ACM. Asbestos includes chrysotile, amosite, crocidolite, tremolite asbestos, anthophyllite asbestos, actinolite asbestos, and any of these minerals that has been chemically treated and/or altered. For purposes of this standard, ``asbestos'' includes PACM, as defined below. Asbestos-containing material, (ACM) means any material containing more than one percent asbestos. Assistant Secretary means the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health, U.S. Department of Labor, or designee. Authorized person means any person authorized by the employer and required by work duties to be present in regulated areas.
