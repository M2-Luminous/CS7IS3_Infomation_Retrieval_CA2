FR940916-0-00028 FR940916-0-00011 33 CFR Part 117 [CGD07&hyph;93&hyph;110] Drawbridge Operation Regulations; Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway, FL AGENCY: Coast Guard, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Coast Guard is changing the regulations governing the operation of the State Road 402 Max Brewer Bridge, mile 878.9, at Titusville by permitting the draw to remain closed during different periods. This change is being made to synchronize the existing closed periods with the periods of peak vehicular traffic. This action will accommodate the needs of vehicular traffic and still provide for the reasonable needs of navigation. EFFECTIVE DATE: October 17, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Walt Paskowsky, Project Manager, Bridge Section, (305) 536&hyph;4103. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Drafting Information The principal persons involved in drafting this document are Walt Paskowsky, Project Manager, and LT Jacqueline Losego, Project Counsel. Regulatory History On February 22, 1994, the Coast Guard published a notice of proposed rulemaking entitled Drawbridge Operation Regulations, Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway, FL in the Federal Register (59 FR 8428). The Coast Guard received no comments on the proposal. A public hearing was not requested and one was not held. Background and Purpose The bridge presently opens on signal except that from 6:15 a.m. to 7:15 a.m. and 3 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday, except federal holidays, the draw need not open. NASA, whose employees commute to and from the John F. Kennedy Space Center, requested a 30 minute increase in the morning closed period extending from 6 a.m. to 7:30 a.m. This was requested to insure uninterrupted flow of highway traffic during the heaviest daily commuter traffic periods. The bridgeowner, Brevard County, concurred with the proposal. A Coast Guard analysis of highway traffic showed the bridge is used almost exclusively by commuter traffic (90% flow in one direction) for about an hour each weekday morning and afternoon. The drawbridge is opened frequently due to its substandard clearance (9 feet closed) especially during the fall and spring vessel migration periods. Holding conditions for vessels are considered adequate to allow vessels to safely wait for a bridge opening during the commuter closed periods. A review of the traffic data indicates there has been a change in the timing and density of commuter traffic which requires an earlier morning closed period. In addition, the data showed there has been a reduction in the amount of afternoon commuter traffic which would allow a change in the closure periods without requiring an increase in the length of time vessels are required to wait for an opening. Discussion of Comments and Changes No comments were received. The owner of the bridge, Brevard County, concurred with the proposed change. The final rule is, therefore, unchanged from the proposed rule published on February 22, 1994. Regulatory Evaluation This rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of executive order 12866 and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a) (3) of that order. It has been exempted from review by the office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation. (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10 E of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979) is unnecessary. We conclude this because the rule exempts tugs with tows. Small Entities Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), the Coast Guard must consider whether this rule will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632). Since the rule exempts tugs with tows, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Collection of Information This rule contains no collection of information requirements. Federalism The Coast Guard has analyzed the rule under principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and has determined that this rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Environment The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this rule and concluded that under section 2.B.2.g.(5) of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B., promulgation of operating requirements for drawbridges is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. A Categorical Exclusion Determination is available in the docket. List of Subjects in 33 CFR Part 117 Bridges.
