Supervisory Board Chairman Pavel Safarik told reporters that his body does not see sufficient justification for the appointment of Roman Ceska as the new chairman of the FNM Executive Council. The argument that, due to the appointment of the deputy privatization minister as the Fund's chairman, there will be better interlinking between the Privatization Ministry and the FNM, seems inadequate to them. In the opinion of the Supervisory Board, these two institutions were already in close contact prior to the recall of T. Jezek. "The conflict of interests that led officially to Tomas Jezek's resignation also relates to Roman Ceska," states the resolution. The Supervisory Board also stated that the course of action adopted by the Fund's Presidium in the recall of Tomas Jezek and his two deputies damaged relations between the privatization bodies and, as a consequence, may even endanger the entire course of privatization. Jan Klak, a member of the Supervisory Board, declared that the Supervisory Board will demand that the Fund's Presidium, which is chaired by Privatization Minister Jiri Skalicky, airs its views immediately on the board's resolution. If its response is inadequate, the Supervisory Board is prepared to turn the matter over to parliament and the government. Speculation that parliament could recall the Fund's Presidium was described as premature by Safarik. In reply to a question on what he thinks of the Supervisory Board's resolution, FNM Chairman R. Ceska said that he had not been informed of the contents of the board's meeting and refused to comment. He said that he was not directly involved in the recall of T. Jezek and that it would vex him if this were to lead to a tense situation between him and the Supervisory Board. He said that on Friday [17 June] morning he had asked the Supervisory Board to help him resolve the situation in the FNM in a calm manner. In reply to a question from LIDOVE NOVINY regarding the state of the FNM when he took over from T. Jezek, R. Ceska said: "There are certain problems of a more serious nature here and they will not be resolved by waving a magic wand." [The same newspaper on the same date on page 3, under the headline "Skalicky Is Standing Behind Ceska," carries a 300-word CTK and "(il)"-signed report on Privatization Minister Jiri Skalicky's reaction to the resolution adopted by the FNM Supervisory Board. According to the report, Skalicky "does not understand the formulation" according to which the board "does not see sufficient justification for the appointment of Roman Ceska as the new chairman of the FNM Executive Council." He said that "he is prepared to inform the Supervisory Board in detail of the reasons for this step" and added that the FNM Presidium had tried "to ensure that the necessary changes in the FNM's management were not made in an atmosphere of emotion and mutual recrimination. Therefore, the Presidium's members did not inform the public of the circumstances of Tomas Jezek's resignation."]
