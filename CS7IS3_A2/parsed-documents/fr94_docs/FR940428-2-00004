FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Zev Primor or Wendy Frankel, Office of Antidumping Compliance, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230; telephone: (202) 482&hyph;5253. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On March 23, 1994, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the Federal Register (59 FR 13700) the final results of its administrative review of the antidumping duty order on color television receivers (CTVs) from the Republic of Korea (ROK) (49 FR 18336, April 30, 1984). The review covers seven manufacturers/exporters and the period April 1, 1991, through March 31, 1992. After publication of our final results, we received timely allegations of ministerial errors, pursuant to ยง353.28 of the Department's regulations, from the petitioners (the Independent Radionic Workers of America, the United Electrical Workers of America, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, the International Union of Electronic, Electrical, Salaried, Machine and Furniture Workers, AFL&hyph;CIO, and Industrial Union Department, AFL&hyph;CIO), and one respondent, Daewoo Electronics Co., Ltd. (Daewoo). We have corrected the ministerial errors, as discussed below, and we have amended the final results of review for Daewoo to reflect those corrections pursuant to ยง353.28(c) of the Department's regulations. Ministerial Errors We have corrected the following ministerial errors: 1. In the computer program instructions for Daewoo's purchase price (PP) calculations, we had used an incorrect model designation (``DTV&hyph;9234N''). We have changed this to the correct designation (``DTV9234N''). 2. In the exporter's sales price (ESP) final results computer program, we included the commission offset in the home market tax adjustment calculation. However, in the PP final results computer program, we inadvertently failed to include the commission offset in the home market tax adjustment calculation. We have corrected the equation by including that offset in the PP final results computer program. 3. When comparing home market price, based on constructed value (CV), to United States Price (USP), we removed the tax adjustment on the home market side. However, in both the PP and ESP computer programs, we inadvertently retained the tax adjustment component in USP. We have corrected the calculated by removing the tax adjustment component from USP.
