International Trade and Industry Minister Eijiro Hata told a morning press conference Friday that the officials will not carry with them any specific answers to three new U.S. proposals made as a condition for resuming the framework talks. Washington has asked Japan to clarify its position on macroeconomic policy, the overall goal of the framework talks and the "objective criteria" sought by the United States to assess progress in opening Japan's markets. A senior ministry official suggested the Japanese negotiators will tell their U.S. counterparts of Tokyo's willingness to take action to broaden foreign access to goods procured by the government. "There is room for study in the case of government procurement, which is under the government's jurisdiction," the official said on condition of anonymity. Government procurement is one of the three areas to which Washington gives top priority in the framework talks. But the official said the two sides are likely to run into rough going in trying to define the goal of the bilateral talks initiated by the U.S. to pry open Japanese markets and rectify the chronic trade imbalance between the two countries. Japanese and U.S. negotiators are in agreement not to go into details on "objective criteria" as sought by Washington but rejected by Tokyo, which led the talks to collapse at the summit meeting in Washington in February. A U.S. diplomat has said it seems that U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor will not stick to his effort to pin down objective criteria by any means if Tokyo promises to widen U.S. access to Japanese markets on a sector-by-sector basis. Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa is scheduled to talk with Kantor later in the day by telephone for their first conversation since Kakizawa took office in late April. The issue of how to deal with the framework talks is expected to be on the agenda in the telephone talks. The Japanese trade negotiators to be sent to Washington are Sozaburo Okamatsu, vice minister of international trade and industry for international affairs, and Sadayuki Hayashi, deputy foreign minister for economic affairs.
