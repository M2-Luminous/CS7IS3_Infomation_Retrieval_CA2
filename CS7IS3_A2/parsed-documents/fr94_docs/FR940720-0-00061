FR940720-0-00061 FR940720-0-00005 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Concurrence Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(ii), OSM is required to obtain the written concurrence of the EPA with respect to those provisions of the proposed program amendment that relate to air or water quality standards promulgated under the authority of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) or the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.). None of the revisions that Pennsylvania proposed to make in this amendment pertain to air or water quality standards. Therefore, OSM did not request EPA's concurrence. Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(i), OSM solicited comments on the proposed amendment from EPA (Administrative Record No. PA 823.01). The EPA responded that it concurred with the proposed amendment. V. Director's Decision Based on the above findings, the Director approves the proposed amendment as submitted by Pennsylvania on May 11, 1993, and clarified on February 17, 1994. As discussed at Finding 2.1., the Director finds that, for the most part, the Pennsylvania program does not have a counterpart to the Federal rules at 30 CFR 800.23(e)(2). The Director is, therefore, requiring Pennsylvania to further amend its program to correct the identified deficiencies. In accordance with 30 CFR 732.17(f)(1), the Director is also taking this opportunity to clarify in the required amendment section at 30 CFR 938.16 that, within 60 days of the publication of this final rule, Pennsylvania must either submit a proposed written amendment, or a description of an amendment to be proposed that meets the requirements of SMCRA and 30 CFR Chapter VII and a timetable for enactment that is consistent with Pennsylvania's established administrative or legislative procedures. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR Part 938 codifying decisions concerning the Pennsylvania program are being amended to implement this decision. This final rule is being made effective immediately to expedite the State program amendment process and to encourage States to conform their programs with the Federal standards without undue delay. Consistency of State and Federal standards is required by SMCRA. For administrative reasons, the Director is reiterating the removal of required amendments (i), (j), and (k) as set forth in 57 FR 48733 (October 28, 1992). Effect of the Director's Decision Section 503 of SMCRA provides that a State may not exercise jurisdiction under SMCRA unless the State program is approved by the Secretary. Similarly, 30 CFR 732.17(a) requires that any alteration of an approved State program be submitted to OSM for review as a program amendment. Thus any changes to the State program are not enforceable until approved by OSM. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.17(g) prohibit any unilateral changes to approved State programs. In the oversight of the Pennsylvania program, the Director will recognize only the statutes, regulations and other materials approved by him, together with any consistent implementing policies, directives and other materials, and will require the enforcement by Pennsylvania of only such provisions. VI. Procedural Determinations Executive Order 12866 This rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866. Executive Order 12778 The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 and has determined that, to the extent allowed by law, this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section. However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1253 and 1255) and 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15 and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other requirements of 30 CFR parts 730, 731 and 732 have been met. National Environmental Policy Act No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C). Paperwork Reduction Act This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3507 et seq.
