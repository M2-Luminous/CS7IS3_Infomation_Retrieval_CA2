C. Tsai] [text] Taipei, March 18 (CNA) -- The government on Friday [18 March] pledged to accelerate the development of the Changhua Coastal Industrial Zone in central Taiwan, where 15 domestic steelmakers are planning to establish a steel complex. Officials of the Industrial Development Bureau (IDB) under the Ministry of Economic Affairs said that the bureau recently gave a green light to the building of a large thermal power plant in the zone by the state-run Taiwan Power Company. Completion of the power plant will help ensure a sufficient supply of electricity in the industrial zone, the officials stressed. The IDB will do its best to continue building the reclaimed land in Changhua County into an industrial area in order to meet the strong demand in Taiwan for land suitable for industrial purposes, they said. A total of 83 manufacturers of everything from precision machinery to computers [words indistinct] applied to open plants in the industrial zone, they added. Meanwhile, the Taiwan Steel and Iron Industries Association announced that 15 steelmakers have decided to join hands to build a steel complex in the zone. Coordinated efforts will help reduce development costs of the steel complex, thereby increasing the competitiveness of the domestic steelmakers, he elaborated. He said the complex will help make Taiwan self-sufficient in steel. Taiwan imported 15 million tons of steel products last year, making it the world' third-largest steel importing country. The spokesman said that the 15 steelmakers are planning to invest NT$30 [New Taiwan dollars] billion (us$1.13 billion) in the five-year project, which will occupy an area of about 200 hectares for the production of a dozen steel products. The IDB officials, however, said that they cannot promise that the steel complex will be completed as planned by the steelmakers because construction of the industrial zone itself might cost more money and take longer than expected.
