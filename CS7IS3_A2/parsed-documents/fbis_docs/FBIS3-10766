In an interview with the Radio Caracol network, due to the insistence of the EL TIEMPO newspaper that such a meeting took place, the Cuban diplomat stated that they are being fooled by someone interested in destroying the excellent relations between the two countries. Those accusations were also denied by the Colombian Government and the minister of defense, as well as by several of the participants in a solidarity meeting held in Havana in January. The Communist Party of Colombia, as an organization that participated in the forum that was held in Havana, issued a statement saying that any attempt to distort the nature of the Latin American meeting was an effort to reaffirm the infamous U.S. blockade against Cuba. The note also stated that efforts are being made to block the sale of oil to Cuba, a transaction that was recently approved by the Colombian Government and condemned by recalcitrant minority groups of Cuban emigres in Miami.
