The exchange balance in March stood at $1.735 billion. Although this balance was 32 percent lower than February's when it totalled $2.528 billion, the government was forced to issue 289.8 million real cruzeiros in certificates to prevent the monetary base from increasing. Particularly because the demand for foreign exchange in March was also less than the February one. The high interest rate policy, which was adopted at the end of last year, has increased the federal domestic public debt balance from 7.7 percent of the GDP to 8.8 percent in March. In nominal terms, the domestic public debt balance in March was 49.75 percent higher than February's. In real terms, however, after deducting the March inflation rate, the increase totalled only 3.99 percent. From January to March, the federal domestic public debt increased 14.36 percent above the inflation rate. The international reserves increased $1.4 billion in February, increasing the balance to $30.5 billion.
