This was confirmed today by the German Foreign Ministry. It said the `Palestinian Information Office' will be upgraded to the rank of `Palestinian Delegation General' [General-Delegation], following the visit to Bonn by PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat in December 1993. 'Abdullah Franji, the long-term PLO spokesman and the new delegate general, will be entitled in the future to raise the Palestinian flag in front of his office headquarters in the Bonn government district, but will not enjoy diplomatic immunity nor other privileges which are reserved for regular embassies. The `Delegation General' and its staff will, however, be included in the `List of Diplomatic Missions and Other Representations' issued by the Foreign Ministry. For its part, the German Government intends to set up a German representation -- officially a German aid coordination office -- as Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel announced during 'Arafat's visit.
