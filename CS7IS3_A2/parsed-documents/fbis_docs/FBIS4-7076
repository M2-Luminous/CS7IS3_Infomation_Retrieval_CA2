Although the BAI is scheduled to check only the general accounts of the Secretariat and the office of security service, the general public is interested in how much President Kim Yong-sam's Chongwadae has spent over the past year. Presidential aides, reportedly paying close attention to their preparations, are well aware that Kim's Chongwadae will invariably be compared with that of former President No Tae-u, whose overspending was pointed out by the board. As soon as the BAI decided to audit Chongwadae, officials checked their own records on spending, contract papers and materials purchased, then classified them for the inspectors, sources said. "Led by President Kim himself, we have tightened our belts and maintained an austere office here," one of the aides said. "There would be almost nothing that could be cited as wasteful." "Actually, we have been worried that the BAI would skip its audit of Chongwadae," said another confident presidential aide. "This will be an opportunity for us to demonstrate that the Kim Chongwadae is different from all previous Chongwadaes," he added. In contrast to a Chongwadae brimming with confidence, BAI officials appear to be diffident over their upcoming task. Basically, there will be nothing they can fault Chongwadae for if the presidential office is as clean and austere as officials claim. "What would the general public think then, if we come up with nothing to show?" said one BAI official. In other words, they are worried that some might accuse them of having "overlooked problems." The BAI was said to have favored skipping Chongwadae this year since it was audited last year, but finally decided to go ahead for fear of criticism that the independent auditing agency recognizes "some sanctuaries," according to BAI insiders. The 10 BAI officials assigned the job of inspecting Chongwadae are already sifting through documents from the presidential office while still inspecting the Culture and Sports Ministry. This shows their determination to dig out something at Chongwadae, said one observer. Last year, the BAI revealed no less than 25 instances of unjustifiable expenditure, adding up to 645 million won in overspending in 1991-92 by No Tae-u's Chongwadae. Most of the money was spent on luncheons, dinners and presents.
