FR940216-1-00023 FR940216-1-00008 Subpart B_Impoundments and Removals The title of this subpart would be revised to read ``Administrative Impoundments and Removals.'' This change would clarify that the rules provide for administrative remedies that may be taken by the Forest Service to impound and remove animals or personal property on the National Forest System. Criminal law enforcement procedures associated with impoundments and property seizures made pursuant to arrests and searches are not covered by the regulations and are contained in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure for the United States District Courts and the Forest Service Law Enforcement Handbook (FSH 5309.11). No other revisions are proposed to this section. Section 262.12␣Impounding of Personal Property Paragraph (d) would be revised to allow the Forest Service to use un-redeemed or abandoned personal property if it is needed for official use, rather than having to offer it for sale. The authority for this proposed change is found in the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended (40 U.S.C. 484(m)) and at 41 CFR part 101&hyph;48. In many cases, the conversion of un-redeemed personal property to Government property can provide a substantial cost savings to the agency. Section 262.13␣Removal of Obstructions This section currently provides for the removal of vehicles or other objects which create either an ``impediment or hazard to the safety, convenience, or comfort of other users of the National Forest System.'' The rule would be revised to include a vehicle or other object ``which has been left in such a manner that it impairs or may result in the impairment of any area of the National Forest System or other areas under Forest Service control.'' The revision is needed in light of increasing problems associated with the abandonment of automobiles or other large objects left as junk in popular undeveloped recreation areas on the National Forest System. No other revisions are proposed to this section. Summary In summary, the Forest Service proposes to amend its rules governing Prohibitions and Law Enforcement Support Activities in order to: _Improve protection of public and their property, National Forest System lands, waters, and other resources, and agency employees; _Update the rules to reflect expanded Forest Service law enforcement authority granted by statutory change; _Make technical corrections and revisions due to the passage of new laws and the promulgation of new rules in other parts of this chapter; and _Provide both the agency and United States Department of Justice increased flexibility in prosecution options for certain offenses. Interested persons are invited to submit comments and recommendations regarding these proposed regulations. All comments received will be considered in promulgation of the final rule. Respondents should note that substantive comments are more helpful than form letters or responses from questionnaires. Regulatory Impact This proposed rule has been reviewed under USDA procedures and Executive Order 12866 on Regulatory Planning and Review. It has been determined that this is not a significant rule. This rule will not have an annual effect of $100 million or more on the economy nor adversely affect productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, nor State or local governments. This rule will not interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency nor raise new legal or policy issues. Finally, this action will not alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, loan programs, or the rights and obligations of recipients of such programs. Accordingly, this proposed rule is not subject to OMB review under Executive Order 12866. Moreover, this proposed rule has been considered in light of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), and has been determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities as defined by that Act. Executive Order 12630 for the Evaluation of Risk and Avoidance of Unanticipated Takings directs all agencies to evaluate whether certain proposed agency actions present a risk of effecting a taking of private property. Section 2(a)(3) of the Order exempts law enforcement actions from the requirements of the Executive Order. Since this proposed action involves additions, and technical and administrative changes, to prohibitions of activities on or affecting National Forest System land and resources, visitors, and employees, section 2(a)(3) applies and further analysis under the Executive Order is unnecessary.
