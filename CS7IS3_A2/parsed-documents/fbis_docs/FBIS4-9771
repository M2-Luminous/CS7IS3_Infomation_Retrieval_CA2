The unusual decision to suspend the parade was announced Thursday by Pedro Ross Leal, secretary general of the Central Organization of the Cuban Workers Federation (CTC), who instead called for additional work shifts in order to ensure the success of the sugar harvest, the country's main industry. The summons to an extraordinary ANPP session was suggested this week by Castro in a speech during the closing ceremony of a plenary meeting of the CTC National Committee. The colorful 1 May parade, to which Cuba would usually invite other countries' leftist political party leaders, was used by the government as a virtual plebiscite of workers support for the Cuban revolution. During a meeting with CTC leaders, Castro pointed out on that date [1 May], "there would be no better homage to workers" than the discussion by the ANPP deputies of the proposals by the "workers parliament" to clean-up the country's finances. Included among the measures to be discussed during the assembly are those dealing with a tax system, a moratorium on subsidies to the consumption of goods and services, the closing down of inefficient companies, price increases, as well as cutting the state payroll.
