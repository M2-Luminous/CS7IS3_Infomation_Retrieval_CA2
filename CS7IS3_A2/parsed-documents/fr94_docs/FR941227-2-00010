ACTION: Issuance of Modification 4 to Scientific Research Permit 818 (P211C). On October 26, 1994, notice was published (59 FR 53780) that an application had been filed by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) for a modification to their scientific research Permit 818. Under Permit 818, ODFW is allowed to take endangered Snake River spring/summer chinook salmon ( Oncorhynchus tshawytscha ) for scientific research purposes as authorized by the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA) (16 U.S.C. 1531-1543) and the NMFS regulations governing listed fish and wildlife permits (50 CFR parts 217-222). ODFW requested an increase in the take of this species for the period 1994&hyph;95 only and an expansion of their research sampling area to include Catherine Creek in the Grande Ronde River Basin for the duration of the permit. Notice is hereby given that on December 15, 1994, as authorized by the provisions of the ESA, NMFS issued Modification 4 to Permit 818 for the above taking, subject to certain conditions set forth therein. In Modification 4 to Permit 818, NMFS included precautions that ODFW are required to implement to prevent accidental listed fish mortalities. Issuance of this modification, as required by the ESA, was based on a finding that such modification: (1) Was applied for in good faith; (2) will not operate to the disadvantage of the listed species which is the subject of the permit; and (3) is consistent with the purposes and policies set forth in section 2 of the ESA. This modification was also issued in accordance with and is subject to parts 217-222 of Title 50 CFR, the NMFS regulations governing listed species permits. The application, permit, and supporting documentation are available for review by interested persons in the following offices, by appointment: Office of Protected Resources, NMFS, NOAA, 1315 East-West Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910&hyph;3226 (301&hyph;713&hyph;1401); and Environmental and Technical Services Division, NMFS, NOAA, 525 North East Oregon St., Suite 500, Portland, OR 97232 (503-230-5400). Dated: December 20, 1994. William W. Fox, Jr., Director, Office of Protected Resources, National Marine Fisheries Service.
