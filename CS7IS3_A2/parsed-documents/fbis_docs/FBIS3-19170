Fires erupted on both ships as a result of the collision. The fire on the freighter is under control, but the fire on the tanker loaded with fuel continues. Two persons were killed in the accident, 29 were wounded, and 23 crew members from both ships are missing. Our correspondents have learned that the Greek Cypriot tanker (Nafia), which was entering the strait from the Black Sea, collided with (Sharprock), a freighter sailing toward the Black Sea, at around 2230 last night. Fires erupted on both ships as a result of the collision. The freighter, in flames, ran aground at Anadolu Kavagi. The fire was gotten under control early this morning. The tanker, also in flames, sailed on out of control for a while. The tanker had loaded 50,567 tonnes of fuel in Russia and was on its way to Italy. It hit rocks in the Cakar region near Rumeli Kavagi and ran aground. The tanker is 250 meters long and weighs 66,820 tonnes. The fire continues to rage and explosions are occurring. Fire fighters from the Port Authority and from the Istanbul Fire Brigade are at work. Two fire-extinguishing ships have sailed from an Izmit refinery to help with the efforts to put out the fire. State Minister Yildirim Aktuna, Istanbul Governor Hayri Kozakcioglu, and Istanbul Mayor Nurettin Sozen went to the site of the incident. Kozakcioglu said that the fire does not pose a threat to the residents in the area. He noted, however, that the fire will continue for some time. The governor said that there were 30 crew members aboard the (Nafia). Of them, 23 were wounded, one was killed, and six are missing. There were 24 crew members on the freighter, of whom one was killed, six were wounded, and 17 are missing. The governor said that there are reports of bodies on the freighter, but they have not been reached yet. State Minister Aktuna said that efforts are being made to ensure that the tanker remains where it is. ANATOLIA reports that Aktuna said that the (Nafia) has 10 oil tanks and that three of them are empty and three are burning. We are cooling the four other tanks, he said, to prevent them from burning, too. He explained that measures have been taken to prevent the burning tanker from being dragged toward the Bosphorus by the wind. He stressed that residents in the area need not worry and that every necessary measure has been taken. Minister of Environmental Affairs Riza Akcali said that the incident proves once again how Turkey is right when it says that transporting fuel through the straits has risks and might be very dangerous for Turkey. In a statement to Turkish Radio and Television, Akcali stressed that the international agreement on the traffic through the straits must be reassessed in accordance with present conditions. Akcali went to Istanbul to check the site of the incident. State Minister Ibrahim Tez said that after the accident, the relevant crisis centers have been activated and that the Istanbul Strait has been closed to maritime traffic. He pointed out that barriers have been sent to the area to prevent the spread of oil leaking from the tanker. He noted that there were no traffic guides on either of the ships. He also said that even though there is no danger of a big explosion on the tanker, the ships at the Kavak Pilot Station, in Altinkum, and in Buyukdere Bay have been evacuated as a precaution. [Nicosia Bayrak Radio in Turkish at 0600 GMT on 14 March reports that the freighter (Sharprock) is Greek and that at least eight persons are dead, 18 are missing, and 23 are injured.]
