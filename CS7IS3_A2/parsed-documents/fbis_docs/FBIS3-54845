The congress' headquarters told Interfax that the Chechen clans had put off their congress for a second time "to avoid bloodshed" after commander of the Shali tank regiment Saifutdin Isayev agreed to fulfil the president's order to open fire at the delegates and their supporters if the congress took place. Earlier, Isayev had supported the idea of organizing such a congress and promised to block the city in order to prevent the president's armed supporters from penetrating into it. "We have put off the congress because we cannot leave the delegates and local population unprotected," said member of the clans' Council Mansur Tagirov. "No one expected Isayev to change his mind so radically," he added. The Council's headquarters announced that the delegates would be informed of the date and place of the congress a few hours before its opening to prevent the Chechen leaders from sending troops to the place before the congress took the decision on organizing parliamentary elections next April.
