He told INTERFAX on Monday that, as a result, 21 more seats were filled of the future legislature's total of 47, in addition to seven obtained during the first round. This still fails to reach the minimum of 32 necessary to make the new parliament's decisions valid. With its former parliament dissolved, Chuvashia will for an indefinite time have no legislature, the spokesman said. Legislative authority will temporarily be vested in the presidium of the previous parliament, headed by the latter's speaker, Eduard Kuborev.
