However, in developing this strategy, which benefits the country, the respect for the state of law has not been strictly observed. Subcommander Marcos himself addressed the issue in an exclusive interview by Francisco Rubio, special correspondent for Television Azteca, just before leaving for the mountains to meet with the Indian communities. He addressed the paradox regarding the legality of the illegality of the negotiation process, the authority of those who discussed the issues, and the legal validity of the resulting agreements. [Marcos] "It is a paradox. Two people who do not exist are talking. On the one side there is a commissioner who does not legally exist. On the other, there is a Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN] that does not legally exist either. Furthermore, there is an intermediary who does not legally exist either. This, legally speaking, is all science fiction." [Constitutional law expert Ignacio Burgos] "The so-called Marcos is an unknown individual. He is an enigma. No one knows who he is. He says he represents the indigenous peoples of Chiapas State, but that representation remains unproven. On the other hand we have Camacho Solis who appointed himself the commissioner for peace. He has not been invested with any sort of authority because he does not represent the Mexican president, the state, or the government." Other specialists and experts, without contradicting the law, express the opposite. [Raul Carranca y Rivas, of the National Autonomous University of Mexico Law School] "The government, Subcommander Marcos, and Marcos' followers accepted this ideological confrontation, where talks are the main element. Given these circumstances, the process gains its legal status. What I mean is that two parties meet by mutual accord to resolve ideological conflicts, to reach conclusions, and to find agreements. This is an agreement in itself, which we could call legal." However, what can be said about the validity and binding nature of the agreements? [Marcos] "The agreements we can reach here are quite fragile no matter from what angle one looks at them. The person signing for one party does not have the authority necessary; not one single group has authorized him to do so. The person signing for the other party is nothing more than a ski mask with a pseudonym." [Carranca y Rivas] "As long as Mr. Camacho has the blessing of the president and Marcos has the blessing of his people, they automatically become legal agreeing parties." According to Commissioner Camacho, federal and state government officials will sign the agreements in San Cristobal. Riding on that fact is the validity and the binding authority the agreements will enjoy.
