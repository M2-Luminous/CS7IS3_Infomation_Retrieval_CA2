The criminal action recalled the Dayr Yasin and Kafr Qasim incidents. They massacred dozens of Palestinians who prayed in a mosque. The incident caused clashes between the Palestinians and the Zionists throughout the occupied territories. The massacre of Palestinians praying in a mosque in Hebron last week caused a wave of mourning in the Islamic world and infuriated the international community. Some 70 Palestinians were killed and dozens of others were wounded. In an effort to prove that Israel's military forces were not linked with the incident, the Zionist regime described the assailant as mad. But the indications are that the Israeli military forces had a part in realizing the tragic incident. The Hebron incident has exposed the true nature of the Zionist regime and the international community has witnessed that the innocent Palestinian people have again become the victim of a criminal Zionist action. [passage omitted] The multisided U.S. support for the occupying Zionist regime is an important factor contributing to the inhuman Zionist activities. The U.S. move to obstruct and veto the UN Security Council resolutions against Israel is an indication of the support that that country gives to Israel. Consequently, the two-faced policy maintained by the UN Security Council has created important opportunities for the Zionist regime and allowed it to commit crimes against the Palestinian people. An example is the stance the United States adopted after Hebron. The U.S. approach prevented the UN Security Council from adopting a resolution on the incident. Considering that, the international community must express its indignation over the issue. The Hebron incident has shown that the sacred Palestinian uprising must be strengthened. It has also revealed that the Palestinians can safeguard their right to live on their own homeland only through an armed struggle.
