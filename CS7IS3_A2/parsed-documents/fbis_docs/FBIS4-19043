Despite setbacks, the United Nations was becoming "the central guardian of peace for the human race," Kinkel said at the annual conference of the German Society for Defense Technology in Bonn today. Germany should not stand to one side in this, and has to "come down from the spectators gallery." The foreign minister added that the greater responsibility that Germany will be taking on also makes necessary a "corresponding voice" as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
