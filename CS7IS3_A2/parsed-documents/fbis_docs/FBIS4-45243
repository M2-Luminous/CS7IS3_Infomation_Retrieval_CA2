Five Dutchmen and one Spaniard were aboard the rig support vessel, Britannia Gazelle, which was carrying the drug in 857 bales in the North Sea, it was alleged. The six seamen pleaded not guilty to charges relating to drug-running brought under the Criminal Justice (International Co-operation) Act, 1990. Michael Harrison, QC, prosecuting, said the Britannia Gazelle, a former trawler which had been de-registered in Britain, had left Lowestoft, Suffolk, in November 1992, and rendezvoused in the Atlantic with a trawler believed to be from Spain. In mid-ocean the cannabis was transferred to the Britannia Gazelle, which then returned to the British Isles around the Scottish coast before steaming towards Norway and eventually to a position 130 miles east of Newcastle, where it was boarded by customs after being secured by armed forces. Jan Wagenaar, aged 48, Laurens Frans Dirk Pels-Rycken, 29, Cornelis Van Delft, 45, Hans Pronk, 48, Jan Peters, 46, and Rojeirio Santiago-Maya, 48, deny conspiring together with other persons unknown fraudulently to evade prohibition of the importation of cannabis resin. All six further deny being knowingly concerned in carrying a controlled drug on a ship. The trial continues.
