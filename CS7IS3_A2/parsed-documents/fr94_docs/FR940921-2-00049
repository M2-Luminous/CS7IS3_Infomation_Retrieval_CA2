Introduction The DOI, as lead Federal Agency on behalf of the EVOS Trustee Council, has prepared a Final EIS on a proposal to construct infrastructure improvements to the IMS in Seward, Alaska. The EVOS Trustee Council is considering providing funding for a portion of this project. The Council is comprised of the designees of the Administrator, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; the Secretary of Agriculture; the Secretary of Interior; and the Commissioner of the Alaska Department of Fish and Game; the Commissioner of the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation; and the Alaska Attorney General. The EVOS Trustee Council is responsible for decisions relating to the assessment of injuries, uses of the joint restoration funds, and all restoration activities relating to the proposed project. In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, the Final EIS presents analyses of the environmental_including social and economic_effects that would be anticipated if the proposed improvements to the IMS in Seward were to occur as presently envisioned. In addition, the EIS assesses the effects of an alternative to the proposal that would eliminate the public education and visitation component, and construct only a research and wildlife rehabilitation component. Lastly, a no action alternative is assessed to determine the effects on the environment should the proposed improvements not be made. B. The Proposed IMS Infrastructure Improvement Project The EVOS Trustee Council is proposing to improve the existing infrastructure at the University of Alaska-Fairbanks IMS in Seward, Alaska, to enhance the EVOS Trustee Council's capabilities to study marine mammals, marine birds, and the ecosystem injured by the Exxon Valdez oil spill. The improvements are intended to help focus and carry out a long-term research and monitoring program for the EVOS area as part of an overall restoration plan. The project would be constructed adjacent to the existing campus of the IMS Seward Marine Center, and would have two components: (1) a research and wildlife rehabilitation component and (2) a public education and visitation component. The research and wildlife rehabilitation component would consist of approximately 22,000 square feet of interior space comprised of wet and dry laboratories, staff offices, and a library for studies and rehabilitation of marine mammals, marine birds, and other wildlife. There also would be approximately 46,000 square feet of exterior space containing outdoor research habitat, tanks, and pools for pinnipeds, sea otters, and marine bird species. A 50-space, 37,000 square foot, parking lot for staff vehicles would be constructed adjacent to the existing IMS Rae Building parking lot. A research vessel and submersible may be acquired for research purposes. The public education and visitation component would include approximately 20,000 square feet of additional interior space to promote public awareness of the marine environment. It would function in concert with, and in support of, the research and wildlife rehabilitation component. This component would include exhibits, interpretive displays, and public areas. A 166-space, 90,000 square foot, parking lot for visitors would be built adjacent to the education and visitor component. No joint EVOS restoration funds would be involved in the construction or maintenance of the public education and visitation component. The two components would share approximately 27,000 square feet of interior building-support space, including the life support system and the facility's mechanical, administrative, and curatorial functions. Funding for the proposed project would come, in large part, from EVOS funds. Overall, the total project capital budget is anticipated to be approximately $47.5 million, of which approximately $37.5 million would come from EVOS funds. Twelve and one-half million dollars of State EVOS restitution funds were appropriated by the Alaska Legislature in 1993 to the City of Seward for the planning, design, and construction of the proposed project. In addition, approximately $25 million of EVOS monies have been requested to fund the research and wildlife rehabilitation component of the proposed project. Lastly, it is anticipated that approximately $10 million would be raised privately to fund the public education and visitation component of the proposed project. Revenue from public education and visitation would be used to help offset the operational costs of all of the proposed improvements. C. The NEPA Process On March 9, 1994, the DOI, as lead Federal Agency on behalf of the EVOS Trustee Council, published a Notice of Intent to prepare an EIS on the Proposed IMS Infrastructure Improvement Project (59 FR 11082&hyph;1183). Scoping commenced on that date. Scoping meetings were held in Seward and Anchorage, Alaska, on March 22 and 24, 1994, respectively. Public notices announcing these meetings and requesting comments were published in EVOS-area newspapers; and a scoping newsletter was distributed widely throughout the EVOS area and beyond. In addition to comments and suggestions received at the scoping meetings, over 300 written responses were received. These comments were evaluated by the DOI and form the basis for the topics, issues, and alternatives addressed in the EIS. A 45-day public comment period on the Draft EIS followed the June 24, 1994, publication of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Notice of Availability in the Federal Register (59 FR 32697). The public comment period ended on August 8, 1994. Public hearings on the Draft EIS were held in Seward and Anchorage, Alaska, respectively, on July 26 and 28, 1994. A total of four individuals presented testimony at these hearings. A total of 31 comment letters were received on the Draft EIS_eight from Federal Agencies, four from state agencies, one from the City of Seward, three from groups or organizations, and 15 from individuals. Most of the comments on the Draft EIS addressed concerns regarding: (1) traffic and transportation, (2) quality of life in and near Seward, (3) recreation resources, (4) archaeological and historic resources, (5) the possible Alaska Marine Highway ferry relocation, and (6) the feasibility of the proposed project. Comments regarding project propriety have been referred to the EVOS Trustee Council for its consideration. Although the use of EVOS settlement funds is a significant issue to be addressed with public input, it is not an environmental issue and, thus, is not analyzed in the EIS. All written and oral comments on the Draft EIS were reviewed, and responses were prepared for 231 comments. The Final EIS reflects revisions made as a result of public comments received. The effect levels predicted in the Draft EIS did not change for the Final EIS. A Record of Decision will be issued no earlier than 30 days after EPA's Notice of Availability for the Final EIS appears in the Federal Register . Dated: September 16, 1994. George T. Frampton, Jr., Assistant Secretary for Fish and Wildlife and Parks, Department of the Interior. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;23367 Filed 9&hyph;20&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4310&hyph;MR-P
