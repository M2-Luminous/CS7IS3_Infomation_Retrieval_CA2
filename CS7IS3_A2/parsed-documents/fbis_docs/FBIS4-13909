You said the Paris talks have progressed. Are you still in the same optimistic mood? [Quray'] Despite the crisis that arose during this round, I cannot but be optimistic as I fulfill such a difficult and arduous role in the negotiations. The moment I cease to be optimistic, I must withdraw from the talks. By their nature, negotiations -- in particular, the economic talks -- are difficult and arduous. We are dealing with an adversary bent on remaining in a dominant position. Then you have the Palestinian side striving to get results. The question of optimism or pessimism, for me, does not arise. In this round in particular, progress was made in the area of tourism, where agreement was reached on a paper. There is not much of a problem there for us. The tough problem that remains is the question of imports and trade and their economic implications. This, despite our having agreed on a principle, which I consider to be important and a gain; namely, the need for there to be an importation policy and a customs tariff policy regulating a number of key goods central to development and everyday life of the Palestinian people in the occupied territories, in terms of pricing, tariffs, import licenses for commercial exchange with Arab and other states. We could not agree on what these goods will be. We hope the Israelis will rethink their position when we meet next week. Another contentious issue was the bank notes. The talks bogged down over the Palestinian currency and the Israeli shekel -- whether the latter would be legal tender or a currency. We insist on it being a currency. These were the sticking points. [Correspondent] This round also addressed Palestinian manpower. How much progress was made there? [Quray'] We raised the issue from the angle of the hardships our workers are suffering due to the closure that has barred the Palestinian workers from Israel. That applies as much to the laborers who work in the occupied territories as it does to those who commute to Israel. We underscored the dangerous implications of these measures for the entire peace process. They said there will be flexibility on this matter, noting that some 5,000 Palestinian workers have been allowed back to their jobs and that $10 million worth of funds have been set aside to alleviate unemployment in Gaza and the West Bank. But that will not solve the problem. The Palestinian workers must be engaged in steady employment and job opportunities must be created for them in the context of the national Palestinian economy. To create jobs in the context of a national Palestinian national economy is an ambitious and difficult task that will not materialize by wishing it. It takes preparations and the building of an infrastructure. [Correspondent] Many Palestinians and some Palestinian factions fear that Israel will dominate the Palestinian economy after the establishment of self-rule. What do you have to say about that fear? [Quray'] Let me say that such a fear is legitimate but does not have to be our fate at all, and that Israel may desire such a dominance but Israel's desires also do not have to be our fate. Therefore, I can say that these economic talks are the most important of all the Palestinian-Israeli talks because they lay the groundwork for the work of our institutions during the transitional stage. Can these institutions achieve a total Palestinian economic independence through the Palestinian rights they will regain? This is the question. Therefore, I can reassure those who voice their concern, which is legitimate, as I have said, that our negotiating strategy, if realized, will pave the way for economic independence. Let me give an example: It is known that during its early days, the occupation completely paralyzed the economic movement by closing banks, which constitute the lifeline of the Palestinian economy. All these banks were replaced by Israeli banks. All Palestinian, Arab, Jordanian, or foreign banks were closed. This took place in the early days of the 1967 occupation, and Israeli institutions replaced them. This is the situation. Therefore, the Palestinian negotiator should achieve his strategy by taking a first step toward regaining the right to license, monitor, and run the banks in accordance with Palestinian economic plan and structure. I can assert and proudly say that we have regained our right to build a Palestinian monetary and financial institution, which has the right to license, monitor, and run the banks and issue instructions and legislations regarding banking activity in the occupied Palestinian territories. This issue is not an easy one. The second issue, frankly speaking, is part of our policy and our strategy. It is aimed at penetrating the customs wall that has been built around the occupied territories since the early days of the occupation, represented by the customs policy, exports, and trade exchange policy. I also can say that we will not regain our full rights. However, we have penetrated that customs wall by securing the Palestinian right to import from Arab countries. It is we who should define the customs tariff with the Arabs and it is we who should define the policies and the specifications, make assessments and analysis, and conduct all activity pertaining to imports from the Arabs. Thus, this is a penetration in the customs wall. The other issue is with the Arab and Islamic countries. Israel, as well as other countries, usually imports from countries maintaining relations with it. Therefore, the penetration took place when we clarified that the occupied territories are a Palestinian identity and entity and not part of Israel. So, it is we who define the policy of the disengagement process. What is important in our strategy is that through these negotiations, we should achieve disengagement with the Israeli economy, which dominates the Palestinian economy. How can we penetrate the customs, gradually achieve disengagement, and build new rules for relations based on cooperation. There is a very important point, which can only be understood by the Palestinian farmer; namely, the principle of reciprocity in agricultural exports. It has been previously known that the Palestinian market was dominated by the Israeli agricultural products, while the Palestinians were not allowed to export any of their vegetables or fruits to the Israeli market. The new agricultural agreement stipulates the Palestinian right to export to the Israeli market. Thousands of tonnes of vegetables and fruits are destroyed every year because they cannot be marketed. The same also applies to industry. We also have the right to reciprocity and to license the industry that serves and promotes our economy. [Correspondent] Will there be direct economic ties between the Palestinian entity and the outside, meaning Arab countries such as Jordan and other countries, without passing through Israel, given that the balance of economic and political power is in Israel's favor? Does the Palestinian economy enjoy freedom and guarantees? [Quray'] Yes. Very lengthy negotiations were held over this issue. The Israelis' logic was that the occupied territories are still within the framework of the transitional period. That is, these occupied territories are not a state and, hence, they should be under Israeli control. We categorically rejected this logic. In the end, we reached the conclusion that since our relations with the Arabs represent our strategic depth, then we should be allowed to define our relations with the Arabs and build economic relations with Arab countries in all fields according to our own will. This is the conclusion we reached. That is not all. The Israelis refused that we establish relations even with Islamic countries. We also reached agreement on this. Hence, we have the right to establish economic relations with whomever we want. However, I must be clear. There will still be some limitations on everything we want. Phased negotiations and a good and efficient institution will eventually lead to the restoration of all our rights. [Correspondent] Thank you Abu-'Ala' [Quray'].
