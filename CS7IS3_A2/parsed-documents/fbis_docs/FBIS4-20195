In 1993 domestic exports to Japan, China, Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore rose by 10.5 percent to 18.7 billion schillings (4 percent of overall exports). These were set off by a volume of imports that had increased by 4.1 percent to 46 billion schillings (8.2 percent of overall imports). Trade with China increased sharply. According to trade delegate Ernst Laschan, exports were expanded by 41 percent to 3.7 billion schillings; imports rose by 30 percent to 7.8 billion schillings. The most important export goods were machines "made in Austria." This provided about 69 percent of export revenues. However, the future lies not so much in direct exports but in joint ventures, Laschan said. At the moment there are fewer than 10 of these joint ventures; by the end of the year another five are to be added, however. In 1993 Austria registered a record growth of exports to Korea: They rose by 50 percent to 2.2 billion schillings. Trade delegate Gerhard Meschke sees "excellent export prospects also for the future." Korea is in the process of developing from a low-wage country to a highly technicized industrial state. This increasingly gives rise to a demand for high-technology solutions to problems. The second most important overseas market after the United States was and is Japan. However, because of the current weakness of its economy and the resulting weak demand, in 1993 exports to Japan declined by 4.3 percent to 7.2 billion schillings. "Still, Austrian exporters have mastered the crisis of the Japanese economy better than expected," Wolfgang Kueng, trade delegate in Japan, stresses. In 1994 exports to Japan are expected to rise again. The strong yen will force Japanese industry to buy more products abroad, which will primarily benefit domestic subcontractors for the automobile industry. [passage omitted]
