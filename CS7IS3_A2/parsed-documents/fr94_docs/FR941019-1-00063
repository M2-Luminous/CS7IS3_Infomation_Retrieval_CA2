FR941019-1-00063 FR941019-1-00009 If trustee officials decide during the Preassessment Phase that the criteria for continuing an assessment have been met, they then enter the Assessment Plan Phase. The Assessment Plan Phase includes various notification and coordination activities. The Department's regulations provide guidance on coordination among trustee officials, including selection of a ``lead authorized official'' to act as an administrative point of contact. Trustee officials are also required to notify the PRPs of their intent to perform an assessment. During the Assessment Plan Phase, trustee officials also prepare a written Assessment Plan describing the procedures, type A, type B, or both, that will be used to determine injury and damages. The Assessment Plan is designed to focus and organize the assessment, which helps ensure that only reasonable assessment costs are incurred. The Assessment Plan is subject to public review and comment. For more information on the Assessment Plan Phase, see subpart C of 43 CFR part 11, as amended by 59 FR 14281&hyph;83. C. Assessment Phase During the Assessment Phase, the work described in the Assessment Plan is conducted. The work consists of three steps: Injury Determination; Quantification; and Damage Determination. In Injury Determination, trustee officials determine whether any natural resources have been injured and whether there is a pathway of exposure between the site of the discharge or release and the injured resources. If trustee officials determine that resources have been injured and that a pathway of exposure exists, they proceed to the Quantification step. During Quantification, trustee officials quantify the extent of the resource injuries by measuring the reduction from baseline conditions. ``Baseline'' conditions are the conditions that would have existed had the discharge or release not occurred. Resources perform functions for humans and for other resources, such as provision of a food source, flood control, or provision of recreational opportunities. These functions are known as ``services.'' Reductions from baseline conditions can be measured by evaluating the change in the level of services provided by the injured resources. Finally, in Damage Determination, trustee officials calculate the monetary compensation to be sought as damages for the quantified natural resource injuries. The basic measure of damages is the cost of restoring, rehabilitating, replacing, and/or acquiring the equivalent of the injured resources. The Department's regulations also allow for an additional component of damages. Trustee officials have the discretion to assess damages for the economic value of the services lost by the public from the date of the discharge or release until completion of restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources. This value is known as ``compensable value.'' When a type A procedure is utilized, trustee officials perform Injury Determination, Quantification, and Damage Determination through the use of a standardized procedure involving minimal field work. The Department is developing different type A procedures for different environments in stages. Only one type A procedure has been included in the regulations to date. That type A procedure incorporates a computer model to perform Injury Determination, Quantification, and Damage Determination for minor discharges or releases in coastal or marine environments. The computer model is known as the Natural Resource Damage Assessment Model for Coastal and Marine Environments (NRDAM/CME). For more information on use of a type A procedure during the Assessment Phase, see subpart D of 43 CFR part 11. There are two ongoing rulemakings concerning type A procedures. The Department is revising the NRDAM/CME in compliance with a court order and the statutory biennial review requirement. The Department is also developing a new type A computer model for use in Great Lakes environments. Therefore, the Department does not intend to address the content of the type A procedures during this review. When a type A procedure is not applicable, trustee officials use type B procedures instead of a type A procedure. In some cases, trustee officials may also use type B procedures to supplement damages calculated through use of an applicable type A procedure. When type B procedures are utilized, trustee officials perform Injury Determination, Quantification, and Damage Determination through the use of site-specific studies. The Department's regulations divide natural resources into five categories: surface water, ground water, air, geologic, and biological resources. Specific definitions of injury are provided for each of these categories. The regulations provide guidance on the selection of testing and sampling methodologies to determine whether an injury has occurred and whether a pathway of exposure exists. The regulations also provide guidance on measuring the change in baseline conditions during Quantification. During the Damage Determination step of an assessment incorporating type B procedures, trustee officials identify and consider a reasonable number of possible alternatives for restoring, rehabilitating, replacing, and/or acquiring the equivalent of the injured resources. Trustee officials select one of the possible alternatives based on several factors. The trustee officials document their decisions in a Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan, which is part of the overall Assessment Plan and, thus, subject to public review and comment. Once trustee officials have selected a restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition alternative, they select one or more of the type B cost-estimating methodologies listed in the regulations. The selected methodologies are used to estimate the cost of implementing the restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition alternative. This estimated cost is the basic measure of damages. Trustee officials also have the discretion to include compensable value in their damage claim. Compensable value is calculated by applying one or more of the type B economic valuation methodologies listed in the regulations. For more information on use of type B procedures during the Assessment Phase, see subpart E of 43 CFR part 11, as amended by 59 FR 14283&hyph;87. D. Post-Assessment Phase The Department's regulations cover the entire process that trustee officials need to follow if they file a lawsuit and expect to obtain a rebuttable presumption. Trustee officials have the authority to settle their damage claims at any time during the administrative process. However, if the trustee officials do not settle with the PRPs by the end of the Assessment Phase, then trustee officials prepare a Report of Assessment detailing the results of the Assessment Phase. Trustee officials present the Report of Assessment to the PRPs along with a demand for damages and assessment costs. If a PRP does not agree to pay within 60 days, the trustee officials may file suit. Federal and State trustee officials receive a rebuttable presumption of correctness for assessments performed in accordance with the Preassessment Phase, Assessment Plan Phase, Assessment Phase, and Post-Assessment Phase procedures set forth in the regulations. Once damages have been awarded or settlement has been reached, trustee officials establish an account for the recovered damages and prepare a Restoration Plan for use of the funds. When type B procedures are used, the post-assessment Restoration Plan is based on the restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition alternative selected in the Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan during the Assessment Phase. For more information on the Post-Assessment Phase, see subpart F of 43 CFR part 11, as amended by 59 FR 14287. III. Related Rulemakings There are several ongoing natural resource damage assessment rulemakings other than this biennial review. State of Ohio v. United States Department of the Interior (Ohio v. Interior ) remanded portions of the administrative process and the type B procedures. 880 F.2d 432 (D.C. Cir. 1989). On March 25, 1994, the Department published a final rule that addressed all but one aspect of the remand. 59 FR 14261. The March 25, 1994, final rule did not address the assessment of lost nonuse values. There are two potential types of compensable values associated with natural resource injuries: Lost use values and lost nonuse values. Use values are derived through activities such as hiking or fishing. Nonuse values are not dependent on use of a resource and include the value of knowing that the resource exists and knowing that a resource will be available for future generations. The only method available for the express purpose of estimating lost nonuse values is the contingent valuation methodology (CV). On May 4, 1994, the Department published a notice of proposed rulemaking addressing CV as a type B procedure for estimating lost nonuse values. 59 FR 23097. The comment period on the notice closed on October 7, 1994. 59 FR 32175 (June 22, 1994). The Department does not intend to address the assessment of lost nonuse values during this review. State of Colorado v. United States Department of the Interior remanded the type A procedure for coastal and marine environments. 880 F.2d 481 (D.C. Cir. 1989). The Department intends to publish a proposed rule to revise the NRDAM/CME later this month. The Department has begun the development of an additional type A procedure for use in Great Lakes environments. This type A procedure uses a computer model known as the Natural Resource Damage Assessment Model for Great Lakes Environments (NRDAM/GLE). The Department published a proposed rule on August 8, 1994. 59 FR 40319. The Department does not intend to address the content of the type A procedures during this biennial review.
