No one has suggested they should not be promoted. Asked about his statement [broadcast] by CyBC [the Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation], Mikhailidhis said the proposals do not aim to substitute the confidence-building measures or represent a way out of the measures the philosophy of which the government has accepted. He said the proposals for disarmament will not be submitted at the negotiating table but will be promoted in international organizations, since the military situation is the main reason for the Cyprus issue remaining unresolved. Mikhailidhis noted that in May, the Greek Presidency [of the EC] is expected to submit the proposal for setting a date to begin negotiations for Cyprus' accession to the European Union. He said the proposal does not clash with the reexamination of Cyprus' accession to the Community in January 1995, since, according to the interpretation by the Cypriot Government, reexamination will concern the result of the accession talks, not the opening of the talks.
