FR941230-2-00034 FR941230-2-00026 [Docket No. 93N&hyph;0184] Barr Laboratories, Inc.; Withdrawal of Proposal To Refuse To Approve Certain Abbreviated Applications AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration, HHS. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is withdrawing a notice proposing to refuse to approve certain original and supplemental abbreviated new drug applications (ANDA's) and certain original and supplemental abbreviated antibiotic applications (AADA's) submitted by Barr Laboratories, Inc., 2 Quaker Rd., Pomona, NY 10970 (Barr). That notice also provided Barr with an opportunity for a hearing. The basis for this withdrawal is Barr's present compliance with current good manufacturing practice (CGMP), so that the methods Barr uses in, and the facilities and controls it uses for, the manufacturing, processing, and packing of its drug products are adequate to assure and preserve its products' identity, strength, quality, and purity. EFFECTIVE DATE: December 30, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Harry T. Schiller, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (HFD&hyph;366), Food and Drug Administration, 7500 Standish Place, Rockville, MD 20855, 301&hyph;594&hyph;2041. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In a notice published in the Federal Register of May 28, 1993 (58 FR 31035)), FDA proposed to refuse to approve certain original and supplemental ANDA's and AADA's submitted by Barr. The basis for the proposal was that the drug products that were the subjects of these original applications and supplements were not being manufactured in compliance with the CGMP regulations. A detailed description of the deficiencies and the basis for the agency's proposal can be found in the May 28, 1993, Federal Register notice. In a notice of opportunity for hearing (NOOH), the agency proposed to refuse approval of the following original ANDA's and AADA's: AADA 63&hyph;291, Minocycline Hydrochloride Capsules, 100 milligrams (mg); AADA 63&hyph;309, Minocycline Hydrochloride Tablets, 100 mg; AADA 63&hyph;319, Minocycline Hydrochloride Tablets, 50 mg; ANDA 72&hyph;916, Sulindac Tablets, 200 mg; ANDA 72&hyph;964, Sulindac Tablets, 150 mg; ANDA 74&hyph;049, Atenolol Tablets, 50 mg and 100 mg. In the notice, FDA also proposed to refuse to approve the following supplemental ANDA's and AADA's: AADA 62&hyph;418/S&hyph;014, Doxycycline Hyclate Capsules, 50 and 100 mg; AADA 62&hyph;773/S&hyph;005, Cephalexin Capsules, 250 mg; AADA 62&hyph;827/S&hyph;006, Cephalexin Tablets, 500 mg; ANDA 70&hyph;060/S&hyph;012, S&hyph;017, Methyldopa Tablets, 250 mg; ANDA 70&hyph;080/S&hyph;028, S&hyph;029, Ibuprofen Tablets, 600 mg; ANDA 70&hyph;103/S&hyph;018, S&hyph;019, Propranolol Hydrochloride Tablets, 40 mg; ANDA 70&hyph;319/S&hyph;018, S&hyph;019, Propranolol Hydrochloride Tablets, 10 mg; ANDA 70&hyph;320/S&hyph;018, Propranolol Hydrochloride Tablets, 20 mg; ANDA 70&hyph;472/S&hyph;004, Lorazepam Tablets, 0.5 mg; ANDA 70&hyph;474/S&hyph;004, S&hyph;010, Lorazepam Tablets, 2 mg; ANDA 70&hyph;765/S&hyph;010, S&hyph;011, S&hyph;012, S&hyph;013, Chlordiazepoxide and Amitriptyline Hydrochloride Tablets, 5 mg/12.5 mg; ANDA 71&hyph;212/S&hyph;003, S&hyph;009, Haloperidol Tablets, 5 mg; ANDA 71&hyph;251/S&hyph;005, Triamterene and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets, 75 mg/50 mg; ANDA 71&hyph;462/S&hyph;014, S&hyph;015 Ibuprofen Tablets, 200 mg; ANDA 80&hyph;701/S&hyph;079, Prednisone Tablets, 5 mg; ANDA 84&hyph;106, S&hyph;065, S&hyph;066, Hydralazine Hydrochloride Tablets, 25 mg; ANDA 84&hyph;600/S&hyph;039, Dicyclomine Hydrochloride Tablets, 20 mg; ANDA 88&hyph;488/S&hyph;013, Hydroxyzine Pamoate Capsules, 100 mg. Following the publication of the NOOH, the agency inspected Barr's Northvale, NJ, manufacturing facility from May 2, 1994, through June 10, 1994. FDA also inspected Barr's Pomona, NY, manufacturing facility from June 16 through July 18, 1994. Based on these inspections, the firm's responses to the FDA investigators' observations, and the resolution by consent decree of enforcement litigation concerning Barr's compliance with the CGMP regulations ( United States v. Barr Laboratories, Inc ., Civ. No. 92&hyph;2684 (S.D.N.Y.)), FDA has concluded that Barr is now complying with the CGMP regulations in manufacturing drug products. Accordingly, the May 28, 1993, Federal Register notice proposing to refuse to approve certain applications and supplements is withdrawn. The withdrawal of the Federal Register notice does not constitute approval of the original applications and supplements; the agency is continuing its review of those applications and supplements to ensure that they meet all statutory requirements for approval in addition to compliance with CGMP. This notice is issued under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (sec. 505 (21 U.S.C. 355)) and under the authority delegated to the Director of the Center of Drug Evaluation and Research (21 CFR 5.82). Dated: December 20, 1994. Janet Woodcock, Director, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. [FR Doc. 95&hyph;32138 Filed 12&hyph;29&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4160&hyph;01&hyph;F
