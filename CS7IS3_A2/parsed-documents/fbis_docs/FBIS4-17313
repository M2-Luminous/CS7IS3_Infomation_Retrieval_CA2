[Matukovskiy] Nikolay Ivanovich, how many people do you oversee? [Cherginets] One in every ten citizens of the Republic. [Matukovskiy] Are you exaggerating? [Cherginets] Rather minimizing, let us calculate.... The current strength of the Belarusian Armed Forces is 260,000, while the required strength should be 90,000 or even 60,000. Therefore, 170,000 servicemen should be transferred to the reserves. Next, multiply this figure by three (a husband, a wife, and a minimum of one child). The majority of them have no civilian professions, many of them have no housing, they will have to leave their garrisons. Where will they go? With what will they deal? Reaching age 45 is not the end of their lives; this is the most productive age. It is inhumane and unbecoming of our state. This is how I understand the reduction of the Armed Forces. I wish that those deputies who demand that the Armed Forces be instantaneously reduced, understood this situation. However, this is our tomorrow, let us speak about our today, which is no easier. Thousands of Belarusians, who are performing their military service in various CIS regions, would like to return to Belarus. Many of them came back, but we have to absorb 8,684 servicemen including 7,453 officers. As we put it, 40,000 servicemen "are subject to dislocation" and we have to bring back 1,000 servicemen from "hot spots...." At the same time, we have 9,000 servicemen -- retired or transferred to the reserves -- who lack proper housing; a third of them live in Minsk alone. Yes, they have some sort of roof over their heads, but can we call this housing if people are sleeping in bunk beds? Our Republic had 251,845 soldiers fight in World War II, and 74,990 out of them are disabled. With every passing day their ranks are reduced. In addition, there are tens of thousands of families who lost their husbands or sons. In a word, everywhere there are fresh war wounds.... [Matukovskiy] However, the most bleeding wound is Afghanistan. [Cherginets] Of course. This is our ever-lasting pain. Last year, 30 Afghan war veterans committed suicide, more than 100 were imprisoned. Many of them became drug addicts, alcoholics.... These people became outcasts. They are on the edge.... [passage omitted] [Matukovskiy] Nikolay Ivanovich, they usually say that some 30,000 foreign war veterans live in Belarus. Are we ashamed to call them Afghan war veterans? [Cherginets] No, we are not ashamed. The point is that our countrymen fought not only in Afghanistan, but also in Algeria, Angola, Vietnam, Egypt, Yemen, China, North Korea, Syria, Mozambique, Ethiopia -- all in all, in 14 states! One Belarusian even fought in the Seychelles! All in all, 30,577 Belarusians have fought on foreign soil. Fortunately, most of them survived.... [passage omitted]
