Speaking today at an expanded session of the collegium of the Ministry of Fuel and Energy Resources, the first deputy prime minister also said that "the problem of non-payments with which the Russian economy is afflicted has not yet been studied very well." He commented critically on the current pricing and tax policy. "It ought to unite and not separate the government and the producers," he said. Oleg Soskovets sees one of the principal goals of the present cabinet in "creating conditions that will enable producers and consumers to agree among themselves normally." The first deputy prime minister said that the credit and finance system needed adjustment, as did the banking system. He called upon specialists working in the fuel and energy complex to pursue "a policy of partnership with other industries." Otherwise we will be unable to form a civilized market, he said. In the opinion of Oleg Soskovets, active attempts were being made "to discredit the policy of reforms, especially after some members of the previous cabinet left the government." But "no one talks about skilled workers and managers leaving, though it is they who make the whole economy tick," he added.
