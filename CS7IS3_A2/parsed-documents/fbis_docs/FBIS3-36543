This is evidently why the State Duma deputies elected him to one of the key posts in their chamber -- that of chairman of the Committee for Legislation and Judicial and Legal Reform. [Isakov] Our small committee has been set extraordinarily great tasks. It has to prepare and make a preliminary examination of drafts of federal constitutional laws, federal laws in the spheres of human rights, the judicial system, civil, civil-procedural, criminal, criminal-procedural, and corrective labor law, and legislation on administrative offenses, and amnesty decrees. We are obliged to make a preliminary examination of proposals for a revision of the Russian Federation Constitution and for amendments to it and to organize parliamentary hearings on questions of implementing the Constitution and federal constitutional laws. We are required to prepare rulings on draft laws and also to monitor the execution of legislation. [Zvyagin] Are the committee's members sufficiently ready for responsible work, and does the difference in their political views and the fact that sometimes they are even opposed not embarrass you? [Isakov] Indeed, we all have very different political partialities. But then there is also something which unites literally all of us. We are jurists. Many have academic degrees and have had plenty of practice. I myself am a doctor of juridical sciences and a professor, and I was chairman of the former Supreme Soviet's Committee for Constitutional Legislation. I have devoted considerable effort to lawmaking. The same can be said of Boris Zolotukhin, my deputy. He used to tackle problems of judicial and legal reform on the former analogous committee. Zolotukhin represents "Russia's Choice." Another deputy of mine is Dr. of Juridical Sciences Viktor Vishnyakov (Liberal Democratic Party of Russia), leading associate at the Institute of Legislation and Comparative Jurisprudence. A third is Sergey Zenkin (Party of Russian Unity and Accord), a lecturer at Ivanovo State University. I believe that we will also be able to make successful use of the rich experience of Anatoliy Lukyanov and Professors Vladimir Tumanov and Viktor Sheynis. Incidentally, before being elected to the State Duma, the latter was, along with Boris Zolotukhin, a member of the Legislative Proposals Commission under the Russian Federation president. They have all done considerable work over almost the whole range of problems. As regards the diversity of political views, this diversity must be overcome by respect for the law. [Zvyagin] Has the committee already gotten involved in lawmaking activity? [Isakov] Of course. We have already prepared a Russian Federation draft law on the procedure for publishing and bringing into force federal constitutional laws, federal laws, and acts of the chambers of the Federal Assembly. This is one of the fundamental, top-priority documents. Our committee has also prepared another important document. It is the declaration on the legal succession of the Federal Assembly with regard to the Supreme Soviet and the Congress of Russian Federation People's Deputies. In particular, we hope for the return to parliament of the Institute of Legislation and Comparative Jurisprudence. [Zvyagin] What is your contribution to the entire State Duma's plan of law-drafting work? [Isakov] Since the members of our committee have more experience of lawmaking work than others, people heed our voice. We are now seeking to draw the paramount attention of all committees to the creation of federal constitutional and federal laws which stem from the Russian Federation Constitution and which ensure its operation. Among the drafts of normative acts, to draw attention to those aimed at more fully defending citizens' rights and freedoms, developing the social sphere, and strengthening state-legal foundations. Members of our committee will also take a very direct part in drawing up the majority of future legal normative documents. Above all, this means these laws: on the state flag; the state anthem; the referendum; on the Russian Federation Constitutional Assembly; on the government; on the judicial system; on the commissioner for human rights. More than other members of parliamentary formations, we will have to tackle the preparation of draft codes of legislation: civil, criminal, criminal-procedural, criminal-executive, air, land, tax, housing, and labor legislation, legislation on marriage and the family, on administrative offenses, and others. [Zvyagin] What other draft laws which need to be examined and adopted without delay could you name? [Isakov] On the procedure for ensuring the opportunity for citizens to familiarize themselves with documents and materials which directly affect their rights and freedoms; on public associations; on the procedure for holding rallies, demonstrations, processions, and pickets; on elections to the State Duma, on the procedure for forming the Federation Council of the Federal Assembly, on the main provisions for elections to organs of local self-management; on federal state service; on the application of citizens to state organs and organs of local self-management. I also deem it obligatory for us to participate in the work on them, for the Committee for Legislation and Judicial and Legal Reform is responsible for the quality of our entire new parliament's lawmaking.
