Replying to a question during his news conference today, Ataman recalled the confessions of PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] militants who were caught after they came to Turkey to carry out terrorist activities. The militants said that they arrived in Athens from Frankfurt on 20 February, underwent terrorist training in a camp in Greece, and then infiltrated into Turkey from Meric river in order to attack tourist, economic, and military targets in Turkey. Ataman pointed out that these confessions were videotaped. In the wake of this development, the spokesman said, Foreign Ministry Deputy Under Secretary Unal Unsal summoned the Greek ambassador to the ministry. Ataman went on: "Ambassador Unsal conveyed the information to the Greek ambassador, told him that it is understood that the PKK is being trained in Greece and is receiving material and moral support in that country. Unsal asked the ambassador for information in connection with this matter and stressed that this is a grave development." Ataman explained that after this meeting, Ambassador Unsal invited the U.S., French, British, and German ambassadors to the ministry and briefed them on this grave situation. The Foreign Ministry spokesman pointed out that the requested information has not yet arrived from Greece. He stressed that backing terrorist organizations against Turkey will not lead Greece anywhere. He said: "Those who sow wind today should never forget that they will reap a storm tomorrow."
