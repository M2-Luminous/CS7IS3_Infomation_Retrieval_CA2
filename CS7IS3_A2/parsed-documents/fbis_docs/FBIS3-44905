Clinton will first attend the NATO summit meeting in Brussels and will then visit Prague and meet with the leaders of the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, and Poland. From 12 to 15 January, he will visit Moscow and meet Russian President Yeltsin. Then he will visit Minsk and meet the leaders of Belarus. Finally, he will go to Geneva to meet Syrian President al-Asad. Europe was the focus of U.S. foreign policy for a long time. However, in the year since Clinton took office, he has mainly paid attention to domestic affairs. In the diplomatic field, in addition to attending the G-7 summit in Tokyo, meeting with Russian President Yeltsin in Canada, and attending an informal meeting with APEC leaders, Clinton has been busy coping with regional conflicts and has had no time to deal with European affairs. However, it is also a pressing matter to readjust the United States' relationship with Europe and with Russia in the new post-Cold War situation and thus maintain the United States' "leading position" in Europe and the whole world. This is the main purpose of Clinton's current visit to Europe. With the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, the precondition for a U.S.-European alliance against the Soviet Union did not continue to exist. The dissolution of the Warsaw Pact even brought about a deep split in the longstanding security ties between the United States and Europe. Disagreements over various European security issues, especially the function and scope of NATO, increased between the two sides. On the issues of settling the conflicts in Bosnia and Somalia, the United States could not effectively influence other countries. U.S.-European conflicts over economic interests also increased, and trade friction between the two sides caused the Uruguay Round of trade talks to stagnate for a long time. In addition, as the United States attached greater importance to the Asia-Pacific region and proposed the establishment of a "New Pacific Community," this caused much speculation about a shift in the focus of U.S. foreign policy. In such circumstances, Clinton's current trip to Europe is aimed at reiterating Europe's importance for the United States' global interests and emphasizing that the United States will continue to undertake its commitments to NATO and will continue to strengthen its cooperative relationship with Western Europe in the security field, thus maintaining the United States' domination of European affairs through NATO. The NATO summit meeting in Brussels will mainly discuss how to strengthen security cooperation with the former members of the Warsaw Pact. In consideration of their own security interests, some East European countries, which were formerly members of the Warsaw Pact, are eager to join NATO. Some NATO member countries also hold that the "security vacuum" brought about by the dissolution of the Soviet Union in Eastern Europe should be filled in good time and that the East European countries should be admitted to NATO. However, Russia is opposed to the admittance of the East European nations into NATO. In view of Russia's stance, the Clinton administration holds that hasty action could endanger NATO's own interests. In addition, the victory of the Liberal Democratic Party headed by Zhirinovsky in the recent Russian parliamentary election made the United States and Europe feel that the rise of nationalist sentiment in Russia could weaken the United States' influence in Russia and that the situation could become unfavorable to both the United States and Europe. Therefore, the United States put forth a new proposal on establishing a "partnership for peace" with the former members of the Warsaw Pact so that military and security cooperation between the West and the East European countries will be advanced in a steady, prudent, and gradual form and will not agitate Russia excessively. Public opinion here holds that Clinton will persuade his NATO allies and the East European leaders to accept this proposal during his visit. In the past year, Clinton gave great support to Yeltsin in weathering two major political crises inside Russia. It is expected that the meeting between the two leaders will be focused on how to help Yeltsin maintain the momentum of reform after the Russian parliamentary election and to win support from the public. At the same time, the two sides will also discuss the issue of controlling nuclear weapons and preventing nuclear proliferation. Middle East peace will continue to be a key point of U.S. foreign policy. When meeting with Syrian President al-Asad in Geneva, Clinton will urge him to quicken the pace of Syrian-Israeli talks and thus further advance the Middle East peace process on the basis of the historic peace agreement concluded last year. Public opinion holds that Clinton's visit to Europe at the beginning of his second year in office obviously shows that he intends to accomplish something in the diplomatic field in order to change the Democrat administration's domestic image of being "incompetent in foreign affairs."
