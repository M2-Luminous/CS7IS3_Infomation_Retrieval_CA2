Labor Minister Teodato Hunguana has said Africa Watch's accusations are an attempt to avoid pointing fingers at those responsible for the failure to implement the mine removal program. In a communique issued in Washington last weekend, Africa Watch blamed the Mozambican Government, Renamo, and the United Nations for the failure to remove mines that have already claimed some 10,000 lives.
