Xu Yongyue, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee, and Li Zhanshu, member of the standing committee of the provincial party committee and secretary general of the provincial party committee, attended the forums. Ending Deficits and Increasing Profits of Some Large and Medium- Sized State-Owned Enterprises Is One of the Emphases of the Current Deepening of Reform Cheng Weigao pointed out: At present, one of the important tasks facing the party committees and governments at all levels is to seize the opportunity, concentrate energy, and accelerate the progress of enterprise reform. Through deepening reform, we should strive to help some state-owned deficit-incurring enterprises or enterprises running at half capacity or brought to a standstill end deficits and increase profits and enable them to free themselves from a difficult position; through changing operational mechanism, we should make enterprises link with the track of the market economy and to enter the orbit of a well-rounded cycle. Solving the problems of money-losing enterprises, particularly the problems of the state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises running in the red, is the emphasis of the current deepening of reform. It has a bearing not only on guaranteeing and increasing the value of state-owned assets but also on stabilizing the basic contingents of the state. Invigorating state-owned enterprises is the key of the transition from the planned economy into the market economy. Enterprises have played a leading role in the play of the market economy. If enterprises fail to enter the market, this play cannot be staged. Therefore, regardless of speaking from the angle of reform or from the angle of development, reform of the state-owned enterprises is very important, and is the key and priority of the establishment of the market economic new structure. All localities across the province have actively explored ways to deepen enterprise reform and solve the issue of helping enterprises end deficits and increase profits. Handan city has proposed that the key to invigorating enterprises is to have "good plant directors, good products, and good mechanisms." Xingtai city has adopted the measures of "reforming, helping, readjusting, and stimulating" money-losing enterprises. These good methods should be upheld continuously. However, generally speaking, we have failed to grasp this work forcefully. It Is Necessary To Eliminate Three Ideological Obstacles While Deepening Enterprises Running in the Red Cheng Weigao said: Some of our leading cadres still have ideological obstacles of varying degrees in deepening reform of enterprises running in the red. First, some held that the increase in the enterprise deficit range is a general phenomenon. They never felt anxious, and they lacked a sense of urgency; second, regarding the problem of deficits, they usually found reasons of deficits objectively and seldom found reasons from enterprises themselves; third, they simply applied the measures for development to increasing input and starting new projects, and held that it has big risks and great difficulties if they rely on reform to invigorate the existing enterprises. Therefore, they failed to pay a high degree of attention to the issue of enterprise reform and to exert sufficient efforts to it. We must clearly understand that in maintaining the mainstay status of state-owned sector of the economy in the course of developing the socialist market economy, on the one hand, the state must increase input and carry out some good projects, and on the other hand, the value of state-owned assets must be guaranteed and must increase. Only thus, can we guarantee the unceasing expansion of the state-owned sector of the economy. The deficits of state- owned enterprises are the main reasons for the losses of state-owned assets. Successfully ending the deficits of state-owned enterprises and helping them increase profits is an important aspect of guaranteeing the state-owned assets to maintain and increase the value and to further develop the productive forces. Therefore, we must pay great attention to the reform of state-owned enterprises and helping them end deficits and increase profits. We Must Be Good at Seizing the Opportunity and Never Lose the Current Favorable Opportunity of the In-Depth Reform Cheng Weigao pointed out: It is true that the favorable conditions are the opportunities and difficulties and the problems are also opportunities. Grasping the difficulties and problems while conducting reform is also a way to seize the opportunity. At present, deficits of enterprises have increased. Although there are reasons of one sort or another, generally speaking, this has precisely exposed the contradictions of enterprises of incompatibility with the market economy and the fact that their ideological concepts, operational mechanism, operational strategy, and management policymaking are incompatible with the technological progress and enterprise management and with the impact caused by the unceasingly changeable market situation. This has also negatively showed that enterprises must carry out reform. These contradictions and difficulties have made the urgency and necessity of enterprise reform more striking. The pains brought by enterprise deficits have urged cadres and staff members to enhance their ability to withstand the strain of reform and provided a favorable ideological foundation for enterprise reform. So, we can say that enterprises may also have the opportunity of reform even when they meet with difficulties. We should seize the opportunity brought by difficulties and extricate ourselves from a difficult position by deepening reform, changing mechanisms, and overcoming difficulties. It Is Necessary To Conscientiously Conduct Investigation and Study and Formulate Plans for Deepening Reform, Changing Mechanism, Ending Deficits, and Increasing Profits Cheng Weigao pointed out: Leaders at all levels should go deep to the money-losing enterprises to clearly understand their degree of deficits and reasons for the deficits one by one, and then, formulate reform measures and methods for grasping the major contradictions and solving problems according to the merits of different cases. Some enterprises should reselect responsible persons and do a good job in selecting and employing trained personnel by introducing the competitive mechanisms; some enterprise deficits are caused by the problems of products and technological transformation which must be solved by adopting various methods, such as introducing technology and developing internal cooperation, updating and upgrading products, and transforming equipment and technology; some are caused by ineffective reform of the international management system which must be resolved by intensifying the degree of internal reforms and exerting efforts to grasp reform of the personnel, labor, and wage distribution systems in enterprises. Some enterprises whose fixed assets cannot pay off their debts and have no hope of ending deficits should be ordered to merge with other enterprises, lease out, or turn into state-owned but people-run enterprises if necessary. A small number of such enterprises should declare bankruptcy. In short, each and every money-losing enterprise should do a good job in formulating its own reform plan aimed at ending deficits and increasing profits. It is necessary to use two or three years to gradually revitalize money- losing enterprises. Accelerating Reform on the Selection and Management of Enterprise Cadres Is the Precondition for Deepening Enterprise Reform Cheng Weigao believed that to deepen enterprise reform, first of all, we must further deepen reform on the selection and management of enterprise cadres. It is necessary to adopt the mechanism which combines incentives with restraints, select the superior and eliminate the inferior through competition, enable a great batch of outstanding entrepreneurs to show up, and eliminate managers and plant directors who are incompetent to improve the backward enterprises. The key to successfully running an enterprise is to have a good manager or plant director. With a good manager and plant director, an enterprise may produce products and introduce technology and funds even though it does not have any. On the contrary, an enterprise cannot run well without a bright and competent plant director even though it has all given conditions. To implement reform of the personnel system, we must formulate reform methods according to the merits of different categories of enterprises. Enterprises implementing the corporate system should choose and employ cadres in line with the company law, and enterprises implementing the contract system should establish a strict mechanism that combines incentives with restraints and select managers and plant directors on this basis. To push Hebei's economy forward, the most important is to solve the issue on making proper use of personnel. Only by successfully building ranks of party and government cadres and enterpreneurs, can Hebei have hopes. If it simply makes no difference whether the enterpreneurs of a place work or loaf, whether they do a good or bad job, or whether they make achievements or not, this place will have no hope of running its enterprises well. It Is Necessary To Emancipate the Mind and Find a Way To Extricate Ourselves From a Difficult Position Through Various Methods, Such as Reform and Opening Up Cheng Weigao stressed: Difficulties are many, but methods will usually outnumber difficulties. As long as money-losing enterprises emancipate the mind and seek development actively, they will finally find a way to overcome difficulties and to extricate themselves from a difficult position. Enterprises with given conditions should strive to find partners in foreign countries or outside the territory and conduct transformation through grafting because this will be helpful not only to promoting technological progress but also to changing operational mechanism. Some plants in the downtown areas may be moved to the suburban areas so as to make room for developing commerce, service trade, and real estate industry. All state-owned industrial enterprises should make use of their own conditions and advantages to actively develop tertiary industry so as to disperse the surplus labor forces, to develop social service industry, and to increase enterprise income. Party committees and governments at all levels should stress the dedicated spirit of enterpreneurs and give them full political honor and material incentives. As for enterpreneurs with great contributions, the party and government should give them a handsome award with perfect assurance, and enterpreneurs should also boldly take the awards. It is also necessary to strictly punish enterprise responsible persons who cause an enterprise to close down for subjective reasons so as to give a fairly big impetus to and impose a pressure on plant directors and managers of enterprises. Paying Attention To Study and Strengthening Study Is the Key To Coping With the New Situation and Successfully Carrying Out Reform At present, we are facing many new problems in the course of deepening reform. Along with the unceasing deepening of reform, we have to step up our efforts to get familiar with many things unfamiliar to us and to resolve many new problems. It will be difficult to smoothly accomplish enterprise reform if our reform knowledge, ideology, and understanding cannot catch up with it. Therefore, party and government cadres or plant directors and managers should strengthen study and pay attention to study. We should study the theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the market economic knowledge, all sorts of major reform measures issued by the central authorities, and the relevant laws and regulations on the market economy. Young cadres, if conditions permit, should also study international economic knowledge and foreign languages.
