On behalf of the General Staff, the talks on the opening of the airport were attended by Brigadier-General Enver Hadzihasanovic, deputy commander and chief of the General Staff, and his associates, Brigadier- General Mustafa Hajrulahovic-Talijan and Ramiz Suvalic, deputy commander of the 2d Corps. Mayor Selim Beslagic informed General Rose about the difficult humanitarian situation in the Tuzla region, where some 800,000 people have been living under siege for 10 months. He reiterated the demand that the international forces urgently open Dubrave Airport, which would solve the problems connected with the delivery of humanitarian aid not only to the free territories, but also the territories under the aggressor's temporary occupation. The examples of Bratunac, Bijeljina, and Zvornik were given. The only thing to which we will not agree is that the aggressor controls the airport, Mayor Beslagic said. Brigadier-General Enver Hadzihasanovic reported on the attempts by the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army to enable the international institutions to operate freely, and also stressed the need for occasional meetings with the UNPROFOR chief of staff for Bosnia-Herzegovina in order to solve possible disputed issues at that level, too. General Rose expressed his gratitude for the support he was given, and informed his hosts about the orders he had issued to his liaison officers. He said that he believed that their successful work would be the grounds for the achievement of aims ahead of the international forces.
