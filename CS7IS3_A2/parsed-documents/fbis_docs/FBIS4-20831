If We Have to Think About These Questions for Long, We Shall No Longer Need an Answer"] [Text] Vladimir Uglev did not publish any great secret about Russian binary chemical weapons, having decided that this kind of revelation is within the capability of a fifth-year student in any chemistry department and, therefore, it was not worth making a fuss over it. According to rumors, the President "reacted adequately to the unconstitutionality of the prosecution" against the scientist Vil Mirzayanov. It appears that his case will be closed. No matter how you put it, it would be a blessing if only the mass media would quiet down again and not cause public opinion to pout over the news about how we are destroying poisonous substances that we have accumulated for many years. And how we are storing them, and how many are left. These military poisonous substances will be burned up, detonated, and sometimes simply and boldly dumped "on the ground" in secrecy. Well, this cannot be allowed in any case. In general, nearly every disgraceful practice in connection with the production, storage, and destruction of chemical weapons occurred and is still occurring because we continue to live in an environment of total secrecy. A minimum of eleven million citizens of Russia carry this stigma of secrecy. Those who try to free themselves of this stigma are threatened with unpleasant consequences similar to those which befell Mirzayanov and Fedorov, and far from everyone is willing to risk getting a prison cot. This is how my conversation began with Professor Sergey Novikov. Sergey Sergeyevich is director of a laboratory at the Institute of Chemical Physics of the Russian Academy of Sciences and, in contrast to "chemical dissidents," never participated in developing chemical weapons. His scientific and technical experience consists of destroying highly toxic waste material resulting from production. For a long time, Novokov could not go abroad. Two years ago, however, it turned out that the secrets that he kept for many years are not so terrible after all, and the stamp of secrecy was removed. Now Novikov has not only a passport to go abroad, but is conducting a Russo-Swedish project called "The Destruction of Chemical Weapons in Russia: Problems and Perspectives," at the International Institute for Problems of Peace, located in Sweden. You have to agree that it is somewhat strange that this kind of project has a Swedish residence, if one can express himself in this way. In our country, however, any serious and unclassified work of this nature is still practically impossible. All data are still being guarded by sharp-eyed departments of our security service. It is simply astounding. The USSR participated for nearly 20 years in preparing the Convention on Prohibiting the Development, Production, Accumulation, Use, and Abolishment of Chemical Weapons. We presented the world community with the most diverse possible data on their production and storage, and on possibilities of destroying the chemical potential that had been turned out by our country; also, the ecological impact of existing and future production on the environment and on people who worked with poisonous substances and who lived in polluted areas.... And what happened? The 1992 publication of the book by Kraus and Mellari, "Chemical Weapons in Soviet Military Doctrine," contains the same data that continue to be a great secret for all citizens of Russia, whether they are specialists in narrow fields, journalists, or residents of polluted areas. But a Swede, an American, or a German can easily look at this great secret of ours if he wants to buy the book in a store or request it from a library. Nothing changed after Russia signed the Convention in January 1993 either. Indeed, what is this legal suit against Mirzayanov? Is it not simply an unwillingness on the part of the "science security people" to forego their fairly well-organized and apparently well-paying personal lives? Experts are generally amused about the charges leveled at Mirzayanov. And, really, one has only to analyze the list of those who received awards for developing chemical weapons and putting them into production -- a list published in the open press by Lev Fedorov. One does not have to be a Stirlitz to be able to match the names and positions of the heroes of the invisible front with the names of the enterprises, the cities in which they are located, the number of workers at these enterprises, the elapsed time after the discoveries had been made.... This is the intriguing picture that gradually emerges.... Who cares about Mirzayanov's "discoveries"? This is why all talk about exposing secrets is, at a minimum, naive: The chemical dissidents are absolutely right when they focus the attention of the world on the fact that the stores of chemical weapons that we have presented for destruction do not reflect the full picture. We are speaking about the disappearance of, God knows whereto, 75,000 tonnes of mustard gas and 14,000 tonnes of Lewisite. Thus far there has been no mention, but with time information will certainly surface about chemical weapons -- ours and German -- that were buried in the Baltic Sea after World War II. After having signed the Convention, hiding something becomes problematical. After all, we have opened up our borders so that the responsibilities that we have accepted can be monitored. And incidentally, this is not only for monitoring. We agreed that if there is any violation of any point of the Convention, severe sanctions can be applied against us. And this this already a serious matter. Whether there is a court case against Mirzayanov or not, an answer will still have to be given. Until the Convention is ratified, some kind of justification can be made, but that cannot go on forever. And here is where we come to the important point. In accordance with the Convention, Russia has to begin destruction of its stores of chemical weapons in 1997 and finish this difficult task by 2005. Thus far, however, a state plan for the safe destruction of chemical weapons does not exist. There is a Committee for Convention Problems on Chemical and Biological Weapons. There is technology: One accepted and 35 alternative methods for destruction. But there are no factories or plants. Not a single one! So how we are going to free ourselves of this scourge, and in such a short time to boot, is not entirely clear -- neither to you or us, nor to the experts. A plant was being built in Chapayevsk especially for this purpose. It was proposed that a two-stage technology for destruction be applied here: First the poisonous substances would be subjected to a "wet" chemical detoxification and then, the resultant so-called reactive mass formed as a result of alkaline hydrolysis would be subjected to a burning process. Solid waste products were to be glazed and buried, and liquid waste would be used partly for repeated processing of subsequent poisonous substances, while fully detoxicated waste could already be poured into reservoirs because they would be rendered harmless. Despite the fact that the description of this technology looks frightening and not too convincing, the developers maintain that the safety factor of this technology is very high, but as usual, there is no published data, and so it would be impossible to verify this assertion. Moreover, the Chapayevsk plant is now something totally different. In fact, it is now a training center and facility for training experts for the chemical troops. This change of function took place after international experts had visited Chapayevsk and were to report to the world community that something had finally stirred the Soviet conscience, and they had devised a civilized method for destroying chemical weapons. The experts were satisfied that this was indeed the case and departed. Only at that moment did the city dwellers realize what kind of vile thing had been built next door to them. And they began picketing around the plant. Every pre-election program of Deputy candidates was based on promises to protect the residents of Chapayevsk who, for a period of many years now, had been poisoned by chemical products. It was already 1989 and it was impossible not to pay heed to the people's anger. And so the plant's profile was changed. Anyway, plant capability was such that it would have taken 400(!) years to destroy all the accumulated chemical trash, running at full capacity. So at first glance, it was not a great loss. But only at first glance. It was planned that after the plant had begun operating and after the necessary approvals, as many similar plants as necessary would be built. These plans are no longer valid, especially since in the past few years it has become clear that not a single mode of transportation available in our country could guarantee that chemical weapons could be transported safely to areas where plants might have been built. Now there is one way out: Similar enterprises can be built only next to storage areas, of which -- as is well known -- we have seven, and five of them are located in the greatly suffering Volga basin. From a common sense point of view, this is akin to madness. But in reality, there is no other way out. So we cannot be horrified and we cannot close our eyes to the consequences of militaristic philosophizing. We must immediately develop and implement a program of action. Yes, we shall need immeasurably more resources than was proposed earlier. No one can force people to live and work in dangerous areas. But natives of cities where "chemistry" flourished, where they got used to drinking, eating, and breathing from poisonous sources, not receiving anything in return, should be offered a package of measures for their social protection, as well as compensation. Perhaps people will accept these provisions and will not leave. The ecological soundness of various technologies used for different purposes must be proven with absolute openness, with no omissions of any kind, and with the assistance of independent experts. Apparently there is no longer any talk about what was supposed to be operational in Chapayevsk. The Americans are offering their technology already tested on Johnston Atoll and also, loans for this purpose. Of course, in this way they are resolving their own problems of distributing contracts and providing employment, but since time has run out, it is possible that this option will be selected. Monitoring and control (real ones!) will come very quickly and, again, will not be ours. America has already offered resources for the purchase of an information-analytical laboratory network, whose sensing elements will register "traces" of poisonous substances in working areas where the chemical weapons will be destroyed. In addition, it is essential for the public and the press to know that there is legislation which establishes the right of control over these sites. In other words, this problem can be resolved only if the public is fully informed about it. The cost of destroying Russian chemical weapons is estimated at 10 billion dollars. Under our present economic conditions it appears unrealistic that this amount could be appropriated. The storage areas, however, are located in the most densely populated parts of the country, and any accident or sabotage or simply a worsening of storage conditions could lead to a catastrophe that would make Chernobyl look like a minor incident by comparison. Is it possible that we are just going to wait until it all blows up and only then find the money, technology, and the people we need? Anyway, there may simply not be any people left: Chemical weapons are also frightening because there would be no one to save and no one to do the saving in polluted areas. I think it is time for our country to be returned to us, otherwise there will be no place left for us to live.
