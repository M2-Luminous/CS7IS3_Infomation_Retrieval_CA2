The law on public officials' elections and prevention of electoral fraud, amendments to the political funds law, and the local autonomy law were signed by President Kim Yong-sam on Tuesday. The law on public officials' elections and prevention of electoral fraud pulled down the upper limit of election campaign expenses while allowing free outdoor campaign speeches. The law bars anyone convicted of violating the election law from getting a public post for 10 years. His civil rights will also be limited under the new law. Moreover, the new law prohibits political parties from admitting new members during campaign periods and bans neighborhood meetings. Party rallies in the form of discussion gatherings are also prohibited from 30 days before the official campaign period and public disclosure of candidates' personal assets is required. Candidates or political parties can ask the government to arbitrate in disputes over bribery, violence or meddling by government officials in campaigns. The new political funds law introduces a system in which all monetary transactions must be accompanied by receipts issued by the Central Election Management Committee [CEMC], and raises the government's political fund subsidies to 800 won from 600 won per voter. In addition, it allows the formation of support organizations by party local chapters. It also allows collection of campaign funds at rallies and anonymous contributions if they are accompanied by receipts issued by the CEMC. As for the local autonomy law, heads of local governments are allowed to ask the voters about decisions on major issues.
