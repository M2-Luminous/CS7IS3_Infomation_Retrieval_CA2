The African National Congress [ANC] earlier asked an emergency meeting of the management committee to replace Mr Mangope with a new administration under the direction of the TEC and the South African Government. A detailed proposal will be considered by the TEC on Tuesday. The management committee, after a five hour-meeting, stopped short of calling for Mr Mangope's replacement. It decided to send to Mmabatho a team consisting of among others ANC Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa and Constitutional Development Minister Roelf Meyer. But the TEC will be hard pushed to resist an ANC call for Mr Mangope to go. The TEC team visiting Mmabatho was briefed to assess the overall security situation, to consider practical steps to ensure services were restored and to "decide on the spot on the action to be taken in the light of President Lucas Mangope's latest statement in which he has not responded in direct terms to the call for free and fair elections and transitional steps to be taken for the re- incorporation of Bophuthatswana into South Africa". Mr Mangope met Independent Electoral Commission chairman Mr Justice Johann Kriegler on Friday night, but failed to give guarantees on free political activity. At a press conference after the management committee met, Mr Ramaphosa said the management committee felt that Mr Mangope needed to go much further in complying with a TEC resolution last week to allow free and fair political activity. He said it needed to be agreed that the TEC and the South African Government should agree that the situation had deteriorated to the extent that Mr Mangope could no longer exercise effective control. He said action needed to be taken to replace Mr Mangope with an administration set up by the TEC and the South African Government. Mr Ramaphosa and Mr Meyer met behind closed doors during the management committee meeting. Mr Meyer went to the management committee with specific proposals from President F W de Klerk aimed at returning stability to the region and at ensuring free and fair political activity. The TEC took a resolution last week giving Mr Mangope a week in which to ensure free political activity in the homeland, failing which he would face a range of punitive financial and diplomatic sanctions designed to ensure compliance. The management committee meeting took place amid ANC unhappiness with the manner in which Mr Mangope appeared to have salvaged his position as head of state and then compound the injury by not giving assurances to Mr Justice Kriegler.
