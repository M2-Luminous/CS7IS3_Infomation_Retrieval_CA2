Meanwhile, a prominent Iranian opposition leader has revealed that "new forces and a popular movement in the country are prepared to surge forward to end the repressive dictatorship and replace it with a democratic regime capable of saving Iran from catastrophe." Tens of thousands of people poured onto Tehran's streets in the direction of the great Freedom Square carrying placards proclaiming "No Settlement With Enemies of Revolution," and shouting such slogans as "Death to America" and "Death to Israel." [passage omitted] In an exclusive interview with AL-HAYAH from Tehran, Daryush Foruhar (65 years old), leader of the Nation of Iran Party (the oldest secular organization in the country), painted a gloomy picture of the economic, political, and social situation. He urged the clergy ruling Iran to "to vacate the place quietly and let a democratic popular regime take over power and rescue the country from the abyss it has been in since those who were hungry for power wrested that power, isolated the country, and cast it into the darkest reigns." Foruhar accused the regime of deviating "from the revolution's noble objectives" of turning Iran into a strong, prosperous, and developing country taking its special place in the world. He said that the dictatorial rulers "who have savagely crushed the people's rights to happiness, civil liberties, democracy for the parties and the press, and freedom of publication and expression, have isolated themselves from the people. History will show that a repressive regime rejected by the people cannot survive." Contrary to the claim by Hashemi-Rafsanjani and other Iranian leaders that Iran has made "unparalleled progress in all fields," Foruhar described the situation as "catastrophic." He spoke of "massive unemployment, shortages in almost everything including such fields as health, medicine, and education, corruption, bureacracy, high prices, and an increasing gap between the poor and the new rich, while the authorities turn a deaf ear to the people's grievances." He underscored the "social disturbances and the destruction of industry and agriculture." [passage omitted] Foruhar refused to comment on the alleged assassination attempt [on Hashemi-Rafsanjani], but he warned against "the dangerous game" played by the regime in pitting the Sunnis against the Shiites, as was recently the case in Zahedan, which witnessed bloody clashes at the beginning of this month between the town's population (mostly Sunnis) and the security forces.
