Karadzic was speaking after talks with United Nations special envoy for the former Yugoslavia, Yasushi Akashi. "We have been withdrawing already convoys and convoys, and we will withdraw even more," he said. "Those which can't be withdrawn because of snow will be placed under full effective control of the UN without any reservations." "Tomorrow at 2400 regardless of other deadlines all heavy weapons will be under efficient control that is envisaged by UN regulations." The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation has warned that if Serb weapons ringing Sarajevo are not withdrawn to a distance of 20 kilometres (12 miles) or put under UN control by Sunday midnight they will be attacked. Akashi said that from Saturday armed troops of the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) will be controlling seven sites where heavy weapons will be grouped. "There is a good momentum in full awareness that we have to make a very quick agreement," he added. The heavy weapons on both Serb and Moslem side are being withdrawn or put under UNPROFOR control under an agreement concluded with the UN on February 9, the same day as NATO issued its ultimatum.
