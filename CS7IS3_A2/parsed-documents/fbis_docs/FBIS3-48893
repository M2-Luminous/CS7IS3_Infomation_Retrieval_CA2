It was found that pilots of the helicopter had returned home after taking it to Mongolia. The other day Deputy Director of the Russian "Godli" firm B. B. Gomboyev came to Ulaanbaatar with the purpose of receiving money for the helicopter having been sold to the Mongolian "Oyuny Undraa" firm. In response to it we have demanded to send here their pilots having violated the law of the country, he said. According to him, the Mongolian "Oyuny Undraa" firm did not purchase the helicopter for itself but played only the role of a mediator in the selling of the helicopter.
