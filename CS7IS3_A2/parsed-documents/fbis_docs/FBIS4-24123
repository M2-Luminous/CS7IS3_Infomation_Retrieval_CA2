On his return to Maputo, smiling broadly to journalists, the Renamo president said he now had an aversion to war and weapons. Amid doubts and distrust, journalists insistently asked him whether Renamo has been handing over good quality weapons and whether he is truly demilitarizing his forces. Dhlakama firmly answered that he is no longer interested in taking up arms and living in the bush as a guerrilla. "I am a politician," he said, "and I am only concerned with organizing my party." He added: "We do not need to hide weapons. If you could enter my heart, you would know." Amid journalists' doubts he said: "I am speaking from the bottom of my heart." The leader of the former rebel movement said he does not want war any more. He said in Rome on 4 October 1992 that he avowed in his speech during the signing of the General Peace Accord that he would never again resume war in Mozambique. Now, he said, his major weapon "is the Mozambican people who will defeat the Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo] if it resorts to war." "I would like to see the problem of soldiers resolved as soon as possible. I would like to see them confined and demobilized as soon as possible," Dhlakama said, recalling that he is now the president of a party that has placed aside the military option. In a meeting with journalists at his residence in Maputo, the Renamo leader said his party will not demand money as a precondition for taking part in the election. "We need money for the election but that is not the most important thing," he said. Dhlakama said Renamo only needs money to buy fuel for its vehicles, to buy typewriters and paper, to pay telephone bills and so on. Regarding areas previously under the control of his movement, Dhlakama said their nonintegration in state administration so far is an act of sabotage by the government. "The government no longer needs those areas because it thinks the people living there may not be ready to vote for Frelimo." Afonso Dhlakama worked with his cadres in Inhambane and Gaza this week, preparing for the electoral campaign.
