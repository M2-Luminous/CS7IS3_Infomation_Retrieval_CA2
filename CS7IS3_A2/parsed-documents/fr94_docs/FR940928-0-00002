FR940928-0-00002 FR940928-0-00001 NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION 5 CFR Chapter LIX 14 CFR Part 1207 RINs 2700&hyph;AB44, 2700&hyph;AB48, and 3209&hyph;AA15 Supplemental Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration AGENCY: National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, with the concurrence of the Office of Government Ethics (OGE), is issuing a regulation for employees of NASA that supplements the executive branch-wide Standards of Ethical Conduct (Standards) issued by OGE and codified at 5 CFR part 2635. NASA is also repealing those sections of its existing standards of conduct regulations that are now superseded by the new Standards and by the executive branch financial disclosure regulations at 5 CFR part 2634, also issued by OGE, and is adding a cross-reference to the current provisions. EFFECTIVE DATE: These regulations are effective September 28, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: James L. Hoffman, NASA, (202) 358&hyph;2465. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background On August 7, 1992, the Office of Government Ethics published the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch that are now codified at 5 CFR part 2635. See 57 FR 35006&hyph;35067, as corrected at 57 FR 48557 and 52583, with an additional grace period extension at 59 FR 4779&hyph;4780. The Standards became effective February 3, 1993, and established uniform ethical conduct standards applicable to all executive branch personnel. With the concurrence of OGE, 5 CFR 2635.105 authorizes executive branch agencies to publish agency-specific supplemental regulations that are necessary to properly implement their respective ethics programs. NASA, with OGE's concurrence, has determined that the following supplemental regulations, being codified in new chapter LIX of 5 CFR, are necessary for successful implementation of NASA's ethics program, in light of NASA's unique programs and operations. II. Analysis of the Regulations Section 6901.101␣General Section 6901.101 explains that the regulations apply to NASA employees and supplement the Standards at 5 CFR part 2635. Section 6901.102␣Designation of Responsible Officials Although some sections of NASA's existing rules at 14 CFR part 1207 have been temporarily ``grandfathered'' by the new OGE Standards, and others were not affected, 14 CFR part 1207 will eventually be totally superseded by a combination of the new Standards, the new financial disclosure regulation, the NASA supplemental regulation, NASA internal directives, and a future OGE regulation on regulatory waivers issued under 18 U.S.C. 208(b)(2). Therefore, the designation of NASA Agency Ethics Officials currently at 14 CFR 1207.104 is being modified to include and identify ``Agency designees'' and is restated at section 6901.102 of the NASA supplemental regulation. Section 6901.103␣Outside Employment 5 CFR 2635.802 and 2635.803, respectively, authorize individual agencies, by supplemental regulation, to prohibit conflicting outside employment and to require employees to obtain approval before engaging in other outside employment or activities. The current NASA rules prohibiting outside employment with certain entities and requiring administrative approval for other particular employment activities have been in effect for many years and have served NASA well in avoiding violations of the standards of conduct and conflict of interest statutes and, thus, in ensuring public confidence in the integrity of NASA personnel and programs. Accordingly, the rules at 14 CFR 1207.300&hyph;1207.306 have been modified form as §6901.103 of the NASA supplemental regulation.
