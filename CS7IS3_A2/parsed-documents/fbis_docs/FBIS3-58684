If one is to believe the declarations that come from them, most of them are historic. But viewed in a wider context, probably only very few are worthy of the description. I am convinced that the NATO summit on 10 and 11 January 1994 is one of these summits. We have not only set in motion the work to update NATO to fit in with the new world. This work has in fact been going on for some time. But this summit has begun a process which could change NATO fundamentally. This is true in more than one respect. I would like to concentrate on a central aspect here -- relations with the countries of central and Eastern Europe, particularly the Baltic countries. The change has come about as a result of this summit's adoption of Partnership for Peace. We have adopted a comprehensive and ambitious program for concrete security policy and military cooperation throughout Europe. This is something new and very different. In the past NATO was the Western defense organization against what we saw as an overwhelming threat from the East. That threat has gone. The countries of Eastern Europe have won their freedom. The Soviet empire has collapsed into ruins. From these ruins there has arisen a new Russia which has just held the first democratic elections since the revolution in 1917, even though these elections have brought with them repulsive nationalist tendencies as a result of the election of Zhirinovskiy. This is something we must pay attention to and we must support the positive democratic forces. It has long been clear that if NATO were to survive we would have to change the organization so that it fits the new conditions in the world. Not in such a way that we would abandon the collective security guarantee. Not in such a way that we would water down the Western community of values. But in such a way that we would be opening the doors to the new. That is what we have now done. Partnership for Peace is the tool. Within its framework we will this year enter into a number of concrete cooperation agreements with Eastern European countries. There will be joint maneuvers in the field of peacekeeping. There will be direct contacts between military staffs. Liaison offices for these countries will be set up at NATO headquarters. There are many other elements. All in all comprehensive cooperation tailored to meet the needs of each individual country participating. All will receive the same offers, but the actual concrete form cooperation takes will vary. The countries closest to us will want more ambitious cooperation programs. And they will get them. We say expressly in the declaration from the summit that we welcome an enlargement of NATO as part of this development over time. This is new, decisively new. Partnership for Peace is not, as some have claimed, a self-satisfied alliance's refusal to accept new members. On the contrary Partnership for Peace is a preparation to do so. In this connection I think that it was Denmark's simple duty to stress that the Baltic countries must be given special support. They are three neighbors on the other side of the Baltic Sea who have as yet scarcely had time to build up their own military capacity. But they have decided to set up a joint peacekeeping battalion. This fits in well with Partnership for Peace. We want to help them with this battalion, in part by helping with the training of their personnel. But, the critics say, why do we not simply admit all from Eastern Europe and get it over with? We will not do so, because everything must happen at the right time. Security is too important to experiment with. And if we did so we would create more problems than we would be solving. Russia must not be isolated. Russia must also form part of the new pattern of cooperation. On the other hand Russia must not have a right of veto. Let me add one more thing: Partnership for Peace includes access for partner nations to political consultations with NATO if they feel that their security is threatened. This is a very important step. It reflects what the United States recently expressed very clearly: The security of those states which lie between Western Europe and Russia also affects our security. And above all: We must not create new walls -- out of fear and enemy images -- after the fall of the old wall, but new stability and peace-building. I am convinced that Partnership will prove to be epoch-making.
