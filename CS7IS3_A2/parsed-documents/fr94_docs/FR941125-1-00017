FR941125-1-00017 FR941125-1-00007 B.2.a. Subpart 1 of Part D_Section 172(c) Provisions Section 172(c) sets forth general requirements applicable to all nonattainment areas. Under section 172(b), the section 172(c) requirements are applicable on a schedule as determined by the Administrator, but no later than three years after an area has been designated as nonattainment under the amended Act. With the exception of requirements for which subpart 2 established SIP submission dates for corollary requirements prior to November 12, 1993 (which are discussed below), the requirements of section 172(c) were not applicable to ozone nonattainment areas on or before November 12, 1993, the date on which the State of Illinois submitted the complete redesignation request for Jersey County. Therefore, these requirements, including those of sections 172(c)(2) and 172(c)(9) are not applicable requirements for purposes of evaluating this redesignation request. With respect to the requirement of section 172(c)(1) concerning the adoption of RACT, the USEPA notes that, as discussed elsewhere in this action, Illinois has completed the adoption of stationary source RACT rules statewide, the USEPA has approved these rules in prior rulemaking, and has found no deficiencies in the rules for Jersey County. In addition, the USEPA notes that, with respect to Jersey County, no additional RACT controls beyond the RACT rules already covered in the SIP are necessary or were required at the time of the submission of the redesignation request. With respect to the emissions inventory requirement of section 172(c)(3), the USEPA notes that the State of Illinois has developed and submitted the required emissions inventory, which section 182(a)(1) required to be submitted by November 15, 1992. This emissions inventory has been the subject of separate review and rulemaking by the USEPA. EPA expects to take final action approving the emissions inventory before the USEPA takes final action approving the redesignation request for Jersey County. The emissions inventory must be approved for EPA to take final action approving this redesignation request. As for the section 172(c)(5) New Source Review (NSR) requirement, once an area is redesignated to attainment this requirement is no longer applicable. The area then becomes subject to prevention of significant deterioration (PSD) requirements in lieu of the part D NSR program. Under USEPA policy described in a Memorandum from Mary Nichols, Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation, dated October 14, 1994, and area need not comply with the NSR requirement of section 172(c) to be redesignated if it is demonstrated that the area will continue to maintain the ozone standard without a part D NSR program in place. As the State of Illinois has demonstrated the maintenance of the standard will occur without a part D NSR program (see discussion below) and PSD requirements will apply, the lack of fully-approved part D NSR rules applicable to Jersey County does not preclude the redesignation of Jersey County. The requirements of section 172(c) are discussed below along with their relevancy to the redesignation request at hand: (1) Section 172(c)(1) of the Act requires SIPs to provide for all Reasonably Available Control Measures (RACM) as expeditiously as practicable and to provide for attainment of the NAAQS. As discussed elsewhere in this action, Illinois has completed the adoption of stationary source RACT rules statewide. The USEPA has approved these statewide RACT rules in prior rulemaking and has found no deficiencies in the rules for Jersey County.
