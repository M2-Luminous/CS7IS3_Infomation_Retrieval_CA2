The symposium, sponsored by the EPA, opened Thursday in Tokyo as part of the educational assistance for Russia's economic reforms pledged by Japan in May 1993. Russian participants to the symposium, the second of its kind following one in March 1993, included Andrey Shapovalyants, first vice economic minister, Aleksey Ulyukayev, deputy director of the institute for economy in transition, and Vladimir Volkov, deputy chief of the department of the social and economic development. Japanese participants included Shinyasu Hoshino, president of the National Institute for Research Advancement, Nobuyoshi Araki, chief economist at the East and West Research Institute, and Masashi Kato, the EPA's vice minister for international economic affairs. According to the EPA official, the participants discussed macroeconomic aspects of the problem of inflation in Russia under which consumer prices rose by 9.4 times and wholesale prices tenfold during 1993. They also talked about the sharp drop in investment in Russia, to the point that it is difficult even to renew obsolete equipment and facilities. The Russian participants reported at the symposium that Russia's efforts to introduce market economy have now come to the stage of "irreversibility." But its economy is still in poor condition, with gross national product contracting by 12 percent and industrial output dropping by 16.2 percent in 1993 from the previous year, they said.
