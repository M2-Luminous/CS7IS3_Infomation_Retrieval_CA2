He then asked Prime Minister Hata how Japan will deal with economic sanctions if the United States and other nations impose them on North Korea. In response, Prime Minister Hata stated: "If the United States and other nations impose economic sanctions on the DPRK, Japan would prepare for a state of emergency in accordance with the Constitution. The economic sanctions imposed by the United States and other nations are different from those slapped on by the United Nations." In this way, the prime minister indicated that Japan can take concerted action with the United States and South Korea against North Korea. During the session, however, Prime Minister Hata refused to state specifically how Japan will deal with the economic sanctions, saying: "Inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency are now checking nuclear facilities in North Korea, and it is a very delicate time. I therefore wish to refrain from discussing at this session how Japan should deal with the economic sanctions." [passage omitted on questions and answers on public services fees at the session]
