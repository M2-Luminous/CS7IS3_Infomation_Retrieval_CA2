Security Council on Wednesday evening condemned Bosnian Muslim attacks on Brcko, Serb town in the north of the ex-Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina where four people were killed and 13 wounded on Tuesday. The Security Council is concerned about the reports on the shelling of Brcko...[ellipses as received] by the Muslim government forces which resulted in civilian deaths, including those of women and children, reporters learned from Security Council President Ibrahim Gambari of Nigeria after a consultative session. Bosnian Muslim and Croat military commanders recently publically confirmed they are preparing an offensive on Brcko, Serb town in the northwestern part of the corridor which links the eastern and western parts of the Bosnian Serb Republic (RS). On Tuesday evening the Muslims shelled Brcko during a session of the RS parliament. The attack left four Serb civilians dead and 13 wounded. Only 24 hours later, the Muslims attacked again, but this time no-one was injured. RS officials described the attacks as the latest Muslim attempt to provoke a Serb military response and force fresh NATO air strikes against the Serbs. Gambari also said that the Security Council is worried about the violation of the security measures in the region of Tuzla (Muslim-controlled city in northeast Bosnia) especially "the Serb shelling." However, TANJUG learns that the Muslims launched artillery and infantry attacks on Serb positions near Tuzla on Wednesday, and U.N. representatives in Sarajevo confirmed that the Muslims have massed strong forces in the south and southwest of this city aiming to prevent the movements of U.N. military observers and to prepare military actions in the region. According to the Nigerian diplomat, the Security Council called on the warring sides on Bosnia to fully cooperate with the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR), to meet their obligations and to refrain from actions which could worsen the situation or threaten the peace process. Gambari said that the Security Council session did not discuss in detail the modified French proposal on Brcko because the opinion prevailed that it is necessary to wait for the outcome of the meeting of the foreign ministers of Russia, United States and the European Union scheduled to open in Geneva on Friday. Russia insisted that the Security Council condemns the massing of the Muslim heavy arms and their offensive in Mt. Igman, which is close to the exclusion zone in Sarajevo, but Gambari failed to mention this.
