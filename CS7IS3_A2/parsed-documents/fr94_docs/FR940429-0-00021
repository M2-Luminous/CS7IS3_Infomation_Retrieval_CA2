I. Introduction The Congregate Housing Services Demonstration Program was first established by the Congregate Housing Services Act of 1978 (42 U.S.C. 8001). It provided congregate housing and coordinated supportive services for elderly disabled and non-elderly disabled individuals to allow them to maintain their independence and avoid costly and unnecessary institutionalization. Congress appropriated funds for fiscal years 1979 through 1982, to remain available until expended. Since then, Congress has appropriated funds annually to continue the grantees funded. The Congregate Housing Services Program was implemented through the HUD Congregate Housing Services Handbook (4640.1). On November 28, 1990, the National Affordable Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 8011) (NAHA) was enacted. In section 802, Congress specifically directed the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Secretary of Agriculture (USDA) through the Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) to jointly implement regulations to carry out the Congregate Housing Services Program (CHSP). Section 802 provides for congregate services which are minimally necessary to prevent premature or unnecessary institutionalization of frail elderly persons, persons with disabilities regardless of whether a person is elderly, or temporarily disabled persons living in eligible housing for the elderly.
