On Friday and on Saturday, the Moslems opened cannon, mortar, anti-aircraft and small arms fire on Serb settlements and army positions in the areas of Doboj, Teslic, Maglaj and Mt. Ozren in northern Bosnia, the statement added. It also said that regular troops of the Republic of Croatia had not withdrawn from Bosnia-Herzegovina although the deadline set by the U.N. Security Council expired on February 17. On February 3, the Security Council threatened to introduce sanctions against Croatia unless it withdrew its regular troops from Bosnia. From the outset of the Bosnian war nearly two years ago, the Croatian Army supported the local Croat and Moslem forces in their war against local Serbs. Since early 1993, however, Croatia's regular troops and Bosnian Croat forces have been fighting pitched battles with Bosnian Moslems for territories in central and southern Bosnia.
