This was shown during the visit by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher to Beijing. The way the communists deal with people who think differently, who have different ideas and are rebellious, who want independent trade unions and demand freedom of speech and of the press, the uncomfortable people who face up to the state and are therefore removed from circulation -- allegedly, this was the most important issue on the human rights agenda that the U.S. chief diplomat broached in Beijing. In fact, however, this is not true. By publicly insisting on the observance of international norms also in dealing with dissidents, the U.S. secretary of state mainly had an eye on his own audience in Washington. Congress and the Senate have linked trade and customs preferences via the most-favored-nation clause with better treatment of political prisoners, with visits to prisons, with stopping the production of goods for the U.S. market manufactured by prisoners in labor camps, with questions of the immigration of Chinese refugees, and with improvements in the situation in Tibet. The U.S. Administration, which has landed in a dead end with its policy toward China, is now desperately trying to sell the skeptical Congress the claim that, at least in some areas, the human rights situation in China has improved over the previous year--because the United States needs China as a market. In China, Boeing is struggling against Airbus, the powerful U.S. telecommunications corporations are struggling against Siemens. Mercedes-Benz and Chrysler are competitors for a planned truck factory in Guangdong. Mercedes-Benz has even involved Chancellor Kohl in this project. Unexpectedly, German Foreign Minister Kinkel will soon go to Beijing again and, as one has heard, prepare a trip to Germany by head of government Li Peng, because the Chinese head of government will come to Bonn as the chancellor's guest before the Bundestag elections. Japan's Prime Minister Hosokawa has announced his visit to Beijing for next week, and France's Balladur will visit China in April. Thus, the Americans rightly fear that Europeans and Japanese might compete with them for positions in China. This is particularly the case if the abolition of the most-favored-nation clause leads to a boycott of U.S. companies. However, the United States also needs the government in Beijing as a global player in the conflict settlement in the UN Security Council and as a security partner in Asia. In addition, the U.S. consumer would be punished if Chinese goods were burdened with penal duties. From the U.S. point of view, there are far more important issues than human rights. It is just that they are not mentioned so much. "Common global and regional interests" determine the U.S. relationship with China. This is how Christopher summed up his talks in China. Regarding the way it deals with dissidents, China is prepared only for cosmetic corrections. It is unrealistic to expect anything else.
