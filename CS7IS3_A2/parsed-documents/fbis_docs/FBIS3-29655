IAEA Director-General Hans Blix expressed the hope in an opening speech Monday at the Board of Governors' meeting. Blix made it clear that the upcoming IAEA inspection would be limited to checking the seven reported facilities only once and to confirming that North Korea has not diverted nuclear material. The IAEA Board of Governors, meanwhile, decided to take up the North Korean nuclear issue on Wednesday [23 February], the last day of its three-day meeting. The decision came moments after North Korea sent a telegram informing the IAEA secretariat that it would issue visas for members of an IAEA inspection team after seeing the outcome of its talks with the United States, held in New York early this week. The North Koreans thus appeared to have erected yet another barrier to IAEA inspections. Blix told Pyongyang last week that the IAEA was ready to send inspectors whenever North Korea issued visas for them. North Korea sent a three-member delegation to the Board of Governors' meeting including Kim Su-kil, a Foreign Ministry official at the ambassadorial level. "(North Korea's) acceptance of inspections resulted from a North Korea-U.S. agreement," Kim said. The issuance of visas for the inspection team would be linked to corresponding measures the United States has promised to take, Kim said. As a result, the IAEA inspection team could arrive in Pyongyang on Saturday [26 February] at the earliest, if the U.S.-North Korea contact proceeded smoothly.
