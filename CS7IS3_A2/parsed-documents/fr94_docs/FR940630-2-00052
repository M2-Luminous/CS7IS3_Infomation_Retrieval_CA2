FR940630-2-00052 FR940630-2-00040 Space and Earth Station Regulatory Fees June 20, 1994. The Federal Communications Commission issues this Public Notice in order to provide information concerning the payment of regulatory fees in 1994. If you are a space station and/or earth station licensee in the common carrier services, you should carefully review this Public Notice. Who Must Pay Regulatory Fees in 1994 Most licensees and other entities regulated by the Commission must pay regulatory fees in 1994. This Public Notice concerns space station and earth station licensees in the common carrier services only. Why the Commission Must Collect New Fees The new requirement to collect annual regulatory fees was contained in Public Law 103&hyph;66, ``The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993''. These new regulatory fees, which are likely to change each fiscal year, will be used to offset costs associated with the Commission's enforcement, public service, international and policy and rulemaking activities. The new fees are in addition to any application processing fees associated with obtaining a license or other authorization from the Commission. When Fees Will Be Due All Space Station and Earth Station licensees must remit their regulatory fees to the Commission by August 19, 1994, in order to avoid a 25% late penalty: FCC Form 159 Regulatory fee payments must be accompanied by FCC Form 159 (``FCC Remittance Advice''). A copy of this form, with specific instructions is attached to this Public Notice. Please see, ``Special Instructions for Completing FCC Forms 159 & 159&hyph;C'' for detailed information on how to correctly complete these Forms. Where To Send Regulatory Fee Payments All regulatory fee payments must be sent to the following address: Federal Communications Commission, Regulatory Fees, P.O. Box 358835, Pittsburgh, PA 15251&hyph;5835. Method of Payment Regulatory fee payments may be made by check or money order. Payments may also be made by credit card (Visa or Mastercard only). When paying by credit card, please make sure you sign the appropriate block of Form 159. Payments may also be made electronically provided prior approval has been obtained from the Commission. Contact Thomas M. Holleran at (202) 418&hyph;1925 for prior approval. Note: We encourage arrangements to consolidate a number of regulatory fee payments for different entities into a single payment instrument made by a single payee. We recognize the benefits to be gained by all the parties involved. Notwithstanding the published schedule of payment due dates, consolidation of 100 or more regulatory fees due from different entities by a single payee will be due on September 2, 1994. Entities participating in such consolidated payment arrangements that are eligible, and choose, to pay by installment, should pay one-half of the regulatory fee eligible for installment payment by September 2, 1994. The second installment payment will then be due September 30, 1994. Multiple fee payments may be made with one payment instrument. Payors who will be making a single payment for a significant number of entities and wish to submit automated data submissions in lieu of a large number of FCC Forms 159&hyph;C (``Advice Continuation Sheets'') should contact Thomas M. Holleran at (202) 418&hyph;1925 at least four weeks prior to the payment due date.
