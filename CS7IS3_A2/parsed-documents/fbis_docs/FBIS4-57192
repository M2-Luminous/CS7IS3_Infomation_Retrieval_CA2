Strikers threw stones at policemen, injuring 16 of them. The police returned fire and wounded 19 workers, three of them seriously. The police also arrested 33 workers in the clash, which began when they evicted the workers from the farms where they had been on strike for a week. Approximately 1,000 Geest Caribbean company workers were preventing the police from clearing roadblocks on the roads leading to the banana farms. The workers hurled rocks to repel the police's attack, who returned fire with guns and tear gas. Security Minister Juan Diego Castro justified the police action and said he gave the workers a deadline to lift the roadblocks before the police would evict them, but "all efforts to convince them were in vain." A correspondent for the daily LA NACION, who witnessed the incident, said 150 workers clashed with approximately 200 riot police "marching in closed formation toward a roadblock erected by the workers." "The police loaded their M-16 rifles and got the tear gas grenades ready while the strikers awaited the troop's advance, rubbing together in their hands the stones they would later hurl at the police, the daily reported. [no closing quotation mark as received] Union spokesman Jorge Barboza told ACAN-EFE that the labor unrest at Geest Caribbean began in April when the company cut wages up to 50 percent in some cases and then dismissed over 200 workers of the Union of Agricultural, Livestock, and Related Trades Workers of Heredia (Sitagah), a union the company does not recognize. Barboza added that the strike, which has entered its eighth day, is intended to recover wages and achieve the reinstatement of 200 workers fired by the company, "which was preparing to dismiss a similar number of union workers." The Geest Caribbean company issued a communique stating that "the strike is an unjust protest" and explained that it does not recognize Sitagah, which heads the strike, "since it is not a registered union, therefore the company cannot negotiate with people who do not represent the interests of Geest workers." The company granted the workers' representation to an association of blue-and white-collar workers, which, according to the communique "groups 65 percent of the company's workers." Barboza said "the workers have decided that the union will represent them, and the company must accept that decision." He also announced that they are preparing, with support from the International Labor Organization, a labor rights violation complaint. Barboza noted that all the dismissed workers belong to Sitagah and said the company intents to "rid" itself of unionized personnel. He added that the workers are ready to negotiate a solution to the conflict.
