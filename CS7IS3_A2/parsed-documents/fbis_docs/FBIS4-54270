With regard to automobiles, the government plans to propose using the actual number of imports of finished cars as one "objective criterion," and that this criterion shall be monitored twice a year. It will also work for an agreement on steps to improve the standards and certification systems within 1994 by calling for a meeting of experts to determine points of compromise. However, the United States is also expected to demand an increase in the voluntary plan for purchasing U.S.-made auto parts compiled recently by Japanese carmakers. Rough sailing is anticipated in the negotiations. Division-chief class working level meetings on insurance are scheduled to reopen in Tokyo on 1 June, and similar meetings on automobiles and auto parts will start in Washington on 2 June. Subsequently, U.S. Undersecretary of Commerce Jeffrey Garten and Deputy Vice Minister of International Trade and Industry Sozaburo Okamatsu will also hold vice-ministerial level meetings in Tokyo on 6 June to finalize the automobiles negotiations. The Japanese Government will make concrete proposals on objective criteria in the negotiations on automobiles and auto parts. It will suggest using the following as basis: number of finished car imports, volume of auto parts purchase, number of right-hand drive U.S. cars entering the Japanese market, and others; and progress in these categories will be checked by both countries twice a year. Concerning the issue of standards and certification, the United States has presented a list of 16 demands, including partial easing of standards for exhaust gas tests. The government will call for a joint meeting of Japanese and U.S. experts to discuss this problem. It takes the position that after listening to the details of the U.S. demands, "we will draw a conclusion on whether these demands are acceptable within 1994." At the regular meeting between the Transport Ministry and the American Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Japan to be held on 27 May, before the resumption of the framework talks, the government will listen again to the U.S. Big Three carmakers' demands on the issue of standards and certification. It will also consider setting up a regular venue for dialogue between the Transport Ministry and the U.S. automobile industry. In response to U.S. demands, five major Japanese carmakers led by Toyota Motors compiled their voluntary targets for additional purchases of U.S.-made auto parts after fiscal 1994. However, the United States remains unsatisfied, claiming "compared to the growth of Japanese cars produced in the United States, purchase of U.S.- made parts is too little." Furthermore, the United States also demands Japanese Government "guarantee" for these targets. Since the Japanese side is opposed to the latter demand, and a point of compromise has not been found, difficulties are expected in the upcoming negotiations. On the other hand, with regard to insurance, Japan has taken the initiative to implement steps to clarify standards for issuing licenses and product certification, which is one of the U.S. demands. Therefore, the negotiations will concentrate on the focal issue of delaying the liberalization of the third sector insurance. Japanese life and non-life insurers are expected to be allowed to participate in this sector two years later. The United States is actually asking for a postponement of this measure. The Finance Ministry indicates that an agreement is near at hand, affirming "the negotiations have come to the stage of coordinating details of the final agreement." Final adjustments seem to be under way on how to incorporate the postponement of liberalization in the agreement.
