This was said this evening by a senior source in the PLO leadership to our correspondent Moti Amir. He also said that tonight or tomorrow morning it will become clear whether the peace process will continue in its present format in Washington. The source emphasized Yasir 'Arafat is facing severe pressures by various PLO factions which are opposed to the continuation of the peace process, and is continuing his consultations in Tunis.
