What the article says is reasonable. It is worthy of reading. The so-called "migrant upsurge" is often used from the city dwellers's point of view. From rural dwellers's point of view, it is a shift of surplus manpower in a form of rural labor export. This is precisely a major problem that we must solve in carrying out rural reform and development. After the Spring Festival, a new so-called "migrant upsurge"; that is, an upsurge of rural labor export for the new year will soon arrive. In what way can we correctly understand and deal with this major event? How can we guide it to meet the requirements of the socialist market economy? How can we handle this major event well? If it is said that the rural household contract responsibility system with remuneration linked to output is the first assault and that the vigorous development of rural enterprises the second assault, then the so-called "migrant upsurge" is precisely the third assault to China's ossified outmoded system of planned economy in the past. This tide for reform and opening up and for development and prosperity is another creation and contribution made by peasants to China's great reform program. The current tide of civilian workers is gaining momentum year after year. It involves more and more people and covers an increasingly wider area. In addition, with the vigorous development of China's national industrialization, rural urbanization and agricultural modernization, the so-called "migrant upsurge" will further expand. Some people say that the nation-wide "migrant upsurge" involves 50 to 60 million people, while others say 70 to 80 million people. According to a sampling survey conducted by the Jiangxi Rural Survey Team in more than 2,000 rural villages in over 30 counties in the province, the number of Jiangxi peasants who work either seasonally or all the year round in other provinces reached 1.588 million in September 1992, marking an increase of 85 percent as compared with that at the end of 1991. This number rose to 2.13 million during the same period in 1993, accounting for 15 percent of the total rural labor force in the province and registering an increase of 34.2 percent over the same period in 1992. Naturally that fact that Jiangxi's rapidly increasing export of labor to other provinces is neither accidental nor man-made. Its emergence and development are inevitable in the course of carrying out reform and promoting rural economic development in China. It is an important sign reflecting peasants' emancipation of their thought and demonstrating social progress. It has its social roots and intrinsic requirements. The following natural and strong "forces" are fostering this trend. 1. Pressure. Jiangxi has 34 million mu of arable land and a rural labor force of 14.28 million people. If a calculation is made on the basis of the fact that each peasant handles five mu of farmland, the province only needs 6.83 million peasants for its rural areas. It would have a labor surplus of 7.45 million people. This has created a high pressure on the countryside. "Where should the people go?" Many good arrangements for the use of rural labor force have been made such as the comprehensive utilization of agricultural resources, the development of "three-high" agriculture, the establishment of village and township enterprises and the building of small cities and towns. However, peasants have also noticed that the supply of labor falls short of demand in special economic zones and the coastal developed areas. These are the places where the surplus labor force in Jiangxi's old liberated areas and less developed districts can be fully utilized. 2. Pulling force. Since the implementation of the household contract responsibility system with remuneration linked to output in the rural areas, peasants have consciously and unconsciously applied the law of value, and begun to "do whatever is money-making." If one goes out to work outside of Jiangxi, one can make 2,000 to 3,000 yuan per year. If one stays at home and carry out farming, he can only make several hundred yuan a year. Realizing the huge difference and the high remuneration, how can the poverty-stricken peasants remain indifferent? The instinct to shake off poverty and become well-to-to and the kind of natural movement that "water tends to flow to the lowland and people tend to seek improvements at all times" makes peasants feel uneasy. They will not resign themselves to being confined to the pieces of land where they have worked hard for generations. They demand to leave the farmland and their hometown, move to somewhere else and look for other jobs. As a result, peasants have tried one thousand and one ways, overcome all kinds of difficulties, endured untold hardships, crossed ten thousand crags and torrents and accepted jobs that no one else wants to become "ordinary workers." 3. Temptation. First of all, those who left their hometown send a great deal of money home. Girls who used to live in the hills have become modern "young ladies." They spend money freely, and often talk about the "beautiful world outside." They have repeatedly awakened those who live in the hilly districts and often dream about becoming rich; and induced them to make decision to go out and see the world. Those who live in the hilly districts no longer mechanically sing that "eating brown rice and burning charcoal, I am as happy as a fairy." They spread the news to hundreds of people. With the old guiding the new, their relatives calling other relatives, neighbors notifying other neighbors and friends helping other friends, they leave their farms and mountain villages in groups for Guangdong, Fujian, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shanghai or Beijing. The quiet old liberated area in Jiangxi is now seething with excitement. 4. Thrust. As a matter of fact, agriculture has been neglected in many localities. The comparative advantage of grain crops and cotton is small, thus increasing the thrust to the peasants to leave their farmland. 5. Force of guidance. The macro-climate in carrying out reform and the relaxed external environment have created fine conditions for the export of the labor forces. In the past, peasants were not allowed to "leave their land and hometown." Right now, peasants may go south or north to see the outside world by using their identification cards. In this connection, the government does not "conduct check-ups in villages and townships and subject those who seek to leave the countryside to the approval of the county authorities." It actually provides peasants who want to leave with information, training, services and protection. If it is said that the objective conditions provided by the reform program turns the export of the labor force into a possibility, then the enthusiastic support, guidance and services provided by the government have turned this possibility into a reality. People's views on the "migrant upsurge" are similar to their views on the rural household contract responsibility system with remuneration linked to output and on the vigorous development of village and township enterprises. At the very beginning, people do not know much about it. Some people praised it, while others denounced it. Originally the term "migrant upsurge" was journalist language. It seems to be a derogatory term which peasants dislike. Right now, peasants are asking for a correct term for their activities to go to different districts. Experts believe that China's reform begins from the countryside. Peasants have created the household contract responsibility system with remuneration linked to output and developed the village and township enterprises. Right after that China's reform was extended from the rural areas to the cities, and attracted worldwide attention. Currently, peasants have once again brought about the flow of rural labor force to other districts. This is another great pioneering undertaking made by peasants after they had attained their right to carry out and manage their production on their own. This is something inevitable in the course of building the socialist market economy. Peasants have walked out of the countryside, out of a closed environment to the outside world, and to the society to promote development and progress by tens of millions. This is something most gratifying to the people. Peasants have further emancipated their minds. They have fiercely assaulted the dualist social structure which separates the cities from the townships and the workers from the peasants; and shifted the large number of rural surplus labor force to the secondary and tertiary industries. Meantime, they are also creating conditions for carrying out fairly large-scale operations in farming, accelerating the building of small cities and townships, developing village and township enterprises and realizing agricultural modernization. Experts point out that people have different views on economic phenomena such as the "migrant upsurge." This is something inevitable. However, all new-born things have gigantic vitality. Following the development of the "migrant upsurge," people have finally become more clear about the role of this tide and the profound historic significance. In the past, some people called this trend a "blind flow." They even called the "migrant upsurge" as "blind flow of laborers" and regarded such blind flow of laborers as great scourge like fierce floods and savage beasts. They also blamed "blind flow of rural laborers" for disrupting the transportation and bringing unbearable pressure to the cities. When we examine an issue, we should always pay attention to its course, essential aspects, and the main trend. With regard to the "migrant upsurge," it should be correctly termed as an abrupt phenomenon of a large number of rural labors flowing to a certain district to seek employment without obtaining accurate information on job availability and going through the proper procedure and arrangement. Such "migrant upsurge" took place in Guangzhou, Wuhan and other localities. As for the "blind flow of rural laborers," they only happened in some areas, and they should be considered as individual cases. We cannot generalize the entire situation by citing some individual examples. Nor should we brand everything as bad. The flow of population was nothing new since ancient times. Market economy itself is "an invisible hand." It will not call itself market economy if there is no risk at all. China's railways are always quite overloaded. The traveling of a large number peasants by railway during the Spring Festival naturally gives the railway department additional pressure. The excessive number of travellers often cause disasters in some localities. However, under no circumstances should we totally negate the "migrant upsurge," and shift all responsibilities to our peasant brothers and sisters. Nor should we attribute all the problems in public security in the cities to the "migrant upsurge." The existing problem right now is not mainly on the export of labor itself but on the fact that the relative conditions for social management still fails to keep pace with the vigorously developing situation. We will be able to offset the negative effect of the "migrant upsurge," so long as we carry out our work conscientiously, deepen the reform and achieve our goal in "orderly exporting the labor force, controlling the import of labor, providing good services to the flowing labor force, working out measures to make readjustments and handle emergency cases." At the very beginning, the Jiangxi Provincial CPC Committee and the provincial government have paid great attention to the export of labor. They have carried out their work in this connection actively and on their own initiative. As early as in 1987, Governor Wu Guanzheng had already said that on the basis of the rapid economic development in the coastal areas, Jiangxi must implement the policy of "supporting the export of labor, working out follow-ups and replacing those who have left." He called for efforts to keep the doors of Jiangxi's mountain villages wide open and vigorously organize those who wish to leave to go to the coastal areas. The offices under the administration of the provincial government set up in Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Amoy, Shanghai and Beijing regard the export of labor from Jiangxi as a major item in their work. The party and government departments in various localities in the province have consciously regarded the export of labor as another task in support of rural economy after the vigorous development of village and township enterprises. Work stations to help labor export have been set up in various prefectures, cities, counties and townships in Ganzhou, Jian, Shangrao, and Fuzhou where there is a larger number of surplus labor. There are departments and people specially assigned to provide guidance and to serve, help, protect and help those who seek to leave the province. Some localities have also made follow-ups to truly help millions of peasants who wish to leave the province to work in other provinces and to solve their problems. As for the labor markets operated by nongovernment organizations, various localities have adhered to the principle of not trying to interfere with them, drive them out of business or making things difficult for them. They allow, encourage, and help them adopt all types of forms and measures to export labor. In order to alleviate the pressure on the railway transportation imposed by such "migration upsurge," Jiangxi has made full use of its geographical superiority to facilitate the flow of labor out of the province. Many localities have sent out buses to Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Shanghai for use by workers from Jiangxi, winning wide acclaim from the large number of civilian workers and the railroad department. During this year's Spring Festival, the Jiangxi provincial government made special arrangements and called on various prefectures (cities) and counties to take initiative to make things easy for workers out of Jiangxi to return their hometown in the province to spend their Spring Festival. It urged them to dispatch persons or send out buses to places where most of workers from Jiangxi are working to help them come back and return. A provincial-level leading comrade said that we will be able to help our rural labor flow smoothly to various districts in good order; promote what is beneficial and abolish what is harmful; and steadily and healthily develop this trend, so long as we have the government guidance and market demands, keep traffic open between cities and the countryside, adopt various measures to help the flow of rural labor, provide good socialized services and improve the legal system in this connection.
