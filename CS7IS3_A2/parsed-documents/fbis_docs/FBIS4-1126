FBIS4-1126 "drafr078_c_94007" FBIS-AFR-94-078 Daily Report 21 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Mandela Speaks Out Against Lawlessness Mandela Speaks Out Against Lawlessness MB2204070894 Johannesburg SAPA in English 2252 GMT 21 Apr 94 MB2204070894 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [Report by J Rees] [Text] Phuthaditjhaba April 21 SAPA -- Thousands of people braved icy weather to see African National Congress President Nelson Mandela at a waterlogged rally in QwaQwa on Thursday [21 April]. The ANC president's light aircraft from Bloemfontein to Phuthaditjhaba was diverted to Harrismith to avoid the cloudburst and hailstorm over QwaQwa. Youths at Phuthaditjhaba's T K Mopeli Stadium tore down a brass bust of the late Chief Charles N Mopeli -- kicking and stoning it. Mr Mandela made a powerful appeal for reconciliation and national unity, telling cheering supporters he would not tolerate lawlessness after the election. He guaranteed farmers and business people that they would not be the victims of violence, looting or dispossession in his lifetime. "I condemn the lawlessness and anyone who breaks the law will be dealt with harshly." At an earlier meeting in Thaba Nchu, the capital of what was once a fragment of Bophuthatswana, Mr Mandela said it was proper that the ANC should take the lead in getting people to accept the spirit of reconciliation and to work for it. He urged people to support the Police and Army in the former homeland of Bophuthatswana, saying they were needed to maintain law and order. "It is your duty to go to every policeman and soldier and say `Let bygones be bygones. Let us work together to build our country'." The ANC leader spent the day mobbed by photographers who clashed with ANC bodyguards, one of whom threatened to "blow the head off" an international news photographer. Mr Mandela urged people to celebrate the ANC's election victory next week in a manner that would boost confidence in the organisation. He repeated his call for unity throughout the day, quoting himself from after his 1963 treason trial: "I have fought white domination just as I have fought black domination. After 27 years in jail, 20 grandchildren and three great-grandchildren, do you think I could come back and allow any political party to divide our people." He ordered the crowd not to attack farmers or business people. Thursday's weather made Mr Mandela six hours late for a fundraising lunch in Phuthaditjhaba, but about 200 business people waited patiently until after dark to hear that the government gravy train was over. Mr Mandela pledged to take a cut in salary and to start paying tax if he was elected president. "How can a president commit himself to the reconstruction of this country if he doesn't pay tax," he said.
