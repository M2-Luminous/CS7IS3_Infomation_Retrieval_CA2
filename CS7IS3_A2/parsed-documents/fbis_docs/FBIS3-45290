He Zhiqiang, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee and governor, addressed the meeting. He Zhiqiang first briefed the meeting participants on the progress in the three reforms in the province. He said: According to the plan formulated by the central party authorities and the State Council, personnel departments and bureaus at all levels, in close cooperation with departments concerned, have done a great deal of work in regard to organizational reform, the reform to introduce the civil service system, and the reform of the wage and salary system. These reforms have now been started in this province. So far the number of provincial-level organizations has been reduced from 78 to 54, a decrease of 30 percent; the number of organs that form the provincial government has been reduced from 46 to 36; some government organs have been turned into business entities; and remarkable results have been scored. He Zhiqiang demanded that the three reforms be carried on steadily and properly. He said: As far as organizational reform is concerned, the general target is that reform of party and government organs at all levels should be accomplished in the first half of this year; as for the organizational reform for prefectural, autonomous prefectural, and city party committees, pilot projects will be conducted in the first half of this year, and the reform will be gradually expanded on a larger scale in the second half of the year and be completed in the first half of next year; the organizational reform at the county level will be widely launched after the Spring Festival, and will be accomplished in the first half of next year; while the organizational reform at the township and town level will be carried out according to documents issued by the provincial party committee. Wherever it is possible to speed up the reform, the authorities concerned should try to accomplish it ahead of schedule. With regard to the civil service system, the operation should be carried out in accordance with the central party authorities and the State Council's plan concerning the civil service system and the provincial authorities' proposal on specific, relevant arrangements. In the process of implementation, for those parts of the civil service-related reform which cannot go on without organizational reform, pilot projects must be launched before the reform proper is fully started. All executive organs that have completed the three fixing procedures [fixing of the organizational structure, post- specific duties and functions, and staff size] must promptly introduce some practices of the civil service system, such as establishment of posts, the personnel transition process, personnel appointments, and assignment of positions to ensure that the new system will soon operate along the new track. The province must strive to finish establishing the civil service system in three years. With regard to reform of the wage and salary system, He Zhiqiang said: The current wage and salary system reform is to meet the needs of the market economy structure and is for the purpose of deepening the reform of the personnel system. Every effort has been made to ensure that consideration is given to every aspect of the interests of professional and technical personnel, retired personnel, persons with honorary posts, demobilized servicemen, those who are laid off in the wake of the organizational reform, and grassroots staff. All localities must follow nationwide standardized regulations governing the wage and salary system, pay policy, and the pay scale. No locality may arbitrarily change the practices under any pretext of special local needs. It is required that all localities shall carry out the package reform strictly according to the policy. Specific remaining problems will be cautiously dealt with after investigations and study. In order to accomplish the three reforms, He Zhiqiang urged party committees and governments at all levels to set great store by and intensify leadership, personnel departments at all levels to do a meticulous job in implementing the operation, and departments concerned to give strong support to them, to cooperate closely with them, and to work hard on their part to accomplish the reforms. During yesterday's meeting, provincial personnel department director Li Mingyou delivered a report entitled: Advance Our Province's Personnel Work to a New Stage With the Three Reforms as the Key Links.
