FBIS3-54468 "drnes016__s94009" FBIS-NES-94-016-S Document Type:Daily Report 25 January 1994 * RESALAT Editorials on Voice, Vision Matter * Voice, Vision Director's Heresy 94LA0051A Tehran RESALAT in Persian 7 Nov 93 pp 1, 16 94LA0051A Tehran RESALAT Language: Persian Article Type:CSO [Text] Yesterday the radio interrupted its normal programming, and in an unprecedented move, on the pretext of answering the report from the Majles Inquiry and Investigation Group concerning the performance of the Voice and Visage oganization, it insulted and accused the members of the Inquiry and Investigation Group and the deputies elected by the people. 1. In his answer, Mr. Mohammad Hashemi announced that "the Voice and Vision organization is managed under the supervision of the exalted leader. It has therefore always been the closest body to the exalted leader and the leadership."[.sup]1[/] Yet His Holiness Ayatollah Khamene'i, the exalted leader of the Islamic revolution, recently said clearly in answer to a letter from the speaker of the Majles that the Voice and Vision organization was not to answer the Majles, and said that doing this was not justifiable. The Majles is the only power that has the right to inquire, investigate, and evaluate the performance of all the nation's organizations. The deputies can even interpellate the ministers and the government. Can those who have been investigated use the Voice and Vision organization to defend themselves again? Mr. Mohammad Hashemi first laid the groundwork for heresy during the Majles vote of confidence for the minister of petroleum, and yesterday he continued in this. During the Majles vote of confidence for the minister of petroleum, an opponent discussed the bad performance of an organization affiliated with this ministry. An opportunity to respond was afforded both to the minister and to supporters, and this matter was concluded. However, a long time after the vote of confidence for the ministers, Mr. Mohammad Hashemi broadcast that organization's answer over the Majles radio. During Engineer Yahyavi's response to this act, in an insulting response, with disrespect and sarcasm concerning Engineer Yahyavi's 10 years of imprisonment in the Iraqi Government's black pits, he defended what he did. This time Mr. Mohammad Hashemi used the national radio network. He repeatedly interrupted regular programming to insult the Majles deputies. Can Mr. Hashemi, without the approval of the exalted leader, turn the Voice and Vision into a personal forum, when it should be broadcasting the views of the vice-regency of the chief jurisconsult, and use it to revile and abuse people who came to the Majles by a direct vote of the people? 2. In his answer Mr. Mohammad Hashemi says that before the inquiry and investigation he went to the Majles commission and divided the people of society into two groups, those who support and those who oppose the Voice and Vision organization. He said that the hypocrites, the leftist groups, the Hojjatieh Society and those who support America, Israel, and the monarchists are the main opponents. Then, clearly interfering in the work of the commission, he protested the fact that Mr. Parvaresh is a member of this commission. What must be done with someone who was in America during the heat of the revolution and is now saying that deputies elected by the people have the intellectual qualities of the hypocrites and the Hojjatieh Society? Do such heavy accusations against the deputies of the people conform to Islamic culture or American culture, especially when he attacks Mr. Parvaresh, who went to prison, was abused by the accursed shah, is reviled by the hypocrites and the Hojjatieh, and served as minister and deputy Majles speaker for several terms after the revolution? Before the Inquiry and Investigation Commission began its work, Mr. Mohammad Hashemi told them that those who oppose him will be considered supporters of Israel, the hypocrites, and the Hojjatieh. We have seen that he made those very accusations against the commission's members after the inquiry and investigation report was read. Notice: "The intellectual qualities of some of the insensitive members of the Inquiry and Investigation Group is clear: Hojjatieh and hypocrites!"[.sup]2[/] Things similar to this have been reflected repeatedly in the answers from the Voice and Vision organization. 3. One of the reasons some officials feel immunity and easily step out of their domain is the judiciary's failure to investigate their crimes promptly. We remember how, during the election for president of the republic, Mr. Mohammad Hashemi took it upon himself, in violation of the law, to publish a statement against one of the candidates for president of the republic, or to edit his speech, a measure that met with the exalted leader's opposition. If the judiciary had promptly investigated the complaints of these candidates, the supervisor of the Voice and Vision organization would not have dared this time to deal in this ugly and damaging way with the sacred body of the Majles. God forbid, if the judiciary does not deal with such crimes, it will lead to insecurity and increased insults and accusations against government bodies and the elected deputies to the Majles.
