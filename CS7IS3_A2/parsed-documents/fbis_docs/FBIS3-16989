Kozyrev disclosed the idea during a meeting with Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata in Moscow, the officials said. Kozyrev also urged Pyongyang to abide by controls on nuclear facilities as imposed under the international nuclear safeguard agreement, they said. He argued that all controls should be abided by through inspections by experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the officials said. High-level talks between the U.S. and North Korea have stalled in the wake of the IAEA's report that its inspection of Pyongyang's nuclear facilities had been obstructed and the collapse of the dialogue between North and South Korea. The IAEA adopted a resolution Monday to refer North Korea's refusal of full inspections of its nuclear facilities to the United Nations Security Council.
