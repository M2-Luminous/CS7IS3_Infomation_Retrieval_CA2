That is the only way to react to the signing in Moscow of two agreements between Georgia and Abkhazia which have inspired hope, on both banks of the Inguri, of a long-awaited peace. Eduard Bruner [name as transliterated], personal representative of the UN secretary general, particularly stressed the peacemaking efforts by Russian diplomacy, as a result of which a major step has been taken toward peace in an explosive region of the Caucasus. A press conference was held on this topic at the Georgian Embassy in Moscow. The significance of the event was confirmed by the number of journalists, who virtually filled the conference hall at No. 6, Paliashvili. Aleksandr Kavsadze, personal representative of the Georgian head of state and leader of Georgia's official delegation to the talks, noted at the press conference that the success of the Moscow meeting was determined largely by Sukhumi's flexible stance, and also by a compromise and a series of concessions by Tbilisi. He stressed that the agreement on the return of refugees to Abkhazia is an amnesty for those who did fight but have laid down their arms and promised not to take them up again. However, according to Aleksandr Kavsadze, it does not apply to those who committed atrocities or acts of robbery and looting, or to those who are today entertaining plans to resume hostilities. The view was also expressed at the press conference at the Georgian Embassy that those people -- in both Georgia and Abkhazia -- who are responsible for kindling a fratricidal civil war and who have profited by this dirty business, should suffer the criminal punishment they deserve. The remarks at the press conference by Vakhtang Rcheuleshvili, vice speaker of the Georgian Supreme Council, struck me as original, to put it mildly. After demonstrating from the stage his unsuccessfull attempts to open a bottle of Borzhomi [Georgian mineral water] with a Russian bottle opener, he then, with one graceful movement, opened the bottle with a similar, but Swiss-made, tool. That is how it is at the talks, the vice speaker observed with irritation. And then he explained: All the agreements between Georgia and Abkhazia where Russia was present at the signing as intermediary, led to no positive results -- on the contrary, they culminated in bloody armed actions and military defeat for the Georgian side. But the participation of Swiss citizen Eduard Bruner, the UN secretary general's personal representative, in the Moscow talks produced, he said, the long-awaited success. To be fair, it must be noted that Mr. Rcheuleshvili, on failing to observe a rapturous reaction to this nice little "joke" among the Russian and foreign journalists present, did say, in conclusion, that the Georgian side is grateful to Russia for the attainment of the agreements.... Thank you for that. We are long accustomed to see Russia's successful peace initiatives received with irritation outside Russia's borders. The recent success for Russian diplomacy in the Balkans is the most graphic illustration of this. Although it should be noted that not a word was said aloud about this. The artistic performance with the Borzhomi at No. 6, Paliashvili, and the unequivocal remarks by the vice speaker of the Georgian Supreme Council prompt the thought that some people in Tbilisi would prefer to see Western representatives at the talks in the role of peacemaker, rather than Russia. Here it must be noted that the opposition in the Georgian Supreme Council, according to recent reports from Tbilisi, greeted the signing of the peace agreements in a generally hostile fashion. Being a peacemaker is certainly a thankless task: When two people are fighting, they are never happy with a third. However, I would like to point out to Mr. Rcheuleshvili that if aliens from another planet were to appear at the negotiating table in the role of intermediaries, even they could not act as unshakable guarantors of peace in the Caucasus. It all depends primarily on the two warring parties and their true desire to reach an agreement and a peace. On the same day I met with Sergey Bagapsh, first deputy chairman of the Abkhaz Council of Ministers. He expressed satisfaction with the results of the Moscow talks and stressed the beneficial influence of Russian diplomacy in arriving at the two Georgian-Abkhaz agreements that have been signed. Without Russia's participation the CSCE and UN representatives could not have achieved this important task, he concluded. For my part, let me note that I did not notice a Swiss bottle opener in the hands of the first vice premier of Abkhazia. Nor, incidentally, a bottle of Georgian Borzhomi.
