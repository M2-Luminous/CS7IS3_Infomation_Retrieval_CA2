An ANC statement said ANC President Nelson Mandela immediately contacted King Goodwill Zwelithini who expressed his serious concern, saying the events in Ulundi had deeply distressed him. Mr Mandela also contacted Police Commissioner General Jan der Merwe who ordered more troops into the area. "The continuation of political intolerance and daily murders may not be tolerated any longer and all parties have a duty to take decisive action to bring an immediate end to it," the statement said. The ANC demanded the IFP should "take immediate and strong party disciplinary measures against any of their members who were involved. The role of the KwaZulu Police also needed to be investigated because of eye witness allegations that police failed to stop the attack on ANC campaigners. The ANC urged the IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] to investigate these allegations. It said it was crucial all necessary steps should be taken to ensure the freedom of all parties to campaign throughout Natal and specifically in KwaZulu. IEC Natal monitoring head Bheki Sibiya told SAPA it would investigate the incident to see if the electoral code had been breached. If there was a prima facie case against those who had threatened the ANC and IEC members, the IEC would prosecute. The other, preferred, alternative was mediation, Mr Sibiya said. Clashes started after 17 ANC members, accompanied by Independent Electoral Commission monitors, drove to Ulundi around noon on Saturday to distribute election pamphlets and canvass political support. Most of the canvassers were Congress of South African Trade Union Members. The IFP and ANC versions of events on Saturday afternoon differed. While the IFP said ANC members opened fire on residents, the ANC said its canvassers were attacked and their two vans set alight. Five ANC members fled and are still missing. Six others and four IEC monitors took refuge in the Ulundi police station. After about five hours, an armour-plated vehicle brought the ten to safety in Eshowe.
