The same sources told the YEMENI NEWS AGENCY, Aden, that the Air Force Command of the bloody al-Ahmar family is making the ejectable seats on military planes inoperative. These seats are used by pilots to bail out when their planes have been hit. The sources added that this method used by the influential military commands without the pilots' knowledge confirms the disregard these commands have for the lives of the pilots who carry out these savage raids. These sources recalled a similar method used by Iraqi military commands with their pilots during the Gulf War and said that this method currently used by the military commands in Sanaa confirm beyond any doubt the involvement of Iraqi military expertise in the dirty war waged by the al-Ahmar gang against the Democratic Republic of Yemen.
