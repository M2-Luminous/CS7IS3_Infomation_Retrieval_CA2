The official, who requested anonimity, told us that besides issues directly concerning the CPP, the meeting also tackled the problem mentioned in the written answer of Mr. Sam Rangsi, minister of economy and finance, when he responded to the letter of Mr. Theng Bun Ma, chairman of the Thai Boon Rong Company, the investor of the new Olympic market. It should be noted that the meeting was attended by several important CPP ministers. The official expressed his personal opinion "that the content of the written answer by Mr. Sam Rangsi to Olympic market investor Theng Bun Ma appeared to be going too far beyond an economic perimeter, becoming by itself a political issue, and seeming to be of a mudslinging nature," although that dispute first took place as a personal matter. It was learned that Mr. Theng Bun Ma wrote a very critical letter to Mr. Sam Rangsi, the minister of economy and finance of the Kingdom of Cambodia. But it was also learned that Mr. Theng Bun Ma is just an ordinary investor. Mr. Sam Rangsi answered Mr. Theng Bun Ma in a letter that a CPP official described as being part of a purely private squabble using a private newspaper as the venue, a squabble which has gone too far and which unfortunately has become a new problem that never should have been. The dispute between Messrs. Sam Rangsi and Theng Bun Ma up through the afternoon of 19 January has not been reported by state television, radio, or the government news agency AKP although the two gentlemen had already exchanged heated words. Because of the failure of the state media to report it, both local and foreign observers in Phnom Penh have concluded that this was "merely a personal dispute" that would have no effect on the royal government's policy. People are concerned, however, that this acute personal dispute might degenarate into a rift between groups and might affect the bonds between the two ruling parties if no attempt is made to bring about understanding and compromise and if no clear line is drawn. When this problem seriously affects the inner bonds between the two major parties, it will be said that the dispute hurts his majesty the king's national reconciliation policy and the royal government as a whole may be shaken. Most analysts believe that the more serious the internal rift of the government or that of the two major parties in the coalition, the greater the gain made by the outlawed Khmer Rouge.
