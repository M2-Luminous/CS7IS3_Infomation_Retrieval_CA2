He said that in other aspects Russia's plans did not differ from the plan proposed by the CSCE Minsk group. Gukasyan said that during his recent meeting in Moscow with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev they failed to reach full agreement because the Karabakh side made a number of important remarks. However, according to the Karabakh minister, after the discussion of these remarks with the Russian ambassador at Large Vladimir Kazimirov, eventually they were taken into account. Gukasyan expressed hope that the discussion of Russia's plan with Kazimirov, who left for Yerevan on Friday and then will go to Stepanakert, would also be held in a constructive atmosphere. In the meantime, the press secretary of the Armenian president Aram Abramian said in an interview with Interfax that Armenia welcomes Russia's peaceful initiative.
