FR941012-2-00002 FR941012-2-00001 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE Bureau of the Census [Docket No. 940979&hyph;4279] Annual Trade Survey AGENCY: Bureau of the Census, Commerce. ACTION: Notice of determination. SUMMARY: In accordance with Title 13, United States Code, Sections 182, 224, and 225, I have determined the Census Bureau needs to collect data covering year-end inventories, annual sales, and purchases to provide a sound statistical basis for the formation of policy by various governmental agencies. These data also apply to a variety of public and business needs. This annual survey is a continuation of similar wholesale trade surveys conducted each year since 1978. It provides on a comparable classification basis annual sales and purchases for 1994 and inventories for 1993 and 1994. These data are not available publicly on a timely basis from nongovernmental or other governmental sources. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Nancy A. Piesto or Edward Murphy, Services Division, on (301) 763&hyph;3916. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Census Bureau is authorized to take surveys necessary to furnish current data on subjects covered by the major censuses authorized by Title 13, United States Code. This survey will provide continuing and timely national statistical data on 2 wholesale trade for the period between economic censuses. The 1992 Economic Censuses are currently being tabulated. The data collected in this survey will be within the general scope and nature of those inquiries covered in the economic censuses. The Census Bureau will require selected firms operating merchant wholesale establishments in the United States (with sales size determining the probability of selection) to report in the 1994 Annual Trade Survey. We will furnish report forms to the firms covered by this survey and will require their submission within thirty days after receipt. The sample will provide, with measurable reliability, statistics on the subjects specified above. This survey has been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget, in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act, Public Law 96&hyph;511, as amended, and was cleared under OMB Control No. 0607&hyph;0195. We will provide copies of the form upon written request to the Director, Bureau of the Census, Washington, D.C. 20233. Based upon the foregoing, I have directed that an annual survey be conducted for the purpose of collecting these data. Dated: October 5, 1994. Harry A. Scarr, Acting Director, Bureau of the Census.
