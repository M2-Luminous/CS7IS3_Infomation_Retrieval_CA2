Speaking in Cape Town, he said the ANC had nothing to hide and that everybody who was supposed to testify before the commission would do so. However, he added that he had said all that he needed to say in testimony to an internal ANC commission last year. Mr. Modise was among ANC leaders named in that report as having perpetrated or allowed human rights abuses in ANC detention camps in Angola. Mr. Modise's statement is a sequel to a request by nine former generals of the SADF [South African Defense Force] and the police that senior ANC members set an example by giving evidence before the truth commission. The group, including Freedom Front Leader Constand Viljoen, is demanding fairness toward all parties regarding past misdeeds.
