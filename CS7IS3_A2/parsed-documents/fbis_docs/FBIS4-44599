This is another breakthrough in research for shifting to domestic production of nuclear power equipment that follows China's successful development of nuclear power plant pressure vessel steel, no-leak safety valves, dual-channel neutron boron tables, and other achievements in our shift to domestic production of nuclear power plant equipment and it has major significance for China's achievement of a shift to domestic production of nuclear power equipment. The "O"-shaped sealing rings for reactor pressure vessels are one of the key components to ensure safe reactor operation. The difficulty of their development lies in the need for the sealing rings to ensure that no nuclear leaks occur under conditions of high-temperature and high-pressure intense irradiation, which places rather high requirements on their materials and technology. The S&T personnel of the China Nuclear Power Academy employed thick-walled tube casing and thick-walled spherical casing theory and used non-continuous analysis methods and iterative algorithms to successfully analyze the flange seal performance problems of reactor pressure vessels. Because they considered the coupling action of bolts, temperature, friction, and other areas, they achieved innovations and developments. The "O"-shaped sealing rings can be widely used as pressure vessel seals in nuclear power plants, reactors, and other power reactors such as nuclear submarine reactors, and they can be used as high-temperature and high-pressure vessel seals in the petrochemical and chemical industries, thermal power plants, and so on.
