Yankovskiy, Mozhayskiy Military Engineering Institute, St. Petersburg; UDC 519.6:681.3 .06] [Abstract] Dynamic knowledge is represented in terms of formulas for the temporal separation of events. Both textual and graphic descriptions of the formulas are given. The semantics of the formulas is described. A modification of the rule for SLD-resolution is the foundation for logical deduction using the formulas. Dynamic knowledge processing presents the opportunity to use semantics more flexibly by controlling deduction with dynamic formation of additional conditions limiting the combinatorial search of event elements. The recalculation of attributes is proposed as a way of controlling the search for a logical deduction. The state of the deduction is represented by a proof tree, and the values of node attributes can be recalculated by following different paths through the tree. The authors used Turbo Pascal to develop a prototype expert system of dynamic analys is using the principles presented in this article. Work is continuing on this project: the authors are creating a more flexible graphic user interface and a subsystem to automate the formation of dynamic knowledge bases.
