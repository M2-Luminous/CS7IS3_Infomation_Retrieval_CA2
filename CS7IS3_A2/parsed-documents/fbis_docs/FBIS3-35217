Praise be to God, who has guided us to this felicity, never could we have found guidance, had it not been for the guidance of God. [part of a Koranic verse] Blessed be this Ramadan. Blessed be this agreement, God willing, and blessed be your efforts. To begin, I am pleased and honored to thank, once again, our dear brother, His Majesty King Husayn Bin-Talal, and Jordan's leadership and beloved people. We in Yemen are honored that Amman would host this gathering and this blessed agreement, God willing, to start the new phase in Yemeni history that we sign here and continue there, in Yemen. Thank God, the agreement has been signed. Despite the wounds, the wound of the homeland is dearer and greater as far as we are concerned. Everything dear becomes worthless for the sake of Yemen. Our sincerity and seriousness will be tested tomorrow, when we return there. What is important in this agreement is our ability to implement it. Never mind. This time, in Yemen we had another kind of conflict, a dialogue with words. We ruled out the dialogue of bullets and the dialogue of violence. We appealed to national unanimity. We signed this document. And today, we say, after signing, that this is the document of the homeland, the document of national unanimity, and not the document of any one party. With the blessings of God, we will all join hands and work to implement it, despite our reservations, or feelings -- which are based on past experiences -- that there will be difficulties in implementing it. However, let us be optimistic. We must be optimistic all the time. From our people, we will find blessings. We will find support from all faithful people. This is the document of all faithful people. We hope we will succeed in taking it...[pauses] despite our pains. I now have a picture of martyr Majid, martyr Kamil, and martyr Hashim al-'Attas [Yemeni Socialist Party officials or relatives of party officials assassinated in Yemen], but Yemen is more precious than them all. We must place our country above all other considerations, above all personal considerations. We beseech God to grant us success. We will work seriously to move into implementation with all the faithful people. What is new today is not the coalition formula. What is new, with this national consensus document, is the formula of the larger- scale coalition, the national consensus that helped us reach this document. We think that now after this crisis -- and I stress the need to admit that it is a crisis in order to be able to address it, understand it well, and treat it, at the minimum level of the common denominators that we have reached. It is all right. With the blessings of God we march. But as a result of this crisis, awareness must be promoted about the issue of unity in Yemen and Arab unity in the future. From now on, we must use our minds to produce knowledge. We must also allow feelings their role. We are only human. With the blessings of God, time has caught us. It is Ramadan and the fast-breaking time is approaching. May God accept your fasting and bless your fast-breaking meal.
