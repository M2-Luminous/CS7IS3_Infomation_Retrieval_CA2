FR940627-0-00181 FR940627-0-00019 Semi-volatile organic compounds means that fraction of gaseous combustion emissions which consists of compounds with greater than twelve carbon atoms and can be trapped in sorbent polymer resins. Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS) means the 1372 second transient speed driving sequence used by EPA to simulate typical urban driving. The UDDS for light-duty vehicles is described in 40 CFR part 86, appendix I(a). Vapor phase means the gaseous fraction of combustion emissions. Vehicle classes/subclasses means the divisions of vehicle groups within a vehicle type, including light-duty vehicles, light-duty trucks, and heavy-duty vehicles as specified in 40 CFR part 86. Vehicle type means the divisions of motor vehicles according to combustion cycle and intended fuel class, including, but not necessarily limited to, Otto cycle gasoline-fueled vehicles, Otto cycle methanol-fueled vehicles, diesel cycle diesel-fueled vehicles, and diesel cycle methanol-fueled vehicles. Whole emissions means all components of unfiltered combustion emissions or evaporative emissions. §79.51 General requirements and provisions. (a) Overview of requirements. (1) All manufacturers of fuels and fuel additives that are designated for registration under this part are required to comply with the requirements of subpart F of this part either on an individual basis or as a participant in a group of manufacturers of the same or similar fuels and fuel additives, as defined in §79.56. If manufacturers elect to comply by participation in a group, each manufacturer continues to be individually subject to the requirements of subpart F of this part, and responsible for testing under this subpart. Each manufacturer, subject to the provisions for group applications in §79.51(b) and the special provisions in §79.58, shall submit all Tier 1 and Tier 2 information required by §§79.52, 79.53 and 79.59 for each fuel or additive, except that the Tier 1 emission characterization requirements in §79.52(b) and/or the Tier 2 testing requirements in §79.53 may be satisfied by adequate existing information pursuant to the Tier 1 literature search requirements in §79.52(d). The adequacy of existing information to serve in compliance with specific Tier 1 and/or Tier 2 requirements shall be determined according to the criteria and procedures specified in §§79.52(b) and 79.53 (c) and (d). In all cases, EPA reserves the right to require, based upon the information contained in the application or any other information available to the Agency, that manufacturers conduct additional testing of any fuel or additive (or fuel/additive group) if EPA determines that there is inadequate information upon which to base regulatory decisions for such product(s). In any case where EPA determines that the requirements of Tiers 1 and 2 have been satisfied but that further testing is required, the provisions of Tier 3 (§79.54) shall apply. (2) Laboratory facilities shall perform testing in compliance with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) requirements as those requirements apply to inhalation toxicology studies. All studies shall be monitored by the facilities' Quality Assurance units (as specified in §79.60). (b) Group Applications. Subject to the provisions of §79.56 (a) through (c), EPA will consider any testing requirements of this subpart to have been met for any fuel or fuel additive when a fuel or fuel additive which meets the criteria for inclusion in the same group as the subject fuel or fuel additive has met that testing requirement, provided that all fuels and additives must be individually registered as described in §79.59(b). For purposes of this subpart, a determination of which group contains a particular fuel or additive will be made pursuant to the provisions of §79.56 (d) and (e). Nothing in this subsection (b) shall be deemed to require a manufacturer to rely on another manufacturer's testing. (c) Application Procedures and Dates. Each application submitted in compliance with this subpart shall be signed by the manufacturer of the designated fuel or additive, or by the manufacturer's agent, and shall be submitted to the address and in the format prescribed in §79.59. A manufacturer who chooses to comply as part of a group pursuant to §79.56 shall be covered by the group's joint application. Subject to any modifications pursuant to the special provisions in §§79.51(f) or 79.58, the schedule for compliance with the requirements of this subpart is as follows: (1) Fuels and fuel additives with existing registrations. (i) The manufacturer of a fuel or fuel additive product which, pursuant to subpart B or C of this part, is registered as of May 27, 1994 must submit the additional basic registration data specified in §79.59(b) before November 28, 1994. (ii) For these products, the manufacturer must also satisfy the requirements and time schedules in either of the following paragraphs (c)(1)(ii) (A) or (B) of this section: (A) Within May 27, 1997, all applicable Tier 1 and Tier 2 requirements must be submitted to EPA, pursuant to §§79.52, 79.53, and 79.59; or (B) Within May 27, 1997, all applicable Tier 1 requirements (pursuant to §§79.52 and 79.59), plus evidence of a contract with a qualified laboratory (or other suitable arrangement) for completion of all applicable Tier 2 requirements, must be submitted to EPA. For this purpose, a qualified laboratory is one which can demonstrate the capabilities and credentials specified in §79.53(c)(1). In addition, within May 26, 2000, all applicable Tier 2 requirements (pursuant to §§79.53 and 79.59) must be submitted to EPA.
