Law Has Not Been Passed"] [Text] The State Duma's second reading of the draft law on combating corruption opened with a report by Security Committee Chairman Viktor Ilyukhin. He reported that the committee examined 145 amendments and that the final text of the document had been toned down. The approach to bribe-takers has been made differentiated: An official holding an especially senior position shall be liable for any bribe, an average-ranking official shall be liable beginning with a major bribe, while a non-official person (director of a commercial store) shall be liable for a considerable bribe. One may suppose that a rank-and-file non-official (a cleaning woman, for example) shall be liable only for receiving a bribe on an especially big scale. Earlier, the deputies could not receive money for creative or teaching work; now they can. Because the country's system of payment is poorly developed, the ban on paying for big transactions through the bank or by credit cards has been lifted. Finally, only officials shall be obliged to declare their incomes. In additions to those amendments that the Security Committee has approved, it has begun discussing those to which it objected. Deputy Pokhmelkin of the "Russia's Choice," for example, proposed several amendments aimed at excluding from among those designated as "officials" those unrelated to public service, that is to say, at excluding one of the main goals of the draft law (government control over private businesses). Deputy Tarasov suggested that categories of liability should be strictly defined so that the head of a commercial organization would be liable under the proposed law only to the extent of the powers delegated to him by the authorities. Even Deputy Baburin agreed with the opinion of his fellow deputies, noting that one cannot infinitely expand the notion of corruption. To the joy of Mr. Ilyukhin, not a single amendment proposed from the various flanks of the political spectrum was approved. The discussion itself was extremely incomprehensive, disorderly, and wild because of both the deputies' extreme, disparate postures, and because Valentin Kovalev, a less experienced deputy speaker, was sitting in for Speaker Ivan Rybkin. As a result, Mr. Baburin's call -- "the best answer by the Duma to the Edict on Combating Banditry is a law on combating corruption" -- so far remains unheeded by his fellow deputies, and the discussion will continue on 22 June.
