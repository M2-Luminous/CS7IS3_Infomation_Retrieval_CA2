"For the losses I take ful] responsibility. It is the most honourable thing to do," he said in a press conference here after presenting the Bank Negara Annual Report 1993. Asked if in accepting responsibility he will resign Jaffar said: "If there is a move in that direction, you (the media) will be the third to know after the Prime Minister and the Finance Minister." He also said: "Others down the line will also be held accountable, some have already resigned." Asked to explain the absence of Nor Mohamed Yakcop, adviser and the man in charge of the foreign exchange dealings, at this year's press conference, Jaffar said: "He has gone on long leave." The Governor made it clear that "there was no fraud" in the loss suffered by the Central Bank. Despite a total loss of RM6.4 billion, including a loss of RM700 million in its ordinary operations, the Central Bank's balance sheet remained strong and the national financial strength was not affected. Total assets of the Central Bank increased by 68 per cent to exceed, for the first time, RM100 billion at the end of 1993. Foreign reserves increased sharply over the last year to RM76.4 billion which is sufficient to finance about eight months of retained imports and 1 1/2 times the size of the country's external debt. Equally impressive was the growth of the economy. Gross Domestic Product [GDP] grew by 8.5 per cent which means an average growth rate of almost nine per cent for the last six years. The buoyant growth was achieved on the back of an inflation rate below four per cent. The Consumer Price Index [CPI] moderated to 3.6 per cent, compared to 4.7 per cent in 1992. The forecast for 1994 is a high 8.4 per cent GDP growth provided costs, especially wages, can be controlled. He said the Central Bank took forward positions in currencies like the US dollar, deutschmark, and the yen. The rates, however, did not move as anticipated by the bank, causing it to suffer losses. This is the second year the Central Bank has incurred losses in the foreign exchange market. It lost RM9 billion in 1992 though it was described as "loss on paper". "The Central Bank has to deal in foreign exchange be cause of the need to maintain liquidity in other currencies for trade purposes,' he said. "In hindsight it is apparent that we made the wrong decisions (buying into forward or long-term positions) but we had to act the way we did. If we did not take any action the loss might have been even more than RM5.7 billion. "The loss will be written off against the Central Bank's future profits," he said, admitting that "it would take time." The Central Bank will continue to deal in foreign exchange but "only at spot prices" that is buying and selling as and when the need for that particular currency arises. Jaffar said the prospect of strong economic growth this year was bright. If Malaysian businessmen continue to maintain and hopefully improve their competitive edge and consumers spend wisely Malaysians could easily look forward to yet another year of rapid growth exceeding eight per cent," Jaffar said in his introductory remarks. Despite the inflationary pressures of the first month of 1994 when seasonal and festive consumer spending prodded the CPI by four per cent, Jaffar said the Government will put into place measures to ensure that inflation does not move beyond four per cent this year. The manufacturing sector has been the main source of economic growth for the past seven years, contributing no less than 30.1 per cent to the GDP in 1993. Indeed it will continue to be the Iynchpin of the economy. The Federal Government achieved a remarkable financial performance last year when it recorded its first overall budget surplus since 1960. The local stock market saw a record-breaking performance in terms of prices, turnover and market capitalisation. Trading on the Kuala Stock Exchange [KLSE] in 1593 alone exceeded the amount of total trade undertaken during the past 20 years in terms of both turnover (107.8 billion units) and value (RM387.3 billion). From 1973 to 1992, the total volume recorded on the KLSE was a mere 82 million units valued at RM197 million. In 1993, the KLSE emerged as the largest bourse in Asean and the fourth largest in Asia in terms of market capitalisation after Tokyo, Osaka and Hong Kong. The bank system displayed the best performance on record last year, with pre-tax profit of the banks reaching almost RM4 billion.
