ACTION: Closure. SUMMARY: NMFS is closing the directed fishery for Pacific cod by vessels using trawl gear in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Management Area (BSAI). This action is necessary because the 1994 prohibited species bycatch mortality allowance of Pacific halibut specified for the trawl Pacific cod fishery in the BSAI has been reached. EFFECTIVE DATES: 12 noon, Alaska local time (A.l.t.), May 7, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Andrew N. Smoker, Senior Inseason Manager, Fisheries Management Division, NMFS, (907) 586&hyph;7228. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The groundfish fishery in the BSAI exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the Fishery Management Plan for the Groundfish Fishery of the BSAI (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 675. The 1994 Pacific halibut bycatch mortality allowance for the trawl Pacific cod fishery, which is defined at ยง675.21(b)(1)(iii)(E), is 1,200 metric tons (59 FR 7656, February 16, 1994). The Director of the Alaska Region, NMFS, has determined, in accordance with ยง675.21(c)(1)(iv), that the Pacific halibut bycatch mortality allowance for the trawl Pacific cod fishery has been reached. Therefore, NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for Pacific cod by vessels using trawl gear in the BSAI from 12 noon, A.l.t., May 7, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994. Directed fishing standards for applicable gear types may be found in the regulations at ยง675.20(h). Classification This action is taken under ยง675.21 and is exempt from OMB review under E.O. 12866.
