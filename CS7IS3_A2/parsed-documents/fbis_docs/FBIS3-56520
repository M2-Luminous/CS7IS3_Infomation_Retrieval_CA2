In Andrejevs' opinion, this is witnessed by Russia's reaction to the Jan. 10 incident in Riga when the arrest of two generals led to Russian troops stationed in Latvia being put on standby. Andrejevs said the situation was critical, and that Russia gave a vivid demonstration of which methods it plans to use in an incident that could be solved through diplomatic channels. The minister met yesterday with members of a CSCE mission to Latvia who were interested in how a country in a situation similar to the Jan. 10 incident can be helped. Andrejevs said that Russia's consent is needed so that international observers could attend the handover of Russian military facilities to Latvia. [passage omitted]
