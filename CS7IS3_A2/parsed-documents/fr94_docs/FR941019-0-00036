FR941019-0-00036 FR941019-0-00004 (B) During the marketing period, a qualifying multifamily purchaser also may submit an expression of serious interest in a bulk package of its own choice accompanied by a list of eligible multifamily properties. (ii) Notice of Readiness for Sale. At the end of the marketing period, the RTC shall send a Notice of Readiness for Sale to each qualifying multifamily purchaser who expressed serious interest in making a bulk purchase. The notice will identify the properties in the bulk sale package and will outline the minimum terms and conditions for the sale of the properties in the bulk sale package. The RTC will consider the expressions of serious interest, but reserves the right to determine the final composition of the bulk sale package. (iii) Bona fide offer. Within 45 days, or such other time period as RTC may determine, of receipt of the Notice of Readiness for Sale, a qualifying multifamily purchaser may submit a bona fide purchase offer for the bulk sale package which conforms to the terms and conditions set forth in the Notice of Readiness for Sale. A qualifying multifamily purchaser, in its discretion, may submit both individual and bulk purchase offers for each multifamily property for which the RTC received an expression of serious interest from a purchaser interested in an individual sale. The offers shall be in conformance with the requirements in paragraph (b)(7) of this section. (iv) All other restrictions on the sale of eligible multifamily property shall apply to bulk sales of eligible multifamily property. Properties purchased in a bulk sale shall be subject to the lower-income occupancy requirements applicable to properties purchased in a single transaction, as such terms are defined in §1609.2 of this part. (v) At any time during the marketing period for a bulk package of eligible multifamily properties, a qualifying multifamily purchaser may submit to the RTC a notice of serious interest with respect to any single eligible multifamily property within the bulk package, and the RTC may determine to sell such eligible multifamily property to a qualifying multifamily purchaser. (12) Sale to other purchasers. If the RTC does not receive an expression of serious interest with respect to an eligible multifamily property during the marketing period, or does not receive a bona fide offer for such a property within the period following the date of receipt of a Notice of Readiness for Sale, the RTC may sell the property, individually or in combination with other properties, to any purchaser(s). (c) Eligible condominium property_ (1) Notice of Marketing Period. (i) Subject to the exercise by the RTC of its authority under §§1609.9 and 1609.11 of this part, the RTC shall send a Notice of Marketing Period to clearinghouses when an eligible condominium property is ready for marketing to qualifying condominium purchasers. The Notice shall be transmitted by certified mail or any other means of communication with date and time confirmation. (ii) The Notice shall specify a date that begins the marketing period and shall state that the marketing period ends 180 days, or such other time period as may be applicable, after such date. (iii) The Notice shall state whether the eligible condominium property is offered for sale individually or in bulk. (iv) The property listing accompanying the Notice shall contain basic information about the property and such other information as the RTC may determine to be useful. (v) The RTC shall allow qualifying condominium purchasers reasonable access to eligible properties for purposes of inspection. (2) Marketing eligible condominium properties. Prior to listing an eligible condominium property with a clearinghouse, the RTC, in its sole discretion, will determine whether to offer the property for sale individually or as part of a bulk sale package of multiple eligible condominium properties. Subject to paragraph (c)(4)(vii) of this section, the composition of a bulk sale package will be determined solely by the RTC prior to listing the properties with a clearinghouse. Properties listed for sale on an individual basis will be available for purchase by qualifying households only. Properties listed as part of a bulk sale package may be purchased by nonprofit organizations, public agencies or for-profit entities. After 90 days of marketing, properties listed for individual sales may be relisted as part of a bulk sale package for the remaining 90 days.
