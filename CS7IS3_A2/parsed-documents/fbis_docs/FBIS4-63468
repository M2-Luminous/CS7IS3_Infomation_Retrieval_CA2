Sergey Golovaty, for one, said during his appearance on national television on Sunday that "the president of Ukraine has shown indecision with regard to the leadership of the autonomous republic. We are now in a state where Leonid Kravchuk is no longer able to do anything because he is three years late. Any actions of his can now exacerbate the situation even more." Sergey Golovaty said the only way out of the situation consists in "bringing all the latest decrees and resolutions of the parliament and the president of the Crimea in line with Ukraine's legislation." Former vice-premier, Igor Yukhnovsky, stressed that "Ukraine cannot do without the Crimea and will do everything possible to preserve its territorial integrity." Some other parliament members called for direct presidential rule in the Crimea.
