FR940830-1-00096 FR940830-1-00014 III. Operation and Maintenance Manuals for Vessels A. The operation and maintenance manual for vessels consists of three parts: 1. Waste transfer procedures; 2. Waste clean up procedures; and 3. Waste deposit reporting procedures. B. The first part of the operation and maintenance manual shall identify the measures that you will take to minimize the deposit of waste into coastal waters during transport and transfer activities. In the operation and maintenance manual you should (ยง237.5(d)(ii)): 1. Describe the roles and responsibilities of each relevant member of the crew during waste transfer and transport. 2. Provide a detailed step-wise description to the vessel crew on the implementation of the technologies and techniques that will be employed during waste transfer and transport. These should include appropriate containment or diversionary structures, or other equipment designed to minimize waste deposits. The technologies and techniques described shall be appropriate to the size and nature of the vessel and must represent a responsible effort to minimize the spillage of waste. 3. Instruct the crew to secure the waste in such a way as to prevent the deposit of waste. 4. Direct the crew not to load the vessel in excess of its capacity. 5. Direct the crew that all ports and valves that may be used for flushing or discharging waste or waste residue from the hull or tanks must be clearly labelled and that all ports and valves must be sealed except for the purpose of transferring wastes. 6. Describe record keeping procedures, i.e. record of amount and type of waste offloaded, or amount and type of waste received. C. The second part of the operation and maintenance manual describes for the vessel crew the procedures that will be used to clean up, promptly and thoroughly, any waste deposited into coastal waters (ยง237.5(a)(1)(iv)). This section must: 1. Describe the role and responsibilities of each relevant member of the crew during cleanup. 2. Describe in detail for the crew the techniques and technologies that will be employed during waste cleanup. The technologies or techniques must be appropriate to the waste type and the size and nature of the vessel and must represent a responsible effort to clean up all waste promptly and thoroughly. D. In the third part of the operation and maintenance manual describe the procedures to be followed if the vessel's crew is unable to clean up all of the waste deposited. In this section you must: 1. Provide a contact name and telephone number of the designated responsible person (see section 237.5) involved in the ownership or operation of the vessel. Indicate that this contact person should be notified immediately by telephone, marine radio if the crew is unable to completely clean up the waste deposited. This contact name and phone number and the number of the USCG NRC must be posted on the vessel in a location visible to the vessel's crew. 2. Provide the telephone number of the USCG NRC to be called by the responsible person if the crew is unable to completely clean up the waste deposited. 3. Provide an example of a followup letter to be used by the responsible person to report the waste deposit to the USCG NRC. 4. Provide copies of the form that assists record-keeping and reporting in the event of a waste deposit. The operation and maintenance manual must instruct the appropriate crew member to complete one of these forms for each deposit of waste. The record must include the time and date of the deposit, estimates of the amount of wastes deposited and amount retrieved, actions taken to clean up the waste deposit, and any other pertinent information. If an action was not accomplished or successful, it is important to document why those actions were taken. Any actions to prevent further incidents of this type should also be recorded. All waste deposits must be recorded, whether cleaned up or not. IV. Operation and Maintenance Manuals for Waste Sources and Receiving Facilities A. The operation and maintenance manual for waste sources and receiving facilities consists of three parts: waste transfer procedures, waste cleanup procedures, and waste deposit reporting procedures. B. The first part of the operation and maintenance manual must identify the measures that you will take to prevent the deposit of waste into coastal waters during the transfer of wastes (ยง237.4(e)(1)). In the operation and maintenance manual you must: 1. Describe the roles and responsibilities of each relevant facility staff member during waste transfer. 2. Provide a detailed step-wise description to relevant employees on the implementation of technologies and techniques that will be employed during waste transfer. These should include appropriate containment or diversionary structures, or other equipment designed to minimize waste deposits. The technologies or techniques described must be appropriate to the waste type and size and nature of the vessels loaded/unloaded, and represent a responsible effort to minimize the deposit of wastes. 3. Describe record keeping procedures, i.e record of amount and type of waste offloaded, or amount and type of waste received. C. The second part of the operation and maintenance manual describes for your employees the procedures that will be used to clean up, promptly and thoroughly, any waste deposited into coastal waters. This section must: 1. Describe the roles and responsibilities of each relevant employee during waste cleanup. 2. Describe in detail how to implement the techniques and technologies that will be employed during waste cleanup. The technologies and techniques used must be appropriate to the waste type and size and nature of the vessels, and must represent a responsible effort to clean up all waste promptly and thoroughly. The methods described may include sweeper boats, manned boats to remove waste, shoreline cleanup crews, and booms or other equipment designed to recover waste deposited near shore. 3. Specify that cleanup equipment and personnel be in continuous operation, or on standby at the transfer facility for waste transfer operations that occur during an ebb tide. 4. Direct all employees that all waste that clearly resulted from, or may have resulted from, waste loading or unloading operations shall be removed prior to the first high tide following the completion of any waste transfer operation or before the waste has had a chance to disperse. D. The third part of the operation and maintenance manual describes the procedures to be followed if the facility's staff is unable to clean up all of the waste deposited. This section must: 1. Provide a contact name and telephone number of the designated responsible person (ยง237.4) involved in the ownership or operation of the facility. Indicate that this contact person should be notified immediately by telephone or in writing if the employees are unable to completely clean up the waste deposit. This contact name and phone number must be posted at the facility in a location visible to the facility's employees. 2. Provide the telephone number of the USCG NRC to be called if the employees are unable to completely clean up the deposit. This telephone number must also be posted at the facility in a location visible to the facility's employees.
