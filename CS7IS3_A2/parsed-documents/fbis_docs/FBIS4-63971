NATO's Partnership for Peace program also has a part to play in this process." This was stated in Brussels today by Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev addressing a meeting of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council [NACC] at the defense minister level. Twenty-five states, including NATO countries and states of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, belong to this organization. However, he said that this program "is not a comprehensive answer to the realities of the new era." It is merely the first step toward the emergence of a fundamentally new strategic community of allies working for peace and security. Russia, the minister stressed, is interested in a broader relationship with NATO, one which would be in keeping with its weight and position in the system of international ties. We are not claiming any privileged status, he explained. The issue at stake is the nature of the partnership itself. The states of both West and East ought to have an equal interest in deepening it. Today the Russian side presented NATO with a document containing the parameters of Russia's involvement in the implementation of Partnership for Peace. At the same time, Russia proposes that a start be made on preparations for a large-scale program of cooperation between Russia and NATO, based on these parameters, and that a framework document be signed once these preparations are complete. In the political sphere Russia proposes the establishment of an effective mechanism for mutual consultations on the entire range of problems involving European and world security. This would function both on a regular basis and in emergencies. This mechanism would be a practical step toward a future system of collective security and stability in Europe under the aegis of the CSCE. In the military sphere, Russia is ready to develop cooperation with the alliance and its partners in such areas as the coordination of joint military activity, peacekeeping, transparency in the field of military planning and military activities, and training of personnel. It also expects to strike up a partnership in other areas as well, such as disarmament and arms control, conversion, non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and environmental protection. Commenting on this document, P.Grachev stressed that the Russian Federation advocates the creation of a qualitatively new system of international security, above all in Europe. In contemporary circumstances, the inevitable contradictions between the national interests of various states -- contradictions that used to be eased by the rigors of bloc discipline -- have come to the foreground. Therefore, it is essential to spot these differences in time and prevent them from becoming factors of military danger or threat. There are several stumbling blocks hampering the organization of genuinely equitable bilateral cooperation with NATO, P.Grachev went on to say. Specific forms and means of securing cooperation in the sphere of military technology have not been defined. This could bring about a fresh escalation of the arms race. A mechanism of cooperation between Russia and NATO in crisis situations needs to be worked out. Russia's position, the minister said, is that the strengthening of anti-crisis mechanisms should proceed on an all-European scale through speeding up the transformation of the CSCE into an authoritative, fully-fledged political structure. In the process, the NACC must become an independent body -- though with close CSCE links -- working for all-European military-political cooperation and prevention and settlement of crisis situations and armed conflicts. In due course the NACC could become the military component of a future bloc-free system of European security. The CSCE and the NACC could exercise constant supervision and coordination of the efforts of the WEU, the EU [European Union], and the CIS in the sphere of strengthening cooperation and mutual security. P. Grachev declared that Russia did not intend to use the Collective Security Treaty (CST) concluded in Tashkent between the CIS countries as an instrument of confrontation with Europe or Asia, let alone turn it into a closed military bloc.
