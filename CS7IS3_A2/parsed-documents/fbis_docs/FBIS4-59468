They pointed out that Christopher's recent visit to Syria "carried a proposal on gradual Israeli withdrawal from the Golan (Majdal Shams First), but Syria did not accept it. But the discussions which have taken place may enable him in his upcoming visit to prepare suitable ideas and proposals regarding practical measures. In that case, Syria will be willing to engage in better discussions with him, in a manner leading to the required progress on this track." The Japanese officials added: "It seems it is a matter of time as to when give and take will begin between Syria and Israel." [passage omitted] An authoritative [Japanese] Foreign Ministry source, who asked to remain anonymous, said: "Israeli prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin expressed to us his wish to convey his view to Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad in connection with bilateral negotiations between the two countries, his conception of peace between them, the regional need for peace, and the need to push Syria to take further steps in these negotiations and to participate in the multilaterals. We conveyed the message to the Syrians. And the Syrians gave their answers to the Israelis' questions we conveyed to them. But they also wanted us -- so it seems -- to convey their message and position to the Americans." [passage omitted] The source added: "Rabin believes that Syria is not serious in seeking peace, and he wants it to join him. The Syrians are not far from saying that the time has come to focus on the Syrian track. They rejected the Israeli proposals talking of withdrawing first from one area of the Golan. And their reply to the specific questions the Japanese delegation conveyed to Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' about acceptable proposals regarding the timetable for withdrawal from the Golan was: The Israelis occupied the Golan Heights in six days...the withdrawal can be completed in the same period." The source pointed out that al-Shar' told the Japanese delegation that "it took Israel less than two years to complete the withdrawal from the Sinai desert, which is much larger than the Golan." He was commenting on Israel's talk of a phased withdrawal from the Golan over eight years. The Japanese source said that "while Rabin believes Syria is unwilling to conduct a serious and detailed discussion of the issues of peace, environment, and economic cooperation in the framework of the multilaterals, the Syrian side responded cautiously to Tokyo's encouragement to join the negotiations. President al-Asad said he is not against them, but Syria will participate in them only when or after progress has been made in the bilaterals -- progress that is practical and clear." The source believes that "the Syrian position is tactical. President al-Asad is fully aware that the time has come to make a decision, and that the historic moment for peace emerged when he informed U.S. President Bill Clinton at the Geneva summit of his willingness to establish normal peaceful relations with Israel. But he wants a high price for that. He knows that Rabin is willing to relinquish all the Golan gradually and to demilitarize the border. But he wants more than what Rabin is proposing. Maybe he wants clear guarantees."
