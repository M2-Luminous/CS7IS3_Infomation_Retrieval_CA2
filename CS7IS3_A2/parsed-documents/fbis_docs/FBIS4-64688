Mr Justice Potts gave his lawyers leave to seek a judicial review, saying there was "an arguable case". But the judge added: "You will appreciate the result may well be that you succeed -- equally it may well be that you fail." With the pressure group Liberty acting as his solicitors, Mr Adams is seeking to overturn the exclusion order made against him last October under the Prevention of Terrorism Act 1989. He will also challenge the legality, under European and domestic law, of the subsequent decision by Mr Michael Howard, the Home Secretary, not to revoke the order in January. Yesterday's application for a review was unopposed by Mr Howard. The judge ordered an urgent hearing of the case because of the "points of public importance" raised. Mr Robin Allen, appearing for Mr Adams, told the court that the Sinn Fein leader only wanted to pay a brief visit to England to discuss the political situation in Ulster with MPs, at the invitation of Mr Tony Benn, the Labour MP. Mr Allen accused Mr Howard of "taking a sledgehammer to crack a small nut". Mr Adams was first excluded from mainland Britain under an order made in 1982. It was lifted the following year when he was elected MP for West Belfast but reimposed last year after an election defeat. The Government action was illegal, Mr Allen argued, under European laws which guaranteed citizens freedom of movement and freedom of expression. The case marked the first time the English courts had had to deal with the concept of European Union citizenship, which had come in for criticism in the country because it created a kind of federalism and "a citizenship which transcends national citizenship". As an Irish national, and therefore a citizen of a European member state' Mr Adams had the right to move freely within the UK, unless restrictions were properly authorised under the Treaty of Rome, as amended by the Maastricht Treaty. There were no such restrictions, Mr Allen said. The European citizen's rights enjoyed by Mr Adams were in a "superior class" and "trumped" the Home Secretary's right to make orders under the domestic anti-terrorism laws. At the heart of the case was the question of freedom of expression. All Mr Adams wanted to do was to attend a meeting at a date to be fixed at the Houses of Parliament to discuss the political situation in Northern Ireland. "Mr Adams says that however much he may be reviled by politicians in this country he is a person who ought to have the right to freedom of expression under Community law." The Home Secretary had in the past allowed persons subject to exclusion orders to attend court and give evidence in England. "Just as evidence in a court is an essential part of the democratic process, engaging in political dialogue in one meeting is also an essential and important part of the political and democratic process," Mr Allen said. He said there was also a possibility of the case being referred to the European Court of Justice, which would add a two-year delay to the judicial process. A Downing Street spokesman said later: "The Government's policy has not changed at all. We will have to see how the process of the judicial review comes out."
