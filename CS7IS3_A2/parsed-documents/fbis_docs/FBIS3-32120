Progressive Party President Alvaro Dias (Parana State) said the government "makes too many mistakes, and is clumsy." In a conciliatory manner, Tarcisio Delgado (Minas Gerais State), PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] leader in the Chamber of Deputies, agreed with President Franco, admitting that the traditional absence of congressmen in Brasilia on Thursdays represents a problem he has been trying to solve: "We are going through a very serious crisis, and the economic plan should be fully supported by the Congress," he said. [passage omitted] Bahia Governor Antonio Carlos Magalhaes, who was charged with hindering the voting, said Franco's attitude against a weakened Congress was cowardly: "It is cowardly to threaten Congress. Realizing that Congress is weakened, Franco wants to force it to approve a tax increase. What he doesn't realize is that he is as weak, or weaker, than Congress," Magalhaes said. Refuting Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso's remarks about breaking an accord for the approval of a tax increase, Magalhaes said: "I had no agreement with him. From the beginning I made it clear that I was against increasing taxes," Magalhaes said. He added that the Congress overcame its fragility by voting against the government's proposal to increase taxes to be collected from enterprises. He pointed out that Congress is not responsible for the tax increase to be paid by individuals, because it was proposed by the government: "Cardoso cannot continue fooling the country with his stewardess smile. I would like to challenge him to a television debate," the governor said. In Magalhaes' opinion, the government presented a plan based only on tax increases. It did not propose any measure to hurt the interests of the financial system or the oligopolies. The Bahia State governor believes that these two sectors of the economy would not be affected by an increase in taxes paid on enterprises' profits, because the companies would cover this difference by increasing prices, the consumers would end up paying for it. Magalhaes remarked caustically: "Franco is a fool." Federal Deputy Delfim Netto (Progressive Renewal Party -- Sao Paulo) said on 29 January that Franco should send a copy of the letter he handed to the presidents of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate to each one of the 75 congressmen of the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] and PMDB who did not appear at Congress last Thursday, 27 January, to vote on the increase in the enterprises' income tax. Referring to the last part of President Franco's letter calling for congressional support, Delfim Netto asserted that the country is not ungovernable: All the president must do is govern. The country has been waiting for that. Everything else is empty talk and seeks to justify what is not functioning. The country's governability depends solely on him.
