FR941220-1-00029 FR941220-1-00009 1. Health Effects The available information on the health effects of sulfate was fully described in the July 25, 1990 (55 FR 30370) Phase V proposal. Studies mentioned in that notice are summarized in the Health Criteria Document for Sulfate (US EPA, 1992), which is available for review and comment in the docket for this rulemaking. Since that time, EPA has funded additional studies on humans and piglets which are currently under review. In the July 25, 1990 notice, EPA stated that there was no evidence of adverse health effects in animals or humans from chronic exposure to sulfate in drinking water. The available health data indicate that chronic exposure to sulfate is not harmful to health. The acute effects noted from exposure to high levels of sulfate range from soft stools to diarrhea. Infants may be more sensitive to sulfate than healthy adults. Infants consume more water and food on a body weight basis than adults, and consequently ingest a higher dose of sulfate (per body weight) in drinking high-sulfate water than do adults. In infants, the greatest risk is from dehydration and electrolyte imbalance that may result from diarrhea. This effect can be fatal if untreated. It has been questioned whether the concentration of sulfate found in drinking water would cause significant dehydration in infants or adults. Schild (1980) reported that eight grams of sulfate retain 120 milliliters of water in the intestine. In this case, an adult drinking two liters of water containing 1500 milligrams of sulfate per liter would ingest three grams of sulfate and retain 45 milliliters of water in the intestine. The Agency is requesting any scientific data which would support or refute the hypothesis that this decrease in available water is likely to cause dehydration and electrolyte imbalance in adults or infants. There are three documented case histories of infants, 5 to 12 months old, who were given formulas prepared with water containing 630 to 1,150 mg/L of sulfate (Chien, et al., 1968). These infants developed diarrhea shortly after they ingested the formula, but the effect subsided after use of the high sulfate water was discontinued. Cole (1992) evaluated this study and concluded that neither the potential effects of osmolarity, specifically hyperosmolarity, nor viral gastroenteritis had been considered as possible causes of the observed diarrhea. Thus, Cole suggested and the Agency agrees that the Chien study provides qualitative evidence of the effects of sulfate but should not be used quantitatively in a sulfate risk assessment. Similar effects have been observed in adults, but individuals seem to become acclimated to high sulfate levels in a short period of time, with a cessation of all ill effects. The laxative effect of sulfate is well-known. Peterson (1951) compiled the results of questionnaires sent to North Dakota residents and concluded that ``waters with 600 to 750 ppm sulfates should be looked upon with suspicion as they may or may not be laxative. Over 750 ppm sulfates is generally a laxative water and below 600 ppm sulfates should be considered safe.'' Moore (1952) replotted the Peterson data and found that as sulfate concentrations increased from 500 to 1000 mg/L, the number of adults reporting laxative effects also increased. At concentrations of sulfate above 1,000 mg/L, the majority of respondents noted a laxative effect. While it is not known how long is needed to achieve acclimation in adults or infants, EPA scientists believe the time to be approximately two weeks, based on mucosal cell turnover rate in the intestines. The Agency is using these studies to support the MCLG, although each has limitations. For example, in the Peterson (1951) study, there is no information available on the chemical composition or the microbiological quality of the water, nor on the length of time that people drank the water.
