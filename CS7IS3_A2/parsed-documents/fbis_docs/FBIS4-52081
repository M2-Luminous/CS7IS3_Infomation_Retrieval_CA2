FBIS4-52081 "dreas088_m_94005" FBIS-EAS-94-088 Daily Report 6 May 1994 Thailand Reports on Reactions to U.S. Drug Probe Continue Reports on Reactions to U.S. Drug Probe Continue Police Chief Comments BK0605051494 Bangkok THE NATION in English 6 May 94 p A2 BK0605051494 Bangkok THE NATION English BFN [Text] Police cannot take legal action against MP Thanong Siriprichaphong, who has been accused by a US court of smuggling drugs into the United States, because the charges were brought against him outside Thailand, police chief Prathin Santipraphop said yesterday. Pol Gen [Police General] Prathin said police had not yet been briefed by US officials and could not act at this stage. On Wednesday, the US Embassy in Bangkok said in a statement that Thanong (Chat Thai-Nakhon Phanom) had been involved in successful and foiled attempts to smuggle more than 45 metric tons of marijuana into the country. Thanong allegedly received about $10 million from drug trafficking between 1977 and 1987. His assets in the United States have been seized by a US court order, according to the statement. Prathin said there was no automatic requirement for Thanong's extradition to the States. If it was requested by the US government, police would have to carefully consider how the law here applied to the case. Thai police may be able to oversee the case themselves, Prathin said. It would be up to Parliament to approve Thanong's arrest if a warrant was issued. An MP cannot be arrested during a parliamentary session without the approval of Parliament. Asked why police had taken no action against Thanong, even though he had long been a suspect, Prathin said police must be careful not to violate personal rights. Police could make an arrest only when they had substantive evidence, he said. Police have lists of probable criminals and "influential" people, but they could not reveal them.
