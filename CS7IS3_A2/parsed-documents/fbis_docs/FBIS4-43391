At least, not for the present. This, because it would be a mistake to continue along the path of the past: "Another missed opportunity." This was said by Massimo Cacciari. According to the philosopher and mayor of Venice, the PDS must first hold a great convention of nonconfessional voters and the Catholic Left to prepare for the establishment of a new "left-wing democratic coalition." Only after that, in October, should the party congress elect a new secretary, on the basis of an "original" program and a "clear and precise" political proposal. Meanwhile, the PDS would be administered by a "committee of guarantors" comprising D'Alema, Veltroni, Bassolino, and Vitali -- all potential secretaries -- and presided over by Napolitano or Trentin. Cacciari is not running either for the secretaryship of the PDS ("I do not even hold a membership card") or for the leadership of the future left-wing coalition. But he is willing to make his own "contribution," within the time limits imposed on him. "I work 12 hours a day for 4 million lire a month as mayor of Venice...." His office, on the first floor of Ca Farsetti on the Grand Canal, is full of faxes arriving from all over Italy, many from PDS members. Some people are insulting him because of his criticism of [outgoing PDS Secretary] Occhetto ("this is your last warning; stop it, or things will turn ugly"), while others grant him their unconditional approval. "I have some respect for Occhetto and for what he has done," Cacciari said. "The decision to change the name and the face of the PCI [Italian Communist Party] was a historic and important one, albeit belated, necessitated by events but conducted in line with continuity with the past, with the old apparatuses." [Bianchin] But you described him as a loser.... [Cacciari] Why not? Who won? It was a fact that he would lose, and that the PDS was not proceeding quickly enough. Mine was a political criticism, not a personal attack. [Bianchin] What about his resignation ? [Cacciari] It permits the start of a phase--in preparation for the congress--within the PDS and a new phase for the entire Italian Left. This is good; but Occhetto was not the problem. The main problem remains the strategy that the PDS lacked, and still lacks, and that the Left as a whole -- and I say the Left, in a manner of speaking -- lacked, and still lacks. [Bianchin] Why should the PDS not elect a new secretary right away? [Cacciari] Because that would change nothing with respect to the past, irrespective of who is chosen. I am saying that a proper congress must be held for the entire progressive alignment, and every effort must be made to involve not only the nonconfessional Left but also the Catholic and European Left. The purpose of the congress would be to discuss the status of the Left and to devise a final option for federalism. It should be a great opportunity for debate, which is what the PDS wants, but it should involve the rest on an equal footing. This decision must be made very promptly, by the end of July, so as finally put an end to all the complaining, the attacks on the government, and boorish, affected antifascism. [Bianchin] So no secretary for the time being? [Cacciari] It would be a bad thing and counterproductive. It would mean electing a secretary just for the sake of doing so. He would be merely the secretary of the old PDS, even if he were God almighty. After all, there is no hurry, just a few months, there is the summer.... The party can be led by a committee of guarantors who will organize the convention and set the pre-congress machinery in motion so as to hold a congress in October, to discuss the result of the convention, to resume the political initiative, and to organize and formulate a program of its own at last, an original program. In this way the secretary would emerge from this group and would be the expression of an entirely new policy line. And it would be in his interest too to be elected by a congress rather than a National Council session. [Bianchin] But some people say that the Left is already dead.... [Cacciari] I am very optimistic. The political earthquake is by no means over and is still fully under way. It is necessary to display flexibility, cultural substance, and rapidity of movement. For instance, it is necessary to start drawing a distinction between party structures and the building of the left-wing democratic coalition. Because in order to govern it is necessary to form broad coalitions; it is necessary first to define the relationship between the structures and leadership of the coalition, which must be not a superparty but an electoral and government alliance, led by its own candidates, not by a coalition secretary. So it will be necessary to broach the crucial issue of the coalition, of relations with the Catholics, which means not negotiating with Segni or the PPI [Italian Popular Party] but issuing a strong, true, and winning appeal to those who really want to build a new policy. Because, despite appearances, this can be done now.
