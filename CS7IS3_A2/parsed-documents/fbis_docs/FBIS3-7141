This is aimed at banning the people's resistance against his traitorous visit to Japan. The puppet traitor also ordered police throughout South Korea to step up their alertness from 23 to 30 March [duration of ROK President Kim Yong-sam's visits to both Japan and China]. Such a frenzy of suppression reveals an ugly face of one who has a bad conscience due to his traitorous acts.
