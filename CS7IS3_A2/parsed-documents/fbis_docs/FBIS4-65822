This would be confined to difficult questions which could quickly trip up a "purple" [the VVD, the PvdA, and the D66] government, a spokesman for the three "investigators" indicated yesterday. PvdA leader Kok also called for a "succinct, but solid" government pact outlining the basic ideas. "We must not be too restrictive, but we must impede the political parties from using the government agreement for their own purposes." Kok wants to see "a unifying line" in the government agreement in order to "restore confidence in democracy." He believes there is an urgent need for this due to the "fragmentation, protest votes, and votes supposedly out of self-interest" during the elections for the Second Chamber. De Vries, Van Aardenne, and Vis believe they will be able to get down to serious negotiations on the formation of a "purple" government on Thursday [19 May]. Major stumbling blocks will have to be tackled immediately, such as the future of social security, the extent of cutbacks, and the situation surrounding residing aliens. Moreover, they believe it will be clear within about two weeks whether there is any chance of the parties reaching an agreement and therefore if there is any purpose in pursuing the negotiations. Beginning this week, the three "investigators" will try to reach an agreement on the method of working during subsequent weeks. This involves deciding on the order in which subjects are to be discussed. Another question is whether the three party leaders involved in the negotiations can be accompanied by party experts in particular fields. Yesterday, the "investigators" discussed this with party leaders Kok and Bolkestein (VVD); today they are to meet with D66 leader Van Mierlo. Kok has recommended first assessing all the problems. He finds that methodology better than always taking one subject at a time and sticking with it until the end. He sees the most important question as being the promotion of job opportunities "at a social cost which is fairly distributed." He has also cited the environment and law and order as major subjects. The VVD party has decided to set up two working groups that will provide negotiator Bolkestein with files on subjects to be discussed at the negotiations. One working group will concentrate on financial and economic affairs, and the other on remaining matters.
