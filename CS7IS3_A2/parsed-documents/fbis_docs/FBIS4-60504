What are these new tasks in light of the available resources? [Ghawshah] During the meeting we discussed our working program and the tasks we must undertake. The Palestinian National Authority is taking over after 27 years of Israeli occupation. We have major tasks and responsibilities. Our discussions are serious and responsible because they deal with all the political, economic, social, and cultural issues. It was therefore necessary to hold an initial discussion of the National Authority's tasks and program ahead. [Al-Jundi] Dr. Ghawshah, doubtless the new Palestinian authority faces many obstacles, notably the economic conditions in Gaza and Jericho. What efforts is the PLO making in this regard? [Ghawshah] The main obstacle has to do with the Israeli occupation, both with regard to eliminating its aftereffects in the areas from which the Israelis have withdrawn and fully implementing the Declaration of Principles. A major economic problem we are facing now resulted from the Israeli occupation's policy of annexing and merging the Palestinian economy with Israel's, disrupting and ruining the economy and in some cases leading to a total loss of the infrastructure necessary for economic activity. [Al-Jundi] Dr. Ghawshah, according to World Bank sources the Palestinian autonomous areas will obtain $1 billion over the next three years, part of an overall $2-billion package to be distributed in three stages. How can these economic resources best be utilized to encourage development in the Palestinian autonomous areas? [Ghawshah] I would like first to say that the Palestinians have made all the administrative and organizational preparations to build a sound economy in line with international specifications and conditions. Despite the promises of aid, no aid or loans have been received. We hope this will happen soon, especially as our people inside the occupied territories are suffering from the effects of occupation. Because of the sieges, particularly the siege of Gaza, our people badly need to begin economic development and reconstruction. This will ease our people's economic difficulties. We hope the World Bank and the donor countries' promises and commitments will be kept. [Al-Jundi] Dr. Ghawshah, let us move a little from the economic side of the Palestinian Authority to the security side and the situation in Gaza and Jericho. The Israeli Foreign Ministry issued a statement protesting Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat's abrogation of the law applied in Gaza and Jericho since 1967 and his reinstating earlier laws. Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres said the Palestinians should be given the opportunity to adjust in the self- rule areas. How do you see things now? [Ghawshah] I would like first to say something about security. Our people, in what were the occupied areas, including those opposed to the self-rule agreement, welcomed the Palestinian police and security forces with open arms. Another thing: It is the right of the Palestinian National Authority to make decisions as it sees fit to consolidate its role and provide our people with services. The decision by brother Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] on reinstating earlier laws is an interim measure pending the passage of new laws by the Palestinian Authority. Naturally, following the withdrawal of Israeli forces, the military orders of these forces could not remain in effect in Gaza and Jericho. If any issues merited objection, such issues should be clarified by returning to the Declaration of Principles. The Declaration of Principles specifies the Palestinian authority's powers and notes its right to pass laws and legislation. If Israel has any objection, it can raise it procedurally instead of disputing the power of the Palestinian Authority to pass laws and legislation. [Al-Jundi] Thank you. [Ghawshah] You're welcome.
