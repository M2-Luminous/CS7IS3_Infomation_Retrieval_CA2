The development project will run for five years, and its outlay is expected to be approximately Â¥5 billion, one half of which will be subsidized by the Agency of Natural Resources and Energy. Ceramic engines can generate high energy efficiencies by eliminating the need for cooling water, because the cylinders are made of high-heat-resistant ceramics. The projected power-generation efficiency, which indicates the degree of conversion of fuel into power, is 46 percent, which clearly exceeds 30 to 38 percent for earlier gas engines. If a ceramic gas engine is used for a co-generation (heat- and electricity-supplying) system, the overall energy efficiency is expected to be increased to 86 percent. The ceramic gas engine, when developed, will be first promoted for uses in offices, hotels and hospitals. The office use will be particularly promoted because there its power generation efficiency is much higher than the co-generation system it replaces.
