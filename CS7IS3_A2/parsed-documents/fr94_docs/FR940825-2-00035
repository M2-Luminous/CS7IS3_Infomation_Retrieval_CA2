FR940825-2-00035 FR940825-2-00017 Department of the Army Nominations to the Inland Waterways Users Board AGENCY: Office, Assistant Secretary of the Army (Civil Works), DOD. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: Section 302 of Public Law 99&hyph;662 established the Inland Waterways Users Board. The Board is an independent Federal advisory committee. Its eleven members are appointed by the Secretary of the Army. This notice replaces the notice with the same subject published in the Federal Register on 4 August 1994. That notice solicited nominations for five appointments or reappointments to two year terms that will begin January 1, 1995. Subsequent to the submission of the August 4, 1994 notice, a member of the Inland Waterways Users Board eligible for reappointment indicated he will decline reappointment. This notice modifies the solicitation of nominations to reflect this change and extends the date for submitting nominations until September 19, 1994. DATES: The effective date of this notice is August 19, 1994. ADDRESSES: Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Civil Works), Department of the Army, Washington, DC 20310&hyph;0103. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dr. John Zirschky, Acting Assistant Secretary of the Army (Civil Works), (703) 697&hyph;4671. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The selection, service and appointment of board members are covered by provisions of Section 302 of Public Law 99&hyph;662. The substance of these provisions is as follows: Selection Members are to be selected from the spectrum of commercial carriers and shippers using the inland and intracoastal waterways, to represent geographical regions and to be representative of waterway commerce as determined by commodity ton-mile statistics. Service The Board is required to meet at least semi-annually to develop and make recommendations to the Secretary of the Army on waterways construction and rehabilitation priorities and spending levels for commercial navigation improvements, and report its recommendations annually to the Secretary and the Congress. Appointment The operation of the Board and the appointment of its members are subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act (Pub. L. 92&hyph;463 as amended) and Departmental implementing regulations. Members serve without compensation but their expenses due to board activities are reimbursable. The considerations specified in Section 302 for the selection of the Board members, and certain terms used therein, have been interpreted, supplemented, or otherwise clarified as follows: Carriers and Shippers The law uses the terms ``primary users and shippers.'' Primary users has been interpreted to mean the providers of transportation services on inland waterways such as barge or towboat operators. Shippers has been interpreted to mean the purchasers of such services for the movement of commodities they own or control. Individuals are appointed to the Board, but they must be either a carrier or a shipper, or represent a firm that is a carrier or shipper. For that purpose a trade or regional association is neither a shipper or primary user. Geographical Representation The law specifies ``various'' regions. For the purpose of selecting Board members, the waterways subjected to fuel taxes and described in Public Law 94&hyph;502, as amended, have been aggregated into six regions. These are: (1) The Upper Mississippi River and its tributaries above the mouth of the Ohio; (2) the Lower Mississippi River and its tributaries below the mouth of the Ohio and above Baton Rouge; (3) the Ohio River and its tributaries; (4) the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway in Louisiana and Texas; (5) the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway east of New Orleans and associated fuel-taxed waterways east of New Orleans and associated fuel-taxed waterways including Tennessee-Tombigbee, plus the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway below Norfolk; and (6) the Columbia-Snake River System and Upper Willamette. The intent is that each region shall be represented by at least one Board member, with that representation determined by the regional concentration of the individual's traffic on the waterways. Commodity Representation Waterway commerce has been aggregated into six commodity categories based on ``inland'' ton-miles shown in Waterborne Commerce of the United States. In rank order they are: (1) Farm and Food Products; (2) Coal and Coke; (3) Petroleum, Crude and Products; (4) Minerals, Ores, and Products; (5) Chemicals and Allied Products; and (6) All other. A consideration in the selection of Board members will be, that the commodities carried or shipped by those individuals or their firms will be reasonably representative of the above commodity categories. Reflecting preceding selection criteria, the present representation by Board members is as follows: The five members whose terms expire December 31, 1994, include one shipper representative representing the Upper Mississippi River Region (Region 1) and farm and food products, ethanol and coal; one shipper representative representing the Lower Mississippi River Region (Region 2), and farm and food products; one carrier representative representing the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway in Louisiana and Texas (Region 4), and petroleum and petroleum products; one carrier representative representing the Ohio River Region (Region 3), and coal and coke, minerals, and metals, petroleum and petroleum products, farm and food products and chemicals; and one carrier representative representing the Columbia-Snake River System and Upper Willamette (Region 6), and farm and food products, petroleum products, chemicals, containers, and forest products. The members representing Regions 2, 3 and 6 area eligible for reappointment. However, the member representing Region 6 has indicated that he will decline reappointment to the Board. The six members whose terms expire December 31, 1995, include three shipper representatives representing (1) the Lower Mississippi River (Region 2), and farm and food products, (2) the Ohio River (Region 3), and coal, and (3) the East Gulf region (Region 5), and coal; two carrier representatives representing the Ohio River Region (Region 3), and farm and food products, coal, petroleum, chemicals, minerals and metals; and one shipper/carrier representative representing the Ohio River Region (Region 3), and coal. Nominations to replace members whose terms expire December 31, 1994, may be made by individuals, firms, or associations. Nominations should state the region to be represented and whether the nominee is to represent carriers or shippers. Information should be provided on the nominee's personal qualifications and the commercial operations of the carrier and/or shipper with whom the nominee associated. The latter information should show the actual or estimated ton-miles of commodities carried or shipped on inland waterways in a recent year (or years) using the waterway regions and commodity categories previously listed. Nominations received in response to last year's Federal Register notice published on August 9, 1993, have been retained for consideration for reappointment along with nominations received in response to this Federal Register notice. Renomination is not required but may be desirable. Deadline for Nominations All nominations must be received at the address provided in this notice not later than September 19, 1994. Kenneth L. Denton, Army Federal Register Liaison Officer. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;21044 Filed 8&hyph;24&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3710&hyph;92&hyph;M
