The attacks have not stopped this evening, TANJUG's correspondent has learned from Serbian military circles. It is specified that, after several days of preparations and constant attacks, Moslem units launched attacks from the area of Olovo, Cemerka and Mountain Zvezda [all north of Sarajevo], and from the Breza and Visoko areas [northwest of Sarajevo]. They are using all available weapons. The main targets of the Moslem offensive activity are Serbian villages and defense positions of the republic of Srpska army in the area of Ilijas [northwest of Sarajevo, toward Visoko], Srednje and in the Nisici plateau [both north of Sarajevo]. The attacks were accompanied by strong artillery support and mortar fire. Republic of Srpska army units are responding to all attacks and successfully thwarting Moslem attempts at an infantry breakthrough of Serbian defense lines. Circles in the republic of Srpska army point out that the Moslems' intention is to cut the Ilijas-Srednje-Nisici communication link and take control of the Nisici plateau. They would then direct their actions toward Sarajevo, aiming at severing Serbian territory and occupying the Serbian part of Sarajevo. [passage omitted]
