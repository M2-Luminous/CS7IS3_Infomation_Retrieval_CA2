A special HOSPODARSKE NOVINY correspondent in Brussels spoke with Sir Leon Brittan, the present deputy chairman of the European Commission and commissioner for trade, about the relations between the Twelve and the states of Central and East Europe and about the prospects for an eastward expansion of the EU. [Sklenka] It has been frequently heard that, while on the one hand the EU officially calls for trade cooperation, on the other hand it closes its markets. Particularly now, at the time of an economic recession, criticism is often heard from the East of the protectionist trade policy not only of the Union but of all the advanced industrial countries in general. How does Brussels intend to help this region without harming the West European economies? [Brittan] The liberation of trade exchange has increased markedly the volume of mutual trade, which undoubtedly can be regarded as favorable. At the same time, however, it burdened the balance of the East with a substantial deficit. From the point of view of stability in this part of Europe, this adverse trend is a very dangerous phenomenon. The EU endeavors to aid the economic and political transformation in Central and East Europe by all available means. Our hope is to reinforce concurrently political and economic relations in harmony with the integrated European policy of the Union that already incorporates the entire Central and East European region. [Sklenka] Nevertheless, it seems as if the EU lacks a sufficiently clear strategy of expanding cooperation with Central and East European countries, a will to open itself more to these countries. [Brittan] The development of any type of closer cooperation in the spheres of the economy, politics, trade, or culture is clearly defined in the association treaties and in the statement of last year's Copenhagen EU summit. To date, the Union has signed six of these treaties, and the Polish and Hungarian ones went into effect in February. It is well known that these documents, which are the first step of the associated states toward full membership in the EU, have an asymmetric character in the trade sphere, which gives an advantage to the East European countries. [Sklenka] Under the present conditions of a global economic recession, however, the expansion of trade relations frequently leads to accusations raised against the East European countries by the EU of so-called social dumping, and their access to the markets is even hindered. [Brittan] It is necessary to find a model of trade and economic cooperation that would enable East Europe to take advantage, above all, of its natural advantages resulting from low wages and production costs. On the other hand, the Union must protect itself against unfair competition, exports of commodities which frequently are subsidized disproportionately at home. This refers particularly to the so-called sensitive sphere, like agriculture, for instance, or steel and textile manufacture, where we are still searching for a common language. Under the conditions of an economic downturn and generally growing unemployment, exports of such items to the EU further disturb the generally valid principles of free economic competition in the common market, and therefore must be subject to antidumping arbitration, customs surcharges, or other forms of protection. [Sklenka] Regarding the entry itself of these countries into the EU, is there a clear idea of their gradual integration into the Brussels organization? [Brittan] The point of departure for the EU is the idea of building a joint federal Europe. Although for the time being we approach the East European states as a single group -- because under present circumstances and with respect to their past it simplifies and accelerates the process of joining the East with the EU -- the actual talks about the entry of each individual country undoubtedly will take place separately. It will depend a lot on their economic and social development. [Sklenka] How important is the speed of submitting the official application? [Brittan] The application for admission to the EU is only a partial step towards full membership. The acceptance of new EU members will not depend on the date of the application but rather on the readiness of the particular country, i.e., on the fulfillment of preset conditions beginning with the stabilization of a pluralistic democracy and a market economy through the observance of human rights and rights of ethnic minorities, reform of the present legislation, and ending with the fulfillment of the convergence macroeconomic criteria. It is obvious from this vantage point that the entry of these countries will probably differ in time. One can already see quite a marked difference in the progress of the reforms in the Czech Republic as compared to some other countries. [Sklenka] The culminating talks on the expansion of the EU by Austria, Sweden, Finland, and Norway indicate that the main problem remains, above all, the institutional questions. Is an estimate possible of the date for the expansion of the EU eastwards? [Brittan] It is not the same thing to maintain the viability of the organization with 16 or 24 members as in its present 12-member composition. One has to start from the assumption, however, that a start of any official talks regarding the entry of the East European countries is completely unrealistic before 1966, when an EU intergovernmental conference will take place, which is to determine further proceeding in the expansion of the EU eastwards. Their admission as full members will be possible somewhere around the year 2000. Nevertheless, it cannot be ruled out that time will require the establishment of an intermediate stage between associate and full memberships for those who satisfy all the preset conditions first.
