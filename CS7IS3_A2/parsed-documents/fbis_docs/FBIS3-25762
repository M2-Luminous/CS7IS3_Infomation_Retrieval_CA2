Colvin] [Text] East London Feb 27 SAPA -- It could be up to two years before an African National Congress [ANC] government is in a position to deliver on its election promise of houses for the people, the ANC's secretary-general, Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, said in East London at the weekend. Ramaphosa also sharply criticised the government's economic and peace efforts and warned the right-wing the ANC would not tolerate attempts to disrupt the election. He highlighted the ANC's concern about the possible confusion which the late introduction of the double ballot could cause on election day. Addressing an election rally in Duncan Village on Saturday, Ramaphosa told the crowd the ANC was still confident of fulfilling its promise to construct one million houses in five years. "We have looked at the budget and we are certain we can achieve our goals," he said. However, it was possible houses would not be available "in the first or second year of government". Ramaphosa told the cheering crowd that any attempt by the right-wing to use violence to disrupt the election would be met by counterforce. "We have already brought the np government to its knees. We will not be pushed around by people like (Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] Leader Eugene) Terreblanche. "If they (the right-wing) use force we are also prepared to use counterforce," he said. Explaining the ANC's willingness to continue negotiations with the Freedom Alliance [FA], he said: "We have a responsibility to ensure the new government operate in a peaceful environment. That is why we sit down with people like the FA and grant them their demands." However, while the ANC was willing to concede to the setting up of a volksraad [citizens councils] for Afrikaners in Parliament, it would never agree to the creation of a volkstaat [Afrikaner homeland]. Similarly, while the ANC realised that King Goodwill Zwelithini should be given some powers to rule over the Zulus, it was not prepared to allow the incorporation of natal into kwaZulu. "We want the king in a place where we can respect him as a king. But Natal is not going to be independent of the rest of South Africa. We will never agree to that." On the double-ballot issue, he said many people were under the misconception that they were obliged to vote for another party when electing the regional legislature. "The second ballot is still for the ANC it is not for the NP [National Party] or PAC [Pan- Africanist Congress]," he added. To the delight of the crowd, Mr Ramaphosa took time out to [as published] State President F W de Klerk's conservative style of dress. "Mandela dresses like a true president. De Klerk is always wearing a tie even when he goes out to campaign," he said to hoots of laughter. "De Klerk is just a commoner. Mandela is a true president. You can see that by the way he walks, speaks, dresses and eats."
