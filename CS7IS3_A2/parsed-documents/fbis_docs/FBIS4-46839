Gridasov, chief of the Main Administration of Crop Growing of the Ministry of Agriculture and Food of the Russian Federation: "On the Course of Field Work"] [Text] According to data of the State Committee on Statistics of Russia, as of 25 April 1994 in the Northern Caucasus region and the south of the Volga area the weather conditions and the moisture content of the soil have been favorable for the growth and development of winter crops. They are mainly in the stage of stem extension here. In the Central Chernozem region and the Central Volga area tillering of winter crops is continuing and on the rest of the territory of Russia they have resumed vegetation. In Russia as a whole the condition of winter crops is characterized by the following figures: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |(millions of hectares) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |1994 |1993 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Planted (total) |15.5 |19.2 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Good and satisfactory |12.6 |17.6 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Dead and thin |2.9 |1.6 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Winter crops suffered considerably more during the course of wintering in Krasnodar Kray, where 34 percent of the planted areas have died off or are thin, and Voronezh (40), Rostov (37), Volgograd (30) and Belgorod (29 percent) Oblasts. At the present time repair work is being done on the planted areas and they are being top dressed with mineral fertilizers. In the southern regions winter crops have been replanted and underplanted on an area of 1.1 million hectares as compared to 113,000 as of this date last year, and top dressing has been applied to only 2 million hectares, which is 1.6 million less than last year. Field work is being done in 38 regions. Spring crops have already been planted on 5.207 million hectares or 1.250 million hectares more than last year. This year agricultural commodity producers are experiencing great difficulties with the acquisition of mineral fertilizers. As of 1 April there were only 1.2 tonnes on the farms or half as much as last year. The expected deliveries during April-June will amount to 0.8-1.0 million tonnes. Thus Russia as a whole will apply 8.4 million tonnes of them (4 times) less than the average annual level during 1986-1990. This will lead to a crop shortfall of about 30 million tonnes of agricultural products translated into grain. According to forecasts, in 1994 the phytosanitary situation is expected to be difficult (increased damage from locusts, beet webworm, pests and diseases of grain crops and potatoes, and increased weediness of the fields). At the same time the supply of pesticides (taking into account the amounts left over on the farms and Selkhozkhimiya bases and also the amounts earmarked for production by the plants) for various crops will amount to 5-50 percent, and seed disinfectants to 60 percent. According to data from local agricultural organs, in Russia as a whole a sufficient quantity of high-grade seeds of oil-bearing crops has been stored except for sunflowers for feed purposes--the shortage will be made up for with corn seeds. The complete required supply of seeds of spring grain crops, vegetables, melon crops, flax, and potatoes is on hand.
