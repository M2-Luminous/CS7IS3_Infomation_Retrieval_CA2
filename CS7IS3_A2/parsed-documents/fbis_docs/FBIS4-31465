Speaking to journalists during a break in an Executive Council meeting, Klaus added that the ODS Deputies' Group had proceeded from this principle while discussing the bill on the senatorial elections. He said the council had resolutely rejected the unsubstantiated statements about a non-constitutional state which had allegedly arisen in the Czech Republic. "Nothing of the kind is true. I see no signs of the constitutional crisis which would justify an urgent need for change in the Czech Constitution," Klaus said. He described as a "fully false card produced by some political parties" statements about the non-constitutional state in the Republic and proposals by some deputies that if the Senate is not established some of its powers should be transferred to the president. Klaus pointed to the existing temporary provisions in the Constitution which "clearly say how competences are being divided up to the moment when the Senate appears." "We permanently respect the Constitution and the majoritarian principle on which the Senate should be set up and we believe it will be filled at a proper moment," Klaus said.
