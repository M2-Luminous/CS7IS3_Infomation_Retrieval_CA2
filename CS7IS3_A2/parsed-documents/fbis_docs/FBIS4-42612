The DP's goal was "to cleanse the welfare state and to reconstruct it on a more solid foundation". In order to achieve this, "more flexibility and a differentiation of jobs are needed in the job market," and "the entire retirement benefits system should be subjected to a critical analysis" and "more selectiveness must be applied in the area of health insurance plans as well." That means that "a return to real necessities and a resolute curbing of any abuse are absolutely essential." How To Cleanse the Welfare State The DP has not yet answered the question of what this "different welfare state", this "other model of social solidarity" should look like. Should the legal minimum wage be lowered or even completely abolished and the unemployment protection be reduced? Will the index be called into question? Or will retirement benefits and pensions no longer be indexed to the price and wage development when the DP election program talks of "bounced checks"? In Parliament, the leader of the DP group has denied any such intentions of his party. But what else do the general statements of the DP platform mean? Or has the leader of the DP group already distanced himself from the DP election program? It would be a welcome development if the DP, as the party "with new ideas," would tell its voters the plain truth before 12 June. Health Care Expenses In the paper JOURNAL, at least, the DP has given us a first taste of its actual intentions and begun to lift the veil. The health policy spokesman of the DP, who is traded as the DP candidate for the post of minister of health as well, examines the constantly rising health care expenses in a series of newspaper articles and suggests drastic cost-cutting measures. In his view, the state and the health insurances should continue to pay but should beware of meddling too much in the health care system. After all, hospitals and physicians are the ones who know best what is good for patients. Patients To Foot the Bill The DP health policy spokesman further demands: -- abolition of the third payer -- take-over of all small risks by patients -- the introduction of a financial contribution from patients for hospital and laboratory fees -- a limitation of the cost reimbursement to a maximum amount per year or even the establishment of an annual amount (franchise) up to which there will be no reimbursement of costs. Those who wish to insure the remaining risks should rely on a private health insurance. DP for Two-Class Medical Care The above-mentioned DP spokesman consequently suggests restoring the two-class health care and to divide patients into two camps: on one side those who can still afford medical treatment, and on the other side those who, for financial reasons, have to do without or are dependent on the support of the "welfare offices." Those who will vote for the DP on 12 June will know now what to expect. But who would vote for their own slaughter?
