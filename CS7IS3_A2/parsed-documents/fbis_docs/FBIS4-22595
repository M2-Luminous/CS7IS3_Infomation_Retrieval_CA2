A RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA correspondent talks with him. [Yudin] I would like to begin with a comparison. As we know, in the Far North nature is extremely fragile. The wounds that it suffers take decades to heal. Just as capable of being wounded is the north's particular economy, which is based on mining and fishing. Production, which is a single technological process, reacts to network violations by declining, and this has a severe effect on workers. Such ruptures are the result of too hurried privatization "according to the Chubays method," which is characterized not by economic expediency but by a practice well-known to us from the past - that of the company campaign, of the most rapid 100-percent seizure. Unfortunately, in many parts of Russia it is too late to stop and look into matters because everything has been given away. But that is not the case here. In Magadan Oblast privatization has proceeded slowly until now. The first to be subject to it were trade, the consumer sphere, and transportation. The foundation, however -- ore concentration combines and the fish industry --remained untouched. For us this was a good chance to preserve our economic potential. I feel that the oblast duma and oblast administration, in developing a privatization plan for 1994, will be obliged to make corrections that are directed at raising its effectiveness. [Androsenko] In your opinions, what should be the priorities? [Yudin] First of all, it should be noted that the idea of voucher privatization has suffered a crash. Meanwhile, the powers that be are forcefully pushing the voucher variant. Why? The answer is obvious -- this is advantageous to our nouveau riche, to those who have amassed a great deal of money through speculation and other criminal activities, who bought up vouchers at an inexpensive price, and who, taking advantage of corruption, became the overseers of the most profitable enterprises. I think that the rejection of voucher privatization and the transition to routine privatization using money will be more fruitful. The second question -- monopolies and "key" enterprises. Is it efficient, let us say, to put the only Nefteprodukt [Petroleum product] enterprise in the oblast into private hands when it has at its disposal all fuel capacities and fuel lines in the territory? Pilots, automobile drivers and villagers are now dependent on it, but the possibilities for regulating its operations at least in some way have already been lost. Or let us take transportation by motor vehicle. Practically all motor-transport depots in the oblast have been privatized and control over solutions to general territorial problems has been lost. The tragedy of the frozen village of Yagodnyy had a great deal to do, I think, with the impossibility of interesting private car owners in transporting coal. [Androsenko] Vladimir Dmitriyevich, the first stage has practically been completed. What will the consequences be? [Yudin] One of them will be the fragmenting of government property into small parts with an inadequate level of management and responsibility. In our oblast we have not heard of any privatized enterprises that have begun to work more productively or dependably. As far as I know the same is true all over Russia. A second important consideration is that the country is being deprived of a normal labor market. Take a look. A furious emphasis is being placed on property owners. Moreover, this is done with reference to Western society. Yet this is not true. In the West the majority of the population is comprised not of owners but of ordinary people who work for someone else and who receive a dignified remuneration for their work. As a rule, owners there have assets to develop production and pay workers. Here the labor collective, having exchanged 51 percent of stock for vouchers, must supply and develop production as well as supply its own needs, but it does not have the assets to do this. Basically, the government is simply freeing itself of the responsibility for the fates of millions of people. I do not believe that this is right and I think it will have a considerable negative impact on reform. Our stockholders often do not even understand the real cost of fixed AO [joint-stock company] capital, of investments and degree of dependability. They are bewitched by the round figures of promised dividends and no one cares about anything else. [Androsenko] Yes, television pictures of Muscovites storming the offices of Olbk when stock was issued seemed symptomatic to me. Such things do not occur here. Is it that northerners are more prone to analysis or is it simply hard to get them moving? [Yudin] The main thing here is that northerners were first among Russians to face the uncertainty of tomorrow. In the Far North we can see with special clarity the gap between the pretty stories of radical reformers and the actual situation. Here geology, building and agriculture have been almost completely destroyed, gold extraction is on the decline and mining towns are closing. Under such conditions it is difficult to expect people to invest assets in enterprises that can become bankrupt at any time. There have been a few things that have put us on the alert. The Russian Privatization Program for 1994 was passed without the participation of representatives and without summarizing 1993 results. Judging by A. Chubays' statements, such an analysis would be undesirable for him, and it is understandable that he would attempt to keep it from a vote. Meanwhile, the privatization process is acquiring more of an administrative and command nature. It is strange that the directives of the former Gosplan [State Planning Committee] are considered bad while those of Goskomimushchestvo [State Property Committee] are looked upon as good. And it is not important that the word "directive" somehow does not correspond to A. Chubays' favorite word -- "market." For example, despite the order from above, for over a year now we have been unable to sell all of the stock of Khasynskiy Building Materials Plant -- the population will not buy it. On the other hand, the hurried fulfillment of last year's presidential decree on selling motor vehicle enterprises by 1 August, in my opinion had a negative effect on the situation in the oblast. In other words, a clear transition from one administrative system to another, and one that is even more severe, is evident. We feel it is essential that the Federal Assembly make a decision that will give territories the right to deal with basic questions involving privatization. Undoubtedly, it is necessary to privatize enterprises and to place them into private hands, but not in the way that Chubays demands, wholesale, and by the end of the first six months of the year without fail. We wish to implement matters openly, without fuss, and to the greatest advantage for the working man, the new owner and the government.
