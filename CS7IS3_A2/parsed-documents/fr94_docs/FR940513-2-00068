FR940513-2-00068 FR940513-2-00039 The home and community-based long term care initiative will focus on building a comprehensive policy on long-term care for all persons who need services, with a special emphasis on the elderly. Surveys show that older people overwhelmingly prefer to live in their own homes and communities, rather than in institutional settings, but many need home and community-based services to do so. Approximately 6.1 million older people living in the community experience difficulty with one or more activities of daily living such as eating, bathing, dressing, toileting, or transferring in or out of bed. However, less than half of these individuals receive any personal help. Through this Discretionary Funds Program (DFP) Announcement, AoA will provide leadership for the continued development of consumer-driven home and community-based systems of care. 2. Older Women Efforts to improve the quality of life for America's older women comprise another of the Assistant Secretary's initiatives upon which this DFP Announcement will focus. Women comprise 60 percent of today's 65 plus population. Today, there are 18.3 million women, as compared to 12.6 older men. By the year 2000, it is expected that there will be five women for every two men over the age of 75. The special circumstances faced by older women are frequently overlooked. Almost three-quarters of all elderly persons living below poverty are women. Poverty is projected to be an even greater problem for women when the baby boom generation reaches retirement. Although women live longer than men, the quality of their lives often deteriorates substantially in the later years due to illnesses, chronic conditions, falls and other injuries, and stresses of caregiving or of living alone. Some physical conditions which typically affect older women can be prevented if they are encouraged to adopt healthier lifestyles in the late middle years. The Administration on Aging recognizes the need for a highly visible, well-coordinated effort which, through outreach, education, dissemination, advocacy and partnership-building, will focus on critical issues affecting older women including income security, health, caregiving and housing. The older women's initiative will work to enhance the capacity of the Aging Network to effectively address older women's issues and explore the feasibility of developing intradepartmental and interagency partnerships to address the needs of older women. It will also endeavor to educate older women at the grass roots/local level, as well as the public and private sectors, about issues affecting older women; and reinforce the capacity of women to make significant contributions to society throughout the life cycle. 3. Nutrition and Malnutrition The nutrition and malnutrition initiative of the Assistant Secretary will address the critical problem of malnutrition among the elderly. Recent surveys show that alarming numbers of older Americans are malnourished. At the same time, because of medical advances and the availability of community-based services, such as home delivered meals, more older persons have been able to remain independent and in their own homes, rather than having to be institutionalized. The Administration on Aging's nutrition and malnutrition initiative will focus attention on educating the public and private sectors to the growing problem of malnutrition, and finding ways to prevent its occurrence. As part of that effort, AoA is now supporting a synthesis of current knowledge concerning the nutritional status of older persons, as well as an analysis of public awareness of the issues of nutrition and malnutrition among the elderly. The Administration on Aging will also focus its nutrition and malnutrition initiative on the current in-home and congregate meals programs supported under Title III and Title VI of the Older Americans Act. Key goals are: 1) increasing public awareness regarding the issues of adequate nutrition, malnutrition, hunger, and food insecurity and their interrelationships to health, independence, and quality of life of older individuals; 2) providing leadership in promoting a nutrition agenda for the future; 3) developing and promoting direct prevention and intervention strategies to enhance the nutritional status of older people, and; 4) developing integrated public policies to ensure greater access to appropriate food and nutrition services for older individuals. In support of these essential components of the nutrition and malnutrition initiative, the Assistant Secretary for Aging is investing approximately $2.8 million dollars in an evaluation of the National Nutrition Program for the Elderly funded under Title III of the Older Americans Act. A contract to perform the evaluation has been awarded to Mathematica Policy Research, Inc., of Princeton, N.J.
