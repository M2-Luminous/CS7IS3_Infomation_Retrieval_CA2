Sladkov on the Black Sea Fleet issue. Sladkov says: "The Ukrainian town of Sevastopol and the Russian naval base there remains the stumbling block in resolving the issue of the final division of the Black Sea Fleet. Moscow insists on Sevastopol for Russia's main Black Sea base and rejects the idea of moving to Donuzlav. Moreover, Russia will not accept the alternative of having both fleets based in Sevastopol." The video then shows Russian Defense Minister Grachev, who says: "We cannot drive thousands of families out of one town, remove them from their homes, and settle them in different towns--now without homes. We must think about people. We must think about the pensioners, who, as members of the Black Sea Fleet, defended our homeland. We do not have the right just to cast them aside." The video then shows interviews with people walking by on the street. Sladkov notes that the population's mood is pro-Russian but does not want hostility. However, he says, "the Crimean leader is more radical." The video shows Crimean President Meshkov addressing a demonstration: "As president of the Republic of Crimea I consider it impermissible to have the headquarters of the Ukrainian fleet on the same territory, in the same republic. For us it will be constant source of tension, a source of conflict and confrontation."
