FBIS4-23670 "drafr114_e_94007" FBIS-AFR-94-114 Daily Report 13 Jun 1994 WEST AFRICA Nigeria Search Continues for Abiola; Short Protests Reported Search Continues for Abiola; Short Protests Reported Abiola Supporter on Government `Panic' AB1306195994 London BBC World Service in English 1705 GMT 13 Jun 94 AB1306195994 London BBC World Service English BFN [From the "Focus on Africa" program] [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Sola Odunfa has been talking to one of Abiola's leading supporters, the radical lawyer Chief Gani Fewehinmi, and he put it to him that this was the beginning of the end for Chief Abiola: [Begin recording] [Fawehinmi] Well, I don't think, I don't think so. I don't think the end of Abiola has come. I think a new chapter has been opened by his declaration that he is the president of the country. Now the situation in the country is so politically confused that the government itself is jittery, is in panic. The government cannot see the surf for the woods. The government is in quandary and you can see clearly the way the president spoke, I mean the head of state spoke on the television yesterday. He looked a shell of himself. He was dumb. He was drab. He was inconsistent. He wasn't looking very happy and that means, really, that since they could not even identify the place where Abiola had declared himself, I mean they were surprised that he beat the entire security network of this country. He declared himself before a crowd of more than 3,000 people and he was not caught by the security forces. Up till today, they couldn't find him and they made a laughingstock of themselves by saying that there was a price of 50,000 on the head of a man like that, and that means in ordinary times they converted it and it is $950. And that is a ridiculous thing. Really, it shows clearly that the government is in panic. It is not in control, and I think this is a government that is tottering. [Odunfa] Where is Chief Abiola now? [Fawehinmi] Honestly, I don't know. I only know that he has declared himself president and many Nigerians are happy that that has been done, at least to confront a government that has no legitimacy. [Odunfa] Why should he go into hiding? [Fawehinmi] I don't know. Really, I cannot proffer an answer to that. All I know is that Nigerians are relieved that somehow he has shown courage. For the first time, he has shown a lot of courage and he has redeemed his image and he has put this government on the run. The government now is in quandary. The government is in chaos. [Odunfa] What will happen now? [Fawehinmi] Anything can happen in Nigeria now. Just anything can happen because there is no stability. [end recording] Now, today was supposed to mark the start of protests by the prodemocracy groups in Nigeria, who are calling for the military government to step down. On the line to Lagos, Robin White asked Sola Odunfa what sort of response there had been to the call for a stay away: [Begin recording] [Odunfa] There wasn't much response on the island. Most people went to work. All government offices were conducting normal business. All business houses on Lagos Island operated normally. The only problem was on the mainland where many markets and several shops did not open. All along Agege motor road which is a very long stretch of road, about 5 km, not a single shop opened when I went there at about 2 P.M. this afternoon. [White] What about elsewhere in the country? [Odunfa] The reports I have got so far are that in the north everybody went to work normally; the same thing in the east. In the west, there was some demonstration, people staying away from work, especially in Ogun State, the home state of Chief Abiola. But on the whole, it has not been a successful thing as was done last year. [White] So it has been a bit of a damp squib, everything? [Odunfa] It looks like that so far. [White] And what about Abiola declaring himself as president? Has that been a damp squib too? [Odunfa] No, it was definitely not! Although people went to work, you find that at least in Lagos about 90 percent of the residents still support Abiola. [White] There have been suggestions, I think coming from the police force, that there was no swearing-in ceremony at all; that it was all a makeup by his supporters. [Odunfa] I read the statement by the deputy inspector general of police in charge of operations. The statement would be correct insofar as he said that there was no swearing in. There was, in fact, no swearing in. What took place was that Abiola addressed the people and proclaimed himself president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. And it took place, the event took place about 100 meters behind my office here. I can still see the sports hall which was used. It is a modern sports center owned by the Lagos Island local government and Abiola came there at about half past seven in the evening, went into the club house on the premises, and by eight his supporters had informed people around that Abiola was around and that they should come and see him. And it was a huge crowd here. The entire street was blocked by people. [White] [words indistinct] absolutely clear, you have spoken to a lot of people who saw him declare himself. [Odunfa] Yes, everybody, in fact people in my building here and people on the street, everybody was there. [end recording]
