Speaking with a group of Japanese reporters aboard the plane about prospects for the political situation, Foreign Minister Hata said: "The ruling parties are now working on coordinating their opinions in an effort to keep their coalition framework intact. I think they will soon complete their policy coordination and choose a candidate to succeed Prime Minister Hosokawa." In this way, the foreign minister predicted that a candidate to succeed Hosokawa as prime minister would be chosen early next week. The foreign minister has been mentioned as the most likely candidate to succeed Hosokawa as prime minister. Asked by a reporter to comment on this, Hata stated: "I have heard about it, but I would like to refrain from mentioning the name of the person to become prime minister." Touching on talks with U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor scheduled to be held on 15 April, the foreign minister said: "I intend to tell him that a change of government in Japan should not set back Japan-U.S. relations," and he added: "It is a matter of course for me to call on him to resume the stalled Japan-U.S. economic framework talks after a new government is inaugurated in Japan."
