The governorate's 135 bakeries, which are literally besieged by the citizens every day beginning at 0400, are no longer able to satisfy demand. In the 35 communes, the same scenes of genuine "stampedes" to buy bread are being observed. Some bakers have already chosen the "coupon book" system giving their loyal customers priority. The phenomenon is explained by the shortage of semolina, which has restricted breadmaking at home, and by the layout of the governorate, whose largest towns are located on RN [National Highway] 5, a major traffic artery generating an irregular and unquantifiable demand that statistics are unable to predict with any certainty. The sales management of Eriad [five food industry enterprises] reports, however, that it has increased its deliveries of flour, which now border on 1,600 quintals per day. The obvious inability to keep up with demand is being reflected in the price of a baguette of French bread, which now sells for 5 dinars [DA]. Because of the complicity of a number of bakers who prefer to sell their production "at wholesale," bread is being found--at prohibitive prices and in dangerous hygienic conditions--in grocers' stalls and for sale by street vendors. Despite its efforts, Eriad says that for the present it is unable to overcome the crisis, which cannot be eliminated except by the arrival in the near future of large quantities of semolina, deliveries of which will enable families to resume their usual food habits. The Bordj Bou Arreridj Governorate will be able to relieve the small local bread "factories" when the industrial bakery now nearing completion goes into operation. It will supply school cafeterias and local communities. It will produce 35,000 loaves per day. The phenomenon is also explained by changes in the rural population's food habits due to the gap between the cost price of bread and of pastry/crepes. [sentence as published] The peasants in the region have given up the practice of growing for their own consumption because of the clearly superior advantage they gain by selling their quintal of wheat for close to DA1,400. There is a definite advantage in selling their entire harvest with the added bonus of "lower domestic household expenses."
