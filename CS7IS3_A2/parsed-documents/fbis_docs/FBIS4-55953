Fewer Large Enterprises, More Small Ones--first paragraph is NEPSZABADSAG introduction] [Text] The Hungarian construction industry underwent a significant transformation in recent years. Several of the large enterprises that earlier had dominated the construction industry went bankrupt; others have been reorganized and are continuing to function. From 1992 to 1993, the number of organizations employing over 300 persons dropped by nearly one-fourth, while the number of firms employing fewer than 20 workers increased by one-third. According to the data of the Ministry of Industry and Trade (IKM), in December of last year there were more than 64,500 contractors in the construction industry. That includes incorporated construction organizations as well as sole proprietors. Since the 1980's, the construction market has been shrinking continually. Therefore it is not surprising that nearly 90 percent of the businesses employ fewer than 10 persons each. At the same time, the number of firms employing fewer than 20 workers and organized as business associations is continuing to rise. The total number of employees was 135,600 in 1993, 4.2 percent less than the year before. Once the Bankruptcy Law came into force, many of the large construction-industry enterprises of years past petitioned to be declared bankrupt. But most of these large enterprises, which usually held substantial assets but were burdened with huge debt, had already transferred their capacities to business associations that had split off from them. Therefore the liquidation of the enterprises' stripped headquarters became inevitable. At the same time, several former state enterprises are continuing to function as corporations, after drastically trimming their personnel and selling off assets. The survival of firms employing more than 300 persons is typical mostly of construction industry's civil-engineering branch. Such organizations account for more than half of the existing capacity within the branch. The IKM reports that there were 113 such firms in Hungary in 1992, and 91 in 1993. In the building industry, the proportions of the organizations within the individual size-categories are about equal. In the specialized building trades and in building maintenance, however, small firms are the dominant. The participation of foreign capital increased further in recent years. At the end of 1992, there were about 700 joint ventures among the incorporated organizations. Their combined total registered capital was 24 billion forints, of which 16.3 billion forints was held by foreigners. At the same time, nearly 230 joint ventures were formed last year. Their capital stock was 3.3 billion forints, of which 1.8 billion belonged to foreigners. On average, foreigners hold 55 percent of the equity in the newly formed joint ventures, while the proportion of foreign direct investment is close to 20 percent. In 1993, the firms within the construction industry produced 241.5 billion forints' worth of construction and installation work. At current prices, this output was 13 percent more than the year before. In the first quarter [of 1993]--because of pro forma invoices due to changes in VAT refunds, and as a result of the Accounting Law's coming into effect--output was 9 percent lower than in the same period of the preceding year. This lag was reduced to 1 percent by the end of the second quarter. Thereafter there was a 20-percent rise in output by the end of September, followed by a 4-percent decline. The price level of construction work rose by 13.2 percent in 1993, which was somewhat less than the rise in 1992. The price level's rise was slightly below average in the building industry, and in civil-engineering industry it was 1 percentage point above the average.
