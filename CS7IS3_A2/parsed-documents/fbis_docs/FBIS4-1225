FBIS4-1225 "drafr079_c_94059" FBIS-AFR-94-079 Daily Report 22 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Mbeki, Ramaphosa Main Candidates for Deputy President Mbeki, Ramaphosa Main Candidates for Deputy President MB2204182894 Johannesburg THE STAR in English 22 Apr 94 p 3 MB2204182894 Johannesburg THE STAR English BFN [Report by political correspondent Kaizer Nyatsumba] [Text] Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] leader Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi might be one of two of South Africa's deputy presidents after the election if he does "reasonably well" in next week's poll, according to reliable ANC sources. The sources said Buthelezi, whose party made a sensational last-minute entry into the election race this week, was being seriously considered in ANC circles for the position of one of two executive deputy presidents. The offer would be made to him in the interests of peace and national unity, especially if he had a fairly respectable showing in the election. He would then join National Party leader F.W. de Klerk as the country's deputy president, with the ANC forfeiting its right to appoint the first deputy president -- something to which it will be automatically entitled to if no more than two parties get over 20 percent each in the election. The sources stressed, however, that this was just one of the options being considered in certain ANC circles, although not everyone in the organisation's national executive committee (NEC) was happy about it. The ANC begins a two-day meeting of its extended NEC today, where the first deputy presidency of the country and Nelson Mandela's tentative Cabinet will be discussed. Within the ANC itself, National Chairman Thabo Mbeki and Secretary-General Cyril Ramaphosa are the two main candidates, with each man's supporters lobbying very strongly for their man. Because of the divisive nature of the designation of a deputy president, this issue has so far been discussed in hush-hush tones within the ANC. Mbeki's supporters, mostly in the ANC Youth League, point to the fact that he was placed second on the lists which came from the various regions across the country. They say the list which saw Ramaphosa leap-frogging to the second spot had been a result of the national conference attended by party bosses and therefore did not represent "the will of the people". Responding to a question at a press conference in Johannesburg yesterday, Ramaphosa -- like Mbeki a week ago -- said he and his colleagues in the ANC were not inclined to talk about themselves and what positions they might hold in future. He confirmed, however, that the process of putting together an ANC Cabinet was under way. The sources said Mbeki, who was "presently the most senior person in the ANC and commands a lot of respect from all sectors", was a clear favourite for the job. Another "very senior and powerful job" had already been earmarked for Ramaphosa. However, ANC sources yesterday told THE STAR there was now a possibility of maverick information and publicity chief Dr Pallo Jordan becoming a compromise candidate for the first deputy presidency to avoid a showdown between Ramaphosa and Mbeki. This would be similar to what happened at the organisation's July 1991 congress in Durban where Walter Sisulu was elected deputy president to stave off a potentially divisive battle for the position between the late Chris Hani and Mbeki. Approached for comment yesterday, Jordan said: "I have not heard about it. However, I would not be a compromise candidate because I am very uncompromising". Asked what his reaction would be if he were nominated for the position, he said he would "seriously consider it".
