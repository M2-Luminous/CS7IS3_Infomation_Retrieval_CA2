There is a wave of resentment across the Police officials who feel not only a threat to their basic functions but also that they will lose many of their cadre posts. This has already started creating bad blood and the police sources openly question the army's ability to deal with an issue as complex as narcotics. The government had taken a decision in principle a few months back that the Pakistan Narcotics Control Board (PNCB) and Anti-Narcotics Task Force (ANTF) would be merged into one `elite force.' The new organisation would be given under the army's command and a Major General would head it. A few days back the government ordered the implementation of that idea according to which the PNCB would be merged with the ANTF and a new department, probably with a new name would be established through a notification. The new force will be led by ANTF's Director General Major General Salahuddin Tirmizi. The PNCB's Chairman Dyas Mohasin was to be transferred and posted as Additional Secretary, Interior Division. The ANTF has been given six months to sort out the complete modalities of the merger. That would deal with the issue of how to adjust about 700 odd personnel of the PNCB. The new force would mostly comprise officers from the armed forces but would also have civilians who have had years of experience in the fight against drugs. The decision to let the army take over the operation has not gone well with the police service. They feel that their basic functions are now being encroached upon. From the look of it, it appears that the army and police are in for a tense relationship as soon as the new force gets underway. As one senior police official said: "The government has not done any service to the cause against drugs by minimizing the role of the police and giving everything under the army's control which may not be able to perform any better. The police officials will obviously obey the orders but one thing is sure that there would be problems as their response would be lukewarm and that of disdain." The reasons for this resentment are many. The Police feel that the functions has been taken away from it when it had started performing exceptionally well during the past few years. One police source said that although the drug problem is not eliminated, but it was not just due to the department's fault. [sentence as published] It was the indifferent attitude of governments during the last 15 years, which despite knowing that this problem is growing into a social cancer, never allocated enough funds and extended the appropriate legal support to catch the culprits. "The police was the only force which remained on top year in and year out in terms of drug seizures of all kinds. The spread of the menace was because successive governments lacked the political will to deal with the problem and that there were never enough resources to counter those who run a parallel black economy," said a top police source.
