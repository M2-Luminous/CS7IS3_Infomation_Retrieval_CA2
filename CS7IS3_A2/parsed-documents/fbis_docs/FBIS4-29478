Speaking in the capacity of chairman of the Life Insurance Association of japan, Toshiomi Uragami told reporters that the proposal runs counter to the law governing postal life insurance that limits services. "This could help give more power to the bureaucracy," said Uragami, who is also president of Sumitomo Life Insurance Co. The report, prepared by a study group for the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, says postal life insurance is serving to promote competition in the oligopolistic life insurance market. Commenting also on a series of damage suits filed by variable life insurance policyholders against life insurance firms, Uragami said each life insurance company should have explained the feature of variable life insurance, and noted that the industry is reviewing a text on the subject for sales personnel. Variable life insurance policies are investment-oriented policies that provide a return linked to an underlying portfolio of securities. Variable life insurance was a big hit in the so-called bubble era in the late 1980s when a booming stock market held the promise of higher returns. But with the stock market crumbling since, many policyholders facing huge losses have filed damages suits against life insurance firms.
