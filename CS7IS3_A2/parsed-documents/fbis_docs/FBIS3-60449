According to the Municipal Health Secretariat, 48 cases were reported, representing 37 percent more than the 35 cases of the disease expected for the month. The number of fatalities during November rose to 12 with the death, on the night before last, of the child J., aged one year, who was confined in the Salgado Filho Hospital. According to the Secretariat, the baby's parents live in the shantytown of Jacarezinho. Despite the spread of the meningococcal disease in Rio, the Secretariat denies the existence of an epidemic, because he does not believe that there has been a significant change in the number of reports of the disease compared with previous years. Most of the cases of meningococcal meningitis in Rio have been caused by the Type B meningococcus, characterized by a slow spread. It is unlike types A and C, which are capable of causing very intense epidemics within a short period of time. Compared with last year's reports, however, the figures on the meningococcal disease in Rio indicate an abnormal rise in at least five months: February (increase of 50 percent); March (105 percent); April (43 percent); September (56 percent); and November (37 percent). Nevertheless, during August and October the number of cases was nearly 30 percent lower than that recorded for those months in 1992. The total number of cases reported to date has already exceeded that of last year's cases: 392 by November, compared with 328 last year. For this reason, the Municipal Health Secretariat requested of the Health Ministry authorization to administer the vaccine against type B meningococcal meninigitis in Rio. The effectiveness of that vaccine is a controversial topic among the experts. Deaths From January to November Total 142 The State Health Secretariat's data indicate that by November, in the state as a whole, the meningococcal meninigitis cases exceeded the total reported in 1992. To date, the Secretariat has recorded 725 cases of the disease, compared with 702 last year. This represents an approximate increase of 3 percent, not counting the figure for the month of December. The disease, which killed 153 persons in 1992, caused 142 fatalities among its victims by November of this year. When added to those of other types of meningitis (such as the ones caused by Haemophilus influenzae, pneumococcus, and viruses), the total cases this year number 2,209, versus 2,422 last year. Yesterday, in Rio, the Municipal Health Secretariat recorded another case of type A meningococcal disease. The victim, L., aged 11 months, lives in Jacarepagua, and is confined in a private clinic.
