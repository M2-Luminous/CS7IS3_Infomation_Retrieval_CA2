Vasili Neikovchin [name as received], spokesman of the Gagauz Parliamentary Presidium, stated to BASA that the deputies will examine the final variant of the "Gagauz-Eri-Gagauzia" project of special juridical status for Gagauzians. After the project is finalized it will be presented to the Moldovan Parliament. Peru Buzaji, chairman of the Gagauz Parliamentary Commission for settling the problem of juridical status, stated to BASA: "During the last four months of negotiations with the similar Moldovan Parliamentary Commission led by Ion Ungureanu and meetings between Moldovan and Gagauz officials, practically, a convenient compromise has been reached. This time it seems that the Moldovan Parliament has no reason not to adopt this project as a fundamental law for Gagauz people's autonomy." He pointed out that it is very important "that the future Moldovan Constitution will have an article recognizing the Gagauz people's existence." Buzaji also specified that there were disagreements between the Chisinau and Comrat leaders on the first two articles, Articles 12, 25, etc. Article 22, for example, states that Moldova will be responsible of security and defense in the region. Buzaji said that the Gagauz side insisted that the soldiers of the districts densely inhabited by Gagauzians be not involved in combat operations without the Gagauz Parliament's consent and the written consent of each soldier. "We made many compromises but we are not going to give in any more, because Gagauz people will not admit and not forgive this," said Buzaji. "We hope that the current Moldovan leadership is aware of the realities and that it will be the parliament's decision to offer Gagauzians the historical chance to self-determination, national rebirth and their development as a nation."
