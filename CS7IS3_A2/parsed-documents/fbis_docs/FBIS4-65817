The rebels who disobeyed the party in order to salvage [Prime Minister] Berlusconi played a nasty trick on him, but Nicola Mancino has succeeded in keeping the PPI in opposition, as promised. [Luzi] Senator Mancino, what is meant by "neither blind nor hostile opposition"? [Mancino] Our aim is to work in the country's interest. This means we will not constitute a confrontational opposition, we will not seek polar confrontations. This is the last thing that those, such as ourselves, who have the ambitious plan to break up the artificial coalitions that came about during the election campaign can permit themselves to do. Dialogue will bring about a thaw and will bring to light the very many inconsistencies already present within this majority. [Luzi] Do you see many inconsistencies? [Mancino] There is no agreement on the concept of the country's unity and indivisibility. In foreign policy there is still cause to be wary, both with regard to the not entirely placated forms of nationalism (I am talking about the revision of borders) and to the single European currency. As for the economy, this emphatically announced neoliberalist stance needs to be thoroughly clarified. Will the welfare system continue to be afforded an important position, or will it be scaled down, causing the most disadvantaged sectors to become completely neglected? [Luzi] Do you long for a return to welfarism? Do you not think that there has been too much of that? [Mancino] This is a criticism that the DC [Christian Democratic Party] used to make of itself, because in the past 15 years the gains in the welfare system were undermined by an exaggerated welfarism. [Luzi] That was called cronyism. [Mancino] Partly that. There were all kinds of things -- the conservation of the ruling bloc, the limitation or exclusion of imagination in production... If Berlusconi is aiming to create a million new jobs within two years, he can do it, inasmuch as already the forecasts for this year indicate an increase of at least 400,000. But we must beware of undermining the recovery. In order to achieve this target it is necessary not to try to go too far. The issue of the South is a crucial one; but specifically on the topic of southern Italy resistance and conflicts could occur within the coalition. [Luzi] Rather than criticisms, these sound like suggestions to Berlusconi. Is the economy the most fertile field for understanding with the government? [Mancino] Unquestionably. [Luzi] Does that mean that in connection with the Finance Bill you will display generous attention to the government's proposals? [Mancino] To create new jobs is not the prerogative of the majority forces alone; the responsibility of the opposition forces will be measured on this too. [Luzi] One of the inconsistencies that you mentioned in the Senate was the prime minister's dual role, including that of owner of a number of television channels. What does the PPI think Berlusconi should do? [Mancino] This is the most serious problem. When the power of information becomes concentrated in the hands of a single person -- either through ownership (Fininvest) or by virtue of his status (the administration of RAI [State Radio and Television]), there is a real, not merely potential, danger of a limitation of the scope for freedom. Good intentions are not enough; it is not enough to move away from the news production centers. There must be a relinquishment. There is already an incompatibility between the role of prime minister and ownership of television channels. True, a businessman cannot be prevented from engaging in politics, but when you choose to serve the interest of the community, you must eliminate these inconsistencies; and in this instance there is a formal and substantive inconsistency. [Luzi] If and when you approve some government measure or another you will be voting the same way as the National Alliance [AN]. Does this prospect embarrass you? [Mancino] I do not think it embarrasses us. This raises a more general issue. What [AN leader] Mr. Fini must come to terms with is not my nostalgic feelings, but the nostalgia for banners, flags, and blackjacks not unconnected with the political tradition of his old MSI [Italian Social Movement]. The Rautis, the Buontempos, Miss Mussolini, the Maceratinis, and the Tremaglias are not insignificant figures in Parliament. In order to become a European-style moderate Right it is necessary to shed these people. A cosmetic operation is not enough. [Luzi] You have said that within the opposition you will "never become confused with left-wing cartels." Will there be no battles waged jointly with the progressive forces? [Mancino] There will definitely be battles to guarantee and defend freedoms. Of course, this cannot authorize anyone to talk in terms of regressive associationism. We want to create a center capable of achieving groupings after it has undermined the stability of alignments that we still consider unnatural. [Luzi] In other words, you want to bring Forza Italia into the center. [Mancino] Yes. I think that the objective must be not only to bring Forza Italia into the center: The objective is to win back our traditional electorate. The recent CEI [Italian Episcopal Conference] document stressed the need for the presence of a Christian-inspired party. With such a party there is a nonexclusive preferential relationship. It is up to the secularist Christians active in politics to recompose the fragmented area lying both to the Right and to the Left of the PPI. When we have won back our electorate, the strategy of coalitions will not be a chimera for us and we will present a less fragile political proposal than that which we presented for the general elections. [Luzi] With which allies? [Mancino] The frame of reference could be a group situated to our Right -- and Forza Italia is definitely situated to our Right -- and a group situated to our Left, if the idea of a democratic alliance embodying Liberal, Republican, and Socialist tendencies materializes. [Luzi] But that is the old five-party alliance... [Mancino] It is not. It is something new born from the ruins of the five-party alliance. [Luzi] What about the Left? [Mancino] The Left is the other aspect of the old system. The collapse of the old majorities was accompanied also by the collapse of the idea of a left-wing government, and this defeat makes the crisis of the left-wing coalition much more serious and profound than the sharp defeat suffered by the Popular Party. The potential for recovery is more on our side than theirs. [Luzi] What does it feel like to be in opposition for the first time? [Mancino] Personally, it feels like a transition, therefore like a change. I still wonder, will we succeed? Can we recover? Do people understand the new effort that is being made? So the experience borders on an existential and political crisis. While on the one hand there is a feeling of depression, on the other hand there is the impetus to carry on in order to recover. [Luzi] Opposition means remoteness from power... [Mancino] It purifies... [Luzi] Yes, it purifies, but it has already lost you the CCD [Christian Democratic Center] and yesterday it lost you four senators... [Mancino] We have not lost them. I have heard from them, listened to them. There is a desire to return, to remain full members of the PPI. In any case, they have been suspended, not expelled... [Luzi] What would have happened if the government had fallen? [Mancino] It would have made our strategy more clearly understood, and even Berlusconi would have realized that he is not invincible. In other words, that politics is not the Milan soccer club...
