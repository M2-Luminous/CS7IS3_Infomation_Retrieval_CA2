ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: NMFS issues a final rule to implement the North Pacific Fisheries Research Plan (Research Plan) for the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) groundfish fishery, Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands (BSAI) management area groundfish fishery, BSAI area king and Tanner crab fisheries, and Pacific halibut fishery in convention waters off Alaska. The Research Plan will provide an industry-funded observer program and promote management, conservation, and scientific understanding of groundfish, halibut, and crab resources off Alaska. EFFECTIVE DATE: October 6, 1994. ADDRESSES: Individual copies of the Research Plan and the environmental assessment/regulatory impact review may be obtained from the North Pacific Fishery Management Council, P.O. Box 103136, Anchorage, AK 99510. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Susan J. Salveson, 907&hyph;586&hyph;7228. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The domestic groundfish fisheries of the BSAI and GOA in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) are managed under the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for the Groundfish Fishery of the BSAI Area and the FMP for Groundfish of the GOA. The FMPs were prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) under the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.) (Magnuson Act) and are implemented for the U.S. fishery by regulations at 50 CFR parts 620, 672, and 675. The domestic fishery for Pacific halibut off Alaska is managed by the International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC), as provided by the Northern Pacific Halibut Act of 1982 (16 U.S.C. 773&hyph;773k), with implementing regulations at 50 CFR part 301. Regulations implementing individual fishing quota (IFQ) measures for the fixed gear sablefish and halibut fisheries off Alaska are at 50 CFR part 676. The king and Tanner crab fisheries of the BSAI area are managed under the FMP for the Commercial King and Tanner Crab Fisheries in the BSAI. This FMP delegates management of the crab resources in the BSAI area to the State of Alaska (State) with Federal oversight. Regulations necessary to carry out the crab FMP appear at 50 CFR part 671. Section 313 of the Magnuson Act, as amended by section 404 of the High Seas Driftnet Fisheries Enforcement Act, Pub. L. 102&hyph;582, authorizes the Council to prepare, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary), a Research Plan for all fisheries under the Council's jurisdiction, except salmon fisheries. The Council adopted a draft Research Plan at its June 1992 meeting and later reconsidered and adopted a revised Research Plan at its December 1993 meeting. A proposed rule to implement the Research Plan was published in the Federal Register on May 6, 1994 (59 FR 23664). Comments on the proposed rule were invited through July 5, 1994. Nine letters providing written comment were received within the comment period and one letter supporting the Research Plan was received after the end of the comment period. Oral comment on the Research Plan also was received during the June 1994 meeting of the Council, and during three public hearings conducted by NMFS on the Research Plan in Anchorage, AK (June 7, 1994), Seattle, WA (June 15, 1994) and Portland, OR (June 16, 1994). Written and oral comments on the Research Plan are summarized in the Response to Comments section, below.
