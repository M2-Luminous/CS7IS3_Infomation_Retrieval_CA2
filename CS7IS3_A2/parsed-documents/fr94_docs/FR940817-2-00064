In particular, the Agency may consider whether a waiver would be consistent with the objectives of the Clean Air Act. In each instance, the factors considered and relied upon should be clearly identified. IV. Analysis of Emissions Data A. Description of Previous Test Programs In support of its request, Ethyl conducted an extensive test program to determine the effect of MMT on the ability of vehicles to comply with current and future emission standards. It also considered the impact of MMT on nonregulated vehicle emissions, urban smog or ozone, refinery emissions, and crude oil use. Ethyl claimed that its test results established that MMT would not cause or contribute to exceedences of current or future emission standards. It also claimed that MMT use would result in other benefits consistent with Clean Air Act goals. In 1988, Ethyl assembled a test fleet of 48 light-duty vehicles, composed of eight different model types (six Buick Centurys (2.5 liter), six Buick Centurys (2.8 liter), six Buick Centurys (3.8 liter), six Chevrolet Cavaliers (2.0 liter), six Ford Escorts (1.9 liter), six Ford Tauruses (3.0 liter), six Ford Crown Victorias (5.0 liter) and six Dodge Dynastys (3.0 liter)) that together represented a broad spectrum of then current (1988) technology vehicles. To accumulate mileage, Ethyl utilized the ``Alternative Mileage Accumulation Cycle'' (AMA) which is a standard procedure utilized to accumulate mileage for certification purposes. 24 It utilized two laboratories to measure each vehicle's exhaust emissions of the regulated pollutants (HC, oxides of nitrogen (NO x ) and carbon monoxide (CO)) at 5,000-mile intervals up to 75,000 miles in the case of most vehicles and up to 100,000 miles in the case of several. 25 It also tested a number of these vehicles for evaporative HC, particulate and manganese emissions, materials compatibility, driveability and catalyst durability. 24 A driving cycle is a description of how to drive a vehicle to accumulate mileage, including such things as a what percentage of driving should be done at what speed and what the overall average speed should be. The AMA cycle is described in EPA Mobile Source Advisory Circular 37&hyph;A, (See Docket A&hyph;91&hyph;46) and is essentially prescribed for use by manufacturers to accumulate mileage for certification of vehicles (See 40 CFR 86.092&hyph;26). A driving cycle is used so that test vehicles accumulate mileage in a manner that is supposedly representative of in-use vehicles. The emissions of a test vehicle that has accumulated mileage according to a driving cycle representative of in-use vehicles are more likely to be representative of in-use vehicles' emissions. There are actually three alternative cycles associated with the AMA; however, the average speeds of the three alternatives are very similar, ranging from 29.9 mph to 30.72 mph. 25 The ``useful life'' of model year 1993 and earlier light-duty vehicles (LDV's) is 50,000 miles or five years, whichever occurs first (section 202(d)). However, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 extended the useful life of LDV's to 100,000 miles or ten years, beginning with 1994 model year vehicles. For the standards that begin to take effect in model year 1994, section 207(c) provides for intermediate in-use standards for several years.
