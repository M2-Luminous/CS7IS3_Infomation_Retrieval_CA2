CPRF Secretariat Information No. 648 Data concerning the South Korean puppets' maneuvers for nuclear weapons development are exposed one after another these days, arousing deep concern and indignation at home and abroad. The South Korean National Democratic Front Central Committee in a white paper dated 30 March disclosed that the South Korean heavy-water reactor in Wolsong and its multipurpose research reactor in the Taedok complex were intended to develop nuclear weapons. South Korean publications and foreign media also continue to report scientific analytical data and testimony from relevant people that confirm this. The South Korean puppets' maneuvers for nuclear weapons development are an outright betrayal to the joint declaration on denuclearization on which the North and the South have agreed, and a vicious challenge to the aspiration of all the fellow countrymen who yearn for peace and peaceful reunification of the country. The South Korean puppets had already established a policy of developing nuclear weapons by the early 1970's, and brought a Candu-type [Canadian Deuterium-Uranium] heavy-water reactor from Canada and installed it in Wolsong in order to secure fissionable material. The heavy-water reactor in Wolsong is a nuclear reactor for the development of nuclear weapons disguised for commercial use. The South Korean magazine WOLGAN CHOSON exposed, through the testimony of the specialists who were directly involved in the nuclear weapons development, that the heavy-water reactor in Wolsong brought from Canada was aimed at producing nuclear weapons. The heavy-water reactor--the main purpose of which is to produce plutonium, different from the light-water reactor for commercial use which is supposed to replace fuel all at the same time, suspending operations after filling it with nuclear fuel every year or year and a half--is designed so that part of the fuel is replaced every day. Therefore, it is easy to secretly hoard the plutonium. The South Korean magazine WOLGAN CHOSON No. 4, 1992 issue referred to the remark of a researcher from the South Korean Atomic Energy Research Institute who said that hoarding can be done by making a double ledger and recording in it that 10 kg of nuclear fuel is processed even if 1,000 kg of nuclear fuel is actually processed. This means that the puppets are hoarding plutonium even under surveillance by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]. The heavy-water reactor in Wolsong is extracting an enormous quantity of used nuclear fuel containing highly pure plutonium from natural uranium. The heavy-water reactor in Wolsong, which began operation in April 1983, has produced an enormous quantity of plutonium, from which some 370 nuclear bombs can be made. Newspapers of many countries, including the United States and Britain, have reported data exposing the status of nuclear weapons development in South Korea and that South Korea has already stockpiled 10 tons of plutonium, which will increase to 24 tons by the year 2000. The multipurpose research reactor in the Taedok complex is also intended solely for the development of nuclear weapons. The South Korean puppets, carrying on a joint design project with Canada for the multipurpose research reactor beginning in 1985, obtained not only the technology necessary for designing and manufacturing a nuclear bomb but the computer software [chonsan koud], the key element thereof, as well. The Japanese magazine SEKAI No. 12, 1992 issue reported that the multipurpose research reactor can produce a nuclear bomb if South Korea purchases enriched uranium from another country quite legally and highly enrich it by using the 20 percent enriched uranium, which is the highest limit of the lowly enriched [chonongchuk] uranium and the lowest limit of the highly enriched uranium. The SEKAI magazine also noted that the reactor can be remade quickly into a reactor to produce plutonium and that it is a reactor for military use, which can produce highly pure plutonium as well. The South Korean puppets have accelerated the development of nuclear weapons in an integrated plutonium generating and extracting system by adding a research retest facility--a semi-reprocessing facility--when they built the multipurpose research reactor so that the used nuclear fuel from the multipurpose reactor can be directly reprocessed in the research retest facility. On 29 March, Japanese NHK exposed that the South Korean puppets have activated its own nuclear weapons development by a group of specialists in the nuclear research facility in Taedok since 1991, a year before the multipurpose research reactor was completed. The Kim Yong-sam group is today further accelerating its nuclear weapons development on a full scale by openly denying the joint declaration on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and going in the direction of invalidating it. On 1 April 1993, the former South Korean minister of the National Unification Board said that the joint declaration on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula was originally invalidated, that it was time for them to possess nuclear capacity, and that the National Assembly should raise its voice for possessing nuclear weapons. On 9 October, Kim Yong-sam the traitor presided over a so-called security-related ministers' meeting with the presence of the minister of Science and Technology to conspire on the issues of securing a nuclear fuel reprocessing reactor and reviewing the joint declaration on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. Regarding these South Korean puppet's suspicious moves, NEW KOREA TIMES, an overseas Koreans' newspaper, exposed in its 23 October 1993 issue that the independent right for nuclear development had become a frequent subject at the National Assembly. Facts clearly prove that the Wolsong heavy-water reactor and multipurpose research reactor in Taedok complex were built for nuclear weapons development and that the puppets have been secretly prompting the development of nuclear weapons. The Kim Yong-sam group is groundlessly taking issue over our nuclear issue talking about the urgency of the resolution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. It is intended to draw domestic and international attention to the North, while accelerating its own nuclear weapons development behind the scenes and justifying it. Our so-called nuclear issue is a product of the antisocialist and anti-Republic plot of the United States and its followers. Under the special circumstances of unilaterally withholding the effect of the announcement of withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty temporarily in concurrence with the announcement of the DPRK- U.S. joint statement, we suspended all transportation of nuclear materials within the Republic to prove the transparency of nuclear activities, and allowed inspections to assure the continuity of safeguards. In particular, to root out the so-called suspicion, we even made a bold decision to transform the existing graphite moderated reactor system to a light-water reactor system knowing that this would sacrifice the independence of the nuclear energy industry, thus displaying the innocence of our nuclear policy at home and abroad. The South Korean top leader also confessed in a recent news conference that we do not have nuclear weapons and admitted that the nuclear development commotion was to frame fellow countrymen and was a deliberate scheme to conceal the truth of their nuclear weapons development. Even while developing nuclear weapons, the Kim Yong-sam ring is irrationally kicking up reckless confrontational commotions against the North. Instead, it must eliminate [pyegi] its heavy-water reactor and multipurpose research reactor, which is clearly for developing nuclear weapons and immediately stop maneuvering to develop nuclear weapons. It is the United States that blocks resolution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. Instead of fulfilling its obligation under the DPRK-U.S. agreement, the United States deliberately avoids fulfilling it and uses the so-called nuclear issue of the North as a means to fulfill its insidious [pulsunhan] purpose of crushing [apsal] our republic. The United States must stop kicking up unjust commotions to pressure us and deploying Patriot missiles and other equipment for a nuclear war and must not resume the provocative Team Spirit nuclear war exercise. The IAEA Secretariat is also responsible for the fact that the issue of denuclearizing the Korean peninsula has not been resolved. The IAEA Secretariat pointlessly [kongyonhui] found fault with our experimental reactor for generating electricity, whose irreproachability [kyolbaeksong] has already been proven and which has no problem at all, and takes issue with the reactor under unjustifiable pretexts. Rather, it turns a blind eye to [mugin] the military-purpose heavy-water reactor and multipurpose research reactor in South Korea, which have grave problems [omjunghan munje] and turned a blind eye to [kkaraborida] even those reactors which came into question [munjesidoeotton] during inspections. The IAEA Secretariat must apologize for widening the scope of its partiality [pulgongjongsongui pomwi hwaktae] by following the United States in its antirepublic maneuvers and must strictly keep to the principle of impartiality in nuclear inspections. We take this opportunity to express our belief that governments, political parties, public organizations, individual personages, and progressive people of various countries of the world that love justice and peace will further raise their voices of solidarity with the Korean people's just struggle to check and frustrate [choji patan] the Kim Yong-sam ring's nuclear weapons development maneuvers and denuclearize the Korean peninsula.
