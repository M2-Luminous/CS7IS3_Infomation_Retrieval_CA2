FR940106-1-00060 FR940106-1-00011 Chipps Island. The downstream end of Chipps Island marks the upstream end of Suisun Bay. As noted above, low salinity habitat in Suisun Bay has been well documented as an important nursery area for Delta smelt, striped bass, and other estuarine species. Suisun Bay also represents the farthest upstream extent of large areas of shallow habitat. These shallow habitats are more productive than deeper channels (Cloern et al. 1983), and horizontal flows across these shallows bring food sources into the entrapment zone. For some species, particularly Delta smelt, shallow areas near the entrapment zone are a preferred habitat (Moyle et al. 1992), perhaps as a refuge from predation. When the average salinity at Chipps Island is less than 2 ppt, organisms associated with this habitat will be in or near the shallow habitats of Suisun Bay for half of each tidal cycle. Confluence of Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers. The confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers marks the point where organisms associated with low salinity habitat are exposed to the detrimental conditions in the lower San Joaquin River. The higher mortalities and poorer habitat conditions associated with the lower San Joaquin River have been documented at length in testimony to the State Board (USBR 1992, WRINT&hyph;USBR&hyph;2; Moyle 1992, WRINT&hyph;NHI&hyph;9). This location, then, provides a suitable upstream limit for the 2 ppt isohaline. When average salinities at the confluence reach the 2 ppt level, the organisms associated with low salinity habitat will have access to the shallow habitats downstream in Suisun Bay only during the lower low tide point of the tidal cycle. _Period of protection. Changes in water quality that have affected aquatic resources have been greatest during the period from February to June. Under naturally-occurring hydrological conditions, flows in these months were often very large while in summer flow rates declined and salinity in the delta increased. Upstream diversions have altered this natural pattern by reducing peak spring flows and, in some years, increasing flows during the late summer and fall months. The changes in summertime water quality (towards lower salinity) occur during a season when most of the fish species have already completed their spawning or migration (Monroe and Kelly 1992). The abundance and reproductive success of almost all species that live in or migrate through the upper estuary depend strongly on conditions during the months from February through June (Stevens 1977; Daniels and Moyle 1983; Stevens and Miller 1983; Moyle and Herbold 1989; Herbold et al. 1992; SWC 1992, WRINT&hyph;SWC&hyph;1). These species survive and reproduce more successfully when Suisun Bay has large areas of low salinity habitat (less than 2 ppt), San Pablo Bay has large areas of medium to low salinities (less than 18 to 22 ppt), river outflows are high, bottom currents are strong, temperature is low, and the areas of greatest turbidity are downstream of the Delta. Because of the combination of drought conditions and high levels of water exports, these conditions have occurred very rarely in recent years. Therefore, EPA's proposed criteria center on these five months. (2) Proposed criteria. EPA's specific proposed criteria are shown in Table 1. They include 2 ppt salinity criteria at Roe Island, Chipps Island, and at the Sacramento/San Joaquin River confluence from February through June. The criteria replicate the average number of days on which the 2 ppt isohaline occurred at or downstream from each of these locations during the historical period 1940&hyph;1975, inclusive, classified by water year type. Because no critically dry years occurred in the period from 1940 to 1975, the required number of days for critically dry years is based on an extrapolation of the data. The proposed criteria are measured using a 14-day moving average. The use of a 14-day moving average allows the mean location to be achieved despite the varying strength of tidal currents during the lunar cycle because any 14 day period will include the full range of spring and neap tidal conditions.
