We also demand the proclamation of the autonomy of the Banja Luka region and the setting of democratic elections for the assembly and government of the Krajina. This is stated in the statement released by the Banja Luka Regional Council of the Serbian People's Front just before the New Year holidays. We were (?pushed) into battle in order to ensure that all Serbs live in one state, but 100,000 of us were killed in the process. In addition to this, we are threatened by an international slaughter. Our Krajina can live and prosper without Pale. That is why we demand that normal people be allowed to conduct political life. They are lying when they say that the corridor means life for our children, because our children have a greater need for living fathers. Corridors will abound in peacetime, and they will be as wide as our hearts. However, when we say all this, we are openly arrested and persecuted by Karadzic's henchmen. This is stated in the statement issued by the Banja Luka Regional Council of the Serbian People's Front.
