FBIS4-12738 "drnes071_k_94004" FBIS-NES-94-071 Daily Report 13 Apr 1994 IRAQ Paper Notes Western Trade Contacts, Weakened Embargo Paper Notes Western Trade Contacts, Weakened Embargo JN1304100894 Baghdad INA in Arabic 0715 GMT 13 Apr 94 JN1304100894 Baghdad INA Arabic BFN [Text] Baghdad, 13 Apr (INA)--The newspaper AL-THAWRAH affirms that the intense momentum in the number of visits to Baghdad by Western businessmen and trade firms is highly significant, and shows that the embargo clamped on Iraq is almost over. In an article today, AL-THAWRAH, which speaks for the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party, adds that these Western parties hope to conclude business contracts and economic agreements with Iraq pending a lifting of the sanctions so as to resume their transactions with Iraq. The paper notes the many offers Iraq has received from Western companies, including French, Italian, Greek, and Turkish corporations. The paper adds that the business community in Washington and London has not failed to express hope that it will not be denied a share in this competition. It made its position in this regard quite clear in its recent meeting with an Iraqi delegation in New York, a meeting that was held there at its own request. AL-THAWRAH stresses that the strong competition among Western firms and corporations to curry favor with Iraq, and win cooperation contracts with it demonstrates that Iraq has emerged from the bottleneck, and efficiently shown its endurance and perseverance. This also shows that Iraq is an indispensable, important, and key regional player in terms of economy--with which cooperation is essential. AL-THAWRAH also notes the impact of the embargo on the domestic front, saying that the past few years have underscored the excellence and superiority of Iraqi expertise, as manifested in its inventive and creative accomplishments within the context of the national reconstruction drive to rebuild what was destroyed in record time. This has rendered Iraqi expertise a strong competitor. The paper also notes the embargo Washington has been enforcing to weaken and exhaust the Iraqis. But thanks to the wisdom of the leadership and the awareness of our people, the embargo has turned into a factor of attrition detrimental to others. Instead of becoming a heavy load on our chest, the embargo has burdened many European businesses which have not hidden their bitterness over U.S. deception and Washington's obtaining the lion share. These businesses were also embittered by Washington's frenzied efforts to obtain the traditional European shares in the Middle East markets. In this regard, the paper notes France's loss of an airbus deal with Saudi Arabia, the deal Washington has won. AL-THAWRAH sheds light on the serious harm inflicted on Western interests in the region as a result of their resignation to the U.S. deception and intimidation campaign, saying that the most obvious result of this has been the bankruptcy of some 4,000 Turkish companies over the past two years due to the Iraq embargo, not to mention that hundreds of West European and East European firms have laid off many of their workers and employees and been forced to shut down for the same reason. To corroborate its argument, the paper cites statements recently made by a senior official of the Greek Ports Corporation that the halt in trade activities with Iraq has seriously affected the economy of his country. He added that the harm done to Greek ports due to the embargo is understandably equal to the financial revenues Greece has lost. The embargo is also responsible for increasing unemployment rates. The Greek official expressed hope that the anti-Iraq embargo will be lifted so that his country may reactivate its trade and business links with Iraq. Regarding the impact of the Iraq embargo on the Arab scene, the paper cites a report issued by the Arab Labor Organization last week. This report stated that the number of unemployed in the Arab states has risen to 5 million due to the severance of trade ties with Iraq.
