When the recovery kicks in, the new airplane should lure airlines, which will be introduced to the A321 in 1994, and the A319 in 1996. A stitch in time saves nine. That piece of advice from good, old Jean de La Fontaine is still giving Airbus Industrie managers headaches. While the airliner market plunges to new depths, the European consortium--indifferent to the economic downturn--is stepping up the number of its product launches. In fact, it is sending up so many new airplanes that the whole thing looks like a fireworks show. Airbus's A340 quadrijet went into service last February, while its twin, the A330 twinjet, is beginning its final phase of certification testing now. If everything goes as planned, the first A330 should join the fleet of Air Inter, which ordered 15 of them, in December. However, the airline might postpone delivery of the last 10, depending on how the economy looks. There is more. A month later, in January, 1994, Airbus will add a new member to its family with the A321, the new stretch version of the bestselling A320, assembled in Hamburg, Germany. It will be joined later by the A319, the small 130-seater whose 1996 birth was announced at the last Bourget Show. That makes four new programs in the space of four years, or almost one a year. Does Airbus think it is a car manufacturer? Most important is the question of how the European aircraft manufacturer plans to amortize the nearly Fr4.5 billion it has invested in these developments. Its sales are at their lowest level ever (see table). Since 1 January 1993, 58 Airbus orders have been canceled, against only 27 new orders written. That is a negative balance of 31 planes. And manufacturing plants are slashing thousands of jobs: 3,000 at Germany's Deutsche Aerospace, and 1,600 at Aerospatiale's airplanes division in France. The truth is, Airbus had little choice. Most of its new planes were launched before the recession. The decision to go ahead with the most expensive of the programs, the dual A330-A340 project ($3.6 billion in development costs), was made in 1987, three years before the slump began. The most recent arrival, the A319, is an exception, and meets a pressing market demand for small planes to serve airline "hubs" and regional routes. Moreover, as a derived model, the 319's development costs are a modest $250 million. The challenge in the aeronautics industry is to make very long cycles to coincide with the abrupt turnarounds in the travel market. It takes five or six years to bring a new program to fruition, once the decision to launch it is made. And engineers design the new aircraft to last 20 years. That means manufacturers always base their strategies on long-term trends. The important thing is to constantly stay ahead of competitors, for technological innovation is what ultimately pays off. Innovation is what has enabled Airbus, which started from scratch less than 20 years ago, to challenge Boeing by capturing 30 percent of the world market. Its first move was to invent the concept of a large-fuselage, short-haul carrier (the A300). Later it gambled on automated cockpits with the A320. But to confirm its penetration of the Seattle giant's market, Airbus still needed a complete family of airplanes. With its four new programs, it now has one. Even in the midst of a recession, say officials in Toulouse, a complete line "will limit the damage and help sell older models, inasmuch as airlines prefer homogeneous fleets, to save money." The A330 will probably not lift Airbus out of the current doldrums. Its sales have topped out at 127 firm orders since the beginning of the year. On the other hand, Airbus managers are convinced that the airplane and its siblings are vital to the consortium's "rebound" once the recovery kicks in. According to the two major launch airlines, Air Inter and Malaysia Airlines, the A330 is certainly not without assets. It is the world's biggest twinjet, designed to serve both as a high-density (440 passengers) short-haul carrier and a long-haul plane (up to 6,000 km). This makes it extremely flexible to use. The A330 is even more fuel-efficient than any rival to date. It does not consume any more kerosene than the first A300s, and can carry 30 percent more. Outfitted with the same equipment as the A320, 321 and 340, the A330 offers fantastic productivity gains, notably in maintenance and crew training. The same simulators mean the same procedures: A pilot can easily shift from one to the other in a few days time. It is easy to imagine how interested airlines are. "The A330 is a recession airplane," claims Air Inter, which will be able to use it to prepare for a price war in Europe. The domestic carrier plans to employ the A330 on its most-traveled routes, i.e. Paris-Marseille, Toulouse, Nice, Strasbourg, and Montpellier. It will gain about 18 percent on operating costs per seat. Meanwhile, the A340 quadrijet has acquired the nickname "World Ranger" since it captured the record for the world's longest flight this summer in a 19,000-km trek from Bourget to Auckland, New Zealand. The A330, together with its A340 twin, is probably Airbus's best weapon for the coming years, provided that traffic continues to pick up and transporters' finances improve. Both Toulouse and Seattle believe they will. After long claiming that there was no market for an A330-A340 type airplane, Boeing is trying to counter the new threat from Europe with its 777 family. It is running two years behind. Only the future will tell which company took its stitch in time.
