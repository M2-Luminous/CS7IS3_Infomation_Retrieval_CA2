This was announced to INTERFAX by Russian Vice Premier Aleksandr Zaveryukha. According to him, agricultural production in the country's agrarian sector has fallen 13 percent in the first quarter of this year, and "it has proved impossible so far" to stabilize it. More than 30 percent of kolkhozes and sovkhozes, joint-stock companies, and other collective agricultural enterprises, according to the vice premier, "are not earning enough even to pay their employees." At the same time, A. Zaveryukha noted, any attempt by the government "not even to recommend but simply approve a particular approach to reform -- be that the Nizhniy Novgorod or Moscow option of disaggregation [razukrupneniye]" -- meets with resistance from agro-industrial complex leaders.
