The police officer, who asked not to be identified, added that in view of this it is very likely that the peasant patrol members will refuse to hand over the guns that were supplied to them by the government to protect their towns against terrorists. He said that the Peasant Patrols have cooperated actively in the pacification of the country, and that through their active presence Shining Path and the MRTA [Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement] lost a great deal of their prevalence. He said that, unfortunately, the strong economic incentive offered by drug traffickers for looking after coca farms allows the peasant patrols to improve their standards of living, while no alternative development programs have been promoted for cultivating other products instead of coca. Moreover, intelligence service reports state that there are bad armed forces and police officers detached in the area who are also offering protection to drug traffickers in exchange for money. The staff at the Santa Lucia base, which was built with the DEA's support to combat drug trafficking in the Upper Huallaga region, is already aware of the situation. As an example of these charges, the police officer said that the peasant patrols in Pampapalma, in La Mar Province, Ayacucho Department, "do not allow the police to enter the area, and openly support drug traffickers."
