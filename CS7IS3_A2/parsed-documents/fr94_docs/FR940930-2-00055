FR940930-2-00055 FR940930-2-00034 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [Announcement 502] Cooperative Agreement for National Organizations' HIV/AIDS Prevention and Health Communications Programs; Health Communications/Behavioral and Social Science Evaluation; and Technical Assistance Efforts in Support of Social Marketing and Health Communications Introduction The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces the anticipated availability of fiscal year (FY) 1995 funds for a cooperative agreement program with national organizations to support HIV/AIDS prevention and health communications programs; health communications/behavioral and social science evaluation; and technical assistance efforts_all in support of social marketing and health communications. These activities should be designed to increase the reach, effectiveness, and impact of HIV prevention efforts. This announcement continues the HIV/AIDS prevention collaboration between CDC and national organizations that was initiated in 1989 under Announcement 904, Cooperative Agreements for National Organizations and Consortiums to Develop and Implement Effective AIDS Information, Education, and Programs among Constituents. A cooperative agreement is a legal agreement between CDC and the recipient in which CDC provides financial and other assistance to, and has significant Federal programmatic involvement with, the recipient throughout the project. For the Nation's HIV/AIDS prevention efforts to succeed, they must be focused on preventing and reducing behaviors that place individuals at risk for HIV infection. Among the significant behavioral objectives necessary for preventing HIV transmission, CDC has adopted the following three related to sexual behavior: •Young people who are not engaging in any form of sexual activity will maintain this behavior. •Sexually active people who use condoms consistently and correctly or are in a relationship with a mutually faithful relationship with an uninfected partner will maintain these behaviors. •Sexually active people who are not in a mutually faithful relationship with an uninfected partner will refrain from sexual activity, choose nonpenetrative sex, or use condoms consistently and correctly. These objectives cannot be met without the understanding, participation, and support of key sectors of the American public. Coordination, collaboration, and communication between and among all sectors are crucial for successful HIV prevention. These sectors include: 1. Public (e.g., health, social services, and education agencies); 2. Voluntary (e.g., civic, social, health and health services, and youth-serving organizations that deliver education and community services to the public); 3. Professional and academic, the health communications/behavioral and social science and social marketing disciplines that must provide a scientific basis for developing, implementing, refining, and evaluating HIV prevention efforts to ensure effective, behavior-focused HIV interventions. 4. Religious; 5. Business and labor; and 6. Media , including print, radio, television, and entertainment media. CDC has initiated a number of programs that are intended to focus on, and assist in, the development and implementation of successful HIV prevention strategies for promoting healthy behavior reducing or eliminating individual risky behaviors, and strengthening social norms that contribute to the prevention of HIV. These include the Prevention Marketing Initiative (PMI) and the Business and Labor Workplace HIV/AIDS Programs. Specific information regarding these two initiatives is included within the application package. To support these and other initiatives there is a need to build the capacity of the sectors addressed in this program announcement to strengthen HIV prevention efforts. CDC has a number of other HIV-related grant programs. This cooperative agreement targeting national organizations is intended to complement these other programs and to include organizations essential for the development of a comprehensive national HIV prevention program. The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives of Healthy People 2000, a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality of life. This announcement is related to the priority area of HIV infection. (To order a copy of Healthy People 2000, see the section entitled WHERE TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.) Authority This program is authorized under sections 301(a) and 317(a) of the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. 241(a) and 247b(a), as amended.
