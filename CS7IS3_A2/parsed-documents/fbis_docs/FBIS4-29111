It has progressed beyond my expectations." Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] spoke thus during the selection of a successor to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. A political upheaval occasionally moves beyond the expectations of politicians. For Ozawa, who revolved the stage in a drama of a series of political changes from the previous prime minister's announcement of resignation to the inauguration of the new Hata cabinet, the withdrawal by the SDPJ [Social Democratic Party of Japan] and the fall (of the administration) to a minority ruling coalition were undoubtedly unexpected evolvements as well. Ozawa's initial strategy was to link the Hosokawa cabinet's departure to act 2 of political reorganization. His plan was to destroy the framework of the "LDP [Liberal Democratic Party]" versus the "non-LDP" that divided the ruling parties and the opposition and to marshal together a new political force by attracting a portion of the LDP and the SDPJ rightwing with Shinseito and Komeito in the center. Non-LDP Exposes Limmitations The framework of the "non-LDP" forming the coalition administration had already exposed its limitations during the midpoint of the Hosokawa government. In February [1994] the people's welfare tax concept initiated by Shinseito and Komeito was withdrawn due to opposition by the SDPJ and Sakigake [Harbinger]. The liberalization of the rice market and the political reform-related law also faced a "crisis" because of resistance by the SDPJ Diet members. Dissatisfaction was expressed by Shinseito that "under the present coalition framework, a policy evolvement with mobility is impossible." Meanwhile, the SDPJ also intensified its distrust of Ozawa et al for their "strongman tactics." Regarding the selection of Hosokawa's successor, Ozawa tried his luck at "changing the coalition makeup." Support for former deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe was his trump card. His calculation was as follows: The SDPJ splits over support for Watanabe and its leftwing bolts from the administration. The gap is filled by deserters from the LDP. Against this shakeup by Ozawa and his aides, the SDPJ braced itself to resist by uniting with Sakigake party and a portion of the DSP [Democratic Social Party] to which the SDPJ drew closer by its response to the people's welfare tax concept. The moves in search of a marshaling of "social democratic/liberal" forces including a portion of the LDP surfaced, and talk of an "LDP-SDPJ coalition" based on "an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth" viewpoint was heard within the SDPJ. The contradictions within the coalition administration--i.e., distortions between combinations of the political parties and policies, and differences in political methods--suddenly emerged with Hosokawa's resignation announcement. Each party definitely sensed the coming of "act 2 of reorganization." However, given the sudden resignation notice, every party was caught unprepared. An agreement by the coalition ruling parties to maintain the coalition framework and unified support for Hata constituted a kind of "political ceasefire." "The real battle comes two months from now." This was the view of the executives of each party. SDPJ Rightwing Also Breaks Away However, the formation of the "Kaishin" [Renovation] new faction in the lower house raised unexpected tremors within the political circles. As the Shinseito executives admitted that "we underestimated the SDPJ," Ozawa had apparently never dreamed that it would result in the SDPJ's secession from the administration, forcing the Hata administration into the position of a minority government. The greatest miscalculation was probably forcing secession by the SDPJ rightwing forces that had been the most aggressive supporters of the coalition. Even General Seceretary Wataru Kubo, who had taken pains to maintain solidarity with the coalition parties in the face of attacks from the SDPJ leftwing, vented his anger at the surprise formation of the new faction by stating: "There is a limit to my patience." The leaders of the SDPJ who left the government are already making contacts with the leaders of the LDP and Sakigake party. Their mottoes are: "Let us protect the principles of democracy" and "let us be antifascists." Criticism of Ozawa's tactics thus continue. Encirclement by LDP-SDPJ Contrary to the spliting of both the LDP and the SDPJ envisioned by Ozawa, an ironic twist is in the making of an "anti-Shinseito and anti-Komeito encirclement" by the LDP and SDPJ that have sustained the 1955 political system. However, major LDP-SDPJ differences concerning the basic policies of foreign affairs and defense remain, and there is a lack of realism in their cooperation. Their sole unity may exist in their joint struggle for an early dissolution of the lower house and a general election. There are also serious internal circumstances in the coalition administration following the SDPJ's separation. There is fear within Shinseito and Komeito of a decline into a minority administration, and criticism within the DSP bursting forth against Chairman Keigo Ouchi who proposed the formation of the new faction. The Japan New Party is also affected by a fallout among its members. With the inauguration of a minority administration resulting from the SDPJ secession, what is the future direction of political realignment? Will the formation of a policy-oriented framework which is seen as a "temporary ceasefire" revive itself? Without anyone seemingly convinced of it, the realignment drama moves on to the next act. [1 May 94 p 2] [Text] LDP President Yohei Kono used the term "tactics" four times and the term "high-handed" three times in his short statement. "The high-pressure, high-handed tactics of Shinseito does not represent the inherent posture of parliamentary democracy." It was on the morning of 26 April [1994] when the SDPJ rejected the newly formed faction "Kaishin" [Rennovation] and was asked by reporters for its thoughts concerning its secession from the coalition administration. Although he mentioned no names, it was clear that Kono's barbs were aimed at Shinseito General Secretary Ichiro Ozawa, the man behind Prime Minister Hata. Kono had previously maintained that "what Ozawa has in mind is only how to retain his position of power." He once warned Michio Watanabe, who had indicated his desire to join Ozawa in seeking government rule, saying: "The man you are trying to join hands with is trying to destroy the LDP." Strong Reaction Against Tactics "Pro-Ozawa" or anti-Ozawa?" The axis of the opposition which caused confusion in the political situation until the inauguration of the Hata cabinet was, more than anything else, "Ozawa's tactics and orientation." The sudden formation of the new faction "Kaishin" among the ruling parties by Ozawa et al led to the SDPJ's decision to leave the coalition is found in the tactics rather than in the confrontation over ideas and policies. The SDPJ has become an opposition party. The possibility of an "LDP-SDPJ union" is also mentioned. However, there is no reason to expect that a "joint struggle" based on reaction against Ozawa's tactics alone will continue forever. There are many Dietmen within the LDP who also support the policies advocated by Ozawa--for example, his debate for a "ordinary nation" that will welcome international contribution in military actions. The LDP executive branch has tended in the past to avoid frontal argument against Ozawa's policy contentions. It stems from the fear that, if it intrudes, policy distortions will inevitably surface and could invite the party to split again in seeking solutions. "The LDP has remained intact merely as a `ruling party' but with disparate ideas. After it lost its ruling power, those who could no longer tolerate the situation slipped away to join the administration parties. Unless some steps are taken soon, the party will only weaken." Thus spoke an executive of the LDP's Mitsuzuka faction in self-derision while watching LDP deserters form the new party "Mirai" [Future] and the Liberal Party. Being anti-Ozawa per se cannot constitute an axis for reorganization. Ideas and policies that form a "nucleus" are necessary to create a full-fledged framework. In that context, it was the aggregation of the "social democratic/liberal" forces that nebulously took form. Aggregation of Liberals a Difficult Task On 27 April [1994] in a room at the National Diet Library, the following dialogue took place between Hiroyuki Sonoda, secretary general of Sakigake, and Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the SDPJ. [Sonoda] It is risky to join the LDP in its present state. [Kubo] The SDPJ shares the same view. We prefer to emphasize cooperation with Sakigake party. [Sonoda] In order to do so, the SDPJ must change drastically. [Kubo] We understand that. The six ruling parties and the LDP control about 200 seats respectively in the lower house. In contrast, the SDPJ and Sakigake together hold only about 90 seats. It sounds good to say that they hold the casting votes, but one false step could plunge them into oblivion in a whirl of reorganization. The key may be said to depend on whether they will be able to use the experience of the Hosokawa administration as a stepping stone and set a direction based on `realpolitik.' The question is whether the "social democrats and liberals" can display a clear policy on such issues as the direction of welfare and obligation amid tax system reform and the relationship between the Constitution and interntional contribution. Rengo Chairman Yamagishi, who adopts a posture of support for the SDPJ, have any clear convictions, either. There is even a possibility that they will simply remain "reactionary" in opposition to the actions of Ozawa et al. Watanage Is Unconvinced "Policies of the LDP and Shinseito are virtually identical. The shifting alignment of the political parties should have inherently depended on their policies." It is reported that Watanabe, who ended up staying within the LDP, still gripes about his indeterminate feelings to the members of his faction. Watanabe's abandonment of his decision to leave the LDP and the SDPJ's split from the coalition have further clouded the direction of political realignment. Political parties and Diet members must determine their positions before making their next moves. Will it be the "eradication of distorted policies" or "pro or con stance vis-a-vis Ozawa's methods?" The tide toward realignment also involves a quarrel over opposing axes. [2 May 94 p 2] [Text] It was the forming of a new faction "Kaishin" that plunged the Hata administration into a minority ruling party. However, there was a foreshadowing event. Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa of Shinseito had thrust a "dagger" (Komeito Secretary Geneneral Yuichi Ichikawa) called "policy" in the face of the SDPJ that heated tensions to the boiling point. On 18 April [1994] when policy discussions among the coalition ruling parties faced rough sailing, Ozawa met Hata at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and told him: "I will do it. We may become a minority party. We could perhaps become an opposition party. Is that all right with you?" The slogans of "political reform" and "non-LDP" that united the Hosokawa administration faded, and basic policy differences among the parties can no longer be kept secret. Meanwhile, Japan-U.S. economic relations and the issue of nuclear weapons development by the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea [North Korea] are approaching dangerous waters for Japan's diplomacy. Unless its policies are solidified, the "Hata administration," which may be regarded as its final trump card, will soon find itself a blind alley. All-Out Emphasis on U.S. Relations In the policy discussions, Ozawa strongly demanded an inclusion of specific responses to the Korean Peninsular problem including "emergency legislation." He refused to compromise on a hike in the consumption tax rate, giving the continuation of the tax reduction measure which had become a public half-promise to the United States as his premise. Providing the backdrop was his posture of an all-out emphasis on the U.S. relations and cooperations when he said: "After the Cold war, as long as Japan keeps relations with the United States as its axis, our tasks concerning national security and economic policy are clear." For Ozawa, the policy problems are problems of content as well as problems of decisionmaking process. The Hosokawa administration as an "eight-horse carriage" ranging from the Shinseito to the SDPJ with different backgrounds has paid a high price for political coordination. The government's response has been on the defensive, and the Gulf war experience of being viewed coldly by the international society flashes through Ozawa's mind. It is not surprising if he thought that the Hata administration cannot cope unless its mode of operation is changed 180 degrees and a Shinseito-led leadership is established. Outlook of a "Ordinary Nation" In fact, this also constitutes the heart of the "political reform" envisioned by Ozawa. Because of the introduction of the "political party-oriented" single-seat constituency system, the LDP-SDPJ "dango" politics under the 1955 political system and the LDP's "total mainstream faction" politics will be rejected with power concentrated on the prime minister and speedier political decisionmaking as principal aims. The outlook for the future is a Japan that transcends "one-nation pacifism" and becomes a "ordinary nation" actively involved in the world in security terms. Former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita explained the "essense" of LDP politics in a recent lecture. "I highly evaluate the postwar role played by the SDPJ. In our policy choices, it would be just right if we implement three years from now what the SDPJ says." Meanwhile, in the "Ozawa-style politics," the desire is seen to realize in a purer form the policies which the LDP was compelled to advance in increments while paying consideration to the SDPJ. The fact that Koji Kakizawa, who was appointed foreign minister soon after leaving the LDP, immediately advocated a change in the government's interpretation, contending that "the exercise of the right of collective defense is not permitted by the constitution," may be considered as an indication (of Ozawa's style). The kind of assurance that the 1955 system offered to the people, for better or worse, does not exist there. Spreading Rumor of a Government Change in June However, the SDPJ's split from the coalition immediately pushed the policy evolvement, which was targeted by Ozawa and embraced by Prime Minister Hata in terms of its direction, into a murky zone. In the political circles, a view is rapidly spreading that the Hata administration will last at best until the passing of FY94 budget and "a change in government in June" is publicly rumored. At a press conference after his inauguration, the prime minister indicated his strong desire for a breakthrough in Japan-U.S. relations. However, a powerful administrative base is indispensable to change the economic structure through a continuing large-scale tax reduction and deregulation, which are decisive factors for trade surplus reduction, including a rein on the bureaucracy. There is also deep apprehension that how far the prime minister is being seriously considered as the counterpart in negotiations by the United States, which feels uneasy about the Hata administration's future. There is a strong view that the confused political situation will continue for several months, with hints of a dissolution and a general election. Meanwhile, there are no signs of business recovery, improvement of Japan-U.S. relations has stalled, and the situation in the Korean peninsula is fraught with tensions. The price paid by the prime minister and Ozawa is enormous.
