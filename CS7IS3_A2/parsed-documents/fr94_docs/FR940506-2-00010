FR940506-2-00010 FR940506-2-00004 DOC Position: We agree with Akzo. The two lists will not correspond exactly. One list represents the volume of subject merchandise entering Akzo's U.S. warehouses during the POI, while the other represents the volume of subject merchandise shipped from the Netherlands during the POI. In addition, at verification we determined that the list of entries used for Akzo's U.S. duty calculation was complete and accurate. Comment 10: Akzo argues that the Department made clerical errors in its calculation of the ESP offset and difference in merchandise adjustment in its preliminary determination. DOC Position: We agree with respondent. We have corrected these errors in our final determination. Also, see our response to Comment 18. Comment 11: Petitioner argues that Arami and Akzo N.V. should not be consolidated for COP or CV calculations. Petitioner states that while they were clearly related, Akzo N.V. held only a 50 percent equity interest in Arami and their operations were never consolidated for financial reporting or any other purposes. According to both Dutch and U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), consolidation is required when one company holds more than a 50 percent equity interest in another company. Petitioner asserts that the reorganization of the Arami joint venture should not be factored into the Department's cost analysis because this development occurred after the POI. Petitioner claims that if the Department departed from its practice of investigating costs and prices during the POI, it would constitute an arbitrary departure from established practice as well as an invitation for post-POI cost and price manipulation by foreign producers. Petitioner maintains that the Department's reason for collapsing transactions between related parties which do not reflect ``arm's length'' costs is to eliminate any substantial risk of price and cost manipulation between those companies. Petitioner states that the legal and operational structure of Arami was designed so that its operations would not be consolidated under Dutch law. Additionally, petitioner asserts that the actual cost of producing aramid fiber is more accurately reflected by Arami's own books and records instead of its records consolidated with the Akzo Group. Petitioner contends that the companies in the cases cited by Arami do not relate to this case because the companies met the requirements for consolidation and should have been consolidated under GAAP ( i.e., equity ownership was greater than 50 percent). Arami claims that Akzo N.V. exerted significant control over its operation not only in 1993, but in all preceding years. Arami states evidence of this close interrelationship is illustrated by its financing transactions as well as evidence of organizational and operational control. Arami argues that it is the Department's practice to combine financing activities of companies where one company exerts significant control over the other company. It also claims that this is in keeping with the Department's position on fungibility of capital. Arami has informed the Department that Akzo Fibers Aramide B.V., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Akzo N.V., increased its equity interest in Arami to 95 percent effective December 31, 1993. Arami concludes that, based on the fungibility of capital, increased equity ownership and significant control, the Department should consolidate Arami with Akzo N.V. for cost of production and constructed value purposes. Arami states that it was consolidated with Akzo N.V. for balance sheet reporting purposes as of December 31, 1993, and would be fully consolidated on both the income statement and balance sheet in the fiscal year 1994. Additionally, Arami claims that in previous cases, the Department has combined the parent and subsidiary's costs even though consolidation did not occur in the normal course of business. In citing the Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Carbon Steel Butt-weld Pipe Fittings from Thailand (pipe fittings), 57 FR 21065 (1992), respondent quotes the Department as saying: ``*␣*␣* it is the Department's policy to combine the financing activities of a parent and subsidiary when the parent exercises control over the subsidiary ( i.e. meets the requirements for consolidation).'' Respondent also cites the Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Ferrosilicon from Brazil (Ferrosilicon), 59 FR 732 (1994), to further support its claim. DOC Position: We agree with petitioner, and have not consolidated Arami and Akzo N.V. for purposes of this antidumping investigation. The corporate reorganization which was effective December 31, 1993, was not considered by the Department because it occurred subsequent to the POI. Each of the joint venture partners had equal control over decisions involving Arami's operations until the new agreement was signed in 1994. Under Dutch GAAP, if a company does not have equity ownership of greater than 50 percent, but still has control over another company, it is required to consolidate. Since Arami was not consolidated with Akzo prior to reorganization, we can reasonably conclude that Akzo did not have sufficient control over Arami to warrant consolidation under Dutch GAAP. Therefore, consolidation of Arami and the Akzo N.V. for antidumping purposes based on a significant control argument is unwarranted.
