He said this after visiting the modern facilities located some 33 km north of Lima. In the company of Peruvian Nuclear Energy Institute Director Conrado Seminario, Osorio made the following comments: [Begin recording] Osorio: We have visited this nuclear plant and can appreciate its optimum level of efficiency, the high level of professional training, and their excellent skill in handling this delicate nuclear plant, which also represents a security issue for the world. It conforms to the strictest nuclear safety regulations and it is really marvelous. It is a great satisfaction for those of us who have worked together to build this nuclear power plant as it will enable us to continue our partnership -- from a commercial standpoint or through the reciprocal transfer of technology by means of this great work, which is perhaps the most important nuclear reactor in Latin America. Unidentified reporter: Are you hinting at the possibility of entering into partnership to export? Osorio: Yes, there that possibility. Reporter: How could this be turned into something concrete, Mr. Ambassador? Osorio: That is a subject for experts to address. I believe that once the authorities of both countries discuss things at technical level, we will perhaps have -- in the near future -- a positive [words indistinct]. [end recording] That was Argentine Ambassador to Lima Arturo Osorio, after making a technical inspection of the Huarangal nuclear power plant and its 10-megawatt reactor accompanied by Conrado Seminario. The building of this plant, which will also produce radioisotopes used in medicine and in industry, has been possible thanks to the technical cooperation of Argentine experts. We should point out that 35 percent of the electrical energy consumed in Argentina is produced by nuclear power plants.
