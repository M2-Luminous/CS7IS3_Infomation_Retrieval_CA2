He suggested in an interview with Interfax today that Kishinev [Chisinau] would follow the experiment with great interest, however, Moldova did not as yet intend to participate in it. Gutsu emphasized that Moldova would strengthen its national currency unit -- lei, the exchange rate of which had been stable for the last months. "To have our own national currency does not harm economic relations between the CIS states. Moreover, after the Moldovan Parliament ratified the agreement on joining the CIS and the CIS economic union signed by Moldovan President Mircea Snegur, these relations will become closer. We will consider the issue on participation in the customs union and in the single payment zone," Gutsu said.
