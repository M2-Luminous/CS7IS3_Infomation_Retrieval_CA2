FR940516-1-00129 FR940516-1-00008 2. The Budget Act authorizes the Commission to take forbearance actions if it determines that: (i) Enforcement of such provision is not necessary in order to ensure that the charges, practice, classifications, or regulations for or in connection with that service are just and reasonable and are not unjustly discriminatory; (ii) enforcement of such provision is not necessary for the protection of consumers; and (iii) specifying such provision is consistent with the public interest. The legislative history of this provision indicates that the Commission may distinguish among types of CMRS providers in making this determination. Assuming that further forbearance in a particular case would not adversely affect rates or practices or harm consumers under the first two prongs of the test, the Commission tentatively identified two factors under the public interest test of the last prong that could serve to guide its determinations: (1) Whether there are differential costs of compliance with the remaining Title II sections that could make further forbearance appropriate for particular types of providers; and (2) whether the public interest benefits from application of particular Title II provisions are less for certain types of CMRS providers. Thus, in applying the last prong of the statutory test, the Commission asks commenters to identify (1) the benefits of applying the remaining Title II sections, (2) the costs of compliance with any the remaining Title II sections, and (3) whether the costs of compliance with any of the remaining sections of Title II outweigh the benefits. In addition, the Commission asks, pursuant to 47 CFR 332(c)(1)(C), whether further forbearance will enhance future CMRS competition from a diversity of entities. 3. The Commission also asks commenters to demonstrate actual or projected costs of compliance with each provision of Title II that was not forborne, and the extent to which such costs vary across different types of providers. For example, if the costs of regulation are fixed, it could indicate that small CMRS providers are more likely than other types of CMRS providers to be burdened by the costs of regulation. The Commission asks whether there are instances where these additional costs outweigh the public interest benefits of applying the statutory provision in issue. The Commission seeks evidence on the magnitude of any such fixed costs. I. Application of Further Forbearance 4. Commenters should address (1) how the statutory forbearance test applies to each remaining Title II provision, (2) how further forbearance from applying each provision of Title II would enhance future CMRS competition, (3) how Congressional intent underlying each Title II provision would be affected, (4) how forbearance for particular types of CMRS providers would comport with regulatory symmetry and (5) whether there are other factors or alternatives we should consider in classifying CMRS for further forbearance. 5. The Commission seeks comment on its tentative view that there would be no purpose in forbearing from applying 47 U.S.C. 210, which allows common carriers to issue franks and passes to their employees, and to provide the Government with free service in connection with preparation for national defense. 6. The Commission characterized 47 U.S.C. 213, 215, 218, 219, and 220 as primarily reservations of authority and reaffirmed its finding in the Second Report and Order that it was unnecessary to forbear from applying these provisions to CMRS. Section 213 authorizes the Commission to make valuations of carrier property. Section 215 gives the Commission the authority to examine carrier activities and transactions. Section 218 authorizes the Commission to inquire into the management of a carrier and its owner. Section 219, inter alia, authorizes the Commission to require annual reports from carriers. Section 220 gives the Commission discretion to prescribe the forms of accounts, records, and memoranda to be kept by carriers, as well as depreciation rates. Even though these provisions impose no affirmative obligations on CMRS providers, and may have no immediate impact on CMRS, the Commission seeks comment on whether the potential for increased regulation (and any concomitant costs) might have an adverse economic impact on specific types of provides that is not in the public interest. 7. 47 CFR 223 governs obscene, harassing and indecent communications. In relevant part, the statute forbids a common carrier (if the carrier collects payments for an adult information provider using the carrier's services) to the extent technically feasible, to permit access to an obscene or indecent communication from the telephone of any subscriber who has not previously requested such access. This requirement, known as ``reverse blocking,'' applies only if a carrier bills and collects fees for the adult information provider. As a technical matter, then, a CMRS provider subject to this obligation would have to program its switch (should it employ one) to accomplish this blocking. 8. The Commission tentatively reaffirms its general conclusion in the Second Report and Order that section 223 should continue to apply to CMRS. Commenters are asked to address the impact of section 223 on existing and projected CMRS offerings, and in particular, whether CMRS providers are likely to be involved in services that implicate Section 223. 9. 47 U.S.C. 225, Title IV of the Americans with Disabilities Act, requires all common carriers providing interstate or intrastate telephone voice transmission service to provide telecommunications services that enable persons with hearing and speech disabilities to communicate with hearing individuals. Common carriers may select one of several methods of offering TRS, but most have elected to designate a TRS provider or to provide TRS in concert with other carriers.
