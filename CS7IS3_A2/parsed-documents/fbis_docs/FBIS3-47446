A self-preservation attitude is eating away at the civil service community. An aversion to work is becoming conspicuous among those in civil service. At one time able to make even the impossible possible, an increasing number of them observe, "Lately, even the possible is impossible." This is because they are scared. Even while dealing with such burdenless work as the issuance of resident registration cards in a comparatively friendly way, they hesitate to handle work for which they will be held responsible, such as authorizing licenses. It has gone so far that there are even people requesting service who offer to pay workers to handle their problems. [passage omitted] It has been nine months since the civilian government's reforms began. With each sector of society changing at its own speed and intensity, the 870,000-strong civil service community too seems to have changed in various ways. Overall, it is busier and its treatment of even strangers has become comparatively friendly. Government workers even answer the phone differently than they did in the past. Compared to rural areas, Seoul and other urban areas in particular have changed a great deal. One government official compressed the most characteristic of recent changes into six categories: three that have increased and three that have decreased. The so-called "Three Increases, Three Decreases". Audits, anonymous messages and group civil petitions have increased; the convictions of government workers, their supplementary income and desire to work have decreased. The number of audits in particular have increased conspicuously. Several audits frequently happen at once, so much so that it is said they happen at the drop of a hat. [passage omitted] Anonymous messages have also increased markedly. This is so much the case that this saying is circulating: "[The government] failed at economic revitalization, but succeeded at anonymous-message revitalization." Anonymous messages and written petitions from all over are pouring into the Blue House, Integrated Government Building, Public Service Center, Board of Audit and Inspection [BAI] and the Public Prosecutor's Office. "Stabbing-the-persimmon-you-can't-eat" style of groundless, anonymous messages intended to secretly hurt someone are also contributing to this flood. Not too long ago, a saying was circulating in one government office in which a bureau chief was sacked because of such anonymous messages: "Anonymous messages are more frightening than the anti-corruption campaign." [passage omitted] Supplementary income has also decreased. The number of regularly visiting petitioners has markedly dropped. Contact with people who used to occasionally call officials out for food and drink has also become rare. The giving and taking of money envelopes, considered natural in the past, is now something to be done cautiously. Restaurants in the vicinity of government offices are starting to feel the pinch of economic hard times. [passage omitted] The lack of enthusiasm is the same, regardless of rank or duties. Although there may be differences in degree between those in and out of government offices, and between central and regional offices, their problems are similar. The "season of ambition" during which workers were anxious to quickly do people's civil-petition paperwork for them appears to have passed. Now a new habit is forming in them, a habit of checking the regulations carefully one more time to make sure they do not get in trouble. Lying low. Is this a byproduct of the reforms or resistance to it? "Outwardly making justifications, inwardly asking, what am I getting out of it, bureaucrats put class and personal interests first. They consider the nation their possession. Their existence is of a different order, their consciousness full of controlling and interfering. In particular, as a result of their distorted political experience, they think taking bribes fair and proper and hate the prevention of this most of all." These are the observations of one Seoul National University professor. He says bureaucrats by their very nature dislike reform. Although not organized, they show a passive resistance by not doing what they are told or by doing it slowly, he explains. This is a problem at both upper and lower levels, he says. "Among office directors, many only answer the phone. They have those below them do all the work and do none themselves. This is in contrast with the bureaucrats of advanced nations, who sit in front of their computers, working diligently of their own accord. Because of such directors, administration becomes careless. What of those in the lower ranks? Their greatest objective is to get in a good position and make a profit for themselves. It does no good to tell bureaucrats to reform: all they will do is pretend." [passage omitted] One Democratic Party lawmaker was even more critical: "Our country's bureaucratic system is a combination of surviving feudalistic thought, which puts the government above the people, and colonial bureaucracy. To this, add the barracks-style authoritarianism picked up during years of military dictatorship. Accustomed to this climate, most bureaucrats perceive reform to be a loss of their rights, as something inconvenient to themselves. Even while accepting--they have no other choice--the trend toward democratization and decentralization, they criticize it as inefficient every chance they get. Unless the scalpel of a large-scale operation is taken to the bureaucracy, we cannot hope for reform and democratization." Not a few government workers strongly deny this, however. [passage omitted] Insisted a secretary of the Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy [MOTIE] "Far from resisting it, the reform is what we want to pull forward." One assistant grade two official working in the Capitol Building said the following: "Reform is the current of the times. Even if it weren't President Kim, there would have been reform. It may have speeded up a little because of him. Although there may be some government workers resisting it, they are few. I think most are not that way. It is only that they can't move quickly because of the nature of the bureaucracy. This actually guarantees the government's stability." [passage omitted] Under the name of beautifying the environment, district office workers have to go around taking down advertisements off the streets. He says they even wash billboards and signs. Even worse, if a "civil petition" comes in that a drunk has vomited making a public place dirty, they have to go out to clean it, the worker says. One told a story about what he experienced while removing poster advertisements. "Two of us were engrossed in removing an advertisement from a telephone pole. One little kid who was going along with his mother asked, Mommy, what do those people do?' Do you know what the mother answered, then? She said, If you don't study hard either, you'll end up being one of those people too.'" He says it is at times like these that the doubt, what is the use in working hard, enters his mind. Recently, the number of public servants feeling this way is increasing. Let us listen to the words of one grade five official: "Lately, in meetings between classmates or between juniors and seniors, you hear a lot of talk about how empty people feel. The greater a person's expectations of the civil service community, the greater the sense of emptiness. It's not because the profits of the past have disappeared with deregulation. It's because there is a great deal of criticism of the economic departments to which we have devoted ourselves, as if they were an obstacle to our country's economic development and because government workers are thought of as a group of criminals. There are not a few of my colleagues who feel the present government has sold us out for political objectives. It's to the extent that we go in twos and threes after work to comfort ourselves in the neighborhood bar." The grade five official said, "When there were regulations, control was possible, so the work was easy. But as regulations were eased, it became less possible to predict, so everything must be checked and reviewed. Because of this, there's a lot more work to do. There may be those in the front-line windows who say they won't take money and they won't work, but here we have neither the time nor mental latitude to think like that." Criticized by civil petitioners for saying they "won't take money and won't work," there are those who respond, "I have something to say to that." These are the words of one low level, district office worker: "They say that we're saying, we won't take your money and we won't give you an authorization, but is it only the government workers who have been bad? It's not that the person in charge is finding fault, even though there is nothing wrong. There are many cases in which people come with something that cannot be done, "include an envelope [a bribe]" and beg you to do it for them. They ask you to look the other way; they whine and plead. It's giving a break to someone in these pitiable circumstances that is considered corruption." [passage omitted] The attitude of government workers toward civil-petitioners is very negative. The words of one district office employee: "Petitioners think if they only include a money envelope in their paperwork, then it will all go through. If you tell them to supplement this or that point, they just think they didn't put enough money in the envelope. If even then you don't take their money and demand supplementary measures, they apply pressure through higher-ups or send anonymous messages for totally unrelated reasons." Of those around him, "Many have suffered this," he says, "unless the whole of society changes, there will be government worker corruption." "If petitioners don't get their way, they send anonymous messages," says a worker at another district office. [passage omitted] The audits have played a big part in workers' decisions to "work according to the law." "You have to spend two weeks getting ready for one audit. There are a lot of cases in which people can't do other work because of this," said one junior official who works in a district office housing department, "You hesitate to issue a license because you don't know what indications are going to come out of the audit." Having watched inspections of workers below him several times, one municipal office manager takes a much stronger tone in his criticism of the auditing: "Do you think the BAI [Board of Audit and Inspection] people are all clean? Some of them are robbers. In the past, they dealt with all high-level civil petitions. Our country can't work because of the BAI. Hardworking people all get hurt. They are the only ones who like inspections." "There is a lot of disparity between service administration and inspections," says one district-office manager, until recently working in the Seoul municipal office. Contrary to service administration, which actively interprets legal statutes, standing on the side of civil petitioners, auditors end up interpreting the nature of the statutes in a passive way. "Unless they narrow this deviation in interpretation, service administration will become impossible," he said, "We are stuck with the absurdity of being disciplined more the harder we work." Is it not this absurdity which created the self-preservation attitude of the civil service community? To the question, "What within your organization has changed with the reforms?" most government workers answer, "Nothing." There are many who respond, "It's become friendlier," "It's become cleaner" or "We try hard to do right." The observation that the reform is deepening is attributable to this. [passage omitted] Although nine months have passed since the reform began, it is not progressing as it should. Concerning areas in which there were many irregularities and injustices in the past, only auditing is being done. No deep prescriptions for eliminating the causes of these irregularities are seen. [passage omitted] "When the Blue House says `reform,' ministers and vice ministers hear this, come and gather the bureau chiefs together and say `reform.' The bureau chiefs gather those below them and talk of reform; those below them also repeat this talk of reform to the people below them. But they only said to carry out reform. Nobody knows what it is that we are supposed to reform. The same goes for the ministers who came in as a reform force. The minister has to designate something to reform, but to do this, he has to know the work of his ministry well. How many such persons are there among the present ministers?" "It doesn't matter whether they are ministers, vice ministers or senior officials, they can't carry out reform because they don't know anything," asserts a person with the rank of bureau chief working at the Capitol Building. The Blue House is also within range of his criticism. "The Blue House has been telling us to carry out reform, but not saying what to reform. All it does is repeat the vague slogan, Creating a New Korea. But it apparently has no concrete methodology on what and how to reform. It's just saying that government workers aren't moving, without presenting any particulars." [passage omitted] A Blue House source says, "The civil service community has no choice but to be placed in a contradictory relationship: on the one hand, it suffers because of the anti-corruption drive, on the other hand, it must draft policy and implement the reform. Even for this, it cannot depend on the Blue House for particulars, but must find them itself. The direction of the anti-corruption drive concerning the government-service community is not against past offenders, but against those people who do not intend to change." Is this really the direction the anti-corruption against public servants has taken up to now? Unfortunately, it does not appear so. The personal assets registration of public servants is a representative example of this. There were senior officials who in the morning heard from their minister, "Stay just as you are," only to hear, "At the Blue House, they say it doesn't look good," in the afternoon and then have to resign. There was also a figure of the legal profession who had to resign only because the land he bought with money he had received as an inheritance happened to be in Suji-myon, Yongin county. The economic condition of a ministry became the standard of the anti-corruption drive. Too much interest in finances became a cause of misfortune. "Is it 500 million or a billion [won]?" became the line between the guilty and the innocent. People had to be anxious over whether they had left out their sons' accounts when registering personal assets. This has been one aspect of the anti-corruption drive up to now. The reality of the civil service community was that, during the time its members were supposed to be finding their own work, such as drafting policy for the particulars of the reform, they had no choice but to look after their futures and the concerns of those above them. There will be many changes in the position held by the Blue House until now, predicted one senior Blue House official in connection with the anti-corruption drive in the civil service community. "It is true that until now we have mainly treated the problem's symptoms. In the future, however, we intend not to use these measures as far as possible. The symptoms suffered by the civil service community are so severe that by trying to excise some parts we could end up killing the patient. Its reform cannot help but be time-consuming." This shows us the considerable extent of the Blue House's distrust of the civil service. Late last October, a conference of planning-management-office directors from each department of the Capitol Building was held for the first time in a long time. It was set up to discuss the problem of education for government workers, but in the middle of the meeting, it unexpectedly went off in a curious direction. The Blue House's method of reforming the government-service community came up in conversation. The words of one participant: "Government employees feel their work is worthwhile because of four things: honor, promotion, remuneration and job security. That the recent reform wind stole all these away from them came up in conversation. Far from being honorable, the public servant is presently portrayed as a member of some criminal organization, resulting in this loss. Prospects are that the backlog in promotions will grow more severe as the years go by and, on top of this, pay is poor. It's bad enough as it is, but the cold wave of the anti-corruption campaign reduced both legal and illegal income by 30 percent. Job security for government workers is never knowing when your head is going to roll." "For these reasons, government workers have become cynical," he said, "In order to cause a desire to participate in the reform to truly well up from within, we need to raise their morale. Since everything else is working out well, we concluded that each of us through our ministers should suggest to the Blue House that, at least, it often give official recognition to people who do well." [passage omitted] The promotion backlog is now considerably severe. It takes an average of 12.7 years to be promoted from grade five to grade four and 10.4 years from grade four to grade three. In the finance ministry and Economic Planning Board, this still takes 2-3 years more than other ministries. Prospects are that these periods will lengthen as time goes by. [passage omitted] To relieve its severe promotion backlog, beginning last November the Ministry of Government Administration adopted a plural ranking system for the main chief clerk positions in its central departments. Through this, about 269 people were promoted to grade four, even while doing grade five work. The question is how long the effects of this will continue. The promotion backlog is the same at the lower levels. Although there are some who started at grade nine and are now bureau chiefs in central departments, people in the lower ranks cannot even dream of this. At best, 18 years are required to go from grade nine assistant clerk to grade six junior official. Furthermore, in the future there is a high probability that the best one can hope for will be to retire as a junior official. With the best they can aim for being "eternal low rank," there is concern about whether talented people will come into government service at all. Because of this promotion backlog, dissatisfaction is being concentrated on the problem of remuneration. They are asking to at least be given decent pay. The present pay of government workers is reportedly 87 percent of workers at government-run firms. During his campaign, President Kim promised to raise this to 100 percent within his term in office. There are no government workers who actually believe this, however. This is because every president has made the same campaign promise. There is a great deal of criticism over the freeze on government pay early this year. "Just because he's president, does that mean he can change what was put into the budget by last year's National Assembly?" ask some, saying that with the wage freeze the president went beyond his authority. One MOTIE grade five official with 11 years in grade, said, "I take home about W1 million in months without a bonus and 1.7 million in months with a bonus. I was shocked when I compared my salary to that of a man in his tenth year working for Samsung: I made over W600,000 less in the amount actually received." [passage omitted] There are problems with the present pay system, which decides pay based on rank and number of years worked. Rather than increases in pay, it is geared more toward increases in rank, so all must depend on promotion. Some point to this as a stumbling block in the way of the move toward a specialized administration. Also, if the small government is achieved, the bureaucracy may have less appeal than previously. In preparation for this, pay needs to be raised more quickly, to continually entice a capable elite into the government. In an economic department of the Kwachon government building early this year, there was a disturbance when an elite, grade four official said he was going to the private sector and others tried to dissuade him. It is very obvious that if the morale of the bureaucracy drops, it is difficult for the government to be managed as it should. Promotion and pay are not the only factors raising morale. Continuous encouragement is needed capable of awakening a sense of belonging and duty. One senior official used the chariot-race scene in the movie Ben Hur as an example. Ben Hur beat off innumerable competitors to win; there is a direct correlation between this and his handling of the reins, he says. If one looks closely, one can see that the others are whipping their horses, but, without a whip, he only keeps the horses in order using the reins, he points out. It has been the whip of the anti-corruption drive centered around the Blue House which has characterized the YS [Kim Yong-sam] style of reform. Thus, people are heard to say things like, "The direction is different, but the method is the same as that of past authoritarian regimes," and use the newly-coined word, Taechi [presidential rule]. The underlying tone of the reform of the government-service community was also determined by this Blue House-centered, anti-corruption style. Because of this, the civil service community is frozen with fear and self-preservation attitudes are prevalent. A bureaucratic organization cannot be the faithful instrument of a reformist government. Unless the situation is changed, the reform may fail and fade away. But this does not mean that it is okay for civil service reform to stop. Reform must continue, but it must be done with the attitude of Ben Hur driving his chariot.
