Section 86.094&hyph;15 of subpart A is amended by revising paragraph (a)(1) to read as follows: §86.094&hyph;15 NO X and particulate averaging, trading, and banking for heavy-duty engines. (a)(1) Heavy-duty engines eligible for NO X and particulate averaging, trading and banking programs are described in the applicable emission standards sections in this subpart. All heavy-duty engine families which include any engines labeled for use in clean-fuel vehicles as specified in 40 CFR part 88 are not eligible for these programs. Participation in these programs is voluntary. * * * * * 6. Section 86.094&hyph;24 of subpart A is amended by adding a new paragraph (a)(3)(iii) and revising paragraph (a)(4) introductory text to read as follows: §86.094&hyph;24 Test vehicles and engines. (a) *␣*␣* (3) *␣*␣* (iii) Engines identical in all of the respects listed in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3)(i) of this section may be further divided into different engine families if some of the engines are expected to be sold as clean-fuel vehicles under 40 CFR Part 88, and if the manufacturer chooses to certify the engines to both the clean-fuel vehicle standards of 40 CFR part 88 and the general standards of this part 86. One engine family shall include engines that are intended for general use. For this engine family, only the provisions of this part 86 shall apply. The second engine family shall include all engines that are intended to be used in clean-fuel vehicles. For this engine family, the provisions of both this part 86 and 40 CFR Part 88 shall apply. The manufacturer may submit one set of data to certify both engine families. (4) Where engines are of a type which cannot be divided into engine families based upon the criteria listed in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this section, the Administrator will establish families for those engines based upon those features most related to their emission characteristics. Engines that are eligible to be included in the same engine family based on the criteria in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3)(i) of this section may be further divided into different engine families if the manufacturer determines that they may be expected to have different emission characteristics, or if the manufacturer chooses to certify the engines to both the clean-fuel vehicle standards of 40 CFR Part 88 and the general standards of this part 86 as described in paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this section. The determination of the emission characteristics will be based upon a consideration of the following features of each engine: * * * * *
