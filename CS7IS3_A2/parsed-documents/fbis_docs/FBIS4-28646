Kakizawa spoke at the upper house Budget Committee session on 10 June in reference to North Korea's position that, if U.S.-North Korea talks on the issue of suspected nuclear development programs are resumed, it is willing to accept inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Questioning Kakizawa during the session, Keiji Kajiwara of the Social Democratic Party of Japan noted North Korean Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam has said his country is willing to accept nuclear inspections if U.S-North Korean negotiations resume. And, Kajiwara asked how the Japanese Government views this. Kakizawa said there exist differences of view between the United States and North Korea over the questions of resuming U.S.-DRPK talks and the timing of IAEA inspections. He said the matter should be settled in a way to guarantee nuclear inspections by the IAEA. Kakizawa thus said that as far as Japan is concerned, nuclear inspections must come first before North Korea and the United States resume their talks.
