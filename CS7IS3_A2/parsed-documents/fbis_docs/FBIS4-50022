She added that China's Foreign Trade Law, which was passed here today by the seventh meeting of the Standing Committee of the Eighth National People's Congress of China, is an epoch-making event in China's foreign trade history. It will be the basic law in fields related to China's foreign trade, outlining basic principles, policies and a macro-management framework for China's foreign trade. Wu said that China's foreign trade has witnessed drastic development during the past 15 years and, with China's further opening, China's economy will continue to join the world economy and has to be managed in line with international practice. As far as foreign trade is concerned, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) is a set of accepted world trade rules, she added. She noted that China applied for the resumption of its contracting status in GATT in 1986, at which time GATT asked for the unification and transparency of foreign trade systems of its contracting parties. Wu opined that without a foreign trade law, meeting the requirements of GATT is beyond imagination.
