Will Relations Warm?"] [Text] Simferopol -- "There will be no war in the Crimea," our correspondent was told yesterday by Colonel General of the Militia Valentin Nedrigaylo, Ukrainian deputy minister of internal affairs. "We will do everything to ensure fulfillment on the peninsula of the Ukrainian presidential edict on the transformation of the Crimean MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] into a Ukrainian MVD Main Administration." For two weeks now Nedrigaylo has been in the Ukrainian mission in Simferopol guarded by national guardsmen and trying to achieve the resignation of General Kuznetsov, who was appointed by the Crimean Supreme Council as the republic's minister of internal affairs. "Nobody agreed his candidacy with us," Nedrigaylo said. "Kuznetsov cannot be a minister since the Crimean MVD no longer exists. He has never worked at law-enforcement organs and has not taken the militia oath of allegiance to Ukraine. We will not be paying him or his nonexistent minister. Consequently, our deputy minister Colonel Chernyshov should head the Main Administration for the Crimea at the decision of the Ukrainian MVD. The size of the militia in Ukraine is currently larger than the size of the Defense Ministry. We could have removed Kuznetsov by force long ago and made the Crimean militia carry out the Ukrainian president's edict. But we do not need bloodshed." Across the road, guarded by the "Berkut" Crimean Special-Purpose Militia Unit, stand people loyal to their disgraced general guarding staffers from the former Crimean MVD. "Leonid Kravchuk's actions are illegal," Valeriy Kuznetsov complained. "He has broken the law ratified two years ago by the Ukrainian and Crimean parliaments on the demarcation of powers between Kiev and Simferopol. Under the Crimean Constitution I was appointed a minister in the republic's Supreme Council, and only the Supreme Council and President Yuriy Meshkov can remove me. As for my pay, I do not need any -- my Afghan pension suffices. Moreover, the Crimean militia has now begun to be financed out of the Simferopol rather than Kiev budget." Each of these generals now has his own version of the truth. Their own concepts of honor and duty, their own treasury, their own security, and their own troops. And the hardest task for them is to prevent gunfire, which could lead to a conflict with unpredictable consequences. In order to resolve this situation Simferopol and Kiev are impatiently waiting for the next round of talks between the Ukrainian and Crimean parliaments. There is relative calm on the streets of Simferopol. But at Yalta, on the southern coast, the sanatoriums are still empty and a bucket of cherries costs the equivalent of 4,000 rubles. Bread is half the price it is in Kiev and a quarter of the Moscow price. For the first time the price of fuel has gone down, and the station tanks are full of Russian solar oil. If you have rubles you can feel good and relax in the Crimea. The sea is warm. Is it not time for a warming of the relationship between the politicians of Ukraine, Russia, and Crimea?
