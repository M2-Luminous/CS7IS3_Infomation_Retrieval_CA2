Moreover, our country does not exclude the possibility of promising to further adjust the size of tariff reductions, with which the U.S. side is dissatisfied. Our country's delegation to GATT consultations will leave by plane for the United States next Tuesday [10 May] to begin the second round of bilateral GATT consultations with the U.S. side. Meanwhile, the Board of Foreign Trade has completed the plan for categorizing import goods, which will go into effect on 1 July. On that day, 92 percent of the goods on our country's import categorization list will be allowed into the country without licenses, bringing to 2 percent the proportion of goods subject to import restrictions. By taking this action, Taiwan will truly move toward export and import liberalization.
