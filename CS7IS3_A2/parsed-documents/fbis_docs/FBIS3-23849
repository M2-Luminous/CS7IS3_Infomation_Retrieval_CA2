Hopes, doubts, alarms -- these are feelings very familiar to every grain grower as spring approaches. Most of the regions sown to winter crops, even the non-fallow predecessors from fall, have good moisture reserves in the soil, and after all, it is they which in many ways determine the growth and development of the crops in the first two months after the regeneration of the spring vegetation. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Average Moisture Reserves in a Metric Layer of Soil Sown to Winter Crops for | |Nonfallow Predecessors (mm) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |1993 |Norm | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Belgorod |169 |110 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Voronezh |164 |106 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Kursk |188 |113 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Lipetsk |149 |125 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Tambov |179 |115 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Volgograd |102 |67 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Samar |148 |91 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Saratov |146 |106 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ulyanovsk |217 |108 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Stavropol |86 |68 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Rostov |131 |62 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Tatarstan |160 |135 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Bashkortostan |169 |129 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Orenburg |166 |73 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- At the same time, the soil's content of nutrients is extremely meager. Last year's negative balance of them, when the removal with the crops and weeds exceeded the intake with mineral and organic fertilizers by a factor of three, had its effect. According to the data of soil diagnosticians, the already small reserves of nitrogen were washed from the top soil to deeper layers. In virtually all the areas, the winter grain had to be given supplementary feeding with nitrogen fertilizers, and in intensive farming -- double supplementary feeding with complex fertilizers cut into the soil with grain seeders. Predictions are that root rot will be widespread in spring, and to combat it, in addition to fungicides, we widely recommend the use of liquid complex fertilizers, phosphorus and potassium solutions. This not only reduces the damage to the plants due to fungus disease, but also increases the stalk's resistance to lodging. For more productive use of ground equipment and agricultural aviation, it is advisable to make wide use of tank mixtures of fertilizers, pesticides and retardants. The moisture reserves in the soil make it possible to predict the high efficiency of local use of fertilizers when spring wheat and corn crops are planted: each kilogram of nutrients will make it possible to obtain an additional 5-7 kilograms, converted to grain, of products. Last year, despite the sharp rise in prices for mineral fertilizers, every ruble spent for their application became 1.5-2 rubles net profit. Unfortunately, because of financial difficulties and a lack of money in the rural commodity producers' accounts, the warehouses of the farms and Selkhozkhimiya rayon associations stand empty. Many chemical combines suspended production in December-January for the same reason. There is no clarity with respect to the supply of aviation gasoline -- and time is not standing still. One recalls the sad experience of last year. When the agricultural producers rushed to look for fertilizers in April-May, the jobbing demand for them began. Things got to the point where the government was forced to forbid the export of fertilizers outside Russia for two months, but, despite the measures taken, the chemical industry could not, just like that, fully satisfy the peasants' demand. One way of getting out of the situation that has been created can be seen -- to come to an agreement with the chemical enterprises on shipping mineral fertilizers and pesticides to the warehouses of the Selkhozkhimiya rayon associations, without pre-payment, for responsible storage. This will make possible fuller use of the production capacities of the Selkhozkhimiya supplying enterprises and storages, and the agricultural producers will gain the possibility of carrying out agrochemical and protective work in the necessary amounts and in better agrotechnical periods.
