His constant frown gives his face a severity which is only softened by the sad kindness of his gaze and gray hair. Jean Birara, now former governor of the National Bank of Rwanda and a man who is respected in his country, is not inclined to optimism. Those who have been listening to him for four years know that, unfortunately, he was right. Although a member of no political party, he was consulted by all. He is a northerner and has family ties with people in power, especially in the Army, and he also has the respect of the southern opposition because he was one of the oldest opponents of the Habyarimana regime. The Presidential Guard Against the Army It is this man who thinks that "Belgium and France could have halted the massacres in the first few hours if they had so wished. Do not forget that the Presidential Guard was trained by the Belgians." It is this Guard which, together with the Interahamwe militia of President Habyarimana's former single party, is responsible for most of the massacres. In Jean Birara's view, the two bodies are virtually the same. "The Interahamwes are the Presidential Guard leading the young. It forms the basis of this militia of around 50,000 members, mainly reservists." According to him, "after the assassination of the president, the Guard fought for two days against the rest of the Army which wanted to maintain the Arusha agreements. They were reconciled on Friday evening when they knew that the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] was attacking." Mr. Birara fears the continuation of the massacres. "This can go on as long as there are young people with weapons throughout the country. In a commune in Gisenyi, which has 140,000 inhabitants, the mayor told me there were 50,000 guns." Europe Knew Mr. Birara thinks the Europeans should intervene. He does not believe in an African intervention: There is no satisfactory precedent in this sphere. Mr. Birara said that the European chancelleries knew that the massacres were being planned. He warned the Belgian political world "at a very high level" where people preferred to believe that "Habyarimana was a saintly man" and do nothing. "In 1991, when I was in danger, an application to renew my visa was turned down and I was forced to leave." According to Mr. Birara, Belgian diplomacy in Rwanda changed when, following action by the nuncio -- who, he said was the only ambassador along with Belgian Johan Swinnen who had sounded the alarm about what was being planned -- the Rwandan church stopped supporting the regime. The Massacre Was Planned What was being planned? The massacre. "The list of people to be eliminated numbered 60 names at the end of 1992, 500 in April 1993. At noon on 20 February 1994, Army Chief of Staff General Nsabimana, my relative, showed me a list of 1,500 names just for Kigali. He did not support that plan, drawn up with President Habyarimana's consent. He told me he had succeeded three times in preventing it but that, on the fourth, he could no longer do so and urged me to leave. On 4 April, another officer told me that serious things were being planned and that he did not know whether he would still be alive in a week's time. On 6 April, the attack took place and General Nsabimana was in the plane with the head of state. The latter's removal had been decided by his own officers in October 1992. But secrets are difficult to keep because everybody has relatives in all the groups."
