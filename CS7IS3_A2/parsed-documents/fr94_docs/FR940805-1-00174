FR940805-1-00174 FR940805-1-00017 (4) Request that an order be issued in accordance with the notice of proposed assessment so that the person charged may appeal to the National Transportation Safety Board. (f) Appeal. Any person who receives an order of assessment issued under this section may appeal the order to the National Transportation Safety Board. The appeal stays the effectiveness of the Administrator's order. (g) Failure to respond to notice of proposed assessment. An order of assessment may be issued if the person charged with a violation fails to respond to the notice of proposed assessment within 15 days after receipt of that notice. (h) Payment. A person shall pay a civil penalty by sending a certified check or money order, payable to the Federal Aviation Administration, to the office identified by the agency attorney. The civil penalty must be paid within 30 days after service of the order of assessment, unless an appeal is filed with the National Transportation Safety Board. In such case, the civil penalty must be paid within 30 days after a final order of the Board or the Court of Appeals that affirms the order of assessment in whole or in part. (i) Collection of civil penalties. If a person does not pay a civil penalty imposed by an order of assessment or a compromise order within 60 days after service of the order, the Administrator may take action provided under the law to collect the penalty, including referring the order to the United States Attorney General, or delegate of the Attorney General, to begin proceedings to collect the civil penalty. The action is brought in a United States District Court, under the authority in section 903 of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended (49 U.S.C. App. 1473). (j) Exhaustion of administrative remedies. A party may petition for review only of a final decision and order of the National Transportation Safety Board to the courts of appeals of the United States or the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia under section 1006 of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended. An order of assessment that has not been appealed to the National Transportation Board and an order compromising a civil penalty action may not be appealed under section 1006 of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended (49 U.S.C. App. 1486). (k) Compromise. The FAA may compromise any civil penalty action initiated in accordance with section 901 of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended, at any time before referring the action to the United States Attorney General, or the delegate of the Attorney General, for collection. (1) An agency attorney may compromise any civil penalty action where a person charged with a violation agrees to pay a civil penalty and the FAA agrees to make no finding of violation. Under such agreement, a compromise order is issued following the payment of the agreed-upon amount or the signing of a promissory note. The compromise order states the following: (i) The person has paid a civil penalty or has signed a promissory note providing for installment payments; (ii) The FAA makes no finding of violation; and (iii) The compromise order will not be used as evidence of a prior violation in any subsequent civil penalty proceeding or certificate action proceeding. (2) An agency attorney may compromise the amount of any civil penalty proposed or assessed in an order. 5.
