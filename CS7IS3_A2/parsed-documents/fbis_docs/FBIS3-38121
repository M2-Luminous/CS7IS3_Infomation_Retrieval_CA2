Salolainen, whom we contacted a short time ago, confirms that the European Commission has in practice completed its detailed stances on agriculture. [Begin Salolainen recording] Well, yes, Federal Chancellor Kohl has the opinion that this is still fully possible [as heard] and he viewed very sympathetically the fact that Finland and the other countries applying for membership would become members in the European Union within this timeframe. In addition, he promised his full personal support, his strong support, toward the success of this. He saidthat this is necessary also regarding the general development in Europe, in other words, that a positive signal could be given to the rest of Europe about the fact that the European Union is a developing organization which can expand, and which would also be an example for the Central and East European countries, indicating that they, too, can progress further in the market economy and also toward future membership of the European Union.
