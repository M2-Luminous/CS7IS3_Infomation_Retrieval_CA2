The agreement guarantees the return of refugees and displaced persons in accordance with current international practice, in particular, that of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. A special commission for refugees and displaced persons composed of representatives of the sides, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, the Russian Federation, and the CSCE in its capacity as an observer, will begin work in Sochi in the middle of April 1994. Implementation of the agreement will begin after the deployment of peacekeeping forces. 5. The sides reaffirm their request that the peacekeeping operation begin as soon as possible and a Russian military contingent form part of the UN peacekeeping troops, as stated in the Memorandum on Understanding of 1 December 1993 and the Communique of 13 January. The plan for implementing the operation to safeguard peace will be coordinated with the sides participating in the conflict. The implementation of the operation to safeguard peace should also facilitate the safe return of refugees and displaced persons. The sides again call upon the UN Security Council to extend the mandate of the UN Monitoring Mission in Georgia. 6. Abkhazia has its own constitution and legislation and its corresponding state attributes: hymn, coat of arms, and flag. 7. The sides have held consultations on the division of powers on the understanding that any agreement on this question forms part of the general settlement and will be reached only when a final resolution to the conflict has been found. At this stage, the sides have reached a general understanding on powers relating to joint action in the following spheres: a) foreign policy and foreign economic relations; b) border service; c) customs service; d) power engineering, transport, and communications; e) ecology and the elimination of the consequences of natural disasters; f) protection of human and civil rights and freedoms and the rights of national minorities. 8. The sides have agreed to continue energetic efforts in order to achieve a full-scale settlement. The sides will form a corresponding commission that will work on a permanent basis, taking into account the decisions of the UN Security Council and under the chairmanship of the United Nations, with the participation of representatives of the CSCE and Russian Federation and also international experts. The committee will hold regular meetings in Moscow and Geneva. The first meeting will take place in Geneva on 19 April 1994. A stage-by-stage action program will be elaborated along with proposals for the restoration of state-legal relations. 9. The sides have adopted a decision to implement additional measures on the search for persons missing without trace and reburial of the dead. 10. The sides, proceeding from the principle of the inevitability of punishment for persons who have committed war crimes and crimes against humanity, and also serious criminal offenses, as determined according to international and national law, have agreed to intensify their work concerning the investigation of such crimes with the aim of bringing those guilty to justice. Persons who, with weapons in hand, are trying or will try to wreck the peace process in Abkhazia will also not escape punishment. [Signed] On behalf of the Georgian side -- A.
