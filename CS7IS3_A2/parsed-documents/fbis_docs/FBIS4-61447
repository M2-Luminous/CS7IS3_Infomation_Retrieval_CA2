And this will be the main topic of my meeting with President Yuriy Meshkov in Simferopol 7 May," Ukraine's Acting Prime Minister Yefim Zvyagilskyy told an ITAR-TASS correspondent today. Yesterday's conversation behind closed doors with Crimea's Vice President Yevgeniy Saburov served as a kind of "impetus" for the trip. Yefim Zvyagilskyy was satisfied with its outcome. He was heartened by the fact that in response to the question: "Where do Crimea's loyalties lie?" Yevgeniy Saburov said unequivocally: "With Ukraine." "It was only after this that I decided to meet the president of Crimea," Yefim Zvyagilskyy stressed.
