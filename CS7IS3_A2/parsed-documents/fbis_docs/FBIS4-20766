The Joint Military Committee includes a group of Yemeni, Jordanian, and Omani officers, in addition to the U.S. and French attaches. It is working on separating the northern and southern forces in the areas that have been the scene of some military tension. These sources said that Shaykh al-Zandani opposes bringing the U.S. and French attaches into this committee, whereas President Salih welcomes their participation. It should be mentioned that the committee has already visited a number of military locations and succeeded in defusing tensions and dispersing troop concentrations from some points, especially in the Mudiyah area of the province of Abyan, which had been the scene of a military confrontation after northern forces had come to give their support to citizens of the area who opposed the southern forces from the al-Wahdah Brigade that had come from the province of Hadramawt. The committee also managed to remove the northern forces, that were near the former border areas, from the southern side. The troops that were headquartered in the al-Rahidah area, south of Ta'izz, were withdrawn to the Janad area, east of Ta'izz. Also, the troops along the line between Ma'rib and Bayhan were separated. In addition to this, a military delegation from the Arab League continued its visit to Yemen in order to investigate the military situation that nearly exploded during the last two days. Sources said that the [Yemeni] Socialist Party is demanding that the military committee be expanded and that Arab forces be created. In addition to this, it was announced in Sanaa that that a preparatory committee had been formed in order to create a higher council for Yemen's tribes, and that this committee met the day before yesterday in the residence of Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar, the "chief of the Hashid tribal leaders." It was decided to announce the formation of this council during the next two days.
