Hong Kong's Executive and Legislative Councils (EXCO and LEGCO) were clearly the advisory bodies for the Hong Kong governor, who was president of both councils. While EXCO was the Hong Kong governor's most important advisory and policymaking body, all key decisions of the Hong Kong administration were made by the Hong Kong governor. Almost all of the highest officials in the Hong Kong administration were members of EXCO. The Hong Kong administration's LEGCO, in addition to having appointments of some government officials as "administration-defense members," also recruited some outstanding public figures from areas, such as industrial and commercial circles, the professional world, and mid- and upper-level figures from certain community groups. The Hong Kong public elected each year 10 outstanding young people, a great many of whom, such as Li P'eng-fei [2621 7720 7378] and Li Chu-ming [2621 2691 6900], were recruited by the Hong Kong government to take part in the administration. These figures took part in the administration in an advisory capacity, having no decisionmaking authority. While EXCO proposals were submitted for discussion to LEGCO, which could propose ammendments, the final decisionmaking authority on their acceptance rested with the Hong Kong governor. The Hong Kong administration's practice of this consultative system contributed to Hong Kong's economic development. As the Hong Kong administration had organized an advisory committee of over 300 members appointed by the Hong Kong administration, including outstanding figures from all walks of life, it was said that the administration was an outstanding regime. Generally speaking, whenever there was an issue, a particular profession had any legislative problems, or the government proposed a program, the pertinent departments would solicit opinions from the advisory committee, whose views were submitted to the pertinent departments, EXCO, and the Hong Kong governor for either adoption or ammendment. While this consultative system was essentially within the Hong Kong governor's monopoly-power political framework, it did enable the Hong Kong governor within certain limits to give a little "democracy" to mid- and upper social levels, providing them with opportunities to both learn about government decisions in advance, as well as to express their opinions, so could be said to be a certain degree of "participatory" or "representative" government. Hong Kong's 19 district assemblies were also part of the consultative framework, aimed at providing residents with a certain degree of participation in district affairs. These district assemblies mostly joined grassroots mid- or lower- levels, with each district assembly carrying out a "plan for meeting with residents," so that residents from the district could make appointments for meetings with district assembly members, in order to express their views on any district matters, and propose means of making improvements. Hong Kong's 19 districts had 71 advisory service centers where questions about government work were answered free of charge, with 127 sub-district committees and over 4,000 village organizations to provide the government with a widespread and quite effective liasion network with grassroots residents. As the Hong Kong administration consulted with residents through these channels, this consultative organization became a key part of the ruling framework under the control of the Hong Kong administration's government affairs office. Hongkongers said that Hong Kong had three governors: 1) the governor appointed by the British Crown; 2. the board chairman of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation who, with his decisive financial might and prerogatives, had become Hong Kong's financial "governor"; 3) the Racing Association, which could be said to be the psychological ruler of quite a few Hongkongers. The Racing Association held horse races twice a week for four months out of the year (June through September), with the betting reaching tens of millions of dollars [HK] a race, hundreds of millions a racing day, 12 billion for all of 1983, and over 30 billion by the eve of my departure in 1989. Hong Kong had two horserace tracks, the older one dirt and the newer sand, where each race not only saw the stands packed with tens of thousands of people, but also included offtrack bettors, attracting up to a million people, all of whom hoped to win. Every week brought two chances for several bettors to get rick quick and become mid- and small-size millionaires, while others went bankrupt and committed suicide. I held that while most people could be said to be "willing taxpayers" for the government, the Racing Association acted as a narcotic to make residents unconsciously satisfied with the status quo, with many trying to get rich by luck instead of looking for other routes to wealth. There was also a lottery, which twice a week created several millionaires and nouveau riches, playing the same role. As British Hong Kong rule was quite successful, the mid and upper levels of society certainly did not essentially contain any organized mindset to overthrow colonial rule, developing a rather widespread dependent mentality instead. As Hong Kong's upper levels, and even quite a few mid-level figures, lacked political independence, it must be said that Britain's colonial rule in this case was successful. The Hong Kong administration also awarded each year several imperial decorations of various grades, such as "Gentleman of Peace" and "OBE," which were conferred on outstanding public figures from all walks of life by the Hong Kong governor himself, or even by the Queen, as well as rewarding administration officials for "achievements or contributions," thus winning over Hongkongers' hearts, giving them a sense of honor and belonging. But other Hongkongers poked fun at these decorations, calling them "Dutch water (soda) bottlecaps." Generally speaking, the Hong Kong administration formed the structure for rule of Hong Kong by the Hong Kong administraion through the law, the police, the military, and the consultative organization, accompanied by social organizations, such as the Racing Association, charitable institutions, and churches. British rule in Hong Kong was a sort of "benevolent" dictatorship. Or it could be called conciliatory rule with a large degree of freedom. While it was not democratic, it did give people, without threatening British colonial rule, various opportunities to vent their discontent or dissent, which discontent and dissent was heard and ameliorated to a certain extent. The third feature of the Hong Kong administration was that it had a civil service. The Hong Kong administration's various departments were essentially composed of permanent staffs, who needed certain qualifications (such as professional knowledge), but had lifetime employment through set procedures of internal training and promotions. Moreover, officials had only to swear allegiance to the British Crown, not being troubled with the problem of having to maintain neutrality in party struggles, giving them an even greater sense of dedication. These three major features of the Hong Kong administration showed that British rule in Hong Kong for the last century plus, particularly the last several decades, had been successful in maintaining Hong Kong's stability, particularly its economic growth in the last two decades. So when drawing up the Basic Law, we needed to notice and utilize this, discarding its colonialism, assimilating its freedom, and developing its democracy, as one of our key grounds for establishing after 1997 a highly autonomous democratic system with prosperity and stability.
