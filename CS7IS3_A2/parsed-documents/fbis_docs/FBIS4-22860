Kiselev, SIBRAE, RNTs [expansions not given] Kurchatov Institute] [Abstract] Bending of reinforcing cables is found to have a substantial effect on the stressing of the jacket in the driving zone, and this must be considered in the design of this zone. Particular attention must be focused on sections where stretching stresses caused by bending are not compensated. Analysis of the stressing of the driving zone must also consider the effect of all bent reinforcement elements using programs that consider their actual trajectories and friction.
