Blunt, HUD (202) 708&hyph;4214. Date: July 28, 1994. Supporting Statement for Information Collection for Notice of Funding Availability for Youth Apprenticeship Programs A. Justification 1. This information collection is required in connection with the issuance of a Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) which announces the availability of $10,000,000 for Youth Apprenticeship Programs for Fiscal Year 1994. The Youth Apprenticeship Program is authorized by the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act for 1993 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;124, approved October 28, 1993). Under the program, grants will be provided to public housing agencies that have been awarded a grant under the Urban Revitalization Demonstration Program (URD) to initiate a joint labor-management organization youth apprenticeship program in that city's URD community. _Section IE(5) requires HAs to develop a process for resident involvement, consultation and comment on proposed applications. _Section II (entirety), Application submission Requirements: description of Program, agreements, narratives, and certifications. _Section I.G., Reports, requires HAs to submit an annual progress report for evaluation purposes, regarding the effectiveness of the Youth Apprenticeship Program in meeting its purpose. A copy of the NOFA is attached. HAs that are interested in participating in the program will use an application kit. 2. The information provided by the applicants will be reviewed and evaluated against the ranking factors contained in the NOFA for possible funding. The applicants will be notified of their selection/rejection. The information is necessary so that the applicants can apply and compete for funding opportunities. 3. We have considered the use of improved technology since there is no other way to obtain the information except directly from the HAs. 4. There will be no duplication of information. 5. There is no similar information already available which could be used or modified for this purpose. 6. We have attempted to minimize the burden on the public housing agencies by using an application kit which includes all the necessary documents for application purposes and contains detailed instructions for completing the information. 7. The information will be collected on a one-time basis as funding is available for Program. 8. There are no special circumstances that require the collection to be conducted in a manner which is inconsistent with the guidelines in 5 CFR 1320.6. 9. Before and during the drafting of the NOFA, informal meetings were held with Executive Directors of Housing Authorities, Youth Corps organizations, and labor union representatives. 10. No assurances of confidentiality is provided. 11. No sensitive questions were asked. 12. We do not estimate that there will be any additional costs for the Federal Government. The applications will be reviewed in accordance with HUD's existing review and monitoring requirements. Annual cost to the respondent is estimated to be minimal since the application submission may be prepared by the public housing agency. 13. We estimate that the information requirement of the proposed NOFA will have the following reporting burdens: ␣ 1␣ 1Number of respondent 1= 1Frequency of responses 1= 1Hours per response 1= 1Burden hours Resident involvement 3,500 1 16 56,000 Application development 33 1 40 1,320 Annual report 7 1 2 14 ␣␣Total reporting burden 57,334 ␣ 1␣ 1Number of recordkeepers 1= 1Hours per recordkeeper 1= 1Total recordkeeping hours ␣ 33 3 99 n,n,n,n,n,s ␣␣Total recordkeeping burden 99 n,n,n,n,n,d ␣␣␣␣Total Burden 57,433 14. This new collection implements the Youth Apprenticeship Program. 15. The collection of this information will not be published for statistical use.
