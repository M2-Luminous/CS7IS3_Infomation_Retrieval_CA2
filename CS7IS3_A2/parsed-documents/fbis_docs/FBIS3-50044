[Todorov] By no means. In the eyes of the international public, this will confirm that the Bulgarian Government is adopting additional measures on preventing any attempts to violate the sanctions. Changing the commission's chairman will not hurt Bulgaria's international status. [Nikolaeva] You claim that you resigned at your own initiative. Why did you resign? [Todorov] An opinion was voiced that... perhaps the control applied by the commission was not very efficient in the sense that if someone implements steps aimed at violating the embargo, this means that he thinks that the trade economic sanctions could be violated. In this context, I thought it would be better if another person replaced me. Perhaps he would adopt stricter measures.... [Nikolaeva] In the past, you were chief of the prime minister's office. Was your appointment as an adviser on foreign economic issues and secretary of the Sanctions Commission the result of a blunder on your part or an award? [Todorov] As chief of the prime minister's office, I had to deal with a broad range of issues, and I felt incompetent to deal with some of those issues. Therefore, I asked to be transferred to a job that I was more qualified for. I received my new appointment in May, and I think that it was a useful transfer. [Nikolaeva] However, there are rumors that as secretary of the commission, you favored certain companies and persons -- for example, [former Deputy Prime Minister] Neycho Neev.... [Todorov] My conscience is clear and I am completely calm. If ever I wanted to favor someone, I could not do so because there was no mechanism that could facilitate it. The efficiency of the control measures is another issue. It was discovered that new additional measures must be adopted if our country is to really implement its commitments to the United Nations and the international community. [Nikolaeva] Do you mean special services that will control the customs officials? [Todorov] I do not know; I was not consulted. [Nikolaeva] Deputy Prime Minister Matinchev said that your dismissal was decided after [Interior Minister] Viktor Mikhaylov's report on attempts to violate the embargo.... [Todorov] I tried to be useful, especially in the area of measures aimed at eliminating the losses and compensating for damages. I am an economist and my area of specialization is economic relations in the Balkans. As far as control is concerned.... the real control is being implemented by border guards and customs officials. [Nikolaeva] What commission members are responsible for the control? [Todorov] The working group on implementing the sanctions is in charge of the control. [Nikolaeva] Who is the chief of this group? [Todorov] Mr. Kulishev, deputy minister of finance and chief of the "Customs" State Administration. [Nikolaeva] However, you are the one who was fired. Do you have any job offers -- for example, as a consultant for private companies? [Todorov] Well.... for the time being, at least, I have no offers.
