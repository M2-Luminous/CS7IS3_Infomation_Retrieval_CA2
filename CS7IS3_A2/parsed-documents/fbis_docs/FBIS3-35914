"If Armenia pledges to withdraw its forces from the territory of Azerbaijan, Azerbaijan, in its turn, will be ready to immediately get down to talks and sign the (ceasefire) agreement", Foreign Minister of Azerbaijan Gasan Gasanov told reporters after meeting Russian envoy mediating the settlement in Nagorno-Karabakh Vladimir Kazimirov on Monday. "It is profitable for Azerbaijan to sign the ceasefire agreement --whether short or long-term. The republic continues to adhere to the position of a political and peaceful settlement of the conflict", Gasanov said, but hinted, however, that the possibility is vague because, according to him, the Armenian position had not changed considerably and remains tough. "Armenia continues to try and talk to Azerbaijan from positions of force", Gasanov stressed. Kazimirov, who had visited Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh, agreed that the positions of both sides remain tough and urged them to be "more flexible". "We would like to see more flexibility because the interests of the peoples whose blood is shed in the senseless conflict demand an early end to the bloodshed", Kazimirov said adding that Russia is ready to render any assistance in mediating a ceasefire. He expressed hope that an agreement on a ceasefire beginning from this night will be reached and will become the first step towards a complete end to hostilities. The complete end to combat activities should be "accompanied by the pullout of forces from seized territories, by the restoration of transport and energy-transmitting communications, by a return of refugees", Kazimirov said. He complained that the warring sides "underestimate the necessity of an early end to hostilities" without which, according to him, it is impossible to efficiently settle the conflict. Advantages in the military situation may go from one side to another while "people are paying for the calculations of political leaders", the Russian mediator said. Both Gasanov and Kazimirov refused to say whether they had achieved any concrete results.
