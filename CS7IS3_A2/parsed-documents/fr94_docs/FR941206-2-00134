FR941206-2-00134 FR941206-2-00090 The Pour Point of the sample was measured according to the method of ASTM D97. [The] lowest temperature at which movement in the liquid could be observed was determined to be ^62 ○C. From the results obtained and observations made, we are confident that this brake fluid will perform and provide braking under the low temperature conditions of the FMVSS 116 standard, section 5.1.7 and offer the following reasons in support of this: _The fluid passed the ^40 ○C/6 day fluidity and appearance test. _The fluid showed appropriate viscosity at low temperature (^40 ○C). _The fluid showed appropriate viscosity at ^50 ○C (bubble travel time of [approximately] 5 seconds against a requirement of 35 seconds [maximum]). _Any crystallization observed was a soft, non-abrasive gel that flowed with the brake fluid. Further, the phenomenon is fully reversible. _The Pour Point of the sample was measured as ^62 ○C. No comments were received on the petition. The agency has reviewed FBC's petition and supporting data. In two of UCC's low temperature tests of the noncompliant fluid there was no crystallization; however, in another test, five crystals were formed. The crystallization was described as ``a soft non-abrasive gel.'' As such, it appears similar to the ``slush-like crystallization'' which occurred in Dow Corning's fluid. As Dow Corning persuasively argued, this type of crystallization will readily disperse under slight agitation or warming and will not adversely affect brake system performance. In contrast are crystals that are either water-based ice, abrasive, or have the potential to clog brake system components. NHTSA accepted the distinction and granted the petition (59 FR 52582). In its view, the same conclusion is sustainable in this case. In consideration of the foregoing, the Administrator has decided that FBC has met its burden of persuasion and that the noncompliance with Standard No. 116 herein described is inconsequential to motor vehicle safety. Accordingly, the Administrator exempts FBC from the notification requirements of 49 U.S.C. 30118 and the remedy requirements of 49 U.S.C. 30120. However, granting of FBC's petition does not constitute an exemption from 49 U.S.C. 30112(a), the prohibition against offering for sale, selling, and introducing into interstate commerce motor vehicle equipment that does not meet all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards. Thus, FBC cannot release the 61,752 units in inventory for sale in the United States, and must dispose of the noncompliant fluid in a manner that does not violate 49 U.S.C. 30112(a). (49 U.S.C. 30118, 30120; delegations of authority at 49 CFR 1.50 and 49 CFR 501.8). Issued on: November 30, 1994. Barry Felrice, Associate Administrator for Rulemaking.
