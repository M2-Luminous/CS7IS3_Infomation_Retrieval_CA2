Representing the Lao side at the signing ceremony was Bounteng Vongsai, deputy minister of information and culture; while the Australian side was represented by Barley, Telstra Lao branch director. Witnessing the contract signing were Bouasi Chaleunsouk, deputy minister of information and culture; Michael Mann, ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary of Australia to Laos; representatives of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Finance; and senior officials from various services concerned. The aim of purchasing the 50-kw short wave radio broadcasting system at a cost of more than $1 million is to allow all localities and provinces throughout the country to receive broadcasting programs of the national radio station. This is because at present, many regions in the country are still unable to tune in the station's programs. Installation of the system will enable our country to possess a new modern short wave radio broadcasting station to beam radio programs to all regions throughout the country. Installation of this new radio transmitter will be completed within one year beginning on the day the contract was signed.
