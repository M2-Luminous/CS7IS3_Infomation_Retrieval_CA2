Nicole Theisen, whose husband works at a German company's liaison office in Beijing, is fond of sitting in an old-fashioned tea house beside the Temple of Heaven in south Beijing, chatting with ordinary people and enjoying local songs. "I hope that Beijing will have more places like this, where foreigners can talk freely with Chinese people," she said, noting that her hotel is pleasant enough as long as it does not turn into a cage. However, many foreigners have found their own ways to get close to local people. Harald W. Villages, chief representative of the Walter Bau ag Company of Germany in Beijing, often strolls in the streets at weekends and has random chats with passers-by. "Beijing people are willing to talk about the issues of their lives, such as prices and incomes," he said, "and they are also eager to learn about our lives." While China opens wider and wider to the outside world, the number of foreigners living in Beijing is increasing. Most of them are diplomats, business persons, students, journalists and experts employed by Chinese units. The total number of foreign residents in the city is estimated at over 10,000, but there is no exact official figure. Local companies and authorities provide chances for foreigners to mix with Chinese people. The Beijing Foreign Enterprises Services Company, a commercial company providing personnel and administrative services for foreign companies, frequently introduces foreigners to villages in the suburbs of the city, where they may go into any house to visit farmers. Many people bring their children to the farmers' houses, where the kids see goats, roosters and oxen for the first time. But many people prefer to seek fun in the city. Joshua Ureneck from the United States said that young people tend to go to bars and discos which open late into the night. Alex Vander Pol, a student from the U.S., said that the entertainment in Beijing is catching up with that in the coastal city of Shanghai in east China. "But there are still not many places to go in the city," said Joshua who works with "CHINA PICTORIAL". He added that some hotels and parks charge foreigners higher prices than local people. And in some universities, tennis courts are separated for Chinese and foreign students, respectively. "I don't want to be called a foreigner; I want to merge with Chinese people," Joshua said, adding that he hoped these ridiculous things left over from a closed China will disappear soon. Joshua has made his own efforts to break down the barriers by setting up the Beijing Foreign Basketball League last August. The basketball league is exclusive. All its six teams are composed of students and businessmen from abroad. They play each other every week and form an "all-star" team to play Chinese amateurs from other parts of the country. He said that both foreign and Chinese people are enthusiastic about the game. He explained that foreign people in Beijing may be sucked into limited circles at hotels and never get a chance to become involved with Chinese people. "But on a basketball court, you are as close to each other as you can get," he said.
