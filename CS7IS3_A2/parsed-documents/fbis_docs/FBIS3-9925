According to CRONICA, which cited military sources, Fernando Andrade, former foreign minister during the military government headed by Oscar Mejia (1983-86) was the one who tried to force the president's resignation so that Vice President Arturo Herbruger, for whom he worked as adviser until a few days ago, could assume the post. The report added that Andrade's intention was promoting Herbruger's enthronement and then having Congress declare him incapacitated in order to leave the Presidency vacant. According to the sources, members of the Armed Forces knew about the alleged plot since October. The report added that Andrade contacted General Jose Luis Quilo Ayuso, who was removed from his post as national defense chief of staff on 18 February; former President Vinicio Cerezo (1986-91); and Central American Parliament Deputy Danilo Roca, the lawyer who represents the soldiers who tried to overthrow Cerezo. Military Intelligence learned about the plan, as well as Israeli and U.S. diplomats, who alerted President De Leon of a possible attack against him. Nevertheless, Andrade, former foreign minister (1983-86) and former ambassador to the OAS and the United Nations, today denied any participation in the alleged plot, stating that he presented his resignation to Herbruger in December, but it was not accepted until February. "I find those rumors very funny," Andrade said, dismissing the possibility that his resignation was due to his presumed implication in the plot. Roca, a member of the Union of the National Center (UCN), also denied the allegations, saying that "the soldiers I represent were discharged." "Should I get involved in something like this, you will see me at the National Palace, and not talking about an aborted coup," Roca stressed. Meanwhile, during a ceremony also attended by President De Leon, Gen. Quilo Ayuso today denied any links to any "conspiracy" as "some people are cynically saying." With regard to rumors about coups d'etat, President De Leon has constantly said that they are "just rumors," and that the changes he made in the Army on 18 February had nothing to do with presumed movements of that nature. "It is said that some people with coupist intentions have participated in those activities and that there have been meetings among them, but there is no evidence," President De Leon said.
