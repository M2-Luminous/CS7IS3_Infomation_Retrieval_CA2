Following his retirement, Maj-Gen Karakashvili held a press conference and announced that he plans to study in one of the Russian military academies (he has only completed a higher military artillery school; his last position in the Soviet Army was as a division chief of staff). He acknowledged that he had made a mistake in preventing the introduction of Russian divisions into the zone of the Georgian-Abkhasian conflict last fall and he has a positive attitude regarding the future location of Russian bases in Georgia, considering this to be "for the good of the republic."
