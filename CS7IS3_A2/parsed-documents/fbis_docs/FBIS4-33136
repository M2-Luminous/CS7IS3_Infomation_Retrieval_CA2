FBIS4-33136 "drlat106_o_94005" FBIS-LAT-94-106 Daily Report 31 May 1994 Colombia Pastrana on Election Results, Runoff Pastrana on Election Results, Runoff PA0206023094 Santa Fe de Bogota Emisoras Caracol Network in Spanish 1242 GMT 31 May 94 PA0206023094 Santa Fe de Bogota Emisoras Caracol Network Spanish BFN [Interview with Andres Pastrana and Luis Fernando Ramirez Acuna, Colombian New Democratic Force presidential and vice presidential candidates, by Caracol news director Dario Arizmendi and unidentified reporters at the station's studios in Santa Fe de Bogota; from "Caracol's 0600 to 0900" newscast; monitored in progress -- live or recorded] [Text] [Pastrana] ...[passage indistinct] it is incredible how high the abstention rate was. That is where the votes are. These are the people to whom we have to appeal. There are proposals from Antonio Navarro [leader of the 19 April Movement Democratic Alliance], from Miguel Alfredo Maza [leader of the National Civic Consensus], from various candidates whose line coincides to a good extent with my government program. I am looking for Colombians and asking them to vote on 19 June. I am very concerned about this abstentionism. The people are going to soccer games; they are going to the World Cup. We must continue calling on the Colombian people because the Colombia's future path will be in their hands on 19 June. [Arizmendi] Dr. Pastrana, your government platform is well known. I suppose you have analyzed that of Dr. Antonio Navarro. What points of agreement could lead you, as you have hinted, to find points in common between the two platforms? [Pastrana] Basically, fighting corruption. I think Navarro wants to fight corruption. I think that the corruption issue is the main thing we have in common right now. Logically, the issue of peace is too, even though his positions are somewhat different from what I have been proposing. But I think he understands my positions well. Basically, fighting corruption is the main thing we have in common. [Arizmendi] Do you think that Navarro's votes could attract many voters to your political movement, or will many Conservatives tend to be put off? [Pastrana] I think we must develop a new mentality in the country. [Words indistinct] at first everybody wondered how they were going to get Regina Betancourt's [leader of the Metapolitical Unitary Movement], or Navarro's, or Maza's votes. I think this is a mistake. I think the country wants a big coalition, a coalition for Colombia. We are addressing all Colombians. We have to seek out those who abstained. If there is integration, a programmatic agreement, fine, but right now I am flirting with the abstentionists. There is where I am directing all my efforts. I am telling young people, women, Colombians in general that the election results are in their hands. I am directing my efforts at them. [Arizmendi] Are you seeking Navarro out or are you going to wait for him to seek you out? [Pastrana] If there is identification with Navarro, I obviously hope there will be a decision from them. I think the Democratic Alliance wants to hold a convention or a meeting or to use a mechanism that will enable it to decide with which program it identifies itself. But meanwhile, I continue working to try to win over a large segment that still exists in our country. That is where I am centering all my efforts and enthusiasm. [Arizmendi] I imagine you identify more with General Maza. [Pastrana] Yes, we have been talking with Maza. But Dario, I think that more than with Maza, Navarro, Regina, we have to look into what identifies us. I have a government program (?which proposes a change). What I am telling the Colombians, including Navarro, Maza, Regina, and each and every candidate who participated, is that if there are points of convergence in our programs, I am willing to sit down and discuss these points in my own program which we want to implement on 7 August. What the country is tired of seeing is that all coalitions have their bureaucratic side. The country says: Here come the same ones with the same thing. What they seek is positions; what they want is to get votes to reach the presidency. That is what we have to end. That is what we have to change. My proposal is one of change. If it was old-style politics and machinery that were defeated this last Sunday, I can hardly make use of old-style politics and machinery. I represent a completely different alternative. [Arizmendi] Abstentionism reached about 68 percent. You have said you are making every effort to try and reduce this abstentionism and to try and win over millions of indifferent voters. How will you do it? What is your strategy? [Pastrana] I think this is important. Sunday, the people did not believe that change can happen. But it has become evident, and the media is beginning to sense this, that there is a chance for change and that the country can change. This is why I believe that on 19 June, the people will support me and Luis Fernando Ramirez, our presidential ticket, because the people realize now that change can happen, that the machinery can be defeated, that old-style politics can be defeated. This is why I am asking those who voted for me Sunday to vote for me one more time, one more time for Andres. I am sure that all Colombians can make change possible. [Arizmendi] You are asking for just 2.5 million votes. [Pastrana] One more time would be fine. [Arizmendi] Will it be necessary to change your program? Will the campaign change? Something will have to change because the first round in the election showed that apathetic voters were not motivated. [Pastrana] I think that those who voted for us did realize that the change can happen, something nobody believed before. I think this is what will stir apathetic voters: the strategy we want for Colombians. We are going to change Colombia. I am sure they are going to vote because they have seen that change can happen, and we are going to effect the change. In whose hands is it? In the hands of all the Colombian people. This is why I am asking them to support me on 19 June because change is in the hands of the Colombians. It is not in the hands of Andres or Luis Fernando. No. It is in the hands of the Colombians. It has been shown that change can happen. Now the consolidation of this position depends on them. [Arizmendi] You like soccer as much as the rest of the Colombians. What will happen on 19 June, when three of the most interesting soccer games are scheduled? [Pastrana] I was looking at the schedule. Javier told me about it. I say that all those games will be rotten compared to the game we will be playing in Colombia. [Arizmendi] Are you playing for the home team or the visitors? [Pastrana] I will be on the home team. I think the country has to realize that they must go out and vote on that day. The people must understand that we have to make the change. The truth is that we have to appeal to everybody. We must consolidate the ongoing democratic process. I know the voters are tired. Sometimes we think about that. We have had eight elections in four years. In a matter of four years, the people have voted eight times. I think that given that there is a chance for change, people will vote. I am sure that women, the elderly, men, Colombians in general, know that there is a chance to change the country, and they will vote. [Arizmendi] Did you expect to win, tie, or lose Sunday's elections? [Pastrana] I hoped to win last Sunday's elections. Dario, the truth is... [pauses] For me this is a victory. I think that when reading the figures and statistics, many Colombians will be perplexed because they thought there were large differences in many regions of Colombia. I think the country supported me; the country understood my message. There are important aspects, such as the case of Antioquia, where we obtained impressive suport, and the case of the coastal region, which also supported us. They understood my direct message to the coastal region. This holds true for all regions of Colombia. I truly believe, Dario, from reviewing and analyzing electoral figures, Luis Fernando and I are very happy with the electoral results. [Arizmendi] Don't you think you have scraped the pots and pans already? [Pastrana] No, Dario. I think we are just getting started. I think there are places where we can still win many supporters. For example in Bogota. I hold the record in my party for the most number of votes in Bogota for the past 10 years and the past four elections. I also think this is rising. I tried to win in Bogota; nevertheless, we got lots of votes, considering that this is very much a Liberal Party city. What we see, Dario, is that the voting strength the Liberal Party had in Santa Fe de Bogota has dropped to 63 percent. When Barco was a candidate, he got 705,000 votes. The lowest number of votes the Liberal Party has obtained in Bogota was with Samper. He obtained only 416,000 votes. The most narrow difference in Santa Fe de Bogota votes took place in this election. Belisario Betancur also got close to [words indistinct]. I am happy because the number of votes has been rising. I think there is still a lot to be harvested; a lot of work is still to be done in Bogota. [Arizmendi] Are you analyzing Bogota's results with a discredited [words indistinct]. [Pastrana] In our case, votes have been rising. You know that I won [the election for mayor of Bogota] with 330,000 votes. This time, I got 60,000 or 50,000 more votes. I think there is much to be secured. There is still a lot to be done. You know that in politics, people want to be visited; they want you to be with them, to spend some time with them. This is why I think there is much to be reaped in Bogota. I am very optimistic about Santa Fe de Bogota. [Reporter] During the campaign, some sectors accused you of being intolerant of religion because you criticized the fact that your political opponent was being accompanied by Christians ands Protestants. What do you think about freedom of religion? [Pastrana] I totally agree with it. During the campaign, there were attacks I did not answer. I believe in freedom of religion. It is established in the Constitution. I respect the Constitution. Religious groups support us. There are the Christian Democrats, who since last week have supported us in this election campaign. I believe in freedom of religion. I am a Catholic, but I respect freedom of religion and the Constitution. [Reporter] You have no objections. [Pastrana] No objections. We invite all Colombians from all religions and creeds to support us in a government for all of us, without exclusion. [Reporter] What do you think about election day restrictions on journalists and restrictions on information from abroad. You are a journalist. What do you think of the restrictions that were imposed? [Pastrana] Electoral mechanisms have to be established. The government made a decision in this regard. I am satisfied with the information reported Sunday, not only reports in the media but also with the changes in the National Civil Registry. We did not think that the Registry was going to be as effective as it was. This also represents change. I think this contributed to prompt electoral information. I think the country was satisfied. By 2100, the country was informed of the results. [Arizmendi] One thing is the delivery of reports, and we did acknowledge the fact that this was done in a timely, diligent, and very professional manner. Another is the fact that we were not able to interview you or other candidates, or political leaders, so that they could express their opinion on the results. [Pastrana] This is probably an exaggeration. I think that reports are one thing and election results are something else. I think this is fine. I think, though, that a restriction so strict as to not allow the candidates to speak is too much. This has been noted by the foreign media. They said: Well, but we are here. We were not allowed to make our speeches at 2100. At 2100, we told the national government: The available data is valid because 97 percent of the votes are in. If they want to lift the restrictions so that candidates may speak, we are prepared to agree. This is what we told the national government. The government said it would lift the restriction if both sides agree. As I told you, Dario, we believed the election results had been established, that the votes yet to be counted were minimal. But the restriction was not lifted. I do not know what the other side thinks. We were ready to have it lifted that very day. I think it is good that candidates speak out and invite the people to vote, that the president and the ministers, that all Colombians who can contribute to encouraging people to vote may do so. The people are motivated by their leaders, the stars, the journalists. The people like to vote. I think this is good. [Reporter] At 2100, you asked the government to lift the restriction. Did the government invite you to participate in the decision on the restriction, the limitations, the restrictions imposed on the media that day? [Pastrana] The truth is that I was not at that meeting, Edgar, and I do not know if that subject was discussed. Once a good percentage of the votes is in, I do not see why we cannot speak. Besides, I think this is good for the country. For the first time, we are going to have a second round. The idea is that whoever won the first round could speak to his voters and thank them and make some proposals, if they so wished. Clear information was available. [Reporter] You think the government [words indistinct]? [Pastrana] [Words indistinct] I believe the government will issue a second invitation to the two candidates to review this. I believe this [words indistinct] the national government. [Arizmendi] Dr. Pastrana, we have completed the first 15 minutes and 33 seconds. We will break for commercials now; we will be back. [six-minute break for commercials] We are at the main studios of Colombia's Emisoras Caracol talking to Dr. Andres Pastrana Arango. His running mate, Dr. Luis Fernando Ramirez, is also here. Welcome, Dr. Ramirez. [Ramirez] Good morning, Dario. I am happy to be here. Special greetings to Caracol's audience. [Arizmendi] During the previous phase of the campaign, you said that swing voters and independent voters would vote for Dr. Andres Pastrana and for you, Dr. Ramirez. But many experts believe, according to what we have read in the papers and heard via the media, that swing voters, specifically in Bogota, sided with Dr. Ernesto Samper. How do you view this and last Sunday's results? [Ramirez] About the swing voters, I think, regarding what happened last Sunday, that in the polls, the people were asked two questions. One was: For whom do you plan to vote? That is, the people were asked about their intentions. In some polls, Samper came out the winner and others had Andres as the winner. In other polls, there was a tie. There was another question: Who do you think will be the next president? Here, Samper used to win systematically. The voters believed that regardless of how the people voted, for this or that candidate, the machinery would impose Dr. Samper. This is now completely changed. I believe that in the second round of the election, if the people are asked again who will be the next president, I am sure that now, the people think it will be Andres Pastrana. Thanks to what happened Sunday, Colombians now are sure that their votes count and that all votes are needed to effect a change. This is why Andres Pastrana has proposed that each of the 2.5 million Colombians who voted for him secure an additional vote for him. I am not optimistic enough to believe that each one will secure one vote. But, let us say, Dario, that 10 percent of these 2.5 million people, that is, 250,000 people, do secure one vote. The abstention rate has been very high and obtaining 250,000 additional votes is not an inconceivable task. The 250,000 votes will allow us to win in the second round of the election. Here is where the biggest resources lie. This is why Andres has said we are more interested in talking to the voters than to certain leaders. Undoubtedly, 10 percent of the people voted for the minorities -- for Maza, for Parejo [leader of the National Democratic Alternative], for Regina, for Navarro. It is important to channel the feelings of 10 percent of the Colombians who did not find clear solutions in Dr. Andres Pastrana's or Dr. Samper's platforms. This is why we have demonstrated our receptivity to the idea of incorporating the positions and the concerns of this minority, of this 10 percent of Colombians, into our platform so they can feel represented. This is our task. This is why we feel we will do better with the swing vote in the second round of the election. [Reporter] Dr. Pastrana, Dr. Ramirez's answer makes evident that the voters were not convinced there were going to be changes. The people want changes but do not believe changes are possible. Could it be that it is very difficult to convince voters that something is going to change in the country when they see that the candidates continue calling themselves Liberals and Conservatives, which is what people want to forget? In spite of the swing vote that could have gone to your side and the votes of the conservative parties [words indistinct] you remain tied to the past which the people want to forget? [Pastrana] In my case, efforts have been made to put me in a corral, like cattle, and brand me with an iron reading Conservative Party. I think the supraparty candidacy I have been espousing is what won the votes. Thanks to this supraparty candidacy we were able to win Sunday's victory when Conservatives, Liberals, and independents supported us. They will continue supporting us in this election process. I do not believe it is not that we were unable to convoke the country. The people were afraid. The people did not know if change was possible in the face of what has been interpreted as the machinery, as old-style politics. I think the country saw that change is possible and for this reason came out and voted. [Reporter] [Words indistinct] [Pastrana] I am not married to the Conservative Party. That party supports me. The Liberal Party also supports me, according to the polls. The independents support us. Colombians support us. Mine is not a party candidacy. Mine is a supraparty candidacy. Dr. Samper has only convoked his party. The media reported today that Dr. Samper will convoke only people in the Liberal Party. My position is different. I am convoking all Colombians. I continue my supraparty campaign. I have the support of the Conservative Party, of the Liberals, and of the independents, and we will continue a supraparty policy. I am sure that this is what the people want, and we will win on 19 June. [Arizmendi] According to the National Civil Registry, you got 2.5 million votes. How many of these do you think are Conservative and how many from other political forces? [Pastrana] I will answer that by giving you figures, Dario. The people wonder: What is a party apparatus? The Conservative Party won 1.5 million votes in the congressional elections. I secured 2.5 million votes. [Arizmendi] In past presidential elections, the Conservative candidate obtained 2.1 million votes. [Pastrana] We are talking about these elections. [Reporter] Are the two elections comparable? [Pastrana] If we were to compare them, we can see that we have 400,000 more votes. At this moment we have approximately 500,000 more votes, which amounts to the sum of the votes of the National Salvation Movement and of Rodrigo Lloreda in 1990. [Reporter] There are new Conservatives now? [Pastrana] I think they are independent. I think this sector is switching. It has been estimated that between 14 and 20 percent of the Liberals supported me. All polls indicated this. There were many independent votes too. [Words indistinct] if we add the election results of Dr. Alvaro Gomez and [words indistinct] we would be somewhere around 400,000 votes and [words indistinct] Dr. Samper's figures decreased. If we compare the election of Dr. Gaviria in 1990 and the 1994 election [words indistinct]. [Reporter] Don't you think you are being unfair with old Conservative Party bosses who helped you win in some departments? How can we fail to acknowledge Omar Yepes' cooperation in Caldas, or that of Cornelio Reyes, who was president of the Conservative Party Directorate; of Fabio Valencia, who surely contributed to the victory in Antioquia? They are the old political class, the old Conservative apparatus. How will the change affect them? [Pastrana] The country knows that the Conservatives in this apparatus sided with Dr. Samper and there they are. A new country is on our side. This country has acknowledged this in me. [Reporter] Tell us about Yepes and Fabio Valencia. [Pastrana] I have the names of many Liberals: Bernardo Gaitan, Alfonso Luis Guerra, Maria Paulina Espinoza. The different aspect of our supraparty movement is that our Conservative and Liberal party friends and our independent friends are proposing the change. This is where the change is. The old Conservative Party apparatus is not supporting me. It went over to Dr. Samper. We envision a new country, a country of changes, and this is why we secured Sunday's victory. This was possible thanks to all our efforts, those of the country and [words indistinct] in many regions of the country, like the ones you mentioned, but also, in the case of Santander, for example, Luis Fernando secured a large number of voters. No one is giving Luis Fernando credit for this. I think this should be acknowledged. This is what we have been trying to establish: the difference between the old-style and new-style politics. When I was mayor I proposed a movement greater than the Conservative Party. As presidential candidate, I am proposing a supraparty movement working with the New Democratic Force. This is what has characterized me. The country sometimes wonders: Why does Andres support eight unknown senators? This is what an important Colombian magazine said when we made a new offer. I think we have seen that change is possible and that those who sought reelection were reelected to Congress. Something is clear: The country is definitely going to vote for the change we are proposing. [Reporter] Dr. Pastrana, you have acknowledged the fact that you have received more support than the Conservative Party during the congressional elections, and that Dr. Samper obtained less votes than Liberalism obtained in the congressional elections. [Pastrana] The Liberals have said Pastrana was [word indistinct] by the apparatus, but not Samper. I have not said the Liberal Party was defeated. Samperism was defeated. These are two different things. I have been insisting on this. [Words indistinct] with Andres Pastrana. I have even proposed that if the chief of the Liberal Party is Dr. Samper, I will reach an undersstanding with him. That decision will logically have to be made by the Liberal Party. Should Dr. Samper continue to be the leader of the Liberal Party, as opposed to what [words indistinct] Samper proposed, I am indeed willing to talk and hold a dialogue with the Liberal Party. I am willing to talk and to govern with the Liberal Party, perhaps even do better than that. [Arizmendi] Half and half? [Pastrana] I do not know that yet, Dario. I think that to speak of figures now... [pauses] maybe more or maybe less. I have even proposed that all control organizations be in the hands of the Liberal Party. In proposing three people for comptroller, or for president of the Supreme Court, I would forward the names of Liberals. I would nominate them. Let us hope that control organizations are in the hands of [word indistinct] the party, the president. The people like transparency. I personally believe that [words indistinct] to supervise a company, management. I think that what the country wants is that control organizations be in the hands of the party in opposition to the president, [words indistinct]. [Arizmendi] [Words indistinct] majority in Congress. [Pastrana] It does not matter. These are lists with three candidates on each, forwarded by the president. I could forward the list with the names of Conservative Party members, but [words indistinct] other parties. In my case, if I become president, I will send the lists of three candidates to Congress, which will be made up of Liberals. [Reporter] Dr. Pastrana, is political affiliation what makes a politician honest and virtuous? There is the case of the prosecutor general and the attorney general. They are Liberals, and they have proven that they are excellent officials who have earned the highest regard [words indistinct]. [Pastrana] I think the people are more at ease, and this is important. I saw this in the office of the mayor of Bogota. The fact that the Comptroller's Office was in the hands of the Liberal Party produced a feeling of much calm and honesty. I think there should be a constitutional tenet establishing that control organizations should be in the hands of the opposition party. Personally speaking, I believe this would be very healthy for democracy. [Reporter] Would you propose changes to the Constitution that would effect this? [Pastrana] I think I would. I like the idea. I like it because it gives me peace of mind. I think this is true for the country also. [Reporter] In a few minutes we are going to discuss economic matters. [Pastrana] And politics too. [six-minute break for commercials] [Arizmendi] Dr. Andres Pastrana is on "Caracol's 0600 to 0900" program today accompanied by his running mate in the second round of elections, Luis Fernando Ramirez. Dr. Pastrana, what about televised debates? Are you prepared to debate Dr. Ernesto Samper face-to-face? [Pastrana] Yes. I think there will be two debates. I am prepared for debates. I think they are good. We are open to them. I think they are healthy. The law, or a government decree, establishes that two debates should be held. I would like to see and the country wants a debate between the vice presidential candidates, between Dr. Luis Fernando Ramirez and Dr. De la Calle, because they have waged a biased campaign against Dr. Ramirez, and I think it is good that the people should get to know him. The people have started to get to know him in the short time during which he has been campaigning. The people know about his experience and his abilities. I think the country should know about who might succeed Dr. Sotero or Dr. [words indistinct]. I think [words indistinct] until the country gets to know them too. I think that after the first debate between Dr. Samper and Andres [words indistinct]. [Arizmendi] But in addition to the two hours the state grants, there are also the opinion columns and time... [Pastrana, interrupting] I think it is worthwhile to see these. I think there should be clear rules. I am prepared for that. I like them. We are prepared for that, Dario. I think this is important. [Arizmendi] Fine. Now after having invited you, I will speak to Dr. Samper about a face-to-face program with you, and, of course, about a face-to-face between Dr. Luis Ramirez and Dr. Humberto De la Calle within eight days. Here is another question, Dr. Andres Pastrana. What role will people like Fabio Valencia and Omar Yepes play in your government? [Pastrana] Right now they are very important people who continue helping from the Senate. They are prohibited from holding any government post. They were elected and have served their regions. That is what we see in the election results. The electorate punishes those who do not give them or their regions possibilities for growth or development. I think the Valencia and Yepes voters have recognized their work and progress. If there is something that impresses me when I tour the country, it is seeing how grateful people are to those who have served their regions. They and others will become very important actors from Congress. They have significant experience in Congress. With my Conservative and Liberal friends in Congress, with the independents in Congress, we will continue activities to push forward all those bills that are important to the country. Sometimes people wonder if the Liberals controlling Congress will block Pastrana, but I think not. I think Congress has changed. We have seen, in different laws and ways, that there is no room for partisan politics when it is a matter of laws that are important to Colombia. The Conservative and Liberal Parties do not [words indistinct] simply because it is a law submitted by a Liberal or ultrapartisan government, or a Conservative [words indistinct] all of Colombia is represented there. Rather, the entire Republic is not represented there because of the districts [words indistinct] it is truly sad it is called Congress or Senate of the Republic, and yet the Republic is not represented in the Senate of the Republic. If I learned anything during the time I served in Congress, it is that lawmakers (?do think) of the country and work for Colombia. There are major amendments that [words indistinct] (?such) as the amendment to Law 100, and the [words indistinct] a consensus was reached and an amendment that was important for the country was approved. [Reporter] [Words indistinct] [Pastrana] Not when Congress works. If you look at what Congress has done, you see that it approved the law against kidnappings and the Social Security Reform Law. Important laws are being implemented. I cannot recall any of them offhand, but I think Congress has worked and must continue working in that fashion. I think Congress closes ranks when it knows what benefits the country. It is simply not going to block any law submitted by a particular government. Congress has a different view of the country. It is aware of its responsibility. It is aware that the image it must have before the people is one of work and service to the community. I think partisan aspects are often set aside to work for the country. [Reporter] Commenting on the television debate and your encounter with candidate Samper, the consensus almost seems to be that if Samper did not win it, there was at least a tie, although you were expected to trounce him in that televised debate. Some feel this confirmed that newsmen know a little about everything but lack depth. You are a newsman. Andres Pastrana, you are being criticized for that, for your lack of experience and depth, lack of in-depth knownledge of economic topics, perhaps, and for not being mature because of your age, perhaps, since you are not as old as the other candidate. How do you respond? [Pastrana] Honestly, the first thing I would say is that I am not an economist. I am aware of economic issues, and I approach them in a somewhat different manner. Just look at what came out of the debate. Samper Pizano wanted an economic debate. Yet the way things turned out, I was rated as good an economist as he was by the polls in the media. Where he said he was better than I was [words indistinct] however, polls conducted during those days by economists rated Dr. Samper and Andres Pastrana alike. Then, truthfully speaking now, I acknowledge that [words indistinct]. I believe, however, I was able to obtain the substance which is precisely where the country graded me as good an economist as he [words indistinct]. [Reporter] SEMANA magazine published a phrase related to some of your proposals which, in all honesty... [Pastrana, interrupting] ... out of context, Edgar. If it is out of context, Edgar, you know I... [pauses]. You know I am a journalist. You are also a journalist and know that if something is published out of context it is very difficult, especially with just a minute to answer. If the entire sentence is not published, obviously this can be very misleading. If any article of the Constitution is not read in context, the article can be quite puzzling, as you correctly pointed out. Thus, I believe things must be read in their correct context, not simply read as isolated phrases. I believe this must also be taken into account. [Reporter] Dr. Pastrana, what is your proposal for ending mandatory military service? In particular, what do you intend to do to end mandatory military service while financing a professional Armed Forces? [Pastrana] Look, I personally believe that there are clear differences between Dr. Samper and me. I believe he stated on "Caracol's 0600 to 0900" newscast that he does not support an end to mandatory military service. I propose putting an end to mandatory military service. Little by little, the country must professionalize the Armed Forces. How are we going to do this? By investing, investing resources that will allow us to professionalize the Armed Forces. There are currently 23,000 professionals [words indistinct] Armed Forces by 11,000 additional men before the end of his term. It is being suggested that between now and the year 2000, we must find the resources to have 33,000 new policemen; of these, 23,000 will be for the urban areas and approximately 13,000 for the rural areas. I do not think the country should continue sacrificing its best men, the youth, by sending them to fight truly professionals. This is something that the country will have to sit down and think about. The country must decide whether these youths, just out of high school and with a few months of training, can be sent out to fight men with real experience. If the guerrillas do not show a will for peace, then the country will have to confront them with professionals and not with youths who are not qualified to fight them. We plan to apply this to all sectors. In any case, Carlos, the younger generation must be offered the opportunity to get involved in some type of community service. It is not that the younger generation will develop without any type of responsibility. They must interact in their respective communities; they can participate in teaching programs or work in other community activities. I am not sure Carlos and Dario, if sometimes [words indistinct]. I believe they still have a lot to offer. I also believe that the young generation is willing to give a lot more. They are not interested in just standing around on street corners. I maintain that this is the direction in which we must orient the country. That is why I propose to move ahead little by little in progressively ending mandatory military service. Anyone who wants to participate in this program... [pauses] There might be those who would rather go through with their military service because they like it and believe it is the best way to serve the nation. I understand, however, the anguish Colombian mothers are experiencing knowing that they only have one child who is about to finish high school; they have no one else to help them, and their children are being sent to the jungle to get killed by those who are better trained. [Reporter] Dr. Pastrana, it is time for us to take a break. We will be back soon. [six-minute break for commercials] We continue our interview with Dr. Andres Pastrana Arango and Luis Fernando Ramirez. We now turn to economic issues. Dr. Pastrana, it has been suggested that nowhere in your presidential platform are there clear indications of what your position with respect to wages actually is. Do you support increasing wages in general as a way of stimulating demand, thus encouraging productivity throughout the country? [Pastrana] Let us start with the wage base. First, we have to return wages to their real value. What I have been proposing is that we must start looking after the basic staples basket. To accomplish this, we must bring inflation down. Wages must once again revert to their real value. The country cannot continue with the 18 and 20 percent wage increases we had in the last months of the previous year, the 22 percent rise in utility costs, and the 23 percent rise in gasoline prices in the first months of the year. What we currently have is that the wage increase obtained by Colombian workers during the first part of the year has been lost. [Reporter] What would you do to break the circle? [Pastrana] I believe the best way to do this would be by fighting inflation. We must channel efforts in this direction. Wages must return to normal levels. The government must implement an efficient spending program. Nearly [words indistinct] percent is a result of government spending. We must have some concepts straight. First, as stipulated by the Constitution, the Board of Directors of the Banco de la Republica is completely independent and is currently responsible for fighting inflation. But I believe that to a large extent, the government is also responsible for fighting inflation, and that commitment is reflected in controlling spending. [Reporter] Would you cut public spending by increasing public investments? [Pastrana] Exactly. What I have been proposing is a cut in public spending and to give priority attention to the deficit. What we see when we analyze Colombia's budget is, as I have been saying, that we have been going from insignificant project to insignificant project. At this stage of my campaign, I have a very select group of professionals working on how we can cut public spending, how we can select those projects that are important to the country and complete them. It is not a matter of simply earmarking resources to complete these projects. One of the biggest burdens we are currently confronting is that we spend nearly 20 years building highways. We transfer 1 billion [currency not specified] to one highway this year, and 2 billion the next year, and we spend 20 years doing the same thing over and over. If we exercise strict control over public expenditures, I believe we will begin to cut inflation. Most of all what we have to begin to control is the basic staples basket. Dario, what are we currently confronting in the country? Most people are moonlighting because current wages are insufficient. They work by day and then go out at night to work for a couple more hours in order to make ends meet. That is why we plan to work very hard to defend the basic staple basket as well as to work on stopping inflation. Other countries have been able to do it, and I am sure we can do it in Colombia. [Reporter] Dr. Pastrana, I would like to comment on something you just said with respect to an increase in investments in public projects and citizens safety [words indistinct] to the Armed Forces, public projects, the justice system, housing, education and industrial development. If all this increases, this is once again an increase in public spending. Priority status goes to the Armed Forces, public projects, the justice system, public safety, and housing. In this respect, it will be very difficult to undertake significant social investments and control spending at the same time because spending will be directed at addressing social issues. [Pastrana] That depends, since one portion of spending is simply earmarked for government operation and not for public investments. This is why I believe it is important to cut government spending and to give priority to investments... [Reporter, interrupting] [words indistinct] [Pastrana] Not exactly. I believe that what we have to look for is how to eliminate nonessential spending. If we do not invest where we have to, then invite the private sector because I believe... [pauses]. I will give some concrete examples of public investment. I plan to build at least 5,000 km of roads, of which 750 km will be highways -- what we know as four-lane highways -- between the interior and the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. Whom do we plan to invite into these projects? The private sector. I also believe we must attract new revenues. We plan to invite the public sector to take part in road projects by way of a concession system. We also plan to pay for the new roads through a toll system. In the case I have just explained [words indistinct] improvements, building drainage systems. We have received funds from the international banking system. There is nearly $110 million which would allow us to recover 150,000 productive hectares for the country. Overall, I believe we must strive for two things: 1) to prioritize spending to carry out the projects the country demands; and 2) to work hand in hand with the private sector. This is already being done. For example, part of the Santa Fe de Bogota-Vallavicencio highway is being completed through a concession system, and the other part is being built by the government, and the toll system will be managed by the private sector. I believe significant resources will be managed... [pauses] for example, in terms of Decree 100, there are significant resources that will allow the completion of projects through pension funds. We already see this happening in the case of Chile and other Latin American countries that have sought investment abroad. I believe this can be done in Colombia, and I know we will be able to do it. We need the government to invest in social projects, hospitals, and so on, but we also need to work hand in hand with the private sector. There are important projects to be undertaken in the country, and we need to promote investments in order to complete the programs I am proposing. [Arizmendi] Dr. Pastrana, you have said that workers' salaries [words indistinct]. If it were possible, or if you had to make the decision by the end of this year to readjust the workers' salaries, would you base the increases on last year's rate of inflation or on the projections of the rate of inflation of your first year in power? [Pastrana] Salaries must be real. What [word indistinct] would it do if Cesar Augusto [not further identified] were to say: The Norwegian coach earns $70,000 after inflation? What really concerns me is that to speak of salaries means having to speak of inflation. We have to make sure that salaries have true value. Salaries can very well increase by 18 percent, which is the rate of inflation. What can we do, however, if the government and private sector are increasing the rates of public services by 22 percent? Why not seek a agreement? I think both the government and private enterprise must say: If we reach an agreement, the government must then control the rates of public services. The private sector must then say: We will try to reach an agreement on salaries; let us try to recover the true value of salaries. It is not a matter of simply saying: Let us increase the rate of inflation because the government is [word indistinct] inflation. This is not fair to the Colombian people. If we start at 18 percent, the price of gasoline will have increased 22 percent by 1 January. I think it is important to work toward giving real value to these salaries, enabling this money to again have value. Suppose that by the end of this administration we manage to reduce inflation. Now then, what does this mean, to lower inflation? Sometimes people do not understand what this is all about. We must reduce the cost of the average family shopping basket in order to help the people understand. Sometimes we talk in terms used by economists, but we must look after the pocketbooks of Colombians. We must take care of their money. Let us hope Colombians will say gasoline increased 5 percent [words indistinct] that their salaries once again have real value. We must not just talk about decreasing inflation, and then, a few days later, undermine that possibility. [Reporter] Let us talk about coffee, Dr. Pastrana. The way things are right now, it seems the next government -- a government which might be yours -- will have to manage a bonanza or a mini-bonanza. We Colombians seldom take full advantage of our windfalls. When there is a bonanza, we do not know what to do with it, or, for example, we fail to pay higher prices to the coffee growers. Today, it is being said that if coffee growers are paid better prices, this will lead to inflation. What will your government do with the coffee growers if you are elected president of the Republic? [Pastrana] I was listening to a news report that said the foreign trade minister [words indistinct]. As of right now, I would suggest that before the end of his administration, President Gaviria should adjust coffee prices. I would do that right now. I leave that possibility open. I am proposing an increase in the price of coffee. [Reporter] But you feel Gaviria that should do it to prevent you from having... [Pastrana, interrupting] If Gaviria does not do it, my first government action will be to increase the domestic price of coffee. At this moment, I am proposing a 10-percent increase. Conditions are right, and the market has responded accordingly. Today, we are talking about economic and market laws, but these are not being applied to the coffee growers. As of right now, I propose a 10-percent increase to President Gaviria so we can have it before the end of his administration. Also, if President Gaviria does not implement the increase I am proposing, my first government action will be to hike prices 10 percent so the domestic price of coffee will be about 145,000 pesos. I would do that immediately, but I think the president should do this before the end of his term. [Reporter] Wouldn't this hike increase inflation? [Pastrana] Not at all, because we are only paying for... [pauses] We need to reactivate the coffee economy. We have not done this yet. The unemployment rates in the coffee sector are reaching... [pauses] the other day I heard these rates had reached 18-20 percent. Here, you can see that Colombia has become bogged down. We need to generate employment again. We need to increase coffee production. I am worried that Colombia sometimes is left with the idea that coffee production could decline next year to somewhere around 9.5-10 million bags. Today, we are producing between 10.5 million and 11 million bags. The country needs 14 million bags to enable it to start competing in the international market. Today, we do not have that opportunity. We must make investments in our efforts to combat the coffee stalk-borer. The most serious problem is that we have nearly 30,000 hectares... [Reporter, interrupting] Thirty percent. [Pastrana, interrupting] Yes, 30 percent of the plantations are affected by the stalk-borer. The state must make investments. Therefore, I think we have to look into this. I say that coffee once saved Colombia, and now Colombians must save the coffee growers. There are 350,000 households that depend on coffee for their livelihoods. We must generate employment. More than 40,000 jobs have been lost because of stalk-borer problems. Sometimes, I say: Let us not talk about just generating new jobs. Why not start by defending the jobs we have? Where does unemployment in Colombia come from? Unemployment comes mainly from not protecting the farming sector. How can we think we have lost 40,000 jobs in the last [words indistinct] in the coffee farms? First, let us start by defending the jobs we have. Let us give Colombian workers the chance to earn more, the chance to have better salaries. Let us protect the area in which we have lost most of the jobs. We must help the coffee growers. Today, the coffee fund is in good shape; it has the resources, and I think it is a good idea to pay the coffee growers a 10-percent increase as of today, right at this moment. [Arizmendi] Dr. Pastrana, inasmuch as you told us you have another commitment... [Reporter, interrupting] You will have a hard time making it. [Arizmendi] I would like to invite you cordially to a debate on economic issues here on "Caracol's 0600 to 0900" newscast with Dr. Ernesto Samper Pizano. [Pastrana] On all of the issues? Why not talk about all of the issues? The country needs [words indistinct] political and social. We are ready for it, Dario, and we will be in touch. Perhaps, our campaign manager, Dr. Luis Alberto Morelo, will be able to... [pauses] and let us hope Dr. Humberto de la Calle will also be with us, together with Luis Hernando Ramirez. [Arizmendi] Are you willing to go on television, also? [Pastrana] Yes, we are willing. Naturally, this is now up to our advisers. We are willing to talk with them about all of the issues, and we will be able to explain things the way we have done today. We are willing to talk about economic and social issues, soccer, and all other kinds of issues. That is what the country is waiting for, and the country wants to hear our proposals. [Arizmendi] Thank you very much for your visit. We also thank you, Dr. Luis Hernando Ramirez.
