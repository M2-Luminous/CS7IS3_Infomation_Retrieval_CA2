FR940314-1-00038 FR940314-1-00009 Conclusion As discussed in the final rule, these species remain extremely vulnerable to losses. For the Tooth Cave pseudoscorpion, the Tooth Cave spider, the Kretschmarr Cave mold beetle, the Coffin Cave mold beetle, and the Bee Creek Cave harvestman, neither the range nor the number of confirmed localities within the range has expanded significantly since the original listing. The Tooth cave ground beetle and the Bone Cave harvestman occur in more locations and are more widespread than was originally believed, but the expansion of the overall range is not significant and the majority of caves in which these species occur are subject to one or more of the threats discussed above (Reddell, in litt. , 1993). The Service recently released a Draft Recovery Plan for the karst invertebrates (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1993). That document details recovery actions and criteria that, when met, may result in reclassification or delisting of the endangered karst invertebrates. Continued efforts to locate new inhabited caves, to implement habitat conservation measures, and to control the threat of fire ants could bring the karst invertebrates to the point where protection under the Act is no longer necessary. The Service has carefully assessed the information presented in the petition, as well as the best and most current scientific and commercial information, in determining that the petition does not present substantial scientific and commercial information indicating that delisting of any of the seven karst invertebrates may be warranted. These species continue to require the protection provided by the Act because of their extremely small, vulnerable, and limited habitats located within an area that is experiencing continued pressures from economic and population growth.
