FR941019-2-00015 FR941019-2-00014 DELAWARE RIVER BASIN COMMISSION Notice of Commission Meeting and Public Hearing Notice is hereby given that the Delaware River Basin Commission will hold a public hearing on Wednesday, October 26, 1994. The hearing will be part of the Commission's regular business meeting which is open to the public and scheduled to begin at 1:00 p.m. in the Goddard Conference Room of the Commission's offices at 25 State Police Drive, West Trenton, New Jersey. The hearing on proposed amendments to the Basin Regulations_Water Supply Charges will be held at 3:00 p.m. An informal conference among the Commissioners and staff will be open for public observation at 10:30 a.m. at the same location and will include a presentation on New Jersey's management of the Potomac-Raritan-Magothy Aquifer and a status report on the Upper Delaware ice diversion project. The subjects of the hearing will be as follows: Proposed Amendments to Comprehensive Plan and Basin Regulations_Water Supply Charges Notice was given in the August 5, 1994 Federal Register , Vol. 59, No. 150 p. 39991, that the Commission would hold a public hearing on October 26, 1994 to receive comments on proposed amendments to its Comprehensive Plan and Basin Regulations_Water Supply Charges concerning the transfer of Certificates of Entitlement. Holders of Certificates of Entitlement are exempted from the payment of water charges until such certificates are transferred. The amendments would (1) define ``transfer''; (2) delete two categories of exemptions from the existing general rule that terminates Certificates of Entitlement upon transfer and (3) revise a third such category. Commission regulations require upon transfer, the termination of Certificates of Entitlement which permit the withdrawal of water from the basin without charge. The U.S. Court of Appeals has confirmed the Commission's power under its Compact to terminate Certificates of Entitlement when a transfer has occurred. The court also ruled that the Commission's interpretation of its existing regulation that limited the extent to which certain transfers were exempt from termination was not consistent with the specific wording of the regulations. Pursuant to the court ruling, the Commission proposes to amend its Basin Regulations_Water Supply Charges, so that transfer exceptions are consistent with existing Commission policy to terminate Certificates of Entitlement when a transfer of ownership and/or control of a water using facility occurs. The amendments inter alia define a transfer to include the sale of corporate stock. They also delete existing exceptions to the transfer rule for corporate merger transactions and certain transactions under the Internal Revenue Code. Current Expense and Capital Budgets. A proposed current expense budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1995, in the aggregate amount of $3,326,500 and a capital budget for the same period in the amount of $1,937,500 in revenue and $1,481,500 in expenditures. Copies of the current expense and capital budget are available from the Commission on request by contacting Richard C. Gore. A Proposal to Adopt the 1994&hyph;1995 Water Resources Program.
