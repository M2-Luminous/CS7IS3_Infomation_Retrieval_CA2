This is said in the Biryukov's statement sent to the media. The spokesman is sure that under the difficult social and political situation in the country, "one cannot but recollect the promises given by those who were amnestied by the decision of the State Duma [no closing quotation mark as received]. He said that some statements made on Victory Day "indicate that some people forgot their promises." Biryukov said that the amnesty was not an unconditional action permitting further statements and actions. He believes that public statements which could lead to a violation of the balance in relations between the authorities and the country's groupings should attract the attention of the Russian Prosecutor's Office.
