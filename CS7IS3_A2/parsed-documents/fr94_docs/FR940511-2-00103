SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On Friday, April 15, 1994, the Department of Housing and Urban Development published two notices of delegation of authority and five notices of redelegation of authority in the Federal Register as part IV, at 59 FR 18276, to implement the reorganization of the HUD field structure. It was intended that the effective date for these notices would all be April 15, 1994. In error, the effective dates for these notices reflected the date of signature for each document and consequently, ranged from April 8, 1994 to April 12, 1994.
