After taking part in the election, the head of state granted an interview to representatives of the Ukrainian and foreign mass media. You are invited to listen to a report filed by our correspondent Eduard Kotenko. [Begin recording] [Unidentified journalist] Leonid Makarovych, as head of our state and its citizen, how do you envisage the newly elected Supreme Council, if it is elected today? [Kravchuk] There is such a notion in statistics and in sociology as insufficiency of data required for analysis. Because sociologists take either 1,000 or 1,500 respondents [pauses] ... It has its own laws. Well, 90 deputies have been elected by now. At the previous election we elected, as far as I remember, five out of 33 and now we have elected four out of 16. Well, they failed to elect approximately 25 percent of candidates altogether, 20 to 25 in all. If we apply this figure to the coming elections, 25 percent is not the kind of figure that would enable one to say that the Supreme Council will not be elected. At present, we should speak not about whether or not the Supreme Council will be elected, but what will be the first steps of the new Supreme Council, so as to create law-governed and responsible authorities. And I think the Supreme Council should gather, and the deputies, because it is they who are responsible [words indistinct], should adopt at least three laws: On the status of the president, on delegating plenary powers, and on a mechanism of subordinating lower-ranking bodies of the executive power to higher-ranking bodies of power [words indistinct]. Then the election, if it does take place and if those laws are adopted [pauses] ... People will know whom they elect and what [words indistinct] enjoy. If we fail to do this at once, we will create a source of conflict between the representative bodies of power and the elected president. He will then say: Good people, I was elected legitimately as head of state and head of the executive power. And on which grounds are you depriving me of these plenary powers? This often happened to me: First I was granted powers, then I was deprived of them. Well, we somehow managed to find a common language. But if everything boils down to confrontation, we will again begin with what we finished up and we will produce nothing new. This is a question of principle, a question of principle, indeed. I only want a legitimate, law-governed Supreme Council to be elected, based on laws, responsibility, reason, and the real situation. I would like it to be an authority which assumes control and works for reforms, for democracy, and for our independent state, and that it will work on the basis of the law and not on good wishes only. [end recording] [Announcer] That was an interview Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk granted at his polling station during the second round of the election to the Supreme Council of Ukraine. The report was filed by correspondent Eduard Kotenko.
