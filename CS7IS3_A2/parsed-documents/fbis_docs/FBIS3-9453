[Nagy] For Slovakia, its relationships with the Czech Republic and Hungary are most important in the Central European region, at present. The latter is so in spite of the fact that it is not as we would like it to be, Eduard Kukan, Slovak foreign minister, told a Hungarian radio correspondent today. Then he continued as follows: [Kukan, in Slovak, fading into Nagy's report in Hungarian] The outside world views this region in which we live, Central Europe, through the prism of Slovak-Hungarian relations. It is in the interest of the international organizations--and the minister was convinced of this as UN ambassador--to stabilize this relationship, so that the number of sources of tension in the world does not increase, so that this region does not constitute a serious problem for the international organizations. The current Slovak Government observed with pleasure that its first statements, by which it would like primarily to encourage the Hungarian side to start a dialogue, were received favorably by its Hungarian counterparts, the foreign minister said. To my question of whether the start of a dialogue could take place in April, Kukan replied that no decision had been reached on this yet, but a relationship ought to be developed between the two neighboring countries, regardless of the governments that happen to be in power. The Hungarian elections are the country's internal affair, and the people have the right to decide what kind of government they want. The Slovak Government, regardless of what Hungary's new leadership will be like, would like to shape the two countries' relationship so that this leads to a solution of the existing questions, Kukan told the correspondent of Hungarian radio.
