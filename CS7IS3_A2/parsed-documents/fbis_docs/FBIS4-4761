FBIS4-4761 "dreas065_m_94003" FBIS-EAS-94-065 Daily Report 5 Apr 1994 Thailand Political Dispute Impacts on Multilateral Trade Political Dispute Impacts on Multilateral Trade BK0504055894 Bangkok BANGKOK POST in English 5 Apr 94 p 17 BK0504055894 Bangkok BANGKOK POST English BFN [Text] The continuing dispute between the Government and the Opposition-plus-Senators has jeopardised the country's status in multinational trade talks, Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak said yesterday. The political wrangling also sent the Stock Exchange of Thailand [SET] index below 1,200 points to its lowest level in five months. Hard hit by political uncertainty coupled with unfavourable situations in foreign exchanges, the market lost 35.94 points or 2.92 percent to close at 1,196.59, the first time since October 27 that it had slipped below 1,200. Dr Suphachai said the disagreements over the Constitution have nothing to do with the country's economy and despite political differences, various projects are still moving forward. However, the parliamentary infighting has a psychological impact on the economy. The international community is questioning whether the political situation would affect government policies, he said. "We will have to explain to them that the current situation has nothing to do with the Government's policies, that means the Government will have to work hard to explain this to them," said Dr Suphachai. "In other words the Government will have to rebuild the credibility of the country." He said that if the Constitution is not amended this time, it's not the end of the world; there will be time to try again. "We should focus on developing our economy first. If the economy is well developed and the people have a better living standard, then they will pay attention to the amendment of the Constitution." Amid rumours of possible dissolution of the House of Representatives, the SET index tumbled and analysts forecast it would decline further. The investment mood yesterday was bearish from the beginning. The three worst performers in prices were: finance (down 4.38 percent), commerce (down 3.46 percent) and banking (down 2.97 percent). Wichet Tantiwanit, marketing manager of TFB Asset Management Co, said investors were worried about possible dissolution of the House of Representatives. Even if Prime Minister Chuan Likphai does not dissolve the Lower House, uncertainty would linger, he said. However, he suggested that dissolution would create positive hope of getting a new prime minister. Dissolution would also provide a clearer investment picture, but only in the short term only, Mr Wichet said. He said his firm had to slow down its plan to launch more funds for sale to the public because of prevailing bearishness. Asia Securities Trading Co managing director Prathip Yongwanit admitted that foreign investors were now sellers of local stocks as they feared political uncertainty. He added that HG Asia in Hong Kong, which normally channelled foreign funds for investment on the SET through his firm, had sold out its holdings for the moment. According to the SET, between March 28 and April 1, sales by foreigners of local stocks accounted for 27.86 percent of total sales by four parties including brokers' portfolios, local mutual funds, foreigners and local investors. Foreigners' bought stocks amounting to 16.56 percent. Sa-ngat Sathapatthana, a director of Baring Research Ltd, said that rising overseas interest rates had also caused the bearishness. The Easter holidays also accounted for slim trading value. He said the Lower House would definitely be dissolved -- it's just a matter of when. Mr Sa-ngat said it could be next month. He added that foreign investors realise there would be no major change in local fiscal and monetary policies after dissolution since any finance minister normally listens to suggestions of his permanent secretary. He forecast a further decline in the SET index since companies must pay corporate tax in May. However, Mr Sa-ngat suggested investors gradually buy into fundamentally sound stocks since the local economy's long-term prospects are good and exports are on the uptrend.
