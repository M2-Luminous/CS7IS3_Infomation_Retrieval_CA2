After the republic Prosecutor's Office instituted criminal proceedings in connection with the threats, we contacted Nikolay Valentinskiy, deputy prosecutor of Sakha-Yakutia. According to our interlocutor, the inhabitants and the law-enforcement organs learned of the critical situation in the city from reports in the central media. There is no panic in Yakutsk, he said. All enterprises, including schools, are functioning normally. N. Valentinskiy did not confirm, but nor did he deny the editorial office's information that a description had been obtained of one of the terrorists, who brought an audiocassette to the mayor's office with the "Retribution" group's demands on it. N. Valentinskiy refused to supply any other details of the incident, citing the ban on providing the press with information until the inquiry has been completed. We were unable to obtain any more information from the republic Security Ministry office. According to the minister's aide, the law-enforcement organs are operating in accordance with a special plan. The criminals have not contacted them again. There has been no agreement so far on the place or time of a meeting. Vladimir Fedyunin, Sakha-Yakutia first deputy minister of internal affairs, was more definite. "It is total rubbish," he said in connection with the description of the terrorist. V. Fedyunin refused to say any more to IZVESTIYA, on the assumption that there might be calls from the terrorists' accomplices. Confidential sources reported that information on the willingness to make a payment was broadcast on Yakutsk television Channel 12 at the appointed hour on 3 February. The money was to be collected by someone in a Moskvich car after a signal had been given on television. There was no agreement, nor could there have been any agreement on the place where the money was to be handed over--our correspondent was citing private conversations with republic Internal Affairs Minister Valeriy Fedorov and General Prosecutor Vasiliy Kolmogorov. Local law-enforcement organs checked on potential hoaxers suspected of similar threats in the past, but they obtained no information on the terrorists. According to the law-enforcement organs' current data, there have been no reports of any "Retribution" terrorist group. There was an earlier occasion, in 1993, when an unidentified citizen also called the local authorities and threatened to blow up power facilities in Yakutsk unless he received some money. It turned out to be a hoax. We were told at the Russian Ministry for Emergencies that an aircraft carrying a rescue team and the necessary equipment and medicines had been prepared in connection with the situation in Yakutsk, in case of unforeseen developments.
