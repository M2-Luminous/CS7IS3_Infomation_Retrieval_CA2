However, the agreement among coalition leaders -- setting aside the amount of tax cuts -- leaves us with a strong impression that the scattered manner in which tax cuts are to be made and how a source of revenue to make up for them is to be ensured are merely stop-gap measures. We deeply regret this. Granted, it could not be helped considering the impending situation regarding the political timetable, including the implementation of pump-priming measures, compilation of the draft budget for the next fiscal year, and the upcoming Japan-U.S. summit meeting. However, the problem has merely been shelved, as the issue of financial insurance for tax cuts has now been left completely up to discussions among the ruling coalition parties. The greatest concern is that there is no real guarantee that an agreement on the source of revenue to make up for tax cuts will be reached by a consultative body made up of members from the ruling coalition parties. According to the statement of accord among coalition leaders, legislation on a source of revenue is to be enacted during a Diet session by the year end. However, there is a precondition that this can only be done "under agreement among the ruling coalition parties." If the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], which is the largest contingent among the ruling coalition parties, should decide to voice opposition to a tax hike, threatening once again to "break away from the coalition government," there is no guarantee the tax issue will not be shelved again. Moreover, unified local elections are to be held in the spring of 1995, and an upper house election is to be held the following summer. Depending on the political situation, there may even be a lower house election. As the time for elections get closer and closer, election-motivated opposition to tax hikes will inevitably grow stronger. Meanwhile, coalition leaders have also agreed to implement a 6-trillion-yen tax cut plan (which includes 5.5 trillion yen in income and residence tax cuts) retroactive to 1 January, for which the legislation is to be effective for one year only. This means that if legislation for securing a revenue source for tax cuts should not be enacted by the year end, the tax cut plan will be cut off thereafter. In that case, the pump-priming effects of the 15-trillion yen economic stimulus package will go to waste. Furthermore, the planned tax cuts rely heavily on deficit-covering bonds as a revenue source. The ruling coalition parties should make a thorough review of these matters and strive to come up with a responsible decision. The responsibility mentioned here does not simply mean that the ruling coalition parties should look from a short-term viewpoint to study the issue of finding a revenue source for tax cuts. It also means they should look from a medium- to long-term viewpoint to study the issue of how the tax system ought to be in preparation for the coming of an aging society; and particularly, the issue of drastic tax system reform which includes rectifying the balance between direct and indirect taxes. This is why we have basically supported the "Hosokawa plan," despite such faults as the abrupt manner in which it was announced, the sudden changing of the consumption tax name, and the nontransparent decisionmaking process. Although the "Hosokawa plan" has basically been brought back to the drawing board, it still bears significance for bringing problems out into the open. Clearly, the current tax system which leans heavily toward direct taxation centered on income taxes will eventually collapse as the society rapidly progresses to a state in which one out of every four Japanese will be over 65 years old. There may be divided views on whether a 7-percent tax rate is reasonable. However, it is impossible to shift the strain of the burden of rapidly rising pension, medical, and nursing costs to workers in the prime of their lives. Regardless of name, indirect taxes -- particularly the consumption tax -- must be raised, and it is inevitable. It is the politician's duty to continue striving to gain public approval by sharing the pain with the people, while taking such future prospects into consideration. It is desirable that a reputable plan on tax system reform be worked out and presented to the people as soon as possible. Sweet promises should not be made merely to put off the issue.
