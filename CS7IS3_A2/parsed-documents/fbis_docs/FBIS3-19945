They have also provided funds for the PKK and supported that organization in the international domain. Many Greeks participated in the rally the PKK militants organized in Germany for "Freedom to Kurdistan" and carried banners of the Greek Panhellenic Socialist Movement [PASOK]. They chanted slogans against Turkey, which they described as the "common enemy." Meanwhile, it is common knowledge that the Greeks facilitate efforts by PKK militants to escape from Turkey through the Greek islands in the Aegean Sea. It will be recalled that several Greek deputies and generals visited PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan in the al-Biqa' Valley some time ago. They informed him that they will give every kind of support to PKK's "justified" struggle against Turkey. Meanwhile, the Greeks are trying to establish a radio for the PKK in Greece. The PKK radio will be in an area close to the Turkish border and will broadcast on the FM band. Furthermore, they have allowed the PKK to open an office in central Athens. It has been reported that relations between the Greek Cypriot side and the PKK go far beyond the visit of Greek Cypriot deputies to PKK camps and the opening of a PKK base in south Cyprus. The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs contacted the Colt [as published] firm some time ago to convey the serial numbers of M-16 rifles the Turkish security forces impounded from PKK militants and ask for information on the country that purchased them from that firm. The officials responded by disclosing that the rifles in question were sold to south Cyprus.
