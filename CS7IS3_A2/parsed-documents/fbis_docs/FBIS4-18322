The EU white paper gives mass unemployment in Europe as being 17 million, about 11 percent of the working population. The European Council followed the most important recommendations of the white paper without automatically adopting all proposals. It is primarily the business of the member countries to put these guidelines into political practice. The proposal of a new common loan financing for infrastructure networks was strictly rejected in particular by Germany and Great Britain. The two German top associations express the fear that political pressure will increase and that it will be stepped up at the national level if the specific measures planned by the EU Commission and envisaged by the action plan of the European Council are ineffective. Tax Burden on Lower Wage Groups Industry set down its ideas regarding the strengthening of Europe's competitiveness in a report by UNICE [Union of EC Industries], the umbrella organization of the European industry and employers' associations, published in December 1993. The two top associations of German industry unanimously pay tribute to the analysis of the reasons of high unemployment in the EU, which the white paper undertakes. The EU white paper distinguishes between economic, structural, and technological unemployment, and explains that in the field of structural unemployment the reason is often to be found in sociopoltically influenced decisions, such as: - relatively high costs for low-qualified work, which favor investments in rationalization, - a lack of flexibility of the labor markets and limitation of entrepreneurial flexibility regarding training, labor law regulations, work contracts, social security, and internal management organization. The two top associations also expressed approval for the statement by the Commission that in most member states the tax burden is disproportionately large for the lower-wage groups and that this burden is about 25 percent higher in the EU, compared with Japan and the United States. The basic political orientation of the white paper and the global strategy, in particular the rejection of expenditure programs and the commitment to the EU's openness to the outside, to reducing labor costs, to promoting education and training, and to establishing more flexibility on the labor markets and regarding work time is welcomed by the top associations. Their statement says that with this the Commission follows the view that has long been advocated by industry, namely that Europe's competitive weakness can be overcome only by eliminating its structural reasons. However, industry criticized that many proposals of the white paper put too great an emphasis on strengthening economic demand, on levying new taxes, and, generally, on the role of the state in abolishing unemployment. The recommendations of the white paper focus on creating more employment, primarily with the help of state measures, and not so much on improving the competitiveness of European industry by reducing the costs for the companies. The economic associations miss proposals that are aimed at improving the entrepreneurial framework conditions in the interest of investments, growth, and employment. They criticize the fact that, in contrast, there are recommendations that would result in new burdens on the companies. They also criticize the fact that the commitment to a multilateral trade system is linked to conditions that can at least be interpreted in different ways, and more or less veiled threats regarding a lack of good behavior by trading partners in other fields of politics, the environment, human rights, etc. The medium-term strategy for growth, competitiveness, and employment that has been developed by the Commission is aimed at halving unemployment in Europe by the year 2000. This corresponds to the creation of at least 15 million jobs. In their statement, the two German top associations explain why the frequent reference of the white paper to the employment increase in the European Community during the second half of the 1980's and the U.S. employment miracle is misleading. Against the Introduction of Environmental Taxes The Commission gives the following priorities for employment: - Education and training as well as life-long learning; - Raising external and internal flexibility; - Stronger decentralization and promotion of the individual's initiative; - Reducing the relative costs of low-qualified work; - Setting the course for a new employment policy; and - A response to new needs. The top associations primarily criticize the last three items. They oppose the Commission's proposals to reduce taxes and social security contributions for low-qualified employees by 30 to 40 percent. In the Commission's view, this could result in an increase in the number of jobs by 2 percent in countries with very high social security contributions. In the EU Commission's view, losses in revenues could be compensated by raising revenues in nother places -- in particular by introducing a tax on carbon dioxide emissions or by "taxing capital income at the source." German industry doubts that such model calculations would correspond to reality. However, they already criticize the starting point of these considerations. Instead of paying low-qualified work for what it is worth, indirect subsidies are supposed to be provided via allowances for social security contributions. This would not correspond to the principle of equivalence in the insurance system. The idea of shifting the tax burden from work to other factors, in particular the environment, would not improve the international competitiveness of European industry, either. The cost-neutral introduction of environmental taxes with a simultaneous reduction of labor cost would be a mock solution. The guiding and financing effects of such a tax would contradict each other, in the view of the economic associations. For economic and ecological reasons they reject the introduction of an energy tax on carbon dioxide emissions and other environmental taxes. In particular with a view to the latest increase in petroleum tax and the decided increase in taxes on income in the form of the solidarity surcharge as of 1 January, there is no more leeway in Germany for a further increase in the tax burden. Losses in revenues, for instance in social security, must be compensated rather by budget savings and a restructuring of social services. The associations also reject a further taxing of capital yield as a possibility to compensate for a reduction of labor cost. The associations criticize the Commission's proposals for a new employment policy. They could be misunderstood as a right to work and training. Furthermore, more intensive public labor exchange will hardly have any effect, at least not in Germany. The associations are skeptical about ideas to use new needs for the so far allegedly undeveloped reserves of new employment opportunities and reject these ideas. These considerations are aiming at a new "social economy." Many recommendations are dangerously close to establishing work subsidized by the state, that is, a second labor market. Warning Against Social Economy Instead, the top associations demand a policy to reduce labor costs with the following elements: - Raising the flexibility of the labor market; - Reducing the ancillary wage costs, including social security contributions; - More leeway in wage contracts to differentiate wages and salaries; - Reducing minimum wages; and - Making hiring easier and reducing costs for dismissal. The EU's proposals for measures at the EU level focus on infrastructure and information. The top associations say that the Commission's proposal to establish efficient trans-European networks, in particular in the field of transportation and energy, is the correct priority. However, in the view of German industry, planning, financing, and construction of infrastructures should basically remain with the member states. List With 26 Large Projects The commission has drawn up a list of 26 large projects that require investments of ECU82 billion by 1999. During this period, ECU13 billion will be used for energy networks. The Commission estimates that the priority projects of the European information structure will require ECU67 billion by 1999. To finance these projects, the Commission suggests allocating ECU20 billion annually until 1999 from the EU budget and, at the same time, suggests the introduction of a new way for the EU to finance loans. German industry calls this proposal particularly problematic. It says that financing the "infrastructure" offensive by raising means on the capital market via EU loans or convertible bonds by private or public project managers would result in a further increase in the EU's debts, which must, in the end, be paid by the member states. Furthermore, any source of income outside the budget counteracts the stability criteria anchored in the Maastricht Treaty. In addition, the associations expressed the fear that this "financial innovation" could mean the beginning of further expenditure programs financed by loans. In Europe's very own interests, German industry rejects loan financing by the EU. Above all, the expansion of telecommunications and energy projects should be carried out primarily by private investments. The associations call for giving private models priority also in the transportation sector.
