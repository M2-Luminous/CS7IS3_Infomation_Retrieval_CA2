Their electron mode of conductivity was achieved by Si doping. On some epitaxial layers with many structural surface defects, such as micro-pockets, micro-cracks, oval defects, etc., the intrinsic photoluminescence was manifested in a form of intensive single band at 1.51514 eV. It was demonstrated that with attenuation G< G[.sup]cr[/] this band is caused by the polariton luminescence near the surface, and with G> G[.sup]cr[/] by the resonant luminescence of the n-1 exiton.
