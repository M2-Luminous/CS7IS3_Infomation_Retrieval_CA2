The operation, to last till November 30, involves thousands of staffers of the interior minister in virtually all regions of the country. Special attention is given to putting a stop to the delivery of the narcotics from the Chuya Valley. According to the information published in the latest issue of the Kazakhstan weekly PANORAMA with a reference to an official of the Kazakhstan Interior Ministry, about 5,000 tonnes of marijuana is manufactured every year out of hemp grown in the Chuya valley. These narcotics then spread all over the world via Russia and Kazakhstan's southern borders. In addition, Kazakhstan was being turned of late into a link for narcotics traffic via China from the so-called golden triangle to Europe. Kazakhstan law enforcement bodies expect the hunting of narcotics producers and narcotics dealers to be effective. Some 850 illegally planted plots of narcotic crops have been found and destroyed during such operations last year. Over 27 tonnes of marijuana and 16.5 tonnes of poppy straw were prevented from entering trafficking. Also some 12 tonnes of narcotics were apprehended. Their total value at black market prices of the Kazakh capital make up about 6.3 million U.S. dollars.
