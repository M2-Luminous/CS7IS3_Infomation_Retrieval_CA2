Translated into the language of specific action, this means an immediate cease-fire without prior conditions, guaranteeing the safety of the civilian population of Nagorno-Karabakh, and deciding at the negotiating table who is to repay debts, to whom, how much, and how. President Levon Ter-Petrosyan is right to believe that he has the support of all Armenia on this issue. The republic, cut off from the outside world by a long-standing blockade, is barely able to keep its economy afloat. The war in Karabakh has in one way or another affected the well-being of every Armenian family, and people realize that it cannot go on endlessly. "We have managed to strike off the agenda the status of Nagorno-Karabakh and focus entirely on the main problem: How can peace be achieved?", Aram Abramyan, the Armenian president's press secretary, told IZVESTIYA. "The two ways proposed by the CSCE and Russia are equally acceptable to us. The advantage of the Russian scenario is that it contains a specific mechanism to prevent the resumption of hostilities -- to whit, the introduction of internationally-mandated peacekeeping forces into the conflict zone. Both plans of action proposed to the warring parties have won the approval of Stepanakert and Yerevan, but they were rejected by Azerbaijan. The conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh has today reached the stage where its peaceful resolution depends not only on the will of the warring parties, but also on that of the world community." Armenia's political parties are unhappy that Yerevan has not made up its mind to recognize the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR]. Armenia's influential "Ramkavar-Azatakan" Liberal-Democratic Party is in favor of recognizing the NKR as an independent sovereign state. In the opinion of party leader Ruben Mirzakhanyan, this step would make it possible to unravel one of the tightest knots of the conflict. It is a question of the decision of the then Armenian SSR [Soviet Socialist Republic] Supreme Soviet of 1 December 1989 declaring Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast [NKAO] an inalienable part of Armenia. It was clear at the time that this decision was as futile as the Azerbaijani authorities' ensuing decision to dissolve the NKAO. However, having effectively changed nothing, both documents are still formally in force to this day. Yerevan's official recognition of the NKR would, in Ruben Mirzkhanyan's opinion, remove the problem. "We do not believe that the process of settling the conflict is becoming more productive as the group of international mediators expands," he said. In his opinion, this group should be confined to the warring parties' immediate neighbors -- Turkey, Iran, and, undoubtedly, Russia. "We have very serious disagreements with the authorities in our approach to the Nagorno-Karabakh problem," Vagan Oganesyan, one of the leaders of the "Dashnaktsutyun" opposition party, told IZVESTIYA. "We cannot in particular see whether we are complying with the Supreme Soviet decision for Nagorno-Karabakh to accede to Armenia or whether we agree with its proclaiming itself the NKR? If Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh are in actual fact a single state, Azerbaijan is in effect at war with Armenia, whereas the latter does not acknowledge itself to be a state at war. "If we consider the NKR a separate state formation, why do we not recognize the republic de jure?" [quotation marks as published] Vagan Oganesyan wonders. Vagan Oganesyan believes that Russia will play a crucial role in resolving the conflict and its participation in these affairs is therefore far more preferable to mediation by any other country or international organization.
