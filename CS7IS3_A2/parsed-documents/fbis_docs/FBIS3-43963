Mr. Etienne Tshisekedi's ghost city campaign seems to doing very well in Kinshasa. No one bothered to go to work on the morning of 19 January. Things have been flaring up around the transitional prime minister's residence, which was surrounded by the Presidential Guard at daybreak. Several Union for Democracy and Social Progress -- Tshisekedi's party -- activists immediately responded to defend their leader. Here is an account by Djouko Moulopo, the charge d'affaires of the permanent representation of Tshisekedi's government in Brussels. [Begin Moulopo recording] The ghost city campaign launched by the opposition in protest against President Mobutu's illegal and anti constitutional acts has been followed totally by the population. At the moment, we fear for the prime minister's life because we have been informed from Kinshasa that the prime minister's residence has been totally surrounded by the (?DSP) and the (?ZARM) [expansion unknown]. Combatants are protecting the prime minister and exchanging fire with the soldiers. This is the situation as it stands in Kinshasa. Army troops are positioned at strategic points. [end recording] This renewed tension jeopardizes the 19 January meeting convened by President Mobutu between the High Council of the Republic and the National Assembly, which should lead to the merger of the two organs and the election of a new prime minister. The choice is between Mr. Tshisekedi and Mr. Mulumba Lukoji. As Djouko Moulopo points out in no uncertain terms, the radical opposition is not at all happy about this: [Begin Moulopo recording] President Mobutu has no right or freedom to convene the High Council of Republic. If he had convened his former assembly, we would understand that, but Monsignor Monsengwo has declared that he did not have to fall in line with President Mobutu's position, because it is an anti constitutional act, which is not laid down in the transitional act on the provisions for the new constitution in Zaire. Therefore in our view, there is no High Council of the Republic in Zaire today. [end recording]
