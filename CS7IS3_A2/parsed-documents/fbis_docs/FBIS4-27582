The commission is investigating charges by the European Council of Chemical Manufacturers Federation (CEFIC), which has expressed concern that the two countries may continue to export their products at unfair prices in view of their ample manufacturing potential. The CEFIC charges that Korean and Hong Kong video cassettes are sold at one-third the price of European products and that their dumping margins were actually greater than the anti-dumping tariff rates imposed. The EU has imposed punitive duties of 1.9 percent on Saehan Media, 3.8 percent on Sunkyong, 2 percent on Kolon and 2.9 percent on Goldstar since June 1989. Under the sunset provision, tariff imposition automatically terminates after five years unless the industry in the host country calls for an extension.
