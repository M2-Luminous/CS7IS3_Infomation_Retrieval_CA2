President Leghari's Categorical Announcement"] [Text] Talking to the Associated Press of Pakistan correspondent in London, President Farooq Ahamd Khan Leghari has said Pakistan will not accept any unilateral restriction on the nuclear nonproliferation issue, because a solution that imposes restrictions on Pakistan but not on India is unacceptable. We want restrictions on the entire world, especially on all countries in the region. From the very beginning, Pakistan has adhered to a principled and just stand on nuclear nonproliferation -- to forcefully support the issue, especially to extend all sorts of cooperation to the international community in eliminating a nuclear arms race in South Asia -- provided India signs the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] at the global level or be prepared to endorse any acceptable solution on the issue at the regional level. But, as India is crazy to become a mini-superpower in the region, forcing its hegemony on other countries, it is bent on rejecting every proposal on nuclear nonproliferation which impedes any progress in the direction. Now, after Indian Prime Minister Narasimha Rao's visit to the United States, President Clinton himself has admitted that India is not willing to extend any cooperation on nuclear nonproliferation and human rights issues and has refused to accept the U.S. proposals as well. Under these circumstances, the sincerity and truthfulness of Pakistan's position has come to the foreground that it is not Pakistan erecting obstacles in the way of nuclear nonproliferation but rather India, which is not prepared to curtail its nuclear program at any cost. As long as India does not do it, Pakistan is not ready to accept any unilateral restrictions on its nuclear program. Now that the differences between India and the United States on the nuclear nonproliferation issue could not be removed, Pakistan should take advantage of the situation and intensify its efforts to convince the United States of the soundness of its position so as to get the illegitimate embargo on economic and military aid lifted.
