Minister of Economic Affairs P.K. Chiang said that he would offer explanations, write U.S. Trade Representative Kantor, and ask the United States to drop Taiwan from the Section 301 "priority watch list" during this year's review. It is time again for the United States to carry out a review of the Section 301 clause of the Omnibus Trade Act. Every April, the United States publishes a blacklist of the countries which violate intellectual property rights. During an urgent situation last year, our country rapidly adopted the eight reserved clauses of the ROC- U.S. agreement on the protection of intellectual property rights but was still included on the "priority watch list." The Ministry of Economic Affairs yesterday held a interministerial coordination meeting on the protection of intellectual property rights and assessed our achievements last year in this regard. In 1993, our country adopted a cable television law, a trademark law, and a patent law; fulfilled its commitments to the "memorandum of understanding" (MOU) signed with the United States, and implemented measures to prevent the export of counterfeit goods. P.K. Chiang said: "This year, our country will not suffer as much reprisal pressure as last year." He will write Kantor and ask the United States to remove Taiwan from the reprisal list. Vice Economic Affairs Minister Li Shu-chiu pointed out after the meeting: Our country's measures to protect intellectual property rights were quite effective last year. We should continue, however, the unfinished legislative work this year in honoring the MOU. We have promised to adopt the video recording law by January of this year, but the draft law will be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation together with the radio and television law. The integrated circuit layout protection law is another bill which will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for deliberation. It has been decided that the industrial design law will not be separately enacted and will be incorporated into the patent law as an article on new design patents. The business secrets law is being studied by the Commercial Department [of the Ministry of Economic Affairs].
