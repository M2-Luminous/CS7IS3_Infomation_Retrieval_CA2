DIKO [Democratic Party] deputy Markos Kiprianou raised the issue of handing over left-wing Turks and Kurds to Turkey, where they face certain imprisonment or death, at yesterday's closed House Legal Affairs Committee meeting. Mikhailidhis, who was present yesterday, told the committee: "If a Kurd's life is in danger for political reasons then he will not be handed over to the Turks." Kiprianou also asked the minister to study other cases brought up by the Kurdistan solidarity committee. There are accusations that Turks and Kurds were being sent back to instant death after entering the free areas illegally. Kiprianou wanted to discuss with Mikhailidhis the procedures followed when Kurds or Turks enter the free-areas illegally. According to the Turkish Cypriot press, two Turks who entered the free area illegally through Famagusta recently were sent back by the government. One of the Turks, according to reports, was a member of the Turkish National Liberation Party and a PLO member. Police say it's their policy to send back those who enter the free areas illegally. The Kurds argue that such action is unacceptable because dissidents are treated as deserters and face the death penalty on their return. "The major thing is that lives of Kurds are not put in danger, if it is known they face death on being returned to Turkey or the occupied areas," said Kiprianou afterwards.
