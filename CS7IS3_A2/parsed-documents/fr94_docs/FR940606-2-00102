FR940606-2-00102 FR940606-2-00068 [Docket 37554] Order Adjusting the Standard Foreign Fare Level Index The International Air Transportation Competition Act (IATCA), Public Law 96&hyph;192, requires that the Department, as successor to the Civil Aeronautics Board, establish a Standard Foreign Fare Level (SFFL) by adjusting the SFFL base periodically by percentage changes in actual operating costs per available seat-mile (ASM). Order 80&hyph;2&hyph;69 established the first interim SFFL, and Order 94&hyph;3&hyph;50 established the currently effective two-month SFFL applicable through May 31, 1994. In establishing the SFFL for the two-month period beginning June 1, 1994, we have projected non-fuel costs based on the year ended December 31, 1993 data, and have determined fuel prices on the basis of the latest available experienced monthly fuel cost levels as reported to the Department. By Order 94&hyph;5&hyph;40 fares may be increased by the following adjustment factors over the October 1979 level: ␣ 1␣ 1␣ Atlantic 1.2979 Latin America 1.3199 Pacific 2.0040 Canada 1.4164 For further information contact: Keith A.
