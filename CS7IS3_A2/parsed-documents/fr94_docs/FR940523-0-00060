FR940523-0-00060 FR940523-0-00014 The Department did not intend the proposed rule to require a licensee to make any changes to a reclamation plan approved by NRC or an Agreement State. On the other hand, the statutory authority to review and approve such plans is by no means limited to the scheduling of subsequent remedial action. To clarify the scope and purpose of this review, §765.30(c) has been revised to state that the intended purpose of the Department's review is to determine conformance with an NRC- or Agreement State-approved reclamation plan, as well as the reasonableness of anticipated future costs. Several commenters requested that the Department clarify in §765.30(b) of the proposed rule the time in which it would approve a subsequent plan for remedial action which was previously rejected by the Department and modified by a licensee. The final rule has been revised to provide that a licensee may continue to resubmit a subsequent plan for remedial action until the Department approves the plan or September 30, 2002, whichever date is earlier. This deadline for submission of plans provides sufficient time for a licensee to resubmit such a plan. It also allows the Department sufficient time to review and approve the plan and to designate by December 31, 2002 available amounts deposited in the Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund, an escrow account established at the United States Treasury Department pursuant to section 1801 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 2297(g)), for reimbursement. Some of these commenters requested that the Department allow for the reimbursement of remedial action costs incurred after December 31, 2002 for plans which have been submitted, but not yet approved by the Department, before this date. The Department does not have statutory authority to reimburse licensees for costs of remedial action after December 31, 2002 for which a plan has not been approved. Therefore, the final rule does not allow for the reimbursement of remedial costs incurred after December 31, 2002, for those plans which have not been approved by this date. One commenter questioned how the Department intends to address costs incurred prior to December 31, 2002, but not yet approved by the Department at the time the plan is submitted by the licensee. To ensure that all incurred and future costs of remedial action are included in a subsequent plan for remedial action, the Department has revised §765.30(b)(2) to include a third category of costs: Those costs incurred or expected to be incurred prior to December 31, 2002. This category includes those costs incurred prior to December 31, 2002 but not yet submitted in a claim for reimbursement, or approved by the Department. Finally, many commenters requested that §§765.20(e) and 765.30(b)(2) of the proposed rule eliminate the provision that claims for reimbursement will be reviewed by the Department to assure that the costs are consistent with the surety requirements provided by the licensees to NRC or an Agreement State. These commenters argued that there are many significant differences between the anticipated costs upon which the surety requirements are based and the anticipated costs contained in plans for subsequent remedial action. These commenters also noted that in some circumstances the surety may not take into consideration all costs that may be reimbursed under Title X. The Department acknowledges these concerns and has eliminated the surety requirement in the final rule. To conform with this change, the Department has deleted the definition of ``surety requirements'' contained in §765.3 of the proposed rule.
