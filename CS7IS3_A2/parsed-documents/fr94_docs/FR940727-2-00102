FR940727-2-00102 FR940727-2-00055 Proposed Generic Communication; Information on NRC/Licensee Safeguards Meeting/Workshop on Revisions to 10 CFR Part 73 To Protect Against Malevolent Use of Vehicles at Nuclear Power Plants AGENCY: Nuclear Regulatory Commission. ACTION: Notice of meeting. SUMMARY: On June 30, 1994, the Commission approved a final rule revising 10 CFR Part 73 associated with protection against malevolent use of vehicles at nuclear power plants. The rule change modifies the design basis threat for radiological sabotage to include use of a land vehicle. The rule change also requires vehicle control measures, including vehicle barrier systems, to protect against the malevolent use of a land vehicle. The vehicle barrier system design requires that the system stop the forward motion of the design basis vehicle. As part of the implementation of this rule change, the NRC staff is publishing Regulatory Guide 5.68, ``Protection Against Malevolent Use of Vehicles at Nuclear Power Plants,'' and NUREG/CR&hyph;6190, ``Protection Against Malevolent Use of Vehicles at Nuclear Power Plants,'' Volumes 1 and 2. These documents were specifically developed to provide guidance acceptable to the NRC staff by which a licensee can meet the requirements of the revised 10 CFR Part 73. The Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation will conduct one-day technical workshops in each of the NRC Regional offices to discuss Regulatory Guide 5.68 and NUREG/CR&hyph;6190, Volumes 1 and 2, and address implementation of the rule change. DATE AND LOCATION: The NRC Region I meeting will be held on August 18, 1994, from 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. at the regional office located at 475 Allendale Road, King of Prussia, Pennsylvania. The NRC Region II meeting will be held on August 9, 1994, from 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. at the regional office located at 101 Marietta Street, Suite 2900, Atlanta, Georgia. The NRC Region III meeting will be held on August 16, 1994, from 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. at the regional office located at 801 Warrenville Road, Lisle, Illinois. The NRC Region IV meeting will be held on August 11, 1994, from 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. at the regional office located at 611 Ryan Plaza Drive, Suite 400, Arlington, Texas. DIRECT QUESTIONS TO: Robert J. Dube, United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, Washington, DC 20555, Telephone (301) 504&hyph;2912. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This meeting between the NRC technical staff and licensees is closed to members of the public or other parties due to the fact that Safeguards Information will be discussed. An unclassified summary of the meeting will be prepared and will be available upon request. The regional conference rooms can accommodate up to three representatives from each facility. It is requested that each licensee planning to send representatives to the workshop provide the names of the attendees to Elaine Koup at (301) 504&hyph;2932 or Catherine Berney at (301) 504&hyph;2933 by August 8, 1994. If a licensee desires to send more than three representatives, they may contact Ms. Koup after August 4 for additional spaces, if available. Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 21st day of July 1994. Douglas V. Pickett, Acting Director, Project Directorate III&hyph;3, Division of Reactor Projects_III/IV, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulations.
