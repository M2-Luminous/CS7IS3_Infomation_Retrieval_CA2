The UN mission in Rwanda has said that a cease-fire is essential to put an end to the genocide against the Tutsis. Let me remind you that Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes criticized the Security Council's decision. He would have preferred the priority to be given to the safe areas near the border with Tanzania and Burundi in order to protect refugees. However, the United Nations' priority is to reopen Kigali airport to facilitate the distribution of food in the country.
