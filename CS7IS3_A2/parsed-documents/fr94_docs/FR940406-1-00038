FR940406-1-00038 FR940406-1-00011 6. Assuming that NHTSA establishes a single light truck CAFE standard for each of MYs 1998&hyph;2006, what would be the manufacturers' responses to CAFE standards set at alternative levels, and what would the energy savings be from those levels? For example, what would be the effect of setting a CAFE standard at x^y mpg versus x mpg versus x+y mpg for a given model year? NHTSA requests that, at a minimum, commenters answer the questions in this paragraph based on the standard levels discussed in the NAS report. Another issue that the agency must consider in setting light truck CAFE standards is the basic structure of the standards. As indicated above, Title V provides the agency with discretion concerning whether to establish a single standard for all light trucks or separate standards for different classes of light trucks. While NHTSA has in the past used its authority to set separate standards for different classes of light trucks, most notably for two-wheel drive and four-wheel drive light trucks, it has more recently established a single standard for all light trucks. A single standard has the advantage of maximizing manufacturer flexibility, e.g., enabling a manufacturer to decide where in its light truck fleet to make fuel efficiency improvements. On the other hand, since the agency sets standards at a level that can be achieved by manufacturers whose vehicles constitute a substantial share of the market, it is possible that a single large manufacturer with a mix toward larger, less fuel-efficient vehicles could skew the single standard downward for the entire industry. It might be possible to address this potential problem by establishing separate standards for different classes of light trucks. The agency requests comments on the following question: 7. For MYs 1998&hyph;2006, should NHTSA propose a single standard for all light trucks or separate standards for different classes of light trucks? Should the answer to this question vary depending on the extent to which the CAFE capabilities of manufacturers differ? If the agency should propose separate standards for different classes of light trucks, how should the different classes be defined? In the final rule issued today establishing light truck CAFE standards for MYs 1996&hyph;1997, NHTSA stated it believes that CAFE standards for the last decade have not had any measurable effect on light truck weight or size; and, hence, safety. In support of that belief, the agency noted that the levels of the light truck CAFE standards have not varied significantly for more than a decade. The light truck CAFE standards for MY 1987&hyph;89 and MY 1994 were set at 20.5 mpg, and, as far back as MY 1984, the standard was only slightly lower at 20.0 mpg. NHTSA also noted that, in setting the light truck CAFE standards over the last decade, the agency has not included in its analyses of manufacturer capabilities any product plan actions that would significantly affect the weight, size or cost of the vehicles the manufacturers planned to offer. Further, the average equivalent test weight of light trucks increased from 3,805 pounds in MY 1984 to 4,200 pounds in MY 1993. 8. NHTSA requests comments on the extent to which the increases in light truck CAFE feasible during MYs 1998&hyph;2006 involve means, such as significant weight or size reduction, that could adversely affect safety. Would achievement during that period of NAS' estimated ``technically achievable'' levels necessarily depend on such means? In setting CAFE standards, the agency takes into consideration that there are often technological risks associated with actually achieving the full potential fuel economy improvement from a particular type of technology. 9. How should the agency take technological risks into account in setting the light truck CAFE standards? What technological risks are associated with gaining the full potential fuel economy improvements from any of the available types of fuel economy enhancing technologies? What are the prospects for overcoming those risks or offsetting their effects on CAFE capability? IV. Rulemaking Analyses and Notices A. Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review) and the Departmental Regulatory Policies and Procedures This rulemaking was reviewed under E.O. 12866. The agency has considered the potential economic implications of this rulemaking and determined that it is significant within the meaning of the Department's regulatory policies and regulatory procedures. A preliminary regulation evaluation has been prepared for this notice and placed in the public docket. B. Executive Order 12612 (Federalism) This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that it is likely that CAFE standards for MYs 1998&hyph;2006 will not have sufficient Federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. C. Civil Justice Reform This rule, when proposed, would not have any retroactive effect. Under section 509(a) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 2009(a)), whenever a Federal motor vehicle fuel economy standard is in effect, a state may not adopt or enforce any law or regulation relating to fuel economy standards or average fuel economy standards applicable to vehicles covered by the Federal standard. Under section 509(b) of the Cost Savings Act (15 U.S.C. 2009(b)), a state may not require fuel economy labels on vehicles covered by section 506 of the Cost Savings Act (15 U.S.C. 2006) which are not identical to those required by the Federal requirement. Section 509 does not apply to vehicles procured for the State's use. Section 504 of the Cost Savings Act (15 U.S.C. 2004) sets forth a procedure for judicial review of final rules establishing, amending or revoking Federal average fuel economy standards. That section does not require submission of a petition for reconsideration or other administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court.
