Asked by AKHIR KHABAR if he was offered a part in the Palestinian National Authority, Shaykh al-Tamimi said that President Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] had contacted several Palestinian figures, including his son, Nadir al-Tamimi, offering them the portfolio of the Religious Affairs Ministry. Nadir, he said, is now in Tunis. Shaykh al-Tamimi added: This is a personal contact rather than coordination between the Palestinian leadership and the Islamic Jihad Movement-Bayt al-Maqdis. Asked whether Dr. Nadir has agreed to participate in the Palestinian Authority, Shaykh al-Tamimi said: Although this is a personal affair, I oppose it because such participation in principle means bargaining. Therefore, I urge Nadir to reject it. He added: If the self-rule area is expanded to include the whole West Bank, I will agree to enter these territories to establish an Islamic opposition party, but not to participate in the Palestinian Authority.
