U.N. officials said that 21 people had been killed Sunday [17 April] and 55 wounded and that the fightings were even more tense after the ceasefire announcement. "Bosnian army defenses around Gorazde have collapsed. They are non-existent," U.N. Peacekeeping Force Spokesman Rob Annink said, adding that "there is nothing to stop them except a command of their own political leadership." The Serb siege of Gorazde, a Muslim enclave declared by the U.N. as a "safe area," provoked two NATO air strikes last Sunday and Monday. Serb forces retaliated against the NATO strikes, detaining U.N. personnel last week and shooting down a British war jet over Gorazde Sunday. This was the first NATO aircraft downed during military operations in Bosnia. With the Serbs continuing their siege despite U.N. efforts to broker a ceasefire, U.N. chief representative for Yugoslavia today admitted that "the means at our disposal are not sufficient to cope with the situation." At least 200,000 people have been killed or missing in the fightings between the Muslims, Serbs and Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
