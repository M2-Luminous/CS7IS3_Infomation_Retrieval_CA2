He repeatedly smuggled cocaine from Belgium and Colombia to Austria. During his last coup he was caught in Dusseldorf by the German police, which had been alerted by the Austrians. He had 4 kg of cocaine on him with a street value of 7.5 million schillings. One kilogram of cocaine from previous deliveries was found in the possession of eight gang members, among whom it had been distributed. In Belgium, the Vienna police has now established the identity of a high-ranking Belgian NATO officer who had supplied the cocaine. The Belgian authorities, however, have so far ignored the Austrian investigations: Not only has the arrest warrant not been executed, and the suspect, who has been incriminated by several witnesses, has not only not been extradited, the Belgians have not even arrested the man. "This man is somehow untouchable," police sources said. Eight individuals have been arrested, while complaints against another 25 have been filed. [passage omitted]
