Unquestionably, this is a worthy position on the part of the head of our state. Simultaneously, this is unprecedented hypocrisy in our modern history. This is so because the government of the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS] was on the verge of signing an agreement with the former creditors on much better terms than the government of the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP], led by his former adviser. This government achieved a vague preliminary agreement, which could hardly be implemented. Weeks before the SDS government was about the sign the agreement, the Bulgarian president gave the signal to launch a total attack on the government, and personally joined in the attack with unworthy lies and mean scripts concocted by the secret services under his control. At that stage [former Finance] Minister Kostov warned him that the national interests are on the line rather than political interests or power ambitions. However, the president, the Bulgarian president, preferred to act as if he were deaf. The SDS government also reached an agreement with the IMF on a three year stand-by. Berov's cabinet has no chance of reaching such an agreement. The tacit coup, again directed by this president, foiled that opportunity. The result -- not a single dollar for Bulgaria as a credit for more than one year, and not a single serious investment. Thus for a year we are marking time, something that has completely ruined our economy, filled up the pockets of the new mafia, caused record unemployment, blocked privatization and land restitution, prompted the first steps of hyperinflation, and foiled the budget and the new draft budget, whose deficit could bury any government. To speak after all this about national interests is only political impudence. It is high time that the one who preaches to Bulgaria measured his own words and deeds, because following their logic it appears that the president himself is a state traitor.
