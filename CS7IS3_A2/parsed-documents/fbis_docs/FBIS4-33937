The Political and Organization Affairs Commissions have yet to submit their reports. The latter report is drawing more attention because it centers on the COB reorganization. Moreover, the Economic Affairs Commission has made the following recommendations: the safeguarding of properties of state-owned companies and the reactivation of mines; the issuance of a statement against the privatization of the National Road Service; the disbursement of $7 million to build the Jaime Mendoza highway. In its report, the Peasant and Agricultural Affairs Commission repudiates the concentration of land in the hands of a few and calls for a halt to the plundering of Bolivian forests and jungles. Regarding the coca leaf issue, the commission disavows Law 1008 because it is unconstitutional and demands the repeal of Article No. 2 of the coca industrialization decree.
