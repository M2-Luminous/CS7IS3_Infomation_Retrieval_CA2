The accord represents an investment of approximately 3-5 billion French francs. It will be announced during Industry Minister Gerard Longuet's visit to Vietnam, and it will be initialed by France Telecom President Marcel Roulet and his Vietnamese counterpart in Hanoi in late February. For the moment, the French telecommunications operator has restricted itself to acknowledging that "the ministry has prepared a memorandum of cooperation." The legal aspects of the agreement remain to be defined. This accord would move France from fourth to second place among foreign investors in the SRV, following Taiwan ($1.5 billion in capital investments), but ahead of Hong Kong and South Korea. There are four legal formulas for foreign investments in Vietnam: a simple cooperation contract; a 100-percent subsidiary; a joint venture with minimum foreign participation of 30 percent; and the BOT (Build Operate Transfer), which stipulates the transfer of the foreign partner's operations to the Vietnamese state after a specified period of time. The Vietnamese partner favors the last formula, whereas France Telecom prefers a joint venture.
