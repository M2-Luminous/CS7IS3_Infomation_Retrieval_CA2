Narysov, candidate of technical sciences, and V.V. Sadchikov, Scientific-Industrial Association ``State Institute of Applied Optics'', Kazan; UDC 621.396.962] [Abstract] Following a review of basic Doppler radar principles applied to detection of moving objects and determination of their velocities by measurement of Doppler reflection spectra, a Doppler radar with an optical rangefinder is described which has been developed and built for monitoring motor vehicles which move through dust clouds. The light source is an LGN-901 CO[.sub]2[/]-laser with operating at a power level of about 3 W. Its radiation is stabilized by means of a piezoceramic corrector and a diffraction grating, whereupon a primary plane Cu mirror reflects it at a 90� angle onto a Ge plate for splitting into an object beam and a reference beam. The object beam is twice reflected upon 45� incidence on two successive plane mirrors, for passage along a parallel path through a diaphragm into a collimating lens which reduces its divergence to one eighth of the original. The collimated beam, 40 mm in diameter with a 0.6 mrad divergence angle, is then reflected by a plane scanning mirror onto the road under observation, whereupon a part of the returning beam is reflected by the same scanning mirror into a receiving objective coaxial with the collimator and operating in the Cassagrain mode. The objective lens has a 1000 mm focal length and a 200 mm outside diameter, its 110 mm inside diameter being larger than that of the collimating lens. The objective focuses the incoming radiation on the diffraction spot on the 0.2x0.2 mm[.sup]2[/] large light-sensitive surface of a HgCdTe photodetector, a high-speed photodiode with a 30 MHz wide passband. The reference beam meanwhile passes through two successive acoustooptic modulators operating at close to one another frequencies (40 MHz and 39.6 MHz) and then, after reflection by another plane mirror, through the receiving objective to the photodiode. For automatic frequency control another photodetector, a photoresistor with 1x1 mm[.sup]2[/] large light-sensitive surface and a 1 MHz wide passband, is placed at the entrance to the laser. Such a configuration of the optical system enables the radar set to operate in the energy mode and in the heterodyne mode without additional tuning. Use of two modulators significantly weakens the effect of direct illumination at the carrier frequency in the reference channel. The radar is calibrated against a foam plastic panel set into 50 Hz vibration by a 10GD-30 loudspeaker head. Figures 2; references 2.
