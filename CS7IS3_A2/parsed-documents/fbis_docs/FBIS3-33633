[Peres] We will in no way agree to U.S. mediation. This will freeze the entire process and bring us back to square one. [Plotzker] Will we reject the mediation even if the price would be the collapse of the talks? [Peres] We will not agree even if the result is a breakdown of the talks. Also, I believe that the Americans will not want to mediate. [Plotzker] Why do you think 'Arafat opted for this? [Peres] 'Arafat has been speaking about U.S. mediation for quite some time. The Palestinians fail to understand Israel's security problem. They believe we are a superpower. Our demands for adequate security arrangements on the bridges and border crossings fall on deaf ears. [Plotzker] Can the Israeli stands be more flexible? [Peres] It is not a question of flexibility. We signed the Oslo agreement; the Knesset approved it; the majority of the people supports it. We must implement it to the letter. If we agree to withdraw from the agreement, we would shatter the credibility of the peace process. Naturally, this would also contradict our real security needs, on which we insist. [Plotzker] So, what it is going to be? Will the parties forever dig in their heels? [Peres] Let me tell you something. The people involved in the Middle East peace process are no longer young; I speak of Israel's prime minister, myself, Mr. 'Arafat, King Husayn, and President al-Asad. It is very probable that the time has come for us to take some unpopular steps and make hard decisions -- because of our age -- to prepare the grounds for the younger generation. After all, in five to six years, the entire Middle East leadership could be different; a new generation will take the reins. The process is essential, and I am optimistic about this new generation. [A report by Sever Plotzker on pages 1 and 15 of the same YEDI'OT AHARONOT edition adds that, arriving in Davos, Peres said: "If 'Arafat wants to bring in the United States as a mediator, he can forget about making progress in the peace process. We have not signed the Oslo and the mutual recognition agreements for this. Such an appeal places a giant obstacle on the road to progress."]
