The media ran numerous calls to be "vigilant," and questioned the possibility of a possible "costly war." Independent newspapers openly criticized the "silence" observed by the Yaounde government on the matter. The weekly LA NOUVELLE EXPRESSION ran an article titled "Sani Abacha Wants a War" in which it disclosed that France, which has sent a high-ranking delegation to the two countries, was "now caught in the middle," involved in a nonaggression pact with Cameroon and caught up with "its interests" in Nigeria. Yaounde media were especially critical of the manner in which Cameroonian authorities are handling the situation. LE MESSAGER says that the decision made by the country and announced on 21 February to take the matter to the International Court of Justice at The Hague is "inadmissible" due to "improper procedure." Furthermore, the newspapers blame the government for its "silence." Neither Paul Biya nor his government has expressed an opinion on the conflict on the Bakassi Peninsula. LA DETENTE denounced "the impotence of a decaying power." Other newspapers, such as PERSPECTIVES HEBDO, describe the conflict as "a crude plot by foreign secret services" and that "Paul Biya and Sani Abacha are taking this opportunity to divert the attention of the people." Only LA DETENTE condemns some of its colleagues who "have a tendency to enjoy the misfortunes of the regime," especially by spreading rumors, like DIKALO, which stated that the 18 and 19 February clashes killed "180 people on the Nigerian side and four on the Cameroonian side." LA DETENTE reminded the public that "this is a very serious issue." Cameroonian television invited Cameroonians to be "vigilant." In a program broadcast during the evening of the 2 March conflict, Cameroonian television asked the public "to sleep with one eye open, because the enemy never sleeps." The presenter, reacting to a Nigerian proposal suggesting a bilateral settlement of the conflict without foreign interference, stated that this proposal was "a trick to deceive Cameroonians." However, he added that Cameroon and Nigeria had no interest in "engaging in a costly war." Recalling the principle of the inviolability of the border, the television said that "Cameroon was ready to defend any part of its national territory. In the television studio, jurists and professors in the field of international relations denounced "Nigeria's moves toward annexation," reaffirming the "non-negotiable character of Bakassi, which is an integral part of Cameroon." The television presenter also affirmed that about three million Nigerians were living in Cameroon and regretted that "despite the sense of hospitality showed by Cameroonians, these Nigerians do not always abide by the laws of the land that welcomed them."
