At the same time pitched battles are under way close to Azerbaijan's border with Iran. Why is this happening right now, when both sides have little hope of resolving the conflict by military means? A few months ago Armenian troops won such convincing victories that it seemed that Azerbaijan had no army left at all. Nonetheless since mid-December the Azerbaijan troops have been making successful advances despite powerful resistance. President Elchibey's unsuccessful attempts to leave Russia's zone of influence and to appeal to Turkey have ended in the realistic Geydar Aliyev coming to power and to Azerbaijan joining the CIS. The latter event is of a partly paradoxical nature since Azerbaijan believes its opponent in the Karabakh war to be not Karabakh as such but Armenia and the CIS thus becomes the only alliance of states of its kind in which two members are at war. This state of affairs automatically assigns Russia, as the nucleus of the CIS, a stabilizing role in the conflict. By the very fact that it has joined the CIS Azerbaijan is unambiguously claiming what is already due to Georgia in the light of its treaty with Russia -- the consolidation of its national army. Five conditions are being set at the secret talks between Russia and Azerbaijan. They include the protection of Azerbaijan's foreign borders by forces of the Russian border troops, the presence of Russian military bases on Azerbaijani territory, the creation of a 12-mile Azerbaijani maritime zone on the Caspian oil shelf instead of the 50-mile zone on which Baku is insisting, recognition of Russia as the only mediator in the Karabakh conflict, and Azerbaijan's recognition of the Nagorno-Karabakh republic in one form or another. These speculations are partly confirmed by the statement made by Grachev in Tbilisi to the effect that Russia will have military bases in all three Transcaucasus republics while there is no public agreement with Azerbaijan on this score. Russia's role could prove very constructive if only because Russian troops, expelled by Elchibey, will appear on Azerbaijan's territory. Something else is also undoubted: Such steps would be extremely unpopular inside Azerbaijan and only a leader with very strong positions in his own country would venture to take them. At present Geydar Aliyev does not have such a credit of trust with the population. The leadership of this country at war can effectively enhance its popularity rating by only one means: successes at the front. In that case Baku's strategy is as follows: to achieve a "limited" military victory with a view to strengthening Aliyev's prestige. He thus gets carte blanche for concessions and steps toward peace. Actually, it should not be forgotten that on the other side of the front line are the field commanders of the Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians, who have no time for big-league politics. They have no intention of strengthening Aliyev's reputation, do not agree to a "limited" military defeat, and are ferociously defending every meter of Karabakh land.
