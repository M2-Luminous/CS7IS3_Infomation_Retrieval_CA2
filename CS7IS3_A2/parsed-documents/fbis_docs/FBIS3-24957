[Chissano] "That is a question that I have been asked constantly, even before I went abroad last week. My answer has always been that I believe that existing problems are of a technical, rather than political, nature, so they should be easy to settle and troop confinement should be over early enough for us to hold elections by October, as scheduled." Asked whether government troop confinement delays were not caused by alleged disorganization, the Mozambican head of state replied: [Chissano] "No, that is no true, because troop confinement does take place in good time when the right means are available and the orders are given. We have not yet had any problem caused by internal disorganization." One journalist asked President Chissano to comment on the Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] leader's remark that Renamo figures, such as first Renamo President Andre Matsangaissa, also be remembered on Heroes' Day on 3 February. [Chissano] "Well, our country (?has to define) [words indistinct] heroes must be recognized at the national level as Mozambican heroes. Those whose names we mention are the more representative, but that does not mean they include all Mozambican heroes. Now, if Andre Matsangaissa had the makings of a hero or not, that is for the Mozambican people to decide."
