The order allows the use of arms in case of attacks on, or other illegal actions toward Russian military personnel or military facilities. Ulmanis told a news conference this today, adding that such an action by the Russian side is not acceptable for him as president. Ulmanis believes that this step on the part of the command of the Northwestern Group of Forces is not a very correct reply to Ulmanis' correct action during the provocation of 10 January [when two Russian generals were detained by Latvians in Riga]. As Igor Golin, the head of the press center of the Northwestern Group of Forces told the Baltic News Agency, the above-mentioned order will not be applicable in cases when Latvian border guards detain Russian military personnel who try to enter Latvia without the necessary documents. According to Golin, the order allows a person who guards a Russian military facility located in Latvia to use arms in case of an attack after a verbal warning or warning shot in the air, as it is provided by the Russian military rules.
