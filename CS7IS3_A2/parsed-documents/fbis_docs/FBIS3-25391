The meeting apparently satisfied both sides. The Niger minister of foreign affairs welcomed the fact that the desired dialogue was becoming a reality. As for the chairman of the Coordination of the Armed Resistance, he said he was glad that the problem is beginning to find a solution on African soil. In fact, the discussion in Ouagadougou will center on one word: autonomy. Mano Dayak, chairman of the Tuareg Coordination, is very keen on this word. He spoke to Christophe Boisbouvier: [Begin recording] [Dayak] We are ready to negotiate, taking as a starting point a document envisaging political and economic autonomy for the Tuareg regions--a program we consider to be good for the whole of Niger. If it is rejected by the Niger Government and other communities, however, we will demand autonomy and discuss it for our regions in the north of the country. [Boisbouvier] You are talking about autonomy, and no longer of federalism? [Dayak] Unfortunately, the word federalism frightens people in Niger and in Africa. If federalism frightens people, what we are interested in is the content. The word does not interest us, so we can also talk of regional autonomy, where our communities can manage themselves economically and politically. [end recording] The government side appears to prefer the term decentralization. Niger Foreign Affairs Minister Adbourahamane Hama also spoke to Christophe Boisbouvier: [Begin recording] [Hama] One of the political lines that the Constitution imposes on our government is that decentralization and devolution -- in other words, the taking over by peoples and regions of their own administration, development, and future -- should be effective and real. [Boisbouvier] So you are ready to discuss autonomy? [Hama] We are not talking about autonomy. You asked me whether we were willing to have the regions of Niger and the people of Niger administering themselves. That is what we are doing at the moment. We want to push this experiment forward and give it its full and real sense. [end recording] The negotiations will deal today with the number of mediating countries, and also on the timetable and location of future political negotiations. Let me remind you that since November 1991 the Tuareg question has officially left some 100 people dead.
