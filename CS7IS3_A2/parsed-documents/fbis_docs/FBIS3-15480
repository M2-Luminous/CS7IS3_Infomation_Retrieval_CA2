The sides have already exchanged compliments in the form of a reciprical expulsion of diplomats or those who were considered to be diplomats. The turn of events is a rather a suprising one. Bill [Clinton] and Boris [Yeltsin] had pledged friendship in the eyes of the world and now here we are faced with this embarrassment. On the American side the fuss is due to many factors: the striving to block the establishment of closer political and economic ties with Russia, the opposition to President Clinton, the dissatisfaction with our efforts to state once again, as it should be, our position and our place in the world in spite of our internal squabbles. It is also due to the cherished desire to put a squeeze on the Russian intelligence service. Tatyana Viktorovna Samolis, Russian foreign intelligence service director's press secretary, is our guest today. Tatyana Viktorovna, the fuss around the arrest of CIA staff member Ames and his wife on charges of spying against [as heard] Russia is not subsiding. One gets the impression that by carrying out reciprocal expulsions the sides have revived the eye-for-an-eye policy. How do you see the situation? [Samolis] First of all, I would not define the situation that has emerged as fitting the eye-for-an-eye scheme. To a certain extent we have here a different variant. Why? Primarily because we consider the expulsion of Aleksandr Iosifovich Lisenko as a discourteous act. This was, most likely, a political step and the Russian side was forced to undertake a reciprical measure, first and foremost, because the expulsion of Lisenko was carried out not out of any operational consideration. Then, whoever Ames really was, Lisenko had had no contacts with him whatsoever. All this situation is to a certain extent burdensome to both the sides. The Russian side would not like to drag out this conflict. On the contrary, we would like, by using all means, to strive to return to the cooperation which has already begun between the Russian and U.S. intelligence services, because the interests that coincide between our states are relatively sufficient in number and the sphere in which we could cooperate is broad. The world is a complex place and very dangerous and there are problems that can be resolved only by applying joint efforts. [Gan] You know that, according to some information, Ames's main aim was in preventing the CIA doing harm to Russia and Russia's agents; in other words, to ensure our security but not to sell and disclose U.S. secrets. Is this so? [Samolis] First, I would like to say that the Russian intelligence service is not going to comment on the Ames case. This is a practice adopted by all the intelligence services. This we should make clear to ourselves. As for your question, on the whole, you are right, to some extent. One could possibly agree with you here. In any case, if one analyzes the U.S. press, a sufficient number of suppositions on this matter have been expressed, including one which can be expressed in the following way: to Ames it was most likely not a operation to penerate U.S. secrets but a counterintelligence measure, a protective measure and a defensive measure for the country which he was acquiring the secrets for. Once again, this is without commenting on the situation itself. The court will decide everything. [Gan] There is another question. It is well known that the CIA is actively involved in intelligence activities on the territory of Russia. The other day, CIA Director James Wolsey, on the whole, openly recognized this. It looks like everybody is engaged in this kind of game. One could then ask why is it necessary, generally speaking, to aggravate and poison the relations between our countries which are already complicated? [Samolis] Yes, you are right here. This was said by the CIA director and not only by him. Many senior officials had made such remarks, including the chairmen of the committees for intelligence services of the Senate and the House of Representatives. On the whole, many people look at this in an absolutely normal way. What can be done about this if the world is made like that? The world is not a safe place and it is quite natural that states cannot do without such a function as the intelligence services. I would also like to speak about some small trivial things. We would not like the Russian proverb that says what the priest is allowed the deacon is not, to be applied to Russia. If the world is a complicated place and is not safe for the United States, the same would be right for Russia and for another country; am I right? [Gan] Yes, of course. [Samolis] Russia has also its own national interests, no matter how strange this might seem. It will continue to defend them by also using intelligence methods. Second, I would to remind you of or maybe acquaint you for the first time with one of the thoughts of Richard Helms, a former CIA director, who once cleverly and ironically remarked that they very well knew that their friends were watching them. The only thing they could blame their spies and foreign spies for was for allowing themselves to be caught redhanded. By the way, speaking about the Ames case, I am obliged to remind us all that he was not caught redhanded. But I said this in connection with another matter: carrying out intelligence activities in the present civilized world is, in no way at all, an obstacle to upholding friendly and even allied relations between states. That is why I do not quite understand all the noise around this case and the attempt to raise this problem from a solely professional level to a supreme political level.
