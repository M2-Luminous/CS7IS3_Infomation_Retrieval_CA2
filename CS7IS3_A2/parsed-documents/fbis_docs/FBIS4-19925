This suspension will be applicable to textile products covered by the multifibre arrangement, with effect from 1 July 1994. This action is the result of the decision of the Republic of Korea to unilaterally increase its customs import duties for some products for which the European Union is a major supplier to the Korean market. This action, has had a direct and detrimental effect on exports from the Union. The measures taken by the Republic of Korea, given the actual timing of their implementation, are contrary to the spirit of the Uruguay Round GATT agreement, which calls for freer, more liberalised Union, in particular, when it is taken by a country whose per capita gross domestic product is similar to that enjoyed by some regions of the European Union.
