FR940721-2-00147 FR940721-2-00085 In Baltimore, the CBP comprehensive community-based strategy is especially well-advanced. Working with the CBP, the City of Baltimore and its Housing Authority have made the transformation of the Sandtown-Winchester neighborhood one of their highest priorities. The CBP partnership aims to ``transform all of the dysfunctional conditions and systems in Sandtown to enable all residents to achieve their highest potential.'' The dysfunctional systems the partnership addresses cross the full range of typical public and human services. Additional Federal, State, and private participants in the transformation of the neighborhood include: the United States Departments of Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, and Health and Human Services; the Maryland State Housing Finance Agency and Community Development Agency; the National Community Development Initiative; the Kellogg Foundation; the Abell Foundation; the Mott Foundation; the Goldseker Foundation; the Strauss Foundation; Baltimore Gas & Electric Company; NationsBank; Habitat for Humanity; local churches; and many local community development groups, including Baltimoreans United in Leadership Development. The community of Sandtown-Winchester contains the 571-unit Gilmor Homes public housing development, as well as over 300 scattered-site public housing units. Nearly half of Sandtown-Winchester residents able to work are unemployed; one-third of the residents have no health insurance. The rate of death from influenza and pneumonia is 2.5 times that of the City of Baltimore. The rate of HIV infection is double that of the City, and is sixth in the State of Maryland. Students in local public schools consistently perform far below state standards on reading, writing, and math tests, and absenteeism is a major problem. Forty-nine percent of all residents live in poverty, and five of six poor children live in single-parent households headed by women. The Sandtown-Winchester crime rate is one of the highest in the City. Typical systems for delivering basic public services of employment, human services, health, education, housing, and public safety have not met the complex and interrelated needs of the residents in Sandtown-Winchester, who have needs typical of residents in many disadvantaged neighborhoods throughout the nation. Large amounts of resources have flowed into the neighborhood from various public and private sources, particularly from government programs meant to address only distinct elements of the many interrelated problems, which have persisted from generation to generation, that are faced by Sandtown-Winchester's residents. CBP is working to change the delivery systems for these programs and resources, to make these services and housing opportunities more accessible to and effective for neighborhood residents. Through the Family Support Teams that will work with clients and their changing needs, the Family Resource Center will transform the delivery system for supportive services from a fragmented maze into a highly responsive personal- and neighborhood-based system. In addition to the core services planned to be available at the Family Resource Center, public housing and other residents of the Sandtown-Winchester neighborhood will be able to access other CBP and partner activities and programs. The Family Resource Center, with its outreach and case management capabilities, will identify residents' needs, connect them to neighborhood-based and City-wide service providers, and monitor their clients' progress. Programs available to residents will include community-based job training, job placement and small business technical assistance, and health care that is focused on preventative measures and primary health care needs. A new Neighborhood Development Center has begun to coordinate the efforts of several community development corporations and other housing providers to construct or renovate housing in the area and to offer counselling and referrals for rental, special needs, and ownership opportunities. Plans to treat substance abuse in the neighborhood include residential, outpatient, support group, and in-home counselling. Youth education and activities programs will include targeted outreach to children from birth to five years of age, to ensure school readiness through a variety of support strategies. Extensive school to work programs and expanded summer recreation and after-school activities involving parents are also planned. Because of the initiative already taken at the local level and the working partnership forged there, the Sandtown-Winchester neighborhood transformation project is an ideal demonstration environment for service delivery integrated across existing Federal program lines. Too often, the requirements of Federal programs have dictated institutional structures at the local level that stand in the way of comprehensive delivery of housing and services to those who need these services to achieve self-sufficiency. The City of Baltimore, HABC, and the community have all come together, supported by The Enterprise Foundation and many private contributors, to implement the Sandtown-Winchester neighborhood transformation. This coordination creates a rare opportunity for the Department to test the capacity of its existing programs to serve in the context of a truly integrated and comprehensive transformation effort. Applicable Requirements Through this demonstration, the Department will explore ways to encourage neighborhood transformation partnerships by, for example, meshing its programs to the needs of the local agencies to coordinate the delivery of programs and services. The strategy to which the demonstration will contribute will integrate public housing residents fully into the services and activities available to the rest of the community, in order to reduce the isolation often imposed by different institutional delivery systems acting within small geographical areas. In order to receive the funding proposed in this notice, the HABC will be required to meet the applicable programmatic and application requirements set out in the NOFA for Public and Indian Housing Family Investment Centers (published at 59 FR 9592 (February 28, 1994), and amended at 59 FR 18570 (April 19, 1994) and 59 FR 29816 (June 9, 1994)) and any subsequent notice that is published after the comment period has closed. When applicable, the certifications, findings, determinations, and requirements listed by the Department under the ``Other Matters'' section of that NOFA also apply to this notice. Authority: 42 U.S.C. 1437t, 3535(d), and 3542. Dated: June 28, 1994. MaryAnn M. Russ, Acting Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing.
