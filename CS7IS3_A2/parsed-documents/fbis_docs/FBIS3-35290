After the meeting, the U.S. ambassador expressed his belief that there will be an opportunity for a truce in Lebanon. He said: What is certain is that the only road to peace in the region is through negotiations. He added that the United States, as well as the Lebanese Government and all other governments, wants to see a peaceful solution in Lebanon. Ambassador Hambley said the U.S. military delegation and the prime minister discussed a cooperation program between Lebanon and the United States that began a year and a half ago and that the discussion dealt with some future moves. This visit, he remarked, is the first in a series of visits scheduled for the delegation. Asked about the likely role of the delegation in the south, Hambley said: We have no details on this matter. No doubt the Lebanese Armed Forces will play a very important role in south Lebanon. We want to help the Lebanese Armed Forces so that they are fully equipped in the future. He referred to a technical training program in addition to some equipment the United States will provide for the Army.
