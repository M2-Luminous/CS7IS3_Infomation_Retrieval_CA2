This thesis was advanced yesterday by kray Vice Governor Sergey Demin in response to rumors circulating in the kray regarding the expected increase in electric power and heat rates. As proof he showed the percentage of January-March expenditures on electric power in the totality of components comprising the production cost at major kray enterprises. The Bor Association--7.7- 8.5 percent. The Khrustalninsk Tin Production Joint-Stock Company-- 5.9-9.5 percent. The Slavyanskiy Ship-Repair Plant--3.6-9.6 percent. The Ussuri Locomotive Repair Plant--1.72-1.38 percent. The figures show eloquently, said the vice governor, that what is ruining the economy is the other "flank." That is, first, high taxes--most of them federal, as the president of the Russian Federation said in his message to the Federal Assembly "On Strengthening the Russian State." Second, the wages paid by an enterprise that respects its workers. Since the mandatory minimum wage of 14,632 rubles [R] cannot be qualified as respect for labor (and this is the figure built into the labor remuneration fund), the enterprises are compelled to take the necessary extra remuneration out of the profit part, which is subject to additional tax on profit. And third, rail transportation rates that are too high. In the latter case, a closed-loop circle of financial problems analogous to that in other sectors is at work. Therefore, the most likely solution lies in reducing the tax burden imposed by the government on producer enterprises, and correspondingly, increasing output. "So far, I have not seen," said Sergey Demin, "any government documents on the subject of repealing a certain decree, No. 1001. There is a document on procedures for forming rates, which gives the regions the right to set them. The kray administration will do its best the keep down as much as possible electric power rate increases. But objectively, as in the rest of the world, this is very difficult to achieve, since prices for components--fuel, materials, and transportation--change." Elaborating on the trends, Sergey Demin recalled that in keeping with Decree No. 1001, subsidies for Maritime Kray to deal with the energy problems were set at R17 billion in 1993. Over the winter the kray managed to add to this amount another R111 billion (a total of R128 billion). This money permitted us to "survive" until spring. Because Maritime Kray enterprises owe the energy sector more than R200 billion for electric power and more than R100 billion for heat. So, despite the share of electric power costs not exceeding 6-12 percent of production costs, enterprises do not pay energy suppliers for months. This situation will lead to a catastrophe within the next five-six months: The kray will not be ready to ensure the supply of heat for itself by the 1994-95 winter season.
