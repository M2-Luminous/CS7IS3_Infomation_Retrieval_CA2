FR940803-0-00042 FR940803-0-00018 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Food and Drug Administration 21 CFR Part 520 Oral Dosage Form New Animal Drugs; Chlortetracycline Soluble Powder AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration, HHS. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the animal drug regulations to reflect approval of two supplemental new animal drug applications (NADA's) filed by the American Cyanamid Co. The supplemental NADA's provide for the safe and effective use of chlortetracycline hydrochloride (CTC HCl) soluble powder in both the drinking water of chickens and turkeys for control of certain bacterial diseases susceptible to CTC, and the drinking water of swine and cattle for control and treatment of certain bacterial diseases susceptible to CTC. The approvals reflect compliance with results of the National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council (NAS/NRC), Drug Efficacy Study Group's (DESI) evaluation of the drugs' effectiveness and FDA's conclusions concerning that evaluation. EFFECTIVE DATE: August 3, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dianne T. McRae, Center for Veterinary Medicine (HFV&hyph;102), Food and Drug Administration, 7500 Standish Pl., Rockville, MD 20855, 301&hyph;594&hyph;1623. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: American Cyanamid Co., Berdan Ave., Wayne, NJ 07470, submitted a supplement to its approved NADA 65&hyph;071 for Aureomycin ® (chlortetracycline hydrochloride (CTC HCl)) Soluble Powder (available in 181 gram (g) (6.4 ounce (oz) packets and 2.3 kilogram (kg) (5 pound (lb) bags, with a concentration of 25 g CTC HCl/lb) and NADA 65&hyph;440 for Aureomycin ® (CTC HCl) Soluble Powder Concentrate (available in 181 g (6.4 oz) and 726 g (25.6 oz) packets, with a concentration of 64 g CTC HCl/lb). The drug products are used to medicate drinking water to be administered to chickens, turkeys, swine, calves, beef cattle, and nonlactating dairy cattle in accordance with §520.445b(d)(4) (21 CFR 520.445b(d)(4)). Both NADA's were originally approved on June 23, 1953, as antibiotic Form 6 applications. The drugs were the subject of a NAS/NRC DESI evaluation of effectiveness (DESI 0113NV). The findings were published in the Federal Register of July 21, 1970 (35 FR 11646). NAS/NRC evaluated the drugs as probably effective for growth promotion and feed efficiency and for the treatment of animal diseases caused by pathogens sensitive to chlortetracycline. NAS/NRC stated: (1) Claims made regarding ``for prevention of'' or ``to prevent'' should be replaced with ``as an aid in the control of'' or ``to aid in the control of''; (2) claims for growth promotion or stimulation are disallowed and claims for faster gains and/or feed efficiency should be stated as ``may result in faster gains and/or improved feed efficiency under appropriate conditions''; (3) each disease claim should be properly qualified as ``appropriate for use in (name of disease) caused by pathogens sensitive to (name of drug)''; if the disease cannot be so qualified the claim must be dropped; (4) claims pertaining to egg production and hatchability should be changed to ``May aid maintaining egg production and hatchability, under appropriate conditions, by controlling pathogenic microorganisms''; (5) the labels should warn that treated animals must actually be consuming enough medicated water or medicated feed to provide a therapeutic dosage under the conditions that prevail and, as a precaution, state the desired oral dose per unit of animal weight per day for each species as a guide to effective usage of the preparation in drinking water or feed; and (6) effective blood levels are required for each recommended dosage. FDA concurred with the NAS/NRC findings. The NAS/NRC evaluation is concerned only with the drugs' effectiveness and safety to the treated animal. It does not take into account the safety for food use of food derived from drug-treated animals. Nothing herein will constitute a bar to further proceedings with respect to questions of safety of the drugs or their metabolites in food products derived from treated animals. The American Cyanamid Co. filed supplemental NADA's which revised the labeling of its products to comply with the results of the NAS/NRC DESI review and FDA's conclusions. The supplemental NADA's are approved as of June 15, 1994, and the regulations are amended by revising §520.445b (21 CFR 520.445b) to reflect the approvals. Additionally, §520.445b(b) is amended to reflect sponsor approvals as a result of this latest DESI finalization: 1. Drug sponsor no. 053389 (Pennfield Oil Co.) is currently codified for the uses provided in §520.445b(d)(3) and (d)(4). Actually, the approval is limited to the uses provided only in §520.445b(d)(2)(i)(D) and (d)(3)(i)(A). 2. Drug sponsor no. 010042 (American Cyanamid Co.) is currently codified for the uses provided in §520.445b(d)(1) and (d)(2). However, approval of its applications is now limited to the uses listed in §520.445b(d)(4). 3. Drug sponsor no. 054273 (Fermenta Animal Health Co.) is codified for all of the current uses in §520.445b(d)(4), which is being amended because the sponsor does not hold an approval for the claim added in paragraph (d)(4)(i)(C) of §520.445b. 4. Drug sponsor no. 017274 (Feed Specialties Co., Inc.) is currently codified for the uses provided in §520.445b(d)(4)(i) through (d)(4)(iii). However, this is being amended because the sponsor does not hold an approval for the claim added in paragraph (d)(4)(i)(C). As a result of the DESI finalization, §520.445b(d)(1) and (d)(2) are being removed (for claims no longer acceptable) and new paragraph (d)(4)(i)(C) is being added to reflect a claim for control of mortality due to fowl cholera caused by Pasteurella multocida . Section 520.445b is further amended in paragraphs (d)(4)(iii)(B) and (d)(4)(iv)(B) to change the name of one of the causative agents, Hemophilus , to Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae , the current scientific name. Finally, §520.445b is amended in paragraph (d)(4)(iv)(C) to add warning statements now required on the labeling. The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1&hyph;23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857, between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360b(c)(2)(F)(iii)), these approvals for food producing animals do not qualify for marketing exclusivity because the supplemental applications do not contain reports of new clinical or field investigations (other than bioequivalence or residue studies) and new human food safety studies (other than bioequivalence or residue studies) essential to the approvals and conducted or sponsored by the applicant. In accordance with the freedom of information provisions of part 20 (21 CFR part 20) and §514.11(e)(2)(ii) (21 CFR 514.11(e)(2)(ii)), a summary of safety and effectiveness data and information submitted to support approval of this application may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
