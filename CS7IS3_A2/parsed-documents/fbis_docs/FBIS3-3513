"This shows that overseas businessmen are bullish on China's market and we have reason to be optimistic about this year's exports," said Wang Zukang, an organizing official of the fair. All the Chinese participants from 20 provinces and cities registered a big increase in exports in January and February, said Wang. The combined annual export value of these provinces and cities has accounted for more than half of the nation's total. The ten-day fair drew 7,788 customers from 82 countries and regions, mostly from Japan, the United States, Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore, Canada and Australia. There were also some first-time participants from Africa and other countries, the organizer said. Thousands of Chinese enterprises displayed over 10,000 varieties of goods. The proportion of new and high technology products as well as machinery and electronics products increased noticeably, according to Wang. Textiles, light industry products and machinery equipment were among those that clinched most orders. Wang said that as more and more domestic exporters took part in the fair every year, it might become a national one before long.
