Gen. Castro, who is also the second secretary of the Cuban Communist Party, indicated that in 1993 the FAR cut its budget by 50 percent, supplied themselves with natural medicines by 70 percent, and were able to maintain their high technical readiness and combat morale. Today Raul Castro inaugurated a new training year for the Western Army, which, he noted, signifies the improvement of defense structures in this region of the country. The western region comprises the Provinces of Pinar del Rio, Havana, Havana City, and the special municipality of the Isle of Youth. Castro pointed out that the transfer of units from the Air Force and the Navy to the Western Army, which have been already implemented in the Central and Eastern Armies, increases significantly the combat potential and the operational autonomy of the commands. Castro stressed that in a recent visit to units of the Central and Eastern Armies, he was able to verify the efforts made to adjust the FAR to the current economic difficulties leaving its combat capacity intact. He added that the FAR's most significant achievements for the past three years include maintaining high morale and combat readiness, preserving the tactics, and contributing to the food program for the population. In addition, Raul Castro emphasized the work carried out by the Youth Labor Army in harvesting sugar, tobacco, tubers, and vegetables in Havana Province, to which it supplies 49 percent of its production. Gen. Castro announced that in 1994, the system to prepare chiefs, officers, and mid-level officers must be strengthened, and stressed that the enemy must realize that the fight will be to the death. Gen. Castro concluded that there will be no mass desertions or generalized collapses because a monolithic unity and absolute loyalty to the revolution and its highest leader, Fidel Castro, prevail in the FAR.
