The worst of the Oslo agreement was the issues we decided to postpone -- for example, the settlements, the issue of the 1948 refugees, external security, and Jerusalem. He added: In my opinion, we have obtained the best conditions even on the postponed issues, particularly the settlements. The whole conflict in this agreement was on how to reduce the area of the settlements and Israel's control over them during the transitional period. Dr. Sha'th added that the agreement does not limit the demand for legitimate rights in the forthcoming period. We have added a clause to the effect that, whatever happens during the transitional period, our rights in the final phase will not be affected. The land in the West Bank and Gaza will also remain a single regional unit. There was also another clause which stipulated that whatever we signed in the Gaza-Jericho agreement did not constitute a renunciation of any of our rights. Sha'th also said that Israel has no right to reoccupy Gaza if settlements and settlers are exposed to danger. Concerning foreign relations, Dr. Sha'th pointed out that Israel advocated that the Palestinian authority should not be allowed to exercise foreign relations. More than this, the PLO would not be allowed to exercise these relations on behalf of this authority, something which we rejected, he said. According to the agreement, countries and international organizations have the right to establish representation bureaus in the self-rule area, but the Palestinian authority cannot have embassies other than embassies of Palestine. On the outstanding points of difference after the signing of the agreement, and the talks to be held about it, Dr. Sha'th said that all these issues are remnants of the Cairo security agreement: these are the Mawasi beach in Gaza, the Jericho crossing point, the Rafah crossing point, the area of Jericho, and the presence of Palestinian soldiers on the Allenby bridge. The talks will continue around four main axes, among which are the gaining of early authority in the West Bank, to include education, culture, tourism, taxes, social affairs, police, and so on. We will also start negotiating over the withdrawal of the Israeli forces from the West Bank and the holding of legislative elections in it. The four-man committee would start negotiating on the return of the refugees after a month. Dr. Sha'th pointed out in a press statement that the talks on the refugees will revolve around two issues only. These are return measures and measures for maintaining security and order; there will not merely be discussions of the same principle.
