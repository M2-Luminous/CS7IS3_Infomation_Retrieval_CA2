FBIS3-49777 "dreeu010__a94034" FBIS-EEU-94-010-A Document Type:Daily Report 14 January 1994 ANNEX Slovakia Hofbauer: `Foreign Sources' Finance Newspapers AU1401095794 Prague CTK in English 0904 GMT 11 Jan 94 AU1401095794 Prague CTK Language: English Article Type:BFN [Excerpt] Bratislava, January 11 (CTK) -- [passage omitted] The source for the report concerning Slovakia published by the Helsinki Commission of the U.S. Congress on Security and Cooperation in Europe [as received] on September 17 last year were newspapers which, given their economic results, should have long ago gone bankrupt and died, Transport and Communications Minister Roman Hofbauer says in an interview for REPUBLIKA. REPUBLIKA is the daily of the government-run Slovak News Agency. These newspapers have evidently prospered from foreign sources, Hofbauer says, with their reports on minorities coming from Hungarian press cuttings. He says Slovakia is the only European post-communist country which has thoroughly redressed the wrongs of the past which were committed against all religions. On the subject of press freedom in Slovakia, Hofbauer says the government is basing its policy on the Council of Europe's resolution on journalistic ethics. Hofbauer adds no one in the government has the task of inspecting the press, because in Slovakia there is no censorship. Statements about the "extermination of Hungarian from road signs" are "considerably exaggerated," he says, because in every state there is a legal form for road signs which cannot be changed at will. If it could, there would be organizational chaos in transport, Hofbauer says. He says that Premier Vladimir Meciar's speech last September about the Romany community was the work of CTK journalist Karel Hirman, who put the words into the premier's mouth. This is why legal proceedings have been started against Hirman. Last autumn's physical attack on Rabbi Baruch Mayers was connected with the growth in crime and had nothing to do with race, Hofbauer says. The offenders were detained and the stolen object, a hat, was returned to its owner, Hofbauer says. There is therefore no need to fear for democracy in Slovakia, and it is enough to confirm "the continuation of the journey to its own promised land," Hofbauer said. The results which Slovakia achieved in its first year of independence are better than international politologists and economic forecasters predicted, Hofbauer tells REPUBLIKA. [passage omitted]
