The topic concerning prospects of French-Turkmen business cooperation in different spheres was raised during talks between Francois Mitterrand and Turkmen leader Saparmurad Niyazov, as well as at meetings of economists from both countries. A large group of French industrialists, including representatives from such internationally established firms and banks as "Gas de France," "Thomson," and "Credit Commercial de France" are also accompanying the French head of state. They are not making a secret of their interest in joining large top priority economic projects, which are being worked out by the Turkmen Government, in their possibly early stage. In turn, Turkmenistan, which strives to join world leaders on the international oil and gas market, sees in enhancing cooperation with French enterprises an opportunity to modernize the technical basis of this leading branch of its national economy, and expedite the realization of the multi-billion gas pipeline laying project which will supply Turkmen gas to Europe. Such French industrial giants as "Elf Aquitaine," "Bouygues," and "Thomson" have already stuck firm roots in Turkmenistan. Besides this, great hopes are being laid on French assistance in the creation and development of modern infrastructure for transport, modern communications and banking services. Judging by all accounts, these hopes have a good base. France, according to Francois Mitterrand, is already prepared to earmark over 220 million francs as credits for these purposes. A number of economic agreements, which, according to Saparmurad Niyazov, must "provide a new impulse to the Turkmen-French development," are planned to be signed at the end of the talks today.
