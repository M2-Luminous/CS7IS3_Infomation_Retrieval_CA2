O you who belonged to the movements of the companions [not further identified] and owned this land for more than 500 years. [passage omitted] O brothers, the Westerners made a terrible mistake when they insisted on turning the Lockerbie problem into a political issue. If they had thought, if they had learned from lessons, they would not have fallen onto that dangerous, slippery path. They should have left the Lockerbie case a purely legal issue. Then they might have been able to try the suspects, to save their shameless faces. They might have been able to avoid the pothole they have fallen into if they had not made it a political issue. [passage omitted condemning France for following U.S.] We are prepared to engage in battle with the imperialists. We held up the olive branch, asked for friendship, asked for understanding, asked for a peaceful settlement, asked for mutual reconciliation and asked for friendship and amity to prevail between the peoples, yet, the colonialist and imperialist circles are bent on confrontation and clashes. We are for it. We are prepared. O America, O France, O Britain, we are prepared for the confrontation. We are prepared to clash. [passage omitted] We reject any infringement of our sovereignty, any harm to our citizens and any violation of our national law. Libyan law is above the law of the United Nations. Libyan law is above international law, because it concerns Libya's sovereignty and its right to live freely on its territory. [passage omitted]
