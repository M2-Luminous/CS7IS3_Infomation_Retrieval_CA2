The essence of the issues was stated with exceptional precision in a recent article, entitled "Premature Partnership," by well-known American political expert Zbigniew Brzezinski: "If Russia is no longer our enemy, then what is it--an ally already, or a client, or simply a defeated enemy? What should be the objectives and content of major U.S. strategy after the `cold war" in relation to the country which, one way or another, is destined to be a force in all world affairs regardless of its present sickened condition?" At the same time rightist conservative figures, above all those closely tied to the Republican Party, reproach the Clinton administration because its proclaimed policy of "partnership with democratic Russia" errs in its exaggerated assessments of Russian reforms, focuses excessive attention on Russia to the detriment of developing U.S. relations with other post-Soviet republics, and prevents the immediate admission of a number of countries of Central and Eastern Europe into NATO. This leads them to demand a rethinking of the whole set of relations with Russia. The causes of such attitudes are obvious. In the first place, there is the anxiety of a significant part of the American establishment over the future pace and direction of the Russian reforms, the continuing danger of major social upheavals, and the unprecedented growth of crime in the country. It is noteworthy that during the recent Senate hearings CIA director James Woolsey expressed alarm at the scale of organized crime in Russia, emphasizing that this not only threatens the reforms and undermines the authority of the Russian leadership, but is even beginning to make it more difficult to fight international crime and creates a danger that nuclear materials will be exported from the former USSR. The administration too has begun to show a more restrained view of the future Russian reforms. And while some of its representatives (Talbot) call for recognition of the first positive results of the transformations despite all the difficulties, others (W. Perry) do not preclude the possibility that reforms will break down and an authoritarian regime hostile to the West will appear in Russia, with the resulting return to some form of "cold war." In the second place, the United States is carefully observing the unending struggle in Russia over foreign policy issues, including relations with the West. An example of this was the debate about the wisdom of Russian participation in the well-known NATO program, Partners for Peace. And special attention is being focused on Russia's relations with the countries of the near abroad. It is perfectly clear that the United States and the West as a whole fear the restoration (in one form or another) of a significant part of the USSR (or Russian Empire) and the elimination of the geopolitical counterweights to Russia, above all Ukraine. In the third place, the real scale of Russian-American cooperation in a number of areas, above all economic, is still very modest. For example, of the 3.2 billion dollars appropriated by the U.S. Congress since 1992 for assistance to CIS countries, as of March of this year (according to American figures) 282 million had been spent, and 141 million of this went to Russia. One of the reasons for this is bureaucratic and other delays in the action of the American state apparatus. In this connection Congressman L. Hamilton said, "The Russians have a right to complain. Congress is appropriating large amounts of money, which are not being used." At the present time the main struggle is unfolding between advocates of so-called "consolidation of geopolitical pluralism" in the territory of the former USSR (Z. Brzezinski, H. Kissinger, R. Zelik, and others) and supporters of the idea of "pragmatic partnership," which has recently been stated by U.S. Secretary of Defense W. Perry and represents a modification of Clinton administration policy in relation to Russia. As for the idea of "consolidation of geopolitical pluralism" in post-Soviet space, it aims at a new isolation of Russia by creating a kind of "buffer zone" of states along Russia's borders. "Only then" argues Mr. Brzezinski, "when an appropriate milieu has been firmly established for Russia so that it can define itself as Russia, will the foundation be laid for strong, true American-Russian partnership." But even with a quick glance at this idea it is obvious that its realization, or more accurately attempts to realize it, would lead Russian-American relations in exactly the opposite direction and would undermine the foundations of stability on the European continent. Least convincing of all are the attempts to reduce all Russia's actions toward the other CIS countries to manifestations of, if not openly imperial, then "protoimperial" policy. Russia has more than enough vitally important interests in the territory of the former USSR, and it cannot be said that its new neighbors always given them proper consideration. This is not to mention the fact that the Western states are not showing real willingness to share even a part of the burden of maintaining stability in the territory of the former USSR, with the exception of actions to eliminate nuclear weapons in Kazakhstan, Belorussia, and Ukraine. And finally, the initiatives relating to various forms of reintegration of some of the former Union republics do not originate solely or even mainly from Russian politicians. The idea of "consolidation of geopolitical pluralism" within the boundaries of the former USSR assigns Ukraine the role of primary counterweight to Russia's neoimperial aspirations. For this purpose it is proposed to greatly increase economic aid to Ukraine, step up pressure on its leaders to push them toward economic reforms, and offer American political guarantees of Ukrainian independence and territorial integrity. It is true that they do not answer the question: Where will the United States and the West get the tens of billions of dollars needed to save the ruined Ukrainian economy, which is barely staying afloat--and that is largely thanks to the Russian reforms. And finally, the main thing--what does the West intend to do if the Ukrainian state disintegrates and what actions does it expect from Russia in such an extremely dangerous turn of events? An important role in assuring "geopolitical pluralism" is assigned also to "broadening the scale and perimeter of European security," or more precisely, admitting a number of Central European countries to NATO, which could be done concurrently with conclusion of a treaty on alliance and cooperation between NATO and Russia. The question immediately arises: Why not conclude such a treaty or some kind of major agreement without enlarging NATO? Is such an enlargement really the only option to ensure stability and security in Europe? The above permits us to draw the conclusion that "consolidation of geopolitical pluralism" is nothing more than an attempt to pursue the policy of "containing" Russia, ignoring the changes taking place in it and in the whole world, especially in European space. We also must not overlook the fact that although the views described above do not exert a determining influence on Washington's actual policy at the present time, they make their mark in public consciousness and are one of the factors that is forcing the administration to modify its policy somewhat in relation to the Russian state. This found expression in advancement of the idea of a "pragmatic partnership" with Russia, which presupposes the existence of contradictions and differences in the national interests of the two countries, but also recognized the need for cooperation in many spheres, above all elimination of nuclear weapons, nonproliferation of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, settlement of international crises, and development of contacts between the military establishments. Such cooperation, important in itself, is less subject to domestic changes in any particular country and serves as an important instrument of the stability of Russian-American relations.
