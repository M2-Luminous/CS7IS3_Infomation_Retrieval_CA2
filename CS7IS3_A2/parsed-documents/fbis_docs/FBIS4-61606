Eduard Shevardnadze thanked the German Government and German people on the whole for the support Georgia can feel from their side. The head of state said that our country is facing two problems: The Abkhaz-Georgian conflict and the grave economic crisis. The disintegration of the former Soviet Union resulted in wrecking economic links with Russia, Ukraine, and other republics. Georgia found itself in a complete isolation. The principal task today is to restore these links and establish integrational contacts with leading world countries. The head of state emphasized that although it is rather difficult to solve the existing problems, Georgia has chosen a road of economic reforms and democracy and will not step aside. On behalf of the German people, Mr. Vogel greeted the head of state and thanked him for the reception. He said that it is necessary to stay by a friend's side when he is in need. The German Government well realizes this, but it also realizes that the assistance it has granted to Georgia is not sufficient and therefore, it welcomes our government's decision to restore links with the republics of the former Soviet Union. Business-like and open contacts do not mean that there will be an element of discrimination, Mr. Vogel said. At the end of the meeting, members of the German delegation expressed hopes that peace will be established in Georgia soon and the country will escape the existing problems. The meeting was attended by Guram Muchaidze, the leader of the Georgian Social democratic Party.
