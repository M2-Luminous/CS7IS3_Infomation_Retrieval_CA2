These figures were released yesterday by acting Minister of Industry, Commerce, and Tourism Ailton Barcelos Fernandes at an awards ceremony for representatives of the sectors that figured most prominently in last year's exports. The balance of trade position stood at $13.072 billion, lower than in 1992, which was $15.308 billion. The minister minimized the fact that the goal of $40 billion in exports set by former Minister Jose Eduardo Andrade Vieira had not been achieved. "That was a very ambitious goal and we are happy to have come close to it," he commented. Predictions For 1994, Fernandes predicts that even higher levels will be reached, in an effort to break new records. He wants to see $44 billion in exports (growth of 13.4 percent), $29 billion in imports (12.8 percent more), a $15 billion trade balance (up 14.6 percent), and a trade flow of $73 billion (plus 13.2 percent). According to the acting minister, these goals were set in light of the expectation that 1993's pace will be maintained. In consultations with the sectoral chambers from the most representative segments of the export economy, he found this to be feasible. The minister said the growth in exports, especially of machinery and raw materials, is a positive development. He commented that imports of luxury items were minor. "Two thirds of the 65,000 automobiles imported, for example, came from Argentina in fulfillment of trade agreements." Highlights The minister gave awards to five sectors for 1993 performance: auto parts, with exports of $1.242 billion (a 22.5 percent growth); footwear, at $1.945 billion (rose 32.0 percent); fresh fruit, at $132.2 million (up 27.3 percent); furniture, at $239.4 million (90.5 percent higher); and wine, at $15.0 million (increased by 96.6 percent). Exports of industrial products gained more than one percentage point from last year's level and accounted for 75 percent of foreign sales. In December, the trade balance recorded the following results: exports at $3.413 billion (less than the $3.484 billion of the same month of 1992); imports of $2.809 billion (more than the $2.223 billion from the previous year); and a trade balance of $604 million (less than 1992's $1.261 billion).
