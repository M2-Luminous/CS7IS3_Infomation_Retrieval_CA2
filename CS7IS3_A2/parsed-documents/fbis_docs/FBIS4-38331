Galazov said that Ingushetia had to forego its claim on the Prigorodnyy District of North Ossetia and that the Ingush refugees had to understand they were North Ossetian citizens and were not allowed to sabotage the decisions of the local authorities. He said it was important that the provisional administration let the local authorities organize the life of the North Ossetian population. He believed that the use of force to return the refugees would result in an out-and-out civil war in the Caucusus which would spread to Russia proper.
