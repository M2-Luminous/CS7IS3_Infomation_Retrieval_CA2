In so far as it is a time when there has been a lot of debate surrounding division of public and private roles such as administrative reform, it is a situation where the view is gaining prominence that government affiliated financial institutions are suppressing private enterprise. However, the government affiliate side has not changed its consistent perception on functions that supplement private enterprise. However, due to the expansion of loan limits that was incorporated in the emergency economic measures, the market feeling is that a crowding out of fund demand has been generated for commercial banks. Plant and Equipment Funds Also Favorable for Private Institutions "We can't help being resentful about the fact that such a one-sided view is rampant." A person in charge of business at a government affiliated financial institution thus refutes the point of the clamorous opinion that public enterprise has been suppressing private enterprise in the aspect of loans. Viewing the loan balance by business sector for the period from June last year to June this year, according to the "Economic Statistics Monthly Report" of the Bank of Japan, the growth rate for plant and equipment funds was 5.8 percent of city banks, 6.2 percent for long-term credit banks, and 5.6 percent for nationwide bank accounts. On the other hand, the growth rate of non-facility funds was sluggish with a minus 2.0 percent for city banks, minus 0.5 percent for long-term credit banks, and minus 0.9 percent for nationwide bank accounts. Totalling plant and equipment funds and non-facility funds, the growth rate was 0.6 percent for city banks, 1.5 percent for long-term credit banks, and 1.2 percent for nationwide bank accounts. In other words, the refutation in the opening paragraph views as an issue the point that it does not clearly distinguish plant and equipment funds and non-facility funds and only argues with figures on a total basis where private financial institutions are sluggish. On this point, the Japan Development Bank summarizes the recent loan trends by saying, "if you consider it from the point that the corporate desire for plant and equipment investment is sluggish with the seriousness of the recession and the circumstances that large corporations are actively procuring funds by straight bonds, it is no exaggeration to say that loans of plant and equipment funds by private financial institutions are steadily increasing and are favorable." The Japan Development Bank is completely specialized in long-term loans of plant and equipment funds such as for big projects or improvement of infrastructure, and does not make short-term loans of working funds. The average lending period is about 15 years. Consequently, it stresses that special factors are at work, saying that "as opposed to repayments increasing within a short period of time and increases in the loan balance being small when the lending period is short like with the private institutions, the aggregate balance is increasing for the Japan Development Bank due to the long-term lending period." Moreover, it emphasizes the point of developing functions that supplement the private institutions in terms of quality, saying that "by our bank financing projects whose profitability cannot be measured precisely by private financial institutions, the credibility of said projects rise also. If that happens, it also is possible for the private institutions to participate in syndicate groups. We are linked, so to speak, in producing external results on the private institution side also." Zenith Age of Functions Supplementing Private Institutions Regarding the cause for the sluggish loans of private financial institutions, the analysis at the Japan Development Bank is that "it is because compared to plant and equipment funds, corporate needs for borrowing working funds are extremely sluggish." Because they do not handle working funds, the Japan Development Bank concludes that "basically, we are not batting with the private institutions." So, what about the Small Business Finance Corp. and the People's Finance Corp. which have a relatively high loan ratio of working funds for medium to small enterprises? The loan balance situation for the Small Business Finance Corp. was an increase of 7.5 percent over the previous year at the end of fiscal 1992. Viewing several recent years, it was similarly an increase of 8.8 percent for the end of fiscal 1988, an increase of 19.7 percent at the end of fiscal 1989, and increase of 11.0 percent at the end of fiscal 1990, and an increase of 6.7 percent at the end of fiscal 1991. Generally, in recessionary periods, the lending limit of government affiliated medium- to small-sized business financial institutions is increased by establishment of economic measures to facilitated fund procurement by medium to small business. For this reason, the loan balance easily has a high growth rate in recessionary periods. However, the growth rate of the loan balance actually was higher in the bubble era. Moreover, the number of agency loans through private financial institutions which have become "a kind of characteristic in the aspect of supplementary functions to the private institutions," (Small Business Finance Corp) was 2,729 in July, exceeding the 2,266 direct loans. In fiscal 1993 up until July, there were 10,767 direct loans and 13,579 agency loans. It is obvious that "viewing the numbers, the growth rate of agency loans has been higher than direct loans." (same) The Small Business Finance Corp. is self-confident saying that "if we inherently were batting fiercely with the private institutions, including working fund loans, agency loans would not increase. However, since agency loans actually are surpassing direct loans, can it not be said that right now is the period when supplementary functions are operating most skillfully?" On the other hand, the People's Finance Corp. has less than 100 employees (commerce and service less than 50) and targets petty businesses with capital less than 10 million yen. In so far as this field is "difficult for private financial institutions to handle aggressively considering the risk," (People's Finance Corp.) the Finance Corp. recognizes that "intense competition with the private institutions is impossible." Actually, the criticism from private financial institutions about the People's Finance Corp. is not as strong as that for the Japan Development Bank or the Small Business Finance Corp. New Kindling However, it is an undeniable fact that "historically in low interest rate situations, the need for long-term, fixed rate funds on the corporate side increases." (Small Business Finance Corp.) On 21 September, the official rate dropped to an historical low of 1.75 percent, but "it has been fully considered that loan applications to government affiliated financial institutions will rapidly increase in terms of a refuge if the feeling of an end to the lowering of the official rate has appeared with this." (long-term credit bank) In addition, emergency economic measures have been established and while some of the loan limits for government affiliates have been further expanded, it can be said that the possibility is great for the government affiliate share to expand in a situation where the corporate desire for plant and equipment investment recovers. Furthermore, there also are cases where the expansion and diversification of system financing has become new kindling. For example, in order to expand "import system provision financing" and "financing to promote investment in Japan," which have the expansion of imports and promotion of foreign capital corporate investment in Japan as objectives, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry incorporated a loan amount of 65 billion yen in its rough estimate request. These financing systems have been implemented by the Japan Development Bank and the Hokkaido-Tohoku Development Corporation under this, but with regard to the import system provision financing, special interest rates less than the long-term prime rate of 4.3 percent have been applied. With regard to project financing and infrastructure improvement related financing, since adequate accommodation cannot be made just by private financial institutions in the aspects of risk and profitability, the significance of the existence of the Japan Development Bank there is fully perceived by the private side also. However, if it is financing with foreign capital corporations as the objective, "it is a field that can be fully accommodated by private financial institutions." (long-term credit bank) The concern that "the private institutions are being crowded out in demand for funds" bears a touch of reality. However, the Japan Development Bank considers the same system to be "based on national policy and we would like to deal with it aggressively." They have no comment about crowding out. A person in charge of business at a government affiliated financial institution who criticizes the view that public enterprise suppressing private enterprise on loans, shut the door on it so to speak, saying "with regard to government affiliated loans, it is a problem clearly of a different dimension than the postal savings problem in the aspect of fund procurement." However, regarding fields which have inherently been accommodated by private institutions, government affiliated financial institutions have been aggressive in lending based on expansion of the lending limit and system financing and as a result, money transferred from the general account (subsidies) are increasing and concern that it will invite an addition to the public burden in the future probably cannot be denied. The basis for a review and debate of public enterprise functions lies here.
