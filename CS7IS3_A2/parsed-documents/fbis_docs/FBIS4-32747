Josef Jezek, an independent member of Parliament who quit Klaus' Civic Democratic Party (ODS) in March, accused Klaus May 12 of making his own amendments to a bill on Senate and Parliament elections and then submitting it to Parliament as the officially recommended government version. Since the split of Czechoslovakia Jan. 1, 1993, the Czech Republic has been operating with a unicameral legislature. The current Chamber of Deputies is the descendant of the Czech National Council, which served as the legislative body of the Czech Republic in the Czechoslovak federation. The bill now under dispute would establish the Senate as the country's new upper house. According to Jezek, the version of the bill presented to Parliament differed from the government-approved one in the sizes and borders of the districts it set for elections to the Senate. "Someone has fundamentally changed the demarcation of the 81 electoral districts," he told RUDE PRAVO. Vladimir Koronthaly, a deputy for the coalition Christian Democratic Party (KDS), laid the blame on Ministry of Interior officials who re-drafted the bill. Their version amounts to a substantive addition, made without the government's approval, he said, and therefore cannot be considered the official proposal. "And the next question is the responsibility of the person who signed it, and that is Premier Klaus," Koronthaly told MLADA FRONTA DNES. According to press reports, the talk in the corridors of Parliament was more pointed: Many suspected that the changes to the districts reflected ODS interests, as the slight changes in boundaries and district sizes cleverly manipulated areas of ODS strength and weakness in order to bolster the party's election chances. Klaus rejected all of the accusations, calling the controversy "useless hysteria." "You know well enough it is nonsense. Nothing of the sort happened. It's an invention of deputy Jezek," Klaus told journalists. ODS has been arguing with its coalition partners about the Senate elections for several months. While ODS demands that there be 81 electoral districts in the upcoming fall Senate elections, with one senator from each district, the other three parties in the ruling coalition--the KDS, the Christian Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-CSL) and the Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA)--want instead 27 districts, each with three senators. The three smaller parties worry that if only one senator were elected from each electoral district, the outcome would be a Senate dominated by one party. And the ODS, as the party with the highest voter support (although its popularity has dropped from 32 percent of voters to 26 percent, according to a mid-May poll), stands to win a vast majority of the winner-take-all races provided for by its version of the Senate election law. Klaus, meanwhile, has threatened that unless the ODS gets its way on the number of electoral districts, it will oppose the formation of the Senate. On March 7, the Cabinet finally agreed to support the ODS version of the bill, and the Ministry of the Interior was charged with making the final adjustments agreed on by the government. According to Klaus, "A couple of officials from the Interior Ministry redrew the maps...according to the consensus demand of the government." The Cabinet had agreed to "redo the maps to follow the current [administrative] district borders," he explained. Klaus said he did not consider the change substantial enough to warrant the charge that the bill submitted to Parliament was a different version than the one agreed on by the Cabinet. He added that the disputes about the validity of the bill had "exceeded all limits, and my patience has really reached its end." According to Jezek, however, the government-approved version of the legislation stipulated that the number of voters could not differ from one electoral district to the next by more than 15 percent, whereas the version submitted by Klaus and Interior Minister Jan Ruml allows a difference of as much as 27 percent. In one instance, press reports said, the actual difference between two districts could be as great as 34 percent. And that, Jezek argued, would disturb the balance of votes. ODA's Radim Spacek agreed, saying the bill's lists of the administrative districts comprising each electoral district wiped from the map five administrative districts: Praha-Zbraslav, Praha-Troja, Brno-Komin, Brno-Jundrov, and the former military region of Libava. If the bill were signed as is, he said, voters in those districts would not be able to cast ballots. Igor Nemec (ODS), director of the Office of the Government, described the dispute as a "misunderstanding." But he confirmed to Parliament that "The government neither discussed nor voted on the change [in the allowed difference in number of voters between districts] and therefore it was not recorded in the minutes," RUDE PRAVO reported. "[But] not all changes are always in the government's decision," Nemec told the daily. Nemec said two options were considered in the Cabinet's discussion of criteria for creating the electoral districts: Either they could correspond strictly to population, or they could follow the borders of current administrative districts. The government opted for the second, thus requiring a change in the maximum permissible difference between electoral district populations, according to Nemec. Representatives of the four coalition parties agreed at a May 20 meeting that the bills were different, and laid the blame on Interior Ministry officials. But they said there was no need to search out a guilty party. Meanwhile, the bill is moving through Parliament's committees, leaving a trail of bitter disputes in its wake. The Constitutional Committee, for instance, supported an ODA proposal for 27 three-senator districts, a fundamental break with the Cabinet's recommendation. The full Chamber of Deputies is expected to vote on the bill during its next session, which starts May 31.
