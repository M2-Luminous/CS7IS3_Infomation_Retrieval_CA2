Experts from the ministries of foreign affairs of the four today concluded all the arrangements for the event in the capital of the Czech Republic. Defense ministers of the Visegrad Group will meet in Warsaw on Friday. There will be no more higher level consultations before the Prague meeting with Clinton. Budapest had different ideas about the preparations for the U.S.-Visegrad summit, but acknowledged the will of the Czech hosts. On the line from Budapest is our reporter Gregor Martin Papucsek with more details: [Papucsek] Hungarian President Arpad Goncz and his Polish counterpart, Lech Walesa, jointly proposed to Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus during the funeral of Jozsef Antall in Budapest that the states of the Visegrad Group coordinate their positions before meeting Bill Clinton. However, Budapest now notes with a degree of regret that Prague refused to form a joint platform. Observers point to the fact that Czech politics views Visegrad cooperation rather skeptically and decisively rejects all attempts which may lead to institutionalizing Visegrad Group activity. It is also observed in Budapest that the Czech representatives have tried from the beginning to emphasize the Czech-U.S. bilateral features of Bill Clinton's visit to Prague. [passage omitted]
