The process of enforcing standardization measures has been expedited since the implementation of NAFTA in an effort to regulate trade practices. The goal is to standardize the regulations of the signatory nations in just a few years, perhaps five. The Commerce and Industrial Development Secretariat (Secofin) has published in the official gazette an agreement that identifies 413 tariff groups for the classification of merchandise subject to compliance with official Mexican rulings. Nevertheless, terms for the regulation of imports are pending from the Secretariats of Agriculture, Communications, SEMIP [Energy, Mines, and Parastate Industry], Health, Sedesol [Secretariat for Social Development], Fishing, Labor, and Tourism. Sources from the business sector, the National Agricultural Council, the UNAM [National Autonomous University of Mexico] Legal Investigation Institute [IIJ], Canacitra [National Association of the Processing Industry], and experts on the issue have said that Mexico needs to create a regulatory system like those used in the United States and Canada if it wants to compete under equal conditions. The IIJ authorities explained that the Mexican negotiators did not understand until very late that pure free trade does not exist and that governments unilaterally close or open the way for imports to their country. That is why the over 400 Secofin terms published in the official gazette and the announcement of several regulatory packages are viewed as measures to restrict the flow of imports to Mexico and thereby control the trade deficit. When this six-year period was initiated, many Secofin officials were inexperienced in world trade and lacked knowledge about how developed nations use free trade in their favor. That is why they were determined to apply the free market doctrine blindly, thus adversely affecting many companies. Now, during the last leg of the Salinas administration, Secofin negotiators have learned how to use international laws in Mexico's favor. For many sectors, however, these measures are coming a bit late, representatives of the Mexican private sector have said. The first sign Secofin gave of reversing the trade opening initiated in 1986 was the application of compensatory taxes against Chinese products. Nevertheless, in these past years, the Union of International Trade Practices has actively sought out import products that harm national production and dumping [previous word in English] practices and have worked to identify sectors that require protection for survival. Secretariat officials have said that the standardization process, "always operative," has been accelerated in the past two months in an attempt to hold back massive importation. The use of measures related to standardization takes up Chapter IX under Article 904 of NAFTA. In the first part, the "right to apply regulations for the security of human, animal, or plant life and for the environmental health of the consumer, the same as any measure that assures its fulfillment or its application," was agreed upon. The second part establishes that "each party can apply the levels of protection it considers appropriate to achieve legitimate goals for security or protection matters." Nevertheless, the fourth part states that the application or creation of technical regulations or nontariff barriers cannot be used as obstacles to trade. Legal experts say the negotiating terms are ambiguous because a ruling could be interpreted for one party as falling under the protection or security provided for in the first part of Article 904; while the other party could argue that such provisions are an obstacle to free trade and are therefore prohibited by the fourth part of the same article.
