Charushnikov, candidate of military sciences] [Text] Three main periods can be traced in the history of creating the Navy of the People's Republic of China [PRC]. They are distinguished by an evaluation of the role of the navy in the country's armed forces, the orientation of their organizational development, and the principles of combat employment. These distinctions, associated with the evolution of China's military doctrine, were largely the result of those changes that occurred in the policy of the Chinese leadership both within the country and in the international arena. The first period, from the time the PRC was formed (1 October 1949) to the early 1960's, was characterized by the fact that with the Soviet Union's help, armed forces were actively formed and equipped in the country. Back in 1949, China's military-political leadership advanced the task of creating not only a powerful army but also a strong navy, capable of operating in coastal waters in order to prevent aggression from without. The lack of a corresponding economic and scientific-technical base, as well as experienced specialists, hindered accomplishing this task with its own forces. The Treaty on Friendship and Mutual Assistance, concluded in 1950 with the Soviet Union, provided a real opportunity for planned creation of a navy, both with use of deliveries of naval equipment and weapons and by creating, with the help of Soviet specialists, its own shipbuilding industry. (In particular, already in the 1950's, the PRC had six major shipyards in operation, where more than 1200 Soviet advisers supported construction of warships and small surface craft). Thus, by the end of the first period, the foundation of a navy was laid, the nucleus of which was ships (up to and including destroyers) and small surface craft supplied primarily by the Soviet Union, as well as captured ships built in Japan, the United States, and other countries. The PRC Navy was able, as a whole, to accomplish the missions of protecting the coastline against invasion from the sea. The second period (early 1960's to the late 1970's) in foreign policy was characterized by the Chinese leadership's departure from the course toward cooperation with socialist countries, which ended with the complete breaking of relations with them. Based on the new political tenets, the Soviet Union and the United States were considered among China's main enemies. The main efforts were directed at speeding up the development of ground-based nuclear missile forces. The concept of "people's war" was predominant in the area of military strategy, which considered the popular masses as a decisive factor of victory in war. Limiting the Navy's missions during this period to defense of the country's coastal areas, the Chinese leadership emphasized the extensive development of light forces and utilization of the favorable physical and geographical conditions for its basing and operational deployment. In addition, due to the "continental" nature of the military doctrine, it was considered sufficient to have antiship missiles installed on shore in order to destroy any maritime target. To a considerable extent, the predominance of such views was caused by China's limited material and technical capabilities. Organizational development of the Navy was accomplished on the scientific-technical and production base created in the 1950's, and the predominant tendency during that period of "relying on one's own forces" impeded the acquisition of modern technology abroad. Thus, creation of a large small-tonnage fleet for conducting coastal military operations and also shore-based missile and artillery units was the result of the development of China's Navy. The changes in China's policy course that occurred during the third period (from the second half of the 1970's to the present) resulted in the need to re-examine the basic tenets of the country's military doctrine. The most significant work to bring its concepts in line with the requirements of modern warfare and the country's real capabilities began with the appointment of Deng Xiaoping to the post of chairman of the Military Council of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in July 1981 and a "strategic change in the guiding ideas of organizational development of the armed forces."[.sup]1[/] The result of the change in the views toward the role and importance of the Navy for safeguarding national interests became the abandonment of wide-scale production of obsolete military equipment and weapons and concentration (particularly during the initial period of reform) of attention on areas not requiring large capital investments and immediately producing a result. These new directions of the new phase of the Navy's development were building ships and creating standardized weapons, modernizing ships that are in service by equipping them with modern armament and equipment, including that purchased abroad, and increasing the combat capabilities of the component forces by improving the forms and methods of operational and combat training. Today, a comprehensive program is being implemented for modernizing the Navy up to the year 2000. One of its priority directions, in particular, is development of forces capable of operating independently, far from friendly shores. According to western and Chinese press data, today's Navy is charged with the following missions: Combating enemy naval forces at sea; providing support to ground forces operating on maritime axes; supporting an amphibious landing defense in cooperation with other branches of the armed forces; protecting sea lines of communication; conducting reconnaissance in the interests of the Navy; executing amphibious assault landings. Organization of China's Navy. The Navy is an independent branch of the country's armed forces and is headed by a commander who simultaneously is a deputy minister of defense. He is responsible for the status and development of the Navy, organizing and conducting operational and combat training of staffs, large units, and units, manpower acquisition and ideological work with personnel, providing weapons and military equipment, and construction and defense of shore installations. The organizational structure of the Navy (Figure 1) includes the Main Staff, three fleets (Northern, Eastern, and Southern), the Sangar River Flotilla, and also the Coast Defense Headquarters with its subordinate districts and coast defense areas. The fleets include warship task forces, naval aviation large units, naval infantry large units, naval bases, arsenals, shipyards, educational institutions, and naval police. Figure 1. Organizational Structure of China's Navy Effective Combat and Numerical Strength. According to Jane's Fighting Ships (1992-1993), the Navy's effective combat strength numbers about 400 ships, 1400 small surface craft, 800 aircraft, and 100 helicopters. The table below gives the number of warships and small surface craft, their class, and basic specifications and performance characteristics. Personnel strength is 260,000, with 28,000 in the coast defense troops, 25,000 in naval aviation, and 6,000 in naval infantry. China's Navy is divided by component forces into submarine, surface, and air forces, naval infantry, and coast artillery. Submarine Forces. The PRC ranks third in the world in numbers of submarines and is one of five countries possessing nuclear-powered submarines with ballistic missiles. The Chines leadership considers the submarine fleet to be the advance guard of defense from the sea and also an auxiliary means of delivering a nuclear missile strike. Construction of diesel-electric submarines at Chinese shipyards under Soviet projects 613 and 633 (Whiskey and Romeo class, respectively, according to NATO classification) began in the mid-1950's. Creation of the series of the first project (21 submarines) was halted in 1964, while submarines of the second project were built until the mid-1980's. According to Western press data, a total of 106 Romeo-class submarines were built; however, taking into account those sold to other countries, the PRC Navy has about 80 of them today. China built its own diesel-electric submarine in the 1970's, given the designation Ming; however, it did not begin series production until the second half of the 1980's. These submarines are similar in characteristics to the Project 633 (Romeo class) submarines, have the same armament, and are distinguished by a somewhat greater displacement. Presently, the effective combat strength includes eight of these submarines, and construction of this series continues. Work is also being conducted to create submarines equipped with antiship missiles. To this end, one of the Romeo-class submarines was modernized (designated Wuhan), on which they installed launchers (outside the pressure hull) for Yinji antiship missiles (firing range up to 40 km, flight speed M=0.9, warhead weight 165 kg, and radar homing head). Despite the successful completion of testing back in 1986, series production of these submarines was not begun. One of the most important directions of development of the Chinese Navy is the construction of nuclear-powered submarines. After commissioning two Han-class nuclear-powered submarines in the late 1970's, which, experts believe, served as the base for working out design solutions and operating principle of nuclear reactors in order to create nuclear-powered ballistic-missile submarines [SSBN], it was resumed only in the mid-1980's. Today, there are five Han-class nuclear-powered submarines in the Chinese Navy. The last three submarines, whose length is 8 meters more than the lead submarine, are armed with Yinji antiship missile systems. The development, construction, and commissioning of the first SSBN, given the name Xia, is considered the greatest achievement in Chinese shipbuilding, which marked the creation of a maritime component of strategic nuclear forces. It was laid at the shipyards in Huludao in 1978 and launched in 1981 (Figure 2 [not reproduced]. After extensive testing, concluding with the successful launch of a Jiuilang-1 ballistic missile (two-stage, solid-propellant, firing range 2700 km, 2-megaton nuclear single warhead) from the submerged position, the SSBN was put into service in the Navy. Earlier published forecasts about series production of Xia-class SSBN's have not been confirmed. Nevertheless, western military press reports that the PRC is presently developing a new SSBN which will be armed with a submarine-launched ballistic missile [SLBM] with a longer range than the Jiuilang-1. Surface Forces. This component force of the Navy includes destroyers, frigates, minesweepers, amphibious warfare ships and landing craft, and also a large number of missile boats, torpedo boats, fire-support craft, and patrol craft. Four Anshan-class ships, built in the USSR in the early 1940's and transferred to China in 1954-1955, became the PRC Navy's first destroyers. Later, as a result of modernization, two Hayin-2 two-canister antiship missile launchers were installed on each of them. Today, ships of this class are in reserve.

Construction of this series (17 ships) was begun in the late 1060's under the Soviet Project 56, (Kotlin-class, NATO classification) and continued for more than 20 years. Most of these ships each have two three-canister Hayin-2 antiship missile launchers (firing range 20 km, flight speed M=0.9, warhead weight 513 kg, and radar or thermal homing head). In 1987, one of them underwent a modernization, during which it was equipped with a helicopter pad and hanger. The last two ships of the series differ significantly in armament and architectonics from those built earlier. Quadruple launchers for Yinji mounts antiship missiles and an 8-rail Crotale SAM launcher (maximum firing range 13 km, SAM flight speed M=2.4, warhead weight 14 km), and instead of 130-mm guns, it has one 2-gun 100-mm mount. It is possible that other ships of this series will undergo this re-equipping. In late 1993, it is planned to commission a new destroyer, given the designation Liuihu. The laying of its keel took place at the Jiangnan shipyards in 1988, and its launch took place in 1991. The ship is equipped with gas-turbines, has modern armament (four two-canister launchers for Yinji antiship missiles, and Crotale SAM's), and can carry two antisubmarine warfare [ASW] helicopters. Construction of frigates (patrol escorts) in China began in 1955 by assembling finished sections and assemblies delivered from the USSR. In 1958-1959, the first four Chengdu-class ships (Soviet Project 50, Riga-class by NATO designation) were commissioned into the Navy. Similar to the Anshan destroyers, in the early 1970's they underwent modernization (Hayin-2 antiship missile complexes were installed in place of the torpedo tubes). The next series of ships of this type (five Jiangnan-class ships) were built in the second half of the 1960's based on a previous project. Their ASW capabilities were expanded by placing two RBU-1200 depth-charge rocket launchers (firing range 1200 meters, depth-charge warhead 34 kg). The largest series of Jianghu-class ships of this type (27 ships) has several modifications. Their development was helped considerably by the experience gained in creating Jiangnan-class frigates and modernizing the Chengdu-class frigates. Ships of the first sub-group (lead ship commissioned in 1976) have a total displacement of about 1700 tons and are armed with Hayin-2 antiship missiles (two two-canister launchers), two one- and two-gun 100-mm mounts, six (on some four) twin 37-mm gun mounts, and two RBU-1200 rocket launchers. Two new modifications of Jianghu-class frigates, having a greater displacement (1820 and 1920 tons) and different armament, appeared in the second half of the 1980's. One of the ships was equipped for basing an ASW helicopter, in connection with which armament located in the stern portion of the ship was dismantled (one antiship missile launcher and one 100-mm gun mount). In addition, it was equipped with two three-tube 324-mm torpedo tubes, and the foremost Chinese-made 100-mm gun mount was replaced with a French single-gun mount of the same caliber. Four ships had the two two-canister Hayin-2 antiship missile launchers replaced by four two-canister Yinji launchers. Several of the Jianghu-class ships have been built for the navies of Egypt, Bangladesh, and Thailand. Jiangdung-class frigates (two ships), laid earlier than the Jianghu-class, were commissioned considerably later in connection with equipping them with the Hunxi-61 SAM system, which was mastered over a long period of time. These ships do not have antiship missile complexes, and their specifications and performance characteristics are identical to the Jianghu-class ships of the first modification. Surface ships of this type were developed further in the new Jiangwei project. According to foreign press reports, three ships are to be commissioned already in late 1993. They have a somewhat greater displacement, are armed with antiship missile and surface-to-air missile systems, and can carry an ASW helicopter. (To be continued.) Footnote 1.
