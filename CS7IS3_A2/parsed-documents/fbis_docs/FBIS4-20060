Its stern ultimatum to the Serbs was unavoidable. The delay in issuing it had a very high, intolerable, human cost, but perhaps the consequences entailed in NATO's decision demanded such a long period of reflection. Now, however, the people of Gorazde can no longer be abandoned to General Mladic's gangs. Their fate is, and has been for some time, closely bound to the credibility of the top international bodies and the major democracies. It is for this very reason that an ultimatum, in practice, an order for an immediate cease-fire, was issued. By its inflexibility it seeks to compensate for blameworthy delays and reveals anger and outrage not entirely due to the human tragedy. The Serbs tried to conceal the bloodshed, prevented television cameras from entering the besieged city, and it is likely that the absence of pictures of the massacre reduced the level of people's feelings and thus public pressure, especially in America, which was very strong during the earlier tragedy in Sarajevo. General Mladic was thus able to gain time. In his haste, the Serbian leader nevertheless failed to realize that, by so obviously defying NATO, by humiliating the military alliance on which the United States bases its leadership in Europe and a large part of its image worldwide, he was prompting an inevitable response. General Mladic is a man with a primitive audacity who, like many of his contemporaries, has learned to calculate time according to the television yardstick. After the two NATO incursions on 10 and 11 April he waited a few hours, long enough for two or three CNN news broadcasts, then resumed his assault. He thought that the West, headed by the Americans, had abandoned their arduous task of halting his men on the outskirts of Gorazde. In fact he had good reasons for believing so. His belief rested on several precedents. But this time Mladic went too far, and he did not receive a warning from television. He failed to realize that, by dropping those four bombs in two incursions on 10 and 11 April, NATO took an important change of course. Having acted for 45 years as a deterrent shield against the Soviet Union -- almost half a century without ever firing a single cannon shot -- on that occasion the Atlantic alliance became an offensive mechanism. Those four little bombs in April had a great political significance. As LE MONDE put it, having been a shield, NATO became a sword. Mladic took it for a tin sword. A comical sword. The Serbs laughed at it and continued bombarding Gorazde. And the whole world laughed with them, mixing tears for the dead and wounded, nowhere to be seen on television, with laughter for the disgraceful showing by Clinton's America (people stopped laughing at Europe some time ago). European diplomatic and military officials involved in discussing what stance to adopt in Bosnia with their American counterparts say that in recent days the latter "became monsters." They stubbornly insisted on the need to salvage NATO's credibility, readily admitting that the United States' own credibility was at stake too. The United States decided some time ago to continue performing a crucial role on the Old Continent, via NATO, by providing it with the decisive means for essential air cover. That is, without obligatorily deploying land troops, which would revive nightmares about Vietnam across the Atlantic. The French and British, anxious about their men in Bosnia, tried to curb America's anger by pointing to the dangers that the blue helmets would face if NATO bombarded General Mladic's troops and guns. The latter would not hesitate to take them hostage, and probably even he would be unable to prevent his troops from taking savage reprisals against isolated UNPROFOR units within easy reach. In the past such arguments stifled UN and NATO plans for intervention amid uncertainties. This time, however, the Americans dragged the reluctant Europeans with them by force; some of the Europeans, under irresistible American pressure, subsequently decided to speak out in favor of the ultimatum to the Serbs even before the NATO meeting in Brussels. Better to appear the promoters of the enterprise rather than to be accused of cowardice by an over-excited public. In an attempt to tame the American "monsters," the Europeans used even Russia's rumblings. Actually, the Russians did more shouting than grumbling in the European capitals. They often raised their voices in an attempt to show that air incursions against the Bosnian Serb troops would kindle Slav and Orthodox patriotism within Moscow's parliament, creating difficulties for the already beleaguered Boris Yeltsin. In order to divert the Europeans from their intent, Russian diplomats insistently pointed to the reassuring "promises" given by Clinton to Yeltsin by telephone. But the Americans convinced the Europeans that the Russians must not be taken too literally and that they should be reassured but not heeded at this stage in their history. Furthermore, Yeltsin had dissociated himself considerably from the Serbs. He had essentially displayed salutary common sense, partly dictated by the need for Western economic aid and the desire to save energies to be devoted to more vital crises. That in Ukraine, for instance. So General Mladic was misled by Clinton's innocent face as it appeared on CNN. He thought that NATO had abandoned its endeavor and that the Serbs could calmly massacre and "win the war." Instead, the war has suddenly been further complicated. It is acquiring a different pace and a different dimension. What are they? It is possible to question the effectiveness of an air intervention without the deployment of adequate ground troops. Indeed, with inadequate ground units that are in danger of being taken hostage. But these are the consequences that were pondered for so long -- though every hour cost human lives -- thus postponing the inevitable NATO ultimatum. There was no other choice. We knew it. Perhaps General Mladic too will realize it before tonight's midnight deadline.
