His visit is taking place within the framework of the visit by the president of the Russian Federation, which starts tomorrow. The key military question to be decided during the Russian president's visit is the question of establishing Russian military bases on Georgian territory, Pavel Grachev told journalists on arrival. The interim agreement on the status of Russian forces in Georgia expires in 1995, he recalled. "We are willing to keep our troops in Georgia provided military bases are established for them. This fits in with the CIS's treaty on collective security. If the two heads of state resolve the bases issue satisfactorily tomorrow, the agreement will be worked out by military experts," the minister said. There is a possibility that a protocol of intent on the establishment of Russian military bases in Georgia could be signed, he added. If agreement is reached on the bases, the Russian side expects to have three military bases on Georgian territory, making a total of five in the Transcaucasus area, with a combined strength of about 23,000 men. The main task of this grouping, Pavel Grachev said, is to safeguard security in the Transcaucasus and North Caucasus regions against outside threats, within the framework of the CIS's collective treaty. Pavel Grachev also noted that the question of assisting Georgia with the formation of an army "would be resolved provided political stability is established in the republic, and the political status of Abkhazia and South Ossetia defined". Pavel Grachev considers it possible that Russian peacekeeping forces might be used to settle the situation in Abkhazia, provided that both the Georgian and Abkhaz sides ask for this.
