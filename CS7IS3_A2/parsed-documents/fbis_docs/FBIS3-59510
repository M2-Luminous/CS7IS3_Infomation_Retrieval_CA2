Its aeronautics branch is eliminating 10,300 jobs, and its automotive branch, 14,000. And its electrical engineering subsidiary is seeking new alliances. The emphasis is now on reduction of costs. "Gross ist wunderbar [Big is wonderful]," Daimler-Benz's CEO [chief executive officer] Edzard Reuter responded to those who criticized his industrial bulimia. That was in 1989. Reuter had just completed a forceful entry into MBB [Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm], Germany's big aircraft manufacturer. Five years later, the visionary leader of Europe's largest industrial group (approximately 349 billion francs [Fr] of annual revenue] is in the grip of the worst recession in its history. The current economic turnarounds are buffeting the German eagle's expansionist ambitions in its sectors of predilection -- the automotive (70 percent of its activity), the aeronautical (17 percent), and the electrical engineering (11 percent) -- with crushing force. Dornier, MTU, MBB, Fokker, and Deutsche Airbus -- all brought together under Daimler's subsidiary, Deutsche Aerospace (DASA) -- are reeling from cancellations of orders by airline companies and the drastic reduction of military spending across the Rhine. Its flagship fighter-aircraft program, the Eurofighter, being realized together with England, Italy, and Spain, and already seriously downsized, is now also running into serious technical difficulties. And its prospects are all of the gloomiest. In 1993, DASA's orders will total Fr10 billion less than projected, and for the second consecutive year, the Munich-based firm will post losses. Given the situation, Jurgen Schrempp, the company's president, is slashing away at costs. After putting in place an initial cost-cutting plan last fall, he has now announced a new phase: the elimination of 10,300 jobs and the closing of six plants. The goal: savings of Fr5.2 billion annually in this sector, deemed strategic for the future of the Daimler group. The restructurings of its aeronautics branch are all the more necessary since its automobile branch, Daimler-Benz's traditional pillar, has also been profoundly hit. A drop of around 28 percent in new car registrations combined with the cost of launching its new C series, and the turbulences of the European market for heavy trucks, have Mercedes also tobogganing in the red for 1993. To resume the road to competitiveness, the subsidiary's top management estimates that it must reduce operating costs by 30 percent within a period of three years. This coming year, 14,000 jobs will be eliminated in the prestigious automobile manufacturer's plants. Mercedes remains tightly knit and is moreover planning to launch its entry into the micro-car market -- a cultural revolution that takes on the allure of a challenge. Meanwhile, Daimler's profits are melting like snow in a hot sun, jeopardizing Edzard Reuter's position. Nor can he count any longer on AEG, Daimler's electrical engineering subsidiary, which expects to post a loss of Fr1 billion this year. Having already divested itself of its domestic appliances business to Sweden's Electrolux, AEG is now searching for new alliances.
