Chen Xitong pointed out that the key to accelerating the development of mountainous areas lies in emancipating the mind, opening wider, relaxing policies, and entering the market. Chen Xitong as well as Yang Chaoshi, standing committee member of the municipal party committee, and responsible persons of pertinent committees and offices went to Yanqing County to the north of the Great Wall on 14 January. They heard reports by Liu Jinsheng, secretary of the county party committee, and Li Shuwang, head of the county, and gave speeches at the township enterprise work conference of the county. [passage omitted] Chen Xitong pointed out: There are five major reasons why Yanqing County has not developed fast enough. First, it has not opened itself wide enough. The mountainous areas, in particular, have established few ties with the outside world and closed themselves for long periods of time, thus hindering their development of the economy and various undertakings. They should open their doors wider to other domestic areas and the foreign countries. Second, Yanqing has yet to fully develop its advantages. With 500,000 mu of cultivated land, Yanqing may take advantage of the difference in temperature to produce the grain, forestry products, fruits, and vegetables that meet market demand and march toward a modernized agriculture. It may also tap the potential in the mineral resources in the mountainous areas and its tourist resources. Third, its degree of industrialization is not high, and township enterprise development is sluggish. Two-thirds of its labor forces still feed themselves by farming and many labor forces have yet to free themselves from farming. It should regard industrialization as the fundamental way of development. Only when township enterprises are developed, can the labor forces be diverted from farming and the productivity improved. Fourth, Yanqing has not emancipated the mind fully enough. It should further emancipate the mind and note both its inferiority and superiority. It should uplift spirit, admit but not be reconciled to its backwardness, and work in a down-to-earth manner to change the backward outlook. Fifth, the municipality and pertinent departments have not provided sufficient assistance. They should render more help to accelerate Yanqing's development. [passage omitted] On 15 January, Chen Xitong and others went to Changping County. They heard reports by Zhang Geng, secretary of the county party committee, and Li Shixiang, acting head of the county, and visited Heishanzhai and Xiazhuang Villages to learn about the situation. [passage omitted] Cheng Xitong fully affirmed the development of these two villages. He pointed out: Heishanzhai Village has done it well to follow the idea of "developing mountainous area based on the reality of mountainous area; and leaving mountainous area (for planned localities) to develop mountainous area." Both villages have proceeded from their reality and their own advantages in resources to vigorously develop the fruits and mineral products that have bright market prospects. This reflects the development idea of "living off the mountain skillfully when living on the mountain and entering the market to achieve prosperity." Chen Xitong expressed satisfaction with Xiazhuang Village which boosted peasants' production enthusiasm through the leasing system, stressing the need to implement the guidelines of the municipal rural work conference and to relax policies to accelerate the development of mountainous areas, especially the old mountainous areas with economic difficulties.
