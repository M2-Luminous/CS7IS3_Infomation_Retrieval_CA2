Speaking at a press conference held within a session of the Executive Council of his Civic Democratic Party (ODS), Klaus said that the state should transfer to churches certain property which serves their mission and goals, saying that no further "law of a restitution character" would be adopted. He said that work continued on a legal document dealing with the completion of restitutions and extra-judicial rehabilitations also referred to as "a restitution and rehabilitation full stop." "We know well that before this full-stop is made, questions related to the return of church property must be solved," Klaus said. The law winding up restitution and rehabilitations should have a preamble saying clearly why restitution and rehabilitations were realised and what stage they have reached, he added. The law itself would de facto rescind all articles of the existing restitution and rehabilitation laws (blocking privatisation), Klaus said. Parliament chairman Milan Uhde (ODS) added that the preamble must clearly say that "we are aware of the fact that the extent of wrongdoings and crimes which had been committed against property, human rights and lives is much higher than any law could have tackled." "But this does not mean that we, as representatives of the state, should engage in a lifetime search for definitive and absolute justice," he added. The restitution of church property has for long been a question at issue between the ODS and the three other coalition parties -- the Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA), the Christian Democratic Union- Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-CSL) and the Christian Democratic Party (KDS) which supported broader restitution than the ODS. But Klaus has stressed that the issue is hampering and slowing down the process of definite settlement of property relations in the country and the process of privatisation.
