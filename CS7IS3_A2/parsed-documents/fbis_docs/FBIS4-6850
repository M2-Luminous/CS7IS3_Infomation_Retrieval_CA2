After a morning cabinet meeting in which Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's cabinet resigned en masse, Hiroshi Kumagai, head of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), said the survival of Japan's economy depends on further deregulation. "Japan has taken only the first step in its deregulation efforts," Kumagai said. "The fire for reforms built up by Mr. Hosokawa should not be extinguished." Manae Kubota, director general of the Economic Planning Agency (EPA), urged the new government, to be headed by outgoing Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, to put priority on consumers. She said that while promoting deregulation and other reforms, the new government should focus on such issues as seeing that the benefits of the high yen are passed on to consumers and repeated that income tax cuts to stimulate the economy should precede an offsetting hike in such indirect levies as the consumption tax. Political sources speculated that Kumagai will keep his post as MITI minister under Hata. Kubota said she had heard nothing of her own prospects. On trade issues, Kumagai hinted at perplexity on new U.S. proposals to restart stalled bilateral "framework" talks, saying Washington's approach should be "a bit clearer." Contents have not been disclosed of the U.S. proposal Hata received as foreign minister April 15 from trade representative Mickey Kantor at a global trade meeting in Marrakech, Morocco. The United States and Japan have "fundamentally different interpretations" of the framework objectives, a senior MITI official said last week, adding Japan will respond to the U.S. proposal after next week's string of national holidays.
