Except the Defense Minister's Birthday":"Spare a Word for the Poor 'Glavpur' [Main Political Directorate]"] [Text] The Defense Ministry collegium has made another decision on another reorganization of the Main Directorate for Work with Personnel, the now former the Main Military-Political Directorate of the Soviet Army and the Navy. Veteran political workers will remember that this is either the fourth or the fifth "purge" of the once indivisible ranks of ideologists and propagandists. The names, structures, and staffs have changed but the department itself has remained, albeit with fewer people. Everyone criticized it except the lazy ones: a "bastion of stagnation," a "hotbed of deception," and so forth. But in the crackle of newspaper crossfire it seemed to have been forgotten that there is no other organization capable of taking care of the education of soldiers and sailors. There was much talk about military chaplains but for some reason priests, mullahs, and rabbis did not appear in the barracks. "The army is outside politics" -- that was the main slogan of recent years. But can that be said today after the events of 4 October and the elections? Some observers, albeit highly cautious ones, connect the latest "purge" of the "Glavpur" with the elections in particular. In Russia's political elite people believe that the Army made a weighty contribution to Vladimir Volfovich [Zhirinovskiy]'s victory. But it voted for the new Constitution, too, didn't it? Be that as it may, it is now being said that the directorate's staffs will be reduced by two-thirds leaving fewer than 50 people in the new structure. What will the trade-off be? For the moment there is none. The Armed Forces will finally be outside politics and at the same time outside education.
