FR940428-0-00016 FR940428-0-00004 Columbia suggests that the Commission exempt from filing all regular employees in the holding company whose expenses do not exceed $30,000 per year. By its terms, however, section 12(i) does not appear to permit a de minimis exemption. 47 The Commission therefore declines to adopt this suggestion. Accordingly, the rule is adopted as proposed. 47 Section 12(i) requires the filing of forms with the Commission with respect to individuals who ``present, advocate, or oppose any matter.'' K. Rule 83: Exemption in the Case of Transactions With Foreign Associates Section 13 of the Act requires that service, sales and construction contracts be performed economically and efficiently for the benefit of associate companies at cost, fairly and equitably allocated among the companies. Under rule 83(d), any subsidiary company can perform service, sales and construction contracts for a foreign associate company without complying with the standards of section 13(b), and without the need to apply for, and receive, prior Commission approval, so long as the aggregate cost of such contracts does not exceed $10,000 annually. 48 The Commission proposed to amend the rule to extend the exemption to all transactions, at not less than cost, with foreign associate companies. 48 17 CFR 250.83(d). The Commission had believed that the pricing requirement under the proposed amended rule would provide an adequate safeguard against abuse. A question has arisen, however, whether the rule would protect against a diversion of management and other expertise away from the needs of the system's core utility operations. The Commission will consider these issues in a companion rulemaking involving a proposed amendment to rule 87. 49 Accordingly, the Commission is deferring action for further consideration of the proposed amendment to rule 83. 49 The Commission proposed to amend rule 87 to clarify the requirement of prior approval, by order upon application, for service, sales or construction contracts involving an exempt wholesale generator or foreign utility company and an associate company. See Holding Company Act Release No. 25887, International Series Release No. 584 (Sept. 23, 1993), 58 FR 51508 (Oct. 1, 1993). L. Uniform System of Accounts and Form U&hyph;13&hyph;60: Annual Report for Mutual and Subsidiary Service Companies The Commission is deferring action on a proposed amendment to the annual report form for mutual and subsidiary service companies, Form U&hyph;13&hyph;60. 50 The proposed amendment was intended to harmonize the Commission's Uniform System of Accounts for Mutual and Subsidiary Service Companies and the FERC's standard accounts for utility companies. 50 See Holding Co. Act Release No. 1858 (Dec. 29, 1939) (adopting Form U&hyph;13&hyph;60); Holding Co. Act Release No. 21447 (Feb. 22, 1980) (amendment). The Uniform System of Accounts are found in 17 CFR 256. Most commenters expressed confusion as to the proposed changes and the degree of flexibility they would afford. These commenters asked the Commission to clarify its proposal. In light of these comments, the Commission has decided to defer action to enable it to consider the matter more closely. M. Other Matters Finally, the Commission is amending or deleting obsolete language in certain rules, including references to the Federal Power Commission, the Atomic Energy Commission and the Bankruptcy Act. 51 51 See, e.g., 17 CFR 250.7, 250.26, 250.27, 250.49, 250.52, 250.62, 250.63. II. Summary of the Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis The Commission has prepared a Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis in accordance with section 603 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 603, regarding the amendment to rule 7. The Analysis explains that the amendment is intended to expand the exemption from regulation for companies that are primarily engaged in nonutility businesses. The Analysis describes the present regulatory framework under which a company operating public-utility facilities must obtain a Commission order declaring it not to be an electric or gas utility company, unless the gross sales of electric energy, or of natural or manufactured gas distributed at retail by means of the facilities owned or operated by such company, did not exceed $100,000 during the previous calendar year. The exemption by order is not available for companies that own but do not operate such facilities. The amendment would increase the dollar sales allowable under the exemption to $5 million. The Analysis states that several significant alternatives to the amendment were considered, including continuing to grant exemptions by order on a case-by-case basis, but concludes that the amendment provides the least impact on, or cost to, small businesses. A copy of the Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis may be obtained from Brian P. Spires, at Mail Stop 10&hyph;6, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 5th Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. The other rule and form amendments will not affect any small entities as defined in rule 110. Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Chairman of the Commission has certified that the amended rules would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The Commission did not receive any comments with respect to the Chairman's certification. III. Cost/Benefit of Proposed Actions The amendments will decrease regulatory compliance costs for companies in a registered holding company system. In fiscal year 1993, for example, the amendments would have eliminated the need for 22 applications and approximately 545 forms, and would have reduced the regulatory burden associated with an additional 86 applications, for an estimated savings of more than 4,114 hours per year. Moreover, the amendments would have reduced by approximately 1,576 hours the staff time associated with reviewing and analyzing these applications. The only cost to the companies complying with the amended rules will be the cost of reporting on Form U5S the information required by rule 40(a)(5). It is estimated that no more than one-half hour will be required to complete the additional information required by the change to Form U5S. IV. Paperwork Reduction Act The Office of Management and Budget has approved the amended rules and forms for continued use through December 31, 1995 and February 28, 1996 (Control No. 3235&hyph;AF68). V.

(a) Any company which is primarily engaged in one or more businesses other than the business of an electric or gas utility company, shall not be deemed an electric or gas utility company within the meaning of section 2(a)(3) or section 2(a)(4) of the Act if the gross sales of electric energy, or of natural or manufactured gas distributed at retail by means of the facilities owned or operated by such company, did not exceed an average annual amount of $5,000,000 over the preceding three calendar years. There may be excluded from the gross sales specified:
