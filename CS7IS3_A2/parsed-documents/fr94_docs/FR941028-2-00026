FR941028-2-00026 FR941028-2-00018 The action will cause no significant impact to ambient noise levels or air quality. Localized, temporary impacts will occur during construction and demolition activities. Compliance with State (Title 35, Section 228) and Federal regulations, including National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPS), will be achieved during removal of asbestos-containing materials. NTC Great Lakes is located in a non-attainment area for ozone. An applicability analysis was performed for air pollutant emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO X ) and volatile organic material (VOM) in compliance with the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 and 1993 final rule for determining conformity of federal actions to State or Federal Implementation Plans (40 CFR Parts 6, 51, and 93). The analysis included construction-related emissions, mobile-source emissions, and stationary-source emissions associated with the realignment. Neither NO X nor VOM emissions estimates for any year of the action exceeded the de minimis levels of 25 tons per year. Therefore, the action is presumed to conform to the State Implementation Plan (SIP) and is exempted from any further requirements of the General Conformity Rule. The action at NTC Great Lakes will not impact any Department of Defense Installation Restoration Program (IRP) sites. The action will not violate any conditions of the NTC Great Lakes Waste Management Plan or the Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures Plan. A Remedial Investigation is currently underway at Glenview Annex to determine the extent of contamination at an IRP site (former fire fighting training area) where it intersects the eastern portion of the family housing site. Also, based on a review of historic aerial photographs as part of the BRAC cleanup plan for the closure of NAS Glenview, the previous existence of three ordnance magazines and a trap/skeet range may exist on a portion of the new family housing area. Contaminated soils that exceed regulatory levels will be remediated prior to construction in accordance with applicable federal and state requirements. The increase in population from the action will be small in comparison with the existing populations in Lake County and the Chicago metropolitan area, and will not result in significant impacts to facilities or services on-base or in the region. The additional economic activity from the action will result in a net positive effect on the local economy. The action will not significantly impact existing land uses at NTC Great Lakes, in the City of North Chicago, or the Village of Lake Bluff. The action will provide a net increase of 206 new family housing units at the Glenview Annex family housing area because 34 units of existing family housing will be replaced. The additional vehicular traffic generated by the action will not be significant and the cumulative impact is anticipated to be less than 1990 levels. The action will increase the number of school-aged children by an estimated 312 students, with an estimated 122 students being dispersed throughout the local communities as a result of naval personnel living off-base. The remaining 190 students are expected to reside in the NAS Glenview family housing. Based on current distribution of naval personnel living off-base, the 122 additional students will attend schools in the communities surrounding NTC Great Lakes and the impacts to individual schools will be minimal. Of the 190 students expected to reside at NAS Glenview, it is estimated that 38 students will attend District 225 schools and the remaining 152 students will attend District 34 schools. District 225 officials consider school capacity to be sufficient and financial impacts to be negligible. District 34 has indicated that an additional 152 students would have a negative impact on district facilities and finances, and could require six to seven new classrooms. The school district should receive Federal Impact Aid reimbursement for lost property taxes for each family residing at Glenview Annex. This will serve to equalize the contribution from Glenview Annex residents with those of the local community for education support. Additionally, it is expected that the conversion of much of the currently non-taxable NAS Glenview property to commercial, industrial, office, and other taxable property will have a positive impact on District 34 revenues. Utilities at NTC Great Lakes and at the NAS Glenview family housing site have adequate capacity to serve the additional personnel at both sites. NTC is allowed to discharge up to 10.5 million gallons per day (mgd) to the local wastewater treatment authority, and the realignment will bring the total NTC discharge to 2.8 mgd. The wastewater treatment facility serving Glenview Annex has 180 mgd excess capacity, and will be able to accommodate the additional 0.2 mgd discharge from the Navy family housing units. Police and fire protection services are also adequate to serve the needs of the new facilities. An expansion of the medical and dental facilities at NTC Great Lakes is programmed to meet the needs of the additional incoming students and staff population. On-base community and recreational services and facilities are adequate to serve the needs of the larger population at both NTC Great Lakes and the NAS Glenview family housing area. The action will result in no significant impacts to plant or animal species listed as threatened or endangered by either federal or state agencies. Potential impacts to cultural resources at NTC Great Lakes have been evaluated in compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA). Renovations will be undertaken for four buildings (Building 4, 177, 178, and 179) in the National Historic District at NTC Great Lakes. However, only building 4 is a contributing property of major significance within the historic district. All modifications to this building will be approved by the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency (IHPA) during the early phases of project design. The IHPA has determined that no significant historic, architectural, or archeological resources are located in the Glenview Annex project area.
