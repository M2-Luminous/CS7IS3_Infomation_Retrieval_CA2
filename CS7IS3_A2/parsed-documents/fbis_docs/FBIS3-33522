President and candidate Luis Inacio Lula da Silva yesterday appealed for an understanding: "We can only promise what we can implement," Lula said. Besides taking the debate on the program to the PT grassroots, Lula wants to extend the discussion to include forces from outside the party. The purpose is to get rid of the ideological character of the discussion and be able to elaborate a program on goals. In the next few months he intends to intervene more often in the debate on the platform, even if it is only to avoid what he calls "political exploration of the project with a text that is not definitive." Lula spent the day yesterday meeting with some of the people who cooperated in formulating the program such as sociologists Francisco Weffort and Maria Victoria Benevides, economist Jorge Matoso, Vice President Rui Falcao, and Secretary General Gilberto Carvalho. He wanted to know the status of the program and which are the points of disagreement. According to Lula, "we are not interested in avoiding controversial items." Moratorium -- The dissemination of the first draft of the program where the PT defends a moratorium on the foreign debt did not please Lula. He has been defending a political renegotiation of the debt in more than 60 meetings with entrepreneurs. "The foreign debt must be transformed into a political issue and discussed by governments face to face, not between ministers and IMF experts," Lula said. According to him, the draft should not talk about default. "We do not know how the country will be in 1995. This is why there is no reason to speak about moratorium." Despite the incisive defense of a renegotiation, the issue of a moratorium is one of the points on which there is no agreement. Two proposals should be included in the first official draft of the program: The suspension of payments to give way to an audit and a renegotiation with creditors guaranteeing the payment of the commercial debt; and a renegotiation of the debt without excluding the possibility of not paying what is not considered legitimate debt. Armed Forces -- The treatment that the Armed Forces will receive, if the PT wins the election, is also controversial. The draft will include two proposals. The first proposal will defend the Armed Forces modernization; the second proposal -- supported by pacifists -- proposes changes in the concept of the Armed Forces organization and opposes investments to modernize it because they are of the opinion that the natural trend points to its disappearance. The only point of agreement is the creation of a Defense Ministry. Lula supports better treatment for the Armed Forces but he also thinks that the matter is not a central issue and should be discussed after talking with military commanders. Another matter that is still a subject of controversy is whether the party platform will stipulate limits to the agrarian reform program. Another subject of discussions is the stability of public servants. PT Secretary General Gilberto Carvalho yesterday denied that there is disagreement on the issue of privatizations revision. He said the program proposes an audit to identify corrupt officials and to see if there were under-evaluations of privatized public companies. "We will try to find ways to punish corrupt officials and compensate the state for damages," Carvalho said. The PT is opposed to the privatization of strategic companies, such as those in the areas of energy, oil, and telecommunications. During today's meeting between the party National Executive Board and members of the party bloc in Congress at the Comodoro Hotel, Lula and party leaders will also define the participation of the federal congressional bloc in the constitutional revision process. There is a widely supported proposal to liberate PT legislators to participate in the revision of the most important issues.
