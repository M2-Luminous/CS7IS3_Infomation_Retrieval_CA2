The Department of Energy has determined that a noncompetitive award is in the public interest. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Department of Energy has determined in accordance with 10 CFR ยง600.7(b)(2)(i)(H) that a noncompetitive award based on the application submitted by the Clean Air Cab Company is in the public interest. This program will be used to stimulate and support the use of alternative fueled vehicles. The proposed grant will provide funding in the estimated amount of $90,000 for the first budget period or $270,000 over a three year period. Data obtained from the grantee will be useful to the Government, industry and the public in determining the adequacy of systems used on these alternative fuel vehicles. The Department of Energy has determined it to be in the public interest to award a noncompetitive grant to the Clean Air Cab Company because the proposed project has been initiated by the applicant using his own resources. The Grantee's vehicles are all equipped with state-of-the-art cellular monitoring equipment, which makes electronic tracking of mileage, maintenance, and refueling information reliable and instantaneous. The proposed project is authorized under the Alternative Motor Fuels Act of 1988, and it will allow the Department to evaluate other types of alternative fuel vehicles in the future as they become available.
