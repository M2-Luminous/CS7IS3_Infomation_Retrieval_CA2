Portuguese President Mario Soares yesterday telephoned President Itamar Franco to inform him that the presidents of Cape Verde and Angola would also not attend the meeting, and would send representatives instead. In view of this Mario Soares decided to cancel the meeting and postpone it to another date. The chief of the Brazilian delegation would have been former President Jose Sarney, and four ministers were to travel with him. Brazilian Ambassador to Portugal Jose Aparecido de Oliveira did not like this cancellation, as he was one of the greatest enthusiasts of the meeting and of the principal point on its agenda: the unification of the Portuguese language. Up until the very last moment Jose Aparecido tried to make President Itamar Franco change his mind and attend the meeting. When he did not convince him, Jose Aparecido became furious.
