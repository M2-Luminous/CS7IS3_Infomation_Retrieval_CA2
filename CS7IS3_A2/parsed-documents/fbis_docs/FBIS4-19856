A first attempt has been made by the Konrad Adenauer Foundation. In December 1993, the foundation published its results in the form of a study. Although the DVU was included to provide a comprehensive picture, the study focused on the Republikaner and their activities in assemblies at the district, land, and European levels. Whereas the DVU clearly falls into the right-wing extremist category, cannot be taken seriously, and is incompetent, the Republikaner merit more serious attention. Analysis The Republikaner are a populist, radical right-wing party with no clear dividing line separating them from right-wing extremism, especially in those areas in which a hostility toward foreigners, racism, and gut nationalism come to the fore in party agitation and propaganda. The main question of the research was to establish the Republikaner's political ability, their "manner of conducting disputes," and substantive and personnel competence in parliament. It was self-evident that consideration would be given to the three land parliaments to which radical right-wing and right-wing extremist parties had been elected -- Bremen, Schleswig-Holstein (DVU), and Baden-Wuerttemberg -- as well as the European Parliament (Republikaner). In selecting towns and districts, the following criteria were considered: the Republikaner share of the vote, achieving a regional balance, and a comparison of town and country. On the basis of these considerations, the following areas were chosen: the city of Hannover, the district of Hannover, Duesseldorf, Cologne, the district of Rheingau-Taunus, Heidenheim, Pforzheim, Augsburg, and Rosenheim. In only a few isolated cases were other examples -- mostly similar and parallel cases -- considered. In those towns and districts, numerous conversations were conducted with representatives of parties and journalists, extensive material connected with parliamentary work was examined and collected, and the local press was assessed. The survey of the Republikaner in district and municipal assemblies revealed the party's weaknesses at that level. Internal party organizational structures -- although they may differ from region to region -- have been barely developed. In quite a number of districts, they were to unable to take up the seats they had obtained, because of a severe lack of candidates. The elected representatives, some of whom have a right-wing extremist past, mainly lack political experience or competence in local politics. The focus of their work -- with some exceptions -- is not on dealing intensively with difficult local issues, but on constantly propagating the general populist slogans, prejudices, and affectations that make up Republikaner ideology. Issues Concerning Foreigners The Republikaner are not a local level party from the point of view of the way in which they were formed and their key national, programmatic policies. Until now, they have not possessed fixed local policy concepts, but have only propagated stances on individual issues in their strongholds. However, those often fail to be linked to programmatic ideas at the federal level. The greatest exception is the only element that holds the Republikaner together: the question of foreigners and asylum. It is a cause and catalyst that runs like a thread through all policy levels -- from local policy to European policy -- in the desperate effort to link it to all political problems. So far, the party has not developed a stance of its own at the local level and the accompanying ability to deal with and solve matters in any particular policy area or field or even with regard to individual problems. In most of the towns and districts that were examined, the work of Republikaner groups clearly concentrated on policy on foreigners and asylum, whereas the classic topics of local politics were secondary as a result of a lack of competence. Propaganda Thus, at all levels of representation, most Republikaner groupings have remained a "single issue party." That also applies to the Baden-Wuerttemberg Landtag, in which the Republikaner have held 15 seats since April 1992. In many assembles, they operate according to the same simple pattern: Almost all issues on which they have expressed a view are in some way -- indirectly or often polemically -- connected with the question of foreigners and asylum. Their patent solution for all problems, extending from economic and social policy to policy on the environment, policy on political and economic systems, is to seal off Germany from foreigners. In the case of the Republikaner, all policy ends up in the blind alley of nationalist isolation. This concentration on policy on foreigners and asylum is particularly evident in agitation and propaganda at the "grass-roots level," that is, in direct appeals to the population. The Republikaner agitation and propaganda work is inseparably linked to their work in parliament. To a large extent, those who work as party agitators are the same people who are represented in parliament. Frequently, particularly polemical group motions or questions are circulated as pamphlets for propaganda in the streets. These examples show that the Republikaner, despite their repeated efforts to achieve recognition from the "established" parties and democratic respectability, do not shrink from the defamation of their political opponents and minority groups and the oblique spreading of fear and aggression. That is why at the local level, they already rule themselves out for any form of cooperation. There have repeatedly been disputes among Republikaner and DVU groupings at various levels of representation. Internal quarrels, disputes, and disagreements often determine the image of radical right-wing and right-wing extremist parties. According to a study conducted by the Southwest Radio, of the 136 Republikaner groups in assemblies, 63 have either completely or partially fallen apart, and of the 402 office holders at the district level, only 289 remain. These findings were completely confirmed by what the Konrad Adenauer Foundation found in numerous towns and districts (for example, Duesseldorf, Cologne, Pforzheim, and Augsburg), at the land level (Bremen and Schleswig-Holstein), and especially in the European Parliament. There, Franz Schoenhuber is the only remaining Republikaner (of the original six), but as a deputy without a group. Like his former colleagues in the "Technical Group of the European Right," Schoenhuber frequently shines in concrete parliamentary work, especially commission work, by virtue of his absence. No Dialogue The radical right-wing, right-wing extremist parties still lack a firm base in society. There is hardly any contact, let alone dialogue, between parties and voters. Parties and groups maintain few contacts with social groups and associations. Contacts with the administration, which are so important for local-level political work, are underdeveloped. The shortcomings do not help make up for the lack of experience and knowledge and insufficient competence on the part of elected representatives. The conclusion is that those who vote for parties such as the Republikaner or the DVU cannot count on personnel continuity and organizational stability in those parties and groups. The voter does not opt for a specific political program or even a minimum ability to solve problems. Right-wing extremist and radical right-wing parties are still unable to act effectively and pursue politics under conditions of parliamentary democracy.
