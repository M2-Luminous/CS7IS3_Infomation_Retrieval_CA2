Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent collapse of the NLG due to cracking of the hinge pins, accomplish the following: (a) Prior to the accumulation of 10,000 total landings or within 1,000 landings after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs later, perform a dye penetrant inspection to detect cracking in the hinge pins on the NLG in accordance with Avions de Transport Regional Service Bulletin ATR42&hyph;32&hyph;0064, dated January 17, 1994. (1) If no cracking is found, prior to further flight, reinstall that hinge pin in accordance with the service bulletin. (2) If cracking is found, prior to further flight, install a new hinge pin or a pin that has been previously inspected and found to be crack-free, in accordance with the service bulletin. (b) As of the effective date of this AD, no hinge pin manufactured by Nardi having part number D56867 and any serial number beginning with the letter ``N,'' shall be installed on the NLG of any airplane, unless that pin has been previously inspected and has been found to be crack-free, in accordance with Avions de Transport Regional Service Bulletin ATR42&hyph;32&hyph;0064, dated January 17, 1994. (c) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113.
