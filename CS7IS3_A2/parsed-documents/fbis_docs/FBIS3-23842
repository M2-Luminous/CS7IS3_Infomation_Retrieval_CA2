Everything is full of politics as it is. At the same time, there has been almost no illumination of the country's economic state. People know very little about what is going on at a neighboring enterprise, not to mention in another city or oblast. But everyone perceives perfectly well the negative consequences of the reforms if they affect him personally. That is, the majority of us does not know the overall situation in the country and the tendencies of its further development. We are suffering in isolation. It is high time to think together, how to live on. But, first, a small analysis of what has occurred with the reformation of the economy over the last 3 years. And not with the reforms in general, but rather, with their main component, which has been called upon to ensure the life of commodity production. Being noticeably carried out are just two standard procedures for introducing a market economy -- privatization and financial and tax transactions. But how are they proceeding? If you take the privatization process, only one of its stages is being implemented at an intensified pace -- the political stage. A change in the property owner is occurring. The second stage, however, the stage of economic privatization, has not yet begun and, in my opinion, is not being planned. The discussions about the fact that the secondary issuing of shares, the funds from which will be directed toward the development of production and will help the market transformations, are groundless. The main question is -- who will buy the enterprises' shares? Who will acquire them? And it is answered with the help of a concentrated advertising campaign based on one scenario -- to take available money from people and put it not into commodity production, but rather, into the so-called "buy-sell" transactions. That is, at the present time, the purchasing of the enterprises' shares for the purpose of stabilizing production has, for all practical purposes, been excluded. And if someone talks about this, then this is the same kind of deception as the one that, for a voucher invested in an investment fund, it is possible to receive some inconceivable interest rates. A source for the development of commodity production through a change in the owner is thus excluded. Privatization is not fulfilling its basic function. The credit, financial and tax policies being pursued by the government exclude both the second and third basic sources of financing and development of the economy -- credits and profits. The so-called financial stabilization begun in June of last year has led to the most negative consequences for the commodity producers. First, the enterprises' working capital was not indexed and all the promises in this regard on the part of several government components just remained empty phrases. And, for the plants and factories, the working capital is the same thing as wages for people. And, since the prices for raw materials and energy resources rose by a factor of 1,000 and more, while the working capital remained frozen at the level of January, 1992, it is clear that a production crisis was inevitable. This is precisely the main reason for the non-payments in all spheres of commodity production. There is no sense at all in talking about profit as a source of life support for the commodity producers. The state has set up such taxes that, for all practical purposes, the enterprises' entire revenues are being taken away. Yet, indeed, it is well known that, in any confiscatorial system, there is an optimum limit which, when crossed, does not lead to an increase in payments into the treasury, but, rather, confronts the entrepreneurs with two questions: to swindle or to cease activities. Which is what is happening in our country: small structures are concealing profits from taxes and the large ones, for whom this is more complicated, are shutting down. Yes, there are commercial organizations which are making money even under these conditions. But this capital has also been cut away from commodity production. It is not profitable under present conditions for a single commercial bank to invest funds in production, since they will not produce quick and significant revenues. Hence follows the conclusion that a split has occurred between financial and industrial capital, which is increasing with every passing day. Money has become expensive and inaccessible for commodity producers and there is constant competition for it, but the outcome has been automatically predetermined to the disadvantage of the commodity producers. The conclusion is unambiguous: the transformations carried out in the country have led to the opposite result, a landslide drop in commodity production, and have threatened the very existence of the nation and the state. An especially difficult situation has taken shape in the production lines which determine the technical level of the produced goods. In electronics, instrument making and the machine-tool industry, the slump is around 50 percent, it is more than 45 percent in the chemical industry, it is also 50 percent in light industry and more than 40 percent in the production of meat and milk protein. It is necessary to add to this the fact that, everywhere, the number of employed people is declining, giving rise to more and more new waves of unemployment. It is not necessary to be a big economist in order to arrive at the conclusion: what is occurring are the de-industrialization of the national economic structure and its conversion into a raw materials base for other countries. Yaroslavl Oblast has always been notable for the stability of its situation and the carefully weighed nature of its decisions, but even it has not become an exception. The rate of the slump in production for some sectors in our oblast is even higher than that of our neighbors. The instances of enterprises being shut down have become more frequent. Not working a full week has become a common occurrence. As per a report of 1 February, 65 percent of the oblast's enterprises were either shut down or working according to a shortened schedule. Hidden unemployment exceeded 16.5 percent of the labor force. Light industry is almost at a standstill. The conversion enterprises are in a most difficult situation. Destruction of the agrarian sector is occurring. The financial situation of the majority of plants and factories is critical. What kinds of measures need to be adopted? I will tell you right out: we have divided them into three levels. The first is one which depends on the enterprises and labor collectives themselves. What has been concealed is the fact that not everyone clearly understands the special features of working under market conditions, including people in our management team. The second level of requirements is the level of the region. If a large portion of the taxes remains at the disposal of the local organs of power, then, naturally, it is also necessary to decide the matters of their efficient use here, locally, taking into consideration the interests of all sections of the people. The logic is simple: if the enterprises do not survive, then there will be nothing to support the budget-controlled workers. However, the third item is quite obvious: the first two directions will produce positive results only when the necessary foundation for the reforms is provided at the federal level. The president and the government should such rules of the game as would be advantageous for the commodity producer and motivate him to work efficiently.
