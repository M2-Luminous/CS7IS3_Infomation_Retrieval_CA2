FR940425-2-00004 FR940425-2-00003 International Trade Administration [A&hyph;570&hyph;830] Postponement of Preliminary Antidumping Duty Determination; Coumarin From the People's Republic of China AGENCY: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Commerce. EFFECTIVE DATE: April 25, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: David J. Goldberger or Michelle A. Frederick, Office of Antidumping Investigations, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230; telephone: 202&hyph;482&hyph;4136 or 202&hyph;482&hyph;0186, respectively. POSTPONEMENT OF PRELIMINARY DETERMINATION: On January 27, 1994, the Department initiated an antidumping duty investigation of coumarin from the PRC (59 FR 3841, January 27, 1994). The preliminary determination was scheduled for June 8, 1994. Due to the large number and difficulty identifying the companies involved in this investigation as well as the complex issues raised by the PRC's non-market economy status, additional time is required to make the preliminary determination. For these reasons coupled with the fact that most parties are cooperating, in accordance with section 733(c)(1)(B)(i)(II) and (III) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, we determine that this investigation is extraordinarily complicated and that additional time is needed. Therefore, in accordance with section 733(c)(1)(B)(ii) of the Act, we are postponing the preliminary determination until no later than July 28, 1994. This notice is published pursuant to section 733(c)(2) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.15 (b)(3) and (d). Dated: April 13, 1994. Susan G. Esserman, Assistant Secretary for Import Administration.
