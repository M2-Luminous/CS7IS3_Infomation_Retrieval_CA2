"Boris Yeltsin's stay in office for one more term would only benefit Russia," he told journalists in Moscow. Shumeyko believes that Yeltsin "has no right" to rely on any particular political forces, because none of them reflects the interests of broad sections of the population. The political parties are mostly concentrated in the State Duma, he went on to say. "Their work shows that polarity in decision- making still persists: democrats are blocking the communists and vice versa," stated Shumeyko. He noted, that centrist tendencies were increasing. Among the centrist parties are the Party of Russian Unity and Concord, Women of Russia, the Communist and agrarian parties, and the New Regional Policy faction, said Shumeyko. However, the center favors conservative ideas rather than reforms, he went on to say. He told Interfax that Russia should not hasten to join NATO's Partnership for Peace program. The main condition for doing so is joint work, equality and a clear-cut mechanism of implementing decisions, said Shumeyko. "The air strikes on the Serb positions by the US military command suggest that there is no such mechanism even in the UN Security Council," stated Shumeyko.
