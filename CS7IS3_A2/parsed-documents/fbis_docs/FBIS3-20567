This has had a very positive effect in stimulating social production, bringing prosperity to urban and rural markets, making things more convenient for the people, adjusting the production structure, increasing employment of labor, and in increasing revenue for public finance. The individual and private economy has thereby become an important force within the national economy of the whole province. In order to further implement the spirit of the 14th CPC National Congress and of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important statements on his southern inspection tour, also to more rapidly and more effectively develop the individual and private economy in our province, and to thereby promote the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of Hubei's national economy, the following has been decided upon: 1. Further Emancipation of Minds, Greater Unanimity of Concepts 1) The individual and private economy is an organic part of China's socialist market economy; it is a new growth sector in the developing social productive forces. Personnel engaged in the individual and private economy are workers in the construction of socialism. Rapid development of the individual and private economy is one of the major moves toward the establishment of the system of socialist market economy, and toward raising the national economy of the entire province to a new height of accomplishment. 2) The following ideology is to guide the development of Hubei's individual and private economy in Hubei: It must be guided by the spirit of the 14th CPC National Congress, the fundamental political line of the party must be upheld, as must be "the three advantageous" criteria, the principle of the priority of the public ownership system with its long-term coexistence with elements of multiple other economic forms, and also the principle of competition on equal terms and the principle of common development. Our central concerns must be the establishment of the socialist market economy, improvement of the external environment, accelerated regional legislation, standardization of business procedures, and accelerating the development of the individual and private economy throughout the entire province. 3) In all places, in all sectors, and especially among leading cadres at all levels, there has to be a further emancipation of minds, outdated concepts shall be revised, and the important position and function of the individual and private economy shall gain full recognition. While we shall continue to strengthen the public ownership system, extraordinary measures shall at the same time be adopted to arouse enthusiasm in all quarters to achieve a breakthrough development in the further promotion of the individual and private economy. 2. Expending Great Efforts To Achieve the Objective of Developing the Individual and Private Economy 4) For the period from 1993 to 1995, the overall developmental targets of Hubei's individual and private economy are: Each year one large step forward and throughout the three years one great development. On the foundation already laid in 1992, we shall, up to the year 1995, double the number of individually operated industrial and commercial businesses, the total number of privately run enterprises, the number of persons engaged in the said establishments, and achieve twice as much output value and twice as much business volume, namely get to 1.2 million enterprises, 2 million persons, and 30 billion yuan, respectively. At the same time, great efforts shall be made to improve the trade structure of the individual and private economy, and to accelerate the productive, scientific, and export-oriented development of privately run enterprises. 3. Simplifying Registration Procedure, Broadening the Scope of Business Operations 5) All secondary and tertiary industries primarily financed by one or more individuals (excluding nonprofit enterprises) shall be considered falling within the scope of enterprises that have to be registered and administered as individually operated industrial and commercial businesses or as privately run enterprises. With the exception of party and government personnel, staff and workers employed in industrial and commercial enterprises, presently serving military personnel, and students at schools--anyone capable of running a business may--on the evidence of his/her proof of identity and other relevant documents, apply to the local administrative organ in charge of industrial and commercial affairs for registration. New entrepreneurs in remote border areas and in impoverished mountain districts may be allowed to start business first and to attend to the prescribed registration later. 6) Individually operated industrial and commercial businesses and privately run enterprises may apply to be allowed to prefix their own name with the name of their county or higher ranking administrative district, and their registration and administration may be carried out at the different administrative levels. Privately run enterprises of certain scale, whether of single proprietorship or whether partnerships, may add "gong si" [company] to their names. 7) Individually operated industrial and commercial businesses and privately run enterprises shall be encouraged to set up productive, scientific, and export-oriented enterprises. Registration requirements, as to number of people employed and amount of registered capital, may be lowered for scientific and export-oriented privately run enterprises during their initial stage of operations. Relevant departments shall be supportive of tertiary industries in the areas of education, cultural affairs, public health, tourism, and consultative services. 8) Individually operated industrial and commercial businesses and privately run enterprises may trade in all lines of business and all kinds of products which it is permissible to trade in, according to state and provincial government provisions. As to products which it is not permitted to trade in, a one-time trade may be transacted with the prior approval of a people's government of county or higher rank or with the approval of an organ authorized by the governments, provided it will not adversely affect the overall situation. 9) Business may be conducted in any form or pattern. Where appropriate prerequisites exist, privately run enterprises may operate, with the approval of the authority in charge of their registration, as group corporations, and may also, with the approval of the relevant authority, set up enterprises on the shareholding system. 10) Individually operated industrial and commercial businesses and privately run enterprises may take over management under contract, lease, or purchase state-owned and collective-owned enterprises or institute joint business operations with them. If public property is placed under private business management, the relevant authority shall effect an appraisal of assets, ensure that value of government-owned or collective-owned assets is maintained or increased, that ownership status of the assets is not changed, and that there is no change in the character of the operations carried out by the individual or private enterprises. 11) Individually operated industrial and commercial businesses and privately run enterprises shall be encouraged to undertake Sino-foreign joint ventures and cooperative enterprises with foreign business firms, also to extend their business operations to overseas. Where necessary prerequisites exist, privately run enterprises may take up foreign trade, either jointly with foreign trade units or through agencies, and may also, according to regulations, report their import-export trading right to higher authority for record. 4. Improving Business Environment 12) Governments at all levels shall incorporate the plant layout and the various market constructions of individually-operated industrial and commercial businesses and of privately run enterprises into the urban development plan of the locality in question. Market construction shall be accelerated by "raising capital in a multiplicity of ways, with a multiplicity of participants, but with unified management and commonly shares benefits," as well as according to the principle of "benefits to accrue to whoever has invested capital." Units and individuals are encouraged to start up various kinds of markets, and the objective that we shall all strive for energetically is to increase the total number of wholesale markets from 91 in 1992 to 150 by the latter part of the Eighth Five-Year Plan. At the head of this development shall be the large- and medium-sized cities and fairly large commodity collecting and distributing centers. They shall initiate two to three large-scale wholesale markets of substantial capacity and broad effective influence to outlying areas, and shall also initiate a series of medium and small-scale wholesale markets of local character, as also one to two wholesale markets that will rank among the ten large wholesale markets of the entire country. At the same time, great efforts shall be expended on the effective establishment of border trade markets. 13) The relevant authorities shall plan for and be most supportive in supplying land needed for production and business operations of privately run enterprises. If it shall become necessary for special reasons to dismantle or relocate business sites or plants, the government at the location in question shall reach an appropriate agreement beforehand with the original user of the land. 14) The authorities in charge in medium- and small-sized cities and county market towns shall, in accordance with the overall city development plan, energetically support the reconstruction of walls and residences along the streets turning them into retail shops. They shall designate certain sections as early-morning markets, as night markets, or in residential districts designate the two sides on nonarterial roads for stalls and crowds of vendors, and also appropriately arrange for business sites for individually operated industrial and commercial businesses and privately run enterprises. 15) New privately run enterprises that are experiencing difficulties during their initial period of operations in paying legally prescribed taxes, may be granted reductions or exemptions in their industrial and commercial income tax for their first year, unless the tax law explicitly prohibits reduction or exemption of a tax for certain products or in case of the "eight small" [ba xiao 0360 1420] enterprises. If further difficulties are experienced beyond the first years, they may be granted further tax reduction or exemption, depending on the circumstances and on obtaining approval, according to the proper procedure under the current system of the tax administration. 16) Individually operated businesses and privately run enterprises whose development, production, and marketing of a new product has been reported to the relevant authority and approved by it, may, if their standards are of "national ranking," be granted two to three years of tax reduction or exemption, and if of "provincial ranking," be given tax reduction and exemption for one to two years. If their difficulties persist after expiration of the said periods, they may be granted further tax reduction or exemption on obtaining approval, according to the proper procedure under the current system of the tax administration. 17) Enterprises set up by individually operated businesses and privately run enterprises with foreign firms as joint ventures or cooperative management enterprises shall enjoy the benefits of preferential taxation policies accorded by the state to foreign-invested enterprises. Scientific and export-oriented enterprises instituted by individually operated businesses and privately run enterprises shall enjoy the benefit of preferential taxation policies. 18) Tax offices shall collect taxes from individually operated businesses and privately run enterprises according to law. Arbitrary increases or reductions in taxes are not permissible. 19) All relevant state agencies and units shall show solicitude for and shall support individually operated businesses and privately run enterprises, and shall help dispel their anxieties and resolve their difficulties. 20) In the appraisal of products, in adjudging high quality and fitness for exhibition, in import-export formalities, in the conferring of titles to their personnel, and in checking for permission to travel abroad, individually operated industrial and commercial businesses and privately run enterprises shall be treated the same as state-owned or collective-owned enterprises; examinations shall be conducted and approval granted by the authorities in charge according to prescribed procedures. 5. Protection of Legitimate Rights 21) Any arbitrary imposition of fees, levies, and fines on individually operated businesses and privately run enterprises shall definitely be stopped. Apart from charges and fines prescribed by law and regulations and charges and fines authorized by the state and the provincial authorities in charge of such collections, arbitrarily decreed fees and fines, wherever and whosesoever, are all invalid. Legitimate charges and fines must not exceed appropriate limits and standards. The various charges and standards shall be properly adjusted and made public. If individually operated businesses and privately run enterprises are subjected to arbitrary charges, levies, and fines in violation of law, regulations, and administrative rules, they may be firmly rejected by the associations of individual workers and associations of private enterprises, and individually operated industrial and commercial businesses and privately run enterprises shall have the right to refuse payment. They may, furthermore, report such incidents directly to the local government or to the individual and private economy leading teams. 22) No unit or government agency whatsoever may, for reasons of initiating an economic entity, leasing out business sites, providing services, and taking up shares, change the economic character of individually operated businesses and privately run enterprises, nor may they arbitrarily transfer their assets. There must be no "incorporation into one's unit" and no "linking up for support" in these business operations. The authorities in charge shall reassess the economic character of state-owned and collective-owned enterprises who are such only in name but not in reality. 23) Business licenses serve to certify the legitimate business operations of individually operated businesses and privately run enterprises. No unit or individual other than those of the state agencies in charge of industry and commerce are legally authorized to retrieve or cancel these licenses. If economic losses are inflicted on individually operated businesses and privately run enterprises by action that exceeded the authority of an agency, the person in charge of that agency must bear responsibility to compensate for such losses. 24) The life and property of those engaged in individually operated businesses and privately run enterprises shall be absolutely protected. With due approval, security organizations may be set up at large- and medium-sized markets and integrated specialized markets. Criminal acts that infringe upon the legitimate rights and interests of individually operated businesses and privately run enterprises shall be punished according to law by the public security and judicial agencies. 6. Enhance Organizational Guidance 25) Party committees and governments at all levels shall enhance their guidance of the individual and private economy. In the same manner as this has been stressed in the case of state-owned and collective-owned enterprises, the same stress should be exercised in the case of the individual and private economy. There has to be effective coordination and proper handling of the major problems in the development and administration of the individual and private economy. 26) Party committees and governments at all levels shall express strong approbation of outstanding contributions made by individually operated businesses and privately run enterprises. Every unit of the news media shall actively propagate incidents of such exemplary cases, propagate the standing and functions of the individual and private economy, so as to create a beneficial public opinion and atmosphere, favorable to the accelerated development of the individual and private economy. 27) The departments concerned shall do an effective job in organizing participation of individually operated businesses and privately run enterprises, of their own initiative and volition, at such activities as studies and training, so as to raise their overall quality. They shall encourage them to freely pursue their business interests, continuously expand the scope of their business operations, striving to become "giants en miniature." They shall educate and guide those engaged in individually operated businesses and privately run enterprises to abide by and implement the laws, rules, and regulations of the state and all provisions of policy, and to arrive at a state of "observing discipline and obeying the law," and of "honorable conduct of all business operations." Where conditions would be suitable for it, privately run enterprises may establish party or youth league organizations and staff and workers unions. 28) Supervision and administrative control of the individual and private economy must continuously be strengthened. Illegal activities, such as evading taxes and resisting taxation, manufacturing and selling counterfeit and spurious goods, fraudulent purchasing and selling, and gaining dominant position in the market by fraudulent means, must be investigated and appropriately dealt with. Persons operating businesses without license must be urged to register, and those still refusing to register shall be ordered to cease operations. 29) According to the party's policy of "uniting, assisting, guiding, and educating," industrial and commercial associations of all ranks shall step up efforts toward strengthening contacts between representatives of the individual and private economy. Their education shall nurture "patriotism, respect for one's trade, and a law-abiding attitude," and their opinions and demands should be promptly made know, so that their legitimate rights and interests may be protected, and to have these associations function as effective intermediaries. They should also participate in the formulation of plans for the development of the individual and private economy, in the formulation of relevant policy, and in commending meritorious achievements. Associations of workers in individually operated businesses and associations of privately run enterprises of all ranks shall give full scope to self-education, self-administration, and mutual service among one's own members, so as to promote the healthy development of the individual and private economy. 30) The Industry and Commerce Bureau, together with relevant departments, shall formulate enforcement provisions for the present decision.
