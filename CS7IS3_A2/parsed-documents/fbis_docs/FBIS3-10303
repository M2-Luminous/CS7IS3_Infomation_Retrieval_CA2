The battalion will help enforce UN resolutions. The United Nations has had to take action in Croatia (Western Slovenia of the former Yugoslavia) [as published] after the country fell apart due to serious domestic conflicts prompted by political, religious, and racial motives. The mission of Argentine troops is to monitor the cease-fire, set up observation posts, patrol specific areas, help the civilian population, oversee exchanges of prisoners, supervise the refugees, and clear minefields. Each operational contingent will stay in Croatia for six months. Of all UN "blue helmets" operations throughout the world, the one in Croatia involves the largest number of troops.
