If NATO wants to survive it must prove that it is Manfred Woerner, not Boris Yeltsin, who holds the NATO council, the Baltic News Service quotes the Estonian president. In Lennart Meri's opinion the Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas acted very correctly in making an official request for Lithuania to be admitted to NATO. According to the Estonian president, there is a vacuum of security in the Baltic states at present, and certain forces in Russia may be tempted to fill it.
