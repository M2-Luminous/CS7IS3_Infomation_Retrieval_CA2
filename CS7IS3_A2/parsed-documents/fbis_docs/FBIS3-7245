This council will be composed of concerned divisions, such as national defense and foreign affairs. At its first meeting scheduled to be held on 30 March, officials from various ministries and agencies--including the Foreign Ministry, the Defense Agency, and the Finance Ministry--will report on the current situation and other matters. The LDP also intends to work out measures for Japan to take in case the UN Security Council decides to initiate economic sanctions against North Korea, and to propose these measures to the government. Discussions will be mainly held on such issues as: 1) whether it is proper to prohibit North Koreans residing in Japan from sending money to North Korea, and 2) what the government should do if U.S. forces stationed in Japan ask for the Self Defense Force's [SDF] assistance in the transportation and supply of fuel. Regarding sanctions against North Korea, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa said: "If sanctions should be applied, Japan will cooperate with the United Nations as much as possible within the boundary of its constitution." However, according to a senior official of the LDP national defense division, there is a skeptical view within the LDP that "it is questionable whether the coalition government can provide enough cooperation because it contains the Social Democratic Party of Japan which considers the SDF unconstitutional."
