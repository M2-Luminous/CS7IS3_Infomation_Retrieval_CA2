Each is intended to have an annual output value of at least 500 million yuan (about 57.5 million U.S. dollars). Sources from the municipal government indicate that the construction of the new project, whose annual output value is eventually to total ten billion yuan, has already been started. The move aims to step up the pace of building the city's high-tech industrial zones and to boost the new and high-tech product growth at a rate of 14.3 percent annually. According to the project designers, in the initial stage of the project, priority will be given to development of major products such as batteries, educational game machines, special materials and new pesticides. With these, the city will add about one billion to its total industrial output value yearly.
