It is clearly a reversal of Japan's previous stance towards the idea and this is certainly welcome news for the six- member ASEAN. Japan's change of mind apparently comes as a result of the establishment of the North American Free Trade Agreement or NAFTA which came into effect last weekend. Previously Japan had been non-committal towards the caucus idea for fear of hurting its largest trading partner, the United States. The U.S., under George Bush, had been vehemently opposed to the establishment of the EAEC because it knew that it would left out of the EAEC. However, the present U.S. Administration under President Bill Clinton had been more receptive to the EAEC concept. So, Japan naturally has come to terms with the caucus as a means of achieving a diplomatic balance in the Pacific Rim region in the way from the expansion of economic ties between the U.S., Canada and Mexico. The historic summit of the heads of state of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation in Seattle last November clearly showed that the U.S. was pushing for leadership of the 17-member body. Now, we have the European Economic Union or EEU and NAFTA looming large to become exclusive trading blocs. How then will East Asia fend for itself? The EAEC seems to be the right answer. The idea of the caucus, mooted by Malaysian Prime Minister Dr Mahathir Mohamed three years ago, came about after the Uruguay Round of GATT talks had failed to produce the result as was scheduled in 1990. Japan had previously thought that the EAEC idea would jeorpadize the global trade talks. Now that the Uruguay Round has been successfully completed, Japan is in a position to reverse to its previous stance towards the EAEC. The EAEC, as have been repeatedly pointed out by ASEAN leaders, is certainly not aimed at being an exclusive trading bloc. It is aimed at being a loose consultative forum where member countries can discuss economic issues of common concern and cooperate with each other for their mutual benefit. ASEAN countries have already commited themselves to an (?indifferent) free global trading system. Any of its member countries is free into bilateral trade with any other country of its choice. Malaysia and ASEAN welcome the Tokyo report that Japan has declared its support for the EAEC concept. The caucus will become even more meaningful and fruitful if more East Asian countries like China, South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong declare their support and join the EAEC to make the region the most dynamic in the world.
