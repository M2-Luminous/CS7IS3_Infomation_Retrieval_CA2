Thus, led by Bruno Trentin and backed by its powerful apparatus and the weight of its 5 million members, the CGIL [Italian General Confederation of Labor] is deploying in mass against the "new right" and its "destabilizing and subversive" plans. A further sign of the difference between the upcoming elections and previous ones is the unprecedentedly clear-cut way in which the largest of the three trade union confederations has taken sides. Has the sacred rule of trade union autonomy been dispensed with? Not at all, answered the trade union leaders at Corso Italia [CGIL headquarters], because, contrary to other trade unions, "we are not fighting for this or that party or coalition," but rather "against" the bloc "made up by the League, Forza Italia, and the former fascists." This is a "duty," Trentin explained in the course of a press conference, because this new right "is endangering the individual and collective rights which our democracy -- despite all its limitations and distortions -- has guaranteed over the past 40 years." What is at stake is a heritage of democratic conquests which "must be defended, enriched if anything, but never called into question." The CGIL's dislike for the coalition "that wants to organize a right which is much more radical even than Thatcher or Reagan" is so intense that a hardened Bruno Trentin has sent a copy of the CGIL's electoral platform to all parties except to the opposing group, just as in the past the trade union excluded the parties that were outside the so-called constitutional spectrum from the list of its interlocutors. Illustrated by CGIL Secretary Angelo Airoldi, the CGIL's document -- which is closer to a political appeal addressed to its own activists than to a traditional list of priority social and economic issues to be raised in the new parliament -- sets out the "distinguishing criteria, regarding values and alignments" which the trade union considers to be essential. To begin with, antifascism, understood also as "uncompromising opposition to those forms of authoritarianism, racism, and contempt and aggression targeting those who are weaker"; in the second place, "the defense of national unity, as a concrete and necessary area" for effectively exercising solidarity. "The CGIL urges its own members and workers in general to follow these two criteria in the electoral campaign and when casting their vote." In referring to the referendums promoted by [Radical leader] Marco Pannella, Silvio Berlusconi, and Umberto Bossi, the CGIL's secretary general did not hesitate to define the right's aims as "destructive" (albeit confused). Such aims range from the request to abolish at-source taxation on employees' income ("which would have devastating consequences in terms of being certain of revenue levels from taxation"), to the abolition of unemployment benefits ("a revenge against the weaker"), to denying workers the right to chose their own trade union through delegates. A constant comparison was drawn between the new conservative bloc and the practice of "social egoism, based on the denial of solidarity" which is today expressed through "a wave of neofascist group violence, directed at immigrants in particular." Trentin referred to the recent attack in Ostia, and called for stricter penal and civil provisions to punish this kind of offense, including sexual offenses. In this same vein, the CGIL is asking for immigrants to be given voting rights in the local elections. Many of the social and economic priorities listed in the CGIL's platform are also shared by the CISL [Italian Confederation of Trade Unions] and the UIL [Italian Federation of Trade Unions]. The CGIL leader was keen to emphasize these points in common, denying that the CGIL's initiative was to be regarded as running counter to unity. Regarding the controversial question of taxing treasury bills, the Confederation is not siding either with [Democratic Party of the Left (PDS) Secretary] Occhetto or Berlusconi, but aims to adopt an autonomous position, as it has in the past. It is in favor of making newly issued bills nominal -- "the Confindustria [General Confederation of Italian Industry] also agrees" -- and gradually bringing all forms of income under the taxation system. It is also in favor of reforming income tax on financial operations and on the interest from treasury bills, by abolishing the current proportional contributions and making them progressive under the IRPEF [personal income tax] system. In order not to penalize small savers, a tax-free income and savings bracket should be introduced. As regards employment, Bruno Trentin's trade union confederation has not given up the idea of a "national solidarity loan" which, instead of generic treasury bills to cover the public debt, would offer bills with long-term, assured returns. These would benefit from tax relief and be used to constitute a development and job creation fund.
