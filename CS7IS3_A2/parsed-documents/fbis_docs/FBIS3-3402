(Yang Zhaopan), correspondent of this station, interviewed Deputy Shao Qihuai, governor of Heilongjiang Province, on this principle. [Yang] Governor Shao, the central authorities have proposed the principle of seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting development, and maintaining stability as the overall interests for the work of the entire party and state. Could you talk about your views on this issue? [Shao] The central authorities' 20-character principle concerning the overall interests not only tallies with the national situation, but also completely conforms to the (?overall) situation. The essence of the 20-character principle, namely opportunity, reform, opening up, development, and stability, is brought up in a definite and appropriate way. For example, seizing the opportunity. As opportunities do not last long, we must seize them. As far as Heilongjiang is concerned, a very important opportunity for the province these years has been the central authorities' (?policy) concerning opening up border areas. By opening up border areas, Heilongjiang has made significant development in economy and foreign trade over the past years. I have noticed that the central authorities are particularly concerned with the problems of agriculture and large- and medium-sized enterprises. Under the current situation, we should seize the opportune time at which the development of agriculture and invigoration of large- and medium- sized enterprises are proposed by the central authorities to boost the development of these two sectors in Heilongjiang. As for deepening reform, reform has been launched for a decade or so; how we should deepen reform is [words indistinct]. Talking about opening up wider, although Heilongjiang Province has been stepping up the pace of opening up border areas in the past few years, the key lies in opening up to all directions. After all, we cannot attach importance to opening up border areas only, and ignore countries in Southeast Asia and Latin America. Therefore, the central authorities [words indistinct] proposed this year that we open up border areas on the one hand, and open up to Southeast Asia and Latin America in an all-round way on the other. [Yang] Governor Shao, what is your view about correctly handling the relations among reform, development, and stability? [Shao] I believe the handling of relations among the three is not only to address problems in the past, more importantly it is to set a higher standard and demand social and economic development in the new situation. To properly handle the relations among reform, development, and stability, I believe we must face actual [words indistinct] and problems, think them over and reform them. There are indeed some problems among reform, development, and stability that have plagued us for a long time. The key to solving these problems lies in developing the tertiary industry step by step. For example, Heilongjiang Province has reaped bumper harvests in agriculture for several years in a row, and attained expected results every year. It should have [words indistinct]. On the contrary, however, peasants' incomes did not increase rapidly and Heilongjiang's revenue is getting worse. This means there is no healthy cycle among production, development, and stability. This problem has something to do with properly handling the relations among the above three things. Therefore, the proposal of correctly handling the relations among reform, development, and stability has (?addressed the actual problem). Why are the relations among the three not handled properly sometimes? The crux of the matter lies in the criteria for work, and whether reform and development can be assessed by the three criteria as proposed by Comrade Xiaoping? As far as reform is concerned, we cannot reform for the sake of reform and oversee the (?overall interests) for the partial needs. Therefore, I think the key to properly handling the relations among reform, development, and stability lies in tackling the actual problems and adopting a definite criterion.
