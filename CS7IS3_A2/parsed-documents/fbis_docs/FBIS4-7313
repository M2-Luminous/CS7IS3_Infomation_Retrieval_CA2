Tsutomu Tanaka, the EPA's vice minister, said the IMF did not sufficiently take into account the effects of Japan's economic stimulus package and signs of recovery seen lately in consumption. "It is difficult to understand why the IMF revised down its projection for Japanese economy from the previous outlook issued lastfall," Tanaka said. The IMF issued an outlook for world economy earlier this week, saying Japan's economy is expected to stay sluggish in 1994, with the annual growth rate remaining weak at 0.7 percent, revised down from a 2.0 percent growth forecast by itself last September. Asked about a drop in the nation's February household spending, Tanaka admitted that the recovery is not yet strong. "Because the recovery momentum is still weak, it is easily affected by such things as unfavorable weather," he said. On Thursday, the government announced the February household spending dropped by 0.5 percent from a year earlier, ending a four- month streak of rise on year. It attributed the drop partly to snowfalls that prevented consumers from shopping.
