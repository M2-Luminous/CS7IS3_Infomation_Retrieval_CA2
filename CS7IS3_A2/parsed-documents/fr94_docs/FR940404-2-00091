FR940404-2-00091 FR940404-2-00059 Statement of Commissioner Deborah K. Owen in the Matter of TCH Corporation I find reason to believe that the proposed acquisition of certain assets of Kmart Corporation by TCH Corporation and Green Equity Investors may violate section 5 of the FTC Act by substantially lessening competition with respect to acute care prescription drugs sold to cash customers in the Bishop and Mt. Shasta, California markets. 1 In the absence of further investigation, I cannot find reason to believe that the Act has been violated with respect to the remaining allegations in the Commission's complaint. 2 I therefore dissent with respect to those allegations, and with respect to any provisions in the order that are unnecessary to remedy the alleged anticompetitive effects in the product and geographic markets that I have supported. 1 I define acute care prescription drugs as those which are prescribed to fill an immediate need and are rarely refilled, such as antibiotics. Maintenance drugs, by contract, are those prescribed on an on-going basis and are regularly refilled, such as blood pressure medicine. The latter are more susceptible to competition from mail-order firms. I define cash customers to mean persons whose prescription purchases are not covered by managed care or other third-party payors. Such customers are less able to resist a price increase. 2 The rationale underlying my unwillingness to find reason to believe that the law has been violated where there has been insufficient investigation is detailed in my dissenting statement in the matter of QVC Network, Inc./Paramount Communications, Inc. (File No. 941&hyph;0008). [FR Doc. 94&hyph;7975 Filed 4&hyph;1&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6750&hyph;01&hyph;M
