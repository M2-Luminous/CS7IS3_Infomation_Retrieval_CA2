According to Mr. Traian Chebeleu, the statement by President Mircea Snegur shows in fact how strong is the pressure put on the Republic of Moldova by the nostalgic-imperial forces; another important factor is the electoral campaign, which is marked by the offensive of the pro-Russian forces that wish to achieve the closest possible bondage of the Republic of Moldova with the CIS, also through treaties. In his interview, Mr. Chebeleu also mentioned that the actions in our county that call on Romania to take firm steps to recuperate those territories that were severed in June 1940 and the unrealistic slogans regarding the unification of the Romanian territories have, in fact, assisted the forces that are seeking to pull the Republic of Moldova away from Romania. Thus, I believe that one should not dramatize the emphasis placed on the idea of the Moldovan nation or on non-unification with Romania, obviously due to the circumstance of the electoral campaign, because these are theories that remind us of well-known Bolshevik concepts, said Mr. Traian Chebeleu. He also mentioned that Romania is the strongest supporter of the Republic of Moldova in the international community and that the policy that our country has promoted and continues to promote is to consolidate the independence of the Republic of Moldova and to constantly take concrete actions to gradually bring the two states closer to each other. Asked whether the future opinion poll that will take place in the Republic of Moldova on the issue of its independence will not sanction the concept of complete separation from Romania, Mr. Traian Chebeleu said that this might also play a positive role if the independence of the Republic of Moldova is more and more frequently questioned by political forces in the Russian Federation, whose representative is the nationalist extremist Zhirinovskiy. One can also expect that the poll will confirm people's option to consolidate their independence in a way similar to that practiced in the Baltic republics.
