The first stage of the selection of the candidates for the members of the National Investment Funds has already been completed. These funds will manage a few hundred companies that have decided on privatization under the PPP. The selection is being carried out by a commission dominated by people appointed by Prime Minister Pawlak. The commission has defined the selection criteria and has not agreed to reveal them. As we have learned unofficially, an especially important factor is "long work at a managerial post." This criterion is met only by former heads of the socialist economy. "It is not important whether a guy has led a company to bankruptcy or not. What is crucial is the fact that he managed it," we were told by a cooperator of the Selection Commission. "This weakens the chances of young and well-educated people." "When the Law on Mass Privatization was being passed, there were rumors that the posts in supervisory boards would be occupied first of all by well-educated and young people," we learned from an economist linked to the commission. "However, the commission has worked out a code that favors people with strong connections with PRL companies. They simply score more points only because they managed the giant socialist companies." We did not like such discrimination: when the citizens were divided into "equal" (nonpartisan) and "more equal" (members of the Polish United Workers Party and the satellite parties). This is why we rejected decommunization ideas as contrary to the logic of a democratic state. Therefore, it is with utmost concern that we have heard about the attempt to recommunize the state by giving privileges to the people of the communist apparatus of power. This is inadmissible. This must have negative consequences not only for the Polish economy but also for those who conceived these ideas.
