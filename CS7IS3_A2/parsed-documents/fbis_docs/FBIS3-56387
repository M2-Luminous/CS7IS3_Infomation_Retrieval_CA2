In his interview with Interfax Mamedov expressed opinion that the tripartite Russian-American-Ukrainian agreement on nuclear weapons withdrawal from the Ukrainian territory is one of the major results of the U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to Moscow. "We have all grounds to be satisfied," he said. Mamedov specially stressed that Russian President Boris Yeltsin was initiator of the proposal to hold a tripartite meeting in Moscow. According to Mamedov, "the uranium contract" which has also become one of the major results of the Moscow summit would not have been signed if we had failed to agree with Kiev. When asked about the scale of compensation which Russia would pay to Ukraine for the nuclear weapons to be withdrawn from its territory, Mamedov answered that "on the whole this problem has been coordinated." "The agreement signed in Massandra (Crimea) fixes the volume of the compensation, cost, sums, etc. The Americans have repeatedly declared about their support to the Massandra agreements. One can view the Moscow agreement as their further development," he said. As Mamedov said, a compromise formula was agreed "primarily not at the tripartite Russian-American-Ukrainian talks in Washington but between the Ukrainian leadership and us." "The thing is that we are withdrawing nuclear weapons from Ukraine to Russia, dismantling it, extracting uranium, and selling fuel uranium to America. A part of these funds with the exception of expenditures attributed to transportation, storage, and re- processing of uranium Russia will hand over to Ukraine as compensation," he continued. Mamedov does not rule out possibility that at first Russia would give uranium to Ukraine as fuel for its atomic power stations. "We shall probably retain part of this fuel for ourselves. Nobody is going to rob us," he noted. Mamedov also reported that the Moscow summit had discussed "very interesting proposals regarding the fact how one can re- focus international package of assistance to Russia given our difficult economic situation." "The Americans understand quite well that Russians should feel that democracy gives something to them that it is not just a trap into which they have been pushed," her said. As an example Interfax interlocutor mentioned the following: "Russia delivers oil to its neighbors, former Soviet republics. We increase the prices to the world ones. But it can occur that our partners will not be able to procure oil in our country. Then we shall be deprived of markets. They can be occupied by rich oil producing countries which can offer more beneficial conditions. What has America done? - The Americans have persuaded the "G-7" and International Monetary Fund to grant subsidies to our neighbors so that they would continue to buy Russian oil. It's an absolutely new form of partnership."
