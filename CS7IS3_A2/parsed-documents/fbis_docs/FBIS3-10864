[Begin Aguilar recording] Today more than ever, and after hearing Camacho's Messianic words, I am more convinced that the PFCRN and its supporters must work hard to ensure a victory in the 21 August elections. With those illuminating statements he is asking the homeland to pay for services rendered and recognize him as a savior. He said this country will be democratized and that it will overcome its difficulties. We do not need transition governments. We need stable, constitutional governments that will govern for everyone. That is why I will repeat that Camacho showed his true colors today during the news conference. He showed himself to be a real fire-eater [traga fuego] who is plotting behind the curtains of the Presidential Palace. Beware. [end recording]
