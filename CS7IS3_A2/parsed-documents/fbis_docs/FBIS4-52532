It is the Geneva peace talks held in April 1954. The Geneva talks were held 40 years ago and have almost been forgotten. It is strange that even experts have no particular interest in the talks. It is necessary, however, to review the talks to correctly understand and properly cope with the peace treaty issue between North Korea and the United States. The Geneva peace talks were held as a step following the conclusion of the Korean Armistice Agreement signed in July 1953. The Armistice Agreement stipulates that representatives of countries concerned should hold political talks within three months after the effectuation of the agreement to discuss the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the Korean peninsula and a peaceful method to resolve the Korean issue and to conclude a proper treaty that will replace the Armistice Agreement. Since they discussed not only the Korean peninsula issue but also the peace issue on the Indo-Chinese peninsula at that time, the meeting was called the Geneva Far East Peace Talks. Present at discussions on the Korean issue in Geneva were North Korea, the former Soviet Union, China, and the 16 member-states of the United Nations, including Britain and France, that participated in the Korean war. In the beginning of the talks, Britain took the lead in discussions by presenting five principles for Korean reunification under the supervision of the United Nations. Corresponding to this, the ROK put forward 14 principles in a proposal that the UN troops be withdrawn from the Korean peninsula after the ROK has satisfactory results from free elections under UN supervision. The Soviet Union, however, presented a five-point resolution urging all foreign troops to be withdrawn first. North Korea put forward a six-point resolution demanding the establishment of an all-Korean committee after the withdrawal of all foreign troops. Because of such differences in opinion, the discussion on the Korean issue was ruptured about two months after it began. Eventually, they failed to reach agreements on the method of reunification and the method of concluding a peace treaty. This Geneva meeting shows the following three facts: First, the Geneva meeting has verified the stark fact that the ROK is a party concerned with the Korean war armistice system. Despite this fact, North Korea has used tactics to exclude the ROK from the Military Armistice Commission [MAC] under the pretext that the ROK is not a signatory of the Armistice Agreement. It has not attended MAC meetings since the UN chief delegate of the MAC was recently replaced by an ROK Army officer. Now, it is even trying to paralyze the function of the MAC by withdrawing its delegates from the MAC. North Korea's insistence that a certain country is a signatory of the Armistice Agreement and another is not is nothing but North Korea's propaganda because those who signed the Armistice Agreement were not countries, but were instead UN troops, North Korean troops, and the commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers. (There are many Koreans who believe North Korea's false insistence is correct.) Second, the peace treaty issue should be discussed by all countries concerned with the war, as was so in Geneva. North Korea, however, has insisted on concluding a peace treaty only with the United States. It took no regard of the ROK. The South-North agreement was concluded in December 1991, but North Korea has not observed it. Article 5 of the South-North agreement stipulates that South and North Korea should make joint efforts to replace the present cease-fire with a "peace state" and should abide by the Armistice Agreement until it is replaced with a peace treaty. Third, although we can help facilitate the holding of North Korea-U.S. talks and further the establishment of North Korea-U.S. diplomatic ties to induce the opening of North Korea, it is wrong for us to agree that North Korea and the United States hold talks over the nuclear issue and discuss the peace treaty issue. North Korea's insistence on discussing the nuclear issue only with the United States is originally absurd. It seems that North Korea will certainly propose the conclusion of a peace treaty when the third round of North Korea-U.S. talks are held. The U.S. Departments of Defense and State have different positions on this. U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry said that it is impossible to conclude a peace treaty, but Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci said everything can be discussed in the third round of talks with North Korea. We cannot figure out what on earth the U.S. position is. The ROK position on this is that the peace treaty issue should be discussed with the ROK first since it is a party concerned, however, the nuclear issue should be resolved first at the present stage. As shown by the Geneva talks, a peace treaty is, in nature, a treaty that parties concerned with a war sign to put an end to the war and restore peace. It is different from an ordinary agreement between countries on friendship and cooperation because it is a treaty for post-war arrangements. Accordingly, the precedent of the Geneva peace talks should be respected in handling the peace treaty issue for post-Korean War arrangements. By the way, these days a peace treaty is not always required for normalizing diplomatic relations between countries concerned with a war. For example, Japan and the former Soviet Union restored their diplomatic relations simply by issuing a joint declaration on it, but have not yet concluded a peace treaty. The United States and China signed a peace treaty four years after the establishment of diplomatic ties, and Japan and China did the same. Accordingly, the conclusion of a peace treaty is not necessary for establishing diplomatic relations between North Korea and the United States. North Korea's hidden purpose is to raise the issue of withdrawing U.S. forces in Korea. The government must invariably push ahead with the policy that the peace treaty issue should be resolved by South and North Korea in accordance with the South-North agreement, not by North Korea and the United States, and must try to convince the United States to agree to the policy. At the same time, the government should make efforts to let the people know the nature of the peace treaty issue. Some naive young people stand inwardly on the North Korean side, wondering what is wrong with the North Korean proposal for replacing the Armistice Agreement with a peace treaty with the United States. The government has the responsibility to help create a righteous public opinion in the country, doesn't it?
