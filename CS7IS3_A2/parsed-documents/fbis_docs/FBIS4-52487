The three are believed to be members of a detained Chinese group that allegedly brokered the illegal immigration of 71 Chinese in Wakayama Prefecture in February. The two men and one woman, whose whereabouts are unknown, are suspected of helping to hide and guard the immigrants after their arrival. New evidence indicates the group was also behind the illegal immigration of another 28 Chinese last November, investigators at the department's public security division said. At an apartment in Tokyo's Toshima Ward, which presumably served as the group's hideout, investigators found notes mentioning "travel expenses for 28" or "prepare bread for 28 guests." The findings indicate the group provided the immigrants with train tickets and provisions, investigators said. Preliminary investigations found the leader of a Hong Kong smuggling ring paid 1.5 million yen to the group to bring the immigrants to Japan. The ring had developed a sophisticated network with separate groups supervising different legs of the journey. One group organized the trip from local areas in China to the port of embarkation and another was responsible for the crossing to Japan. A third batch accompanied the newly arrived to Nagoya Station, where they were taken over [by] a fourth group that guided them to Tokyo Station, the final destination. The arrested group dealt with the Nagoya-Tokyo transaction, according to police.
