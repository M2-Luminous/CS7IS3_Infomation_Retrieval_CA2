Reacting in Strasbourg to the conclusions of the Council of Foreign Ministers, which on Monday in Brussels had asked for the "immediate lifting" of the siege of Sarajevo but did not issue an ultimatum and left the decision to NATO, Mr. Tindemans stressed that the Europeans remained divided. "This inability strips the Maastricht Treaty of its credibility: the treaty precisely provides for the application of a joint foreign and security policy, starting this year," underlined the former Belgian prime minister. He went on to qualify the stance taken by the "Twelve" as "an example of cheap phraseology." Mr. Tindemans observed that the EU member states were sheltering behind NATO. "That organization is at least credible," he said, "but the same cannot be said of Community policy." The leader of the Christian Democrat group has for a long time been saying that other measures ought to have been taken to end the carnage in the former Yugoslavia. "If no measures are implemented, then we should lift the arms embargo on Bosnian Muslims," he said.
