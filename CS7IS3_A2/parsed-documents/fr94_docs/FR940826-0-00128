FR940826-0-00128 FR940826-0-00020 48. In order to prevent collusion in bidding, the Commission in the Second Report and Order stated, *␣*␣* bidders will be required to identify on their short-form applications any parties with whom they have entered into any consortium arrangements, joint ventures, partnerships or other agreements or understandings which relate in any way to the competitive bidding process. Bidders will also be required to certify on their short-form applications that they have not entered into any explicit or implicit agreements, arrangements or understandings of any kind with any parties, other than those identified, regarding the amount of their bid, bidding strategies or the particular properties on which they will or will not bid *␣*␣*. After such applications are filed and prior to the time that the winning bidder has made its required down payment, all bidders will be prohibited from cooperating, collaborating, discussing or disclosing in any manner the substance of their bids or bidding strategies with other bidders, unless such bidders are members of a bidding consortium or other joint bidding arrangement identified on the bidder's short form application. 86 86 Second Report and Order ¶225. 49. Petition. BET Holidays, Inc. (BET) states that the above requirements prevent bidders from entering into any new agreements, joint ventures or similar arrangements with other entities after filing a short-form application. 87 BET claims that as a consequence bidders may be locked into bidding arrangements significantly before the commencement of the auctions, and will be unable to modify their bidding strategies, consult with experts or others, or enter into alliances with new parties any time after the filing of the short-form application. BET states that the collusion rule is an unrealistic constraint on lawful business behavior. For example, according to BET, if a company does not identify affiliates or others with whom it must consult, the company would be forbidden from soliciting research, sharing resources, or discussing its bids until after the winning bidder tenders its down payment. 88 BET requests that the Commission rely on antitrust law as a safeguard against collusion. 87 BET Petition at 10. 88 Id. at 11. 50. Discussion. While we intend to rely primarily on the antitrust laws to prevent bidding collusion, we believe that the anticollusion rules in the Second Report and Order will provide an important tool that will enable the Commission to detect, prevent, and punish collusion. To prevent and detect collusion, we believe that it is important to have clearly stated rules concerning the entities with whom communication about bidding strategies is permissible. The requirement that an entity identify at the time of the short-form application those affiliates, or others with whom it has agreements concerning bidding, and the prohibition of communication concerning bidding with entities identified by other bidders, serve this purpose and are not particularly burdensome. Similarly, prohibiting additional agreements and alliances concerning bidding between applicants bidding for the same licenses, after applications have been filed and the identities of all applicants are known, seems a prudent deterrent to collusion that should have only a minimal and temporary effect on bidders' flexibility. We wish to make explicit our intention that the prohibition extend to post-application settlement agreements and discussions concerning settlement agreements. 51. We do believe, however, that our prohibition on communication among bidders and formation of agreements among bidders after applications have been filed may have been excessively broad in that it includes communications and agreements with bidders who are not bidding against each other, and so may prevent useful agreements that have no effect on the competitiveness of bidding. Consequently, we are modifying our collusion rules, which currently prohibit bidders from communicating with another after short-form applications have been filed regarding the substance of their bids or bidding strategies and which also prohibit bidders from entering into consortium arrangements or joint bidding agreements of any kind after the deadline for short-form applications has passed. In order to permit certain bidders to respond to higher than expected license prices by combining their resources during an auction, we will now permit bidders who have not filed Form 175 applications for any of the same licenses to engage in discussions and enter into bidding consortia or joint bidding arrangements during the course of an auction. We conclude that where bidders have not applied for any of the same licenses there is little risk of anticompetitive conduct and therefore we believe that it is appropriate to relax our collusion rules to permit bidders in this context to have great flexibility to increase their competitiveness in the auction by combining their resources, provided that no change of control of any applicant takes place. 52. In addition, we now believe that entering into consortium arrangements or adding equity partners during an auction may have a useful effect in enabling bidders to acquire the capital necessary to bid successfully for licenses. We have concluded that formation of consortia or changes in ownership after the filing of short-form applications will not necessarily have anticompetitive effects, provided they do not involve parties that might have bid against each other and do not result in a change in control of the applicant. Consequently, we wish to modify our rules regarding amendments to short-form applications. As a result of our experience in the nationwide narrowband PCS auction, we believe that it is necessary to allow applicants to amend their FCC Form 175 applications to make ownership changes after the filing deadline has passed, provided such changes do not result in a change in control of the applicant. Permitting such amendments will provide bidders with flexibility to seek additional capital after applications have been filed, whole ensuring that the real party in interest does not change. Accordingly, we will modify Section 1.2105(c) to permit applicants to amend their FCC Form 175 applications to reflect ownership changes that do not result in a change in control of the applicant, provided the parties have not filed Form 175 applications for any of the same licenses. Such changes shall not be regarded as major amendments to an application, provided they do not result in a transfer of control of the license or the applicant and do not change control of the company.
