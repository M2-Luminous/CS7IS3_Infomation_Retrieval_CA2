He added that Cuba does not wish to hasten the formalization of such ties. Robaina made these statements and answered questions posed by reporters at an improvised news conference last night. He had just ended a tour of the central provinces, where he was accompanied by the diplomatic corps accredited in Havana. We are not in a hurry or insisting on actions that are beyond what life itself imposes on all the countries, he said. Regarding Chile and any other country with which we are furthering talks to renew diplomatic relations, I would rather maintain the same attitude we had with Colombia, Robaina stated. The appropriate time appeared when life itself advised that the renewal of relations was desirable, Robaina said in reference to the recent renewal of ambassadorial-level relations between Colombian and the island. Cuban-Chilean relations were interrupted on 11 September 1973, when a bloody military coup, headed by General Augusto Pinochet, toppled constitutional President Salvador Allende. Currently, bilateral ties are at a consular level.
