Kang Sang-chun, the general manager of the Macao Chokwang Trading Co., thought to be Pyongyang's intelligence office in Macao, was recalled and deputy general manager Pak Cha-pyong took over as general manager and chairman of the company on Dec 18, 1993, according to a North Korean watcher who wished not to be identified. "For Pak, it was a glorious return, for when the North Koreans first set up shop in Macao back in 1974, it was Pak who headed the firm," he explained. Another North Korean watcher told THE KOREA HERALD that Pak was general manager of the company for many years and was very active in the Macao social circles. "It was Pak who had placed North Korea on the Macao map, so to speak. Whenever there were major functions, particularly China-related, such as national day receptions of the People's Republic of China or spring festival activities by the Beijing-oriented Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, Pak would always be there" he disclosed. In the 1980s, however, as the fortunes of Chokwang Trading Co. fell, so did Pak. First, North Korean military personnel engineered a mass assassination plot in Rangoon in October 1983: most of the cabinet members and aides accompanying then President Chon Tu-hwan were killed. Chon was on his way to a national cemetery when the explosion occurred and escaped unharmed. Then, a Korean Airline (KAL) passenger plane exploded in mid-air over the Indian Ocean, killing all aboard in 1987. Two persons, one elderly man and a girl, Kim Hyon-hui, were arrested in a Middle East city for sabotage. Both swallowed poison but the girl survived. It was later confirmed that Kim Hyon-hui and her senior accomplice had been trained in Macao for six months before they planted the bomb on the KAL plane. According to North Korean watchers here, a serious car accident, involving explosives, occurred in Macao within one or two years after the KAL bombing. Several senior officials of the Chokwang Trading Co. in the car were killed and their bodies were returned to Pyongyang without Macao officials being allowed to perform autopsies. "It was rumored that the men were killed on Pyongyang's order and that Macao security keeps a very close watch on Chokwang," a North Korean watcher here said. Shortly after these incidents, Pak, who had by then become very unpopular, was recalled to North Korea. His successors came, but like the Vietnamese officials who came to Hong Kong after the 1979 border incident with China, they adopted a low profile, he explained. "Although they were duty bound to turn up at the many functions they always kept to a corner and tried not to attract attention -- just like the Vietnamese in Hong Kong," he disclosed. Despite this, the source went on to say, protocol was observed to the hilt by all parties. On Kim Il-song's birthday, for example, the Macao XINHUA News Agency would send flower trays to Chokwang and Chokwang would hold small parties. While Kang was managing the Chokwang, according to the North Korean watcher, Pak suddenly turned up in 1992, apparently in a bid to regain some of the North Korean limelight because, he is still well-known in the Macao community. "However, he was demoted to deputy general manager. Part of his duties appears to be the reestablishment of North Korean prestige and also the reorganization of North Korean business activities in Macao," he explained. In these two fields, he explained that there has been some progress. Pak is now in his early 60s and should retire soon but he has once again been appointed general manager. "Speculation is ripe here that his returning to the post may either be a kind of reward for his contribution to Pyongyang or a move to coordinate the return to power of Kim Il-song's brother, Kim Yong-chu," he added.
