One of the major reforms was a measure which allows direct presidential and vice presidential elections in 1996. Previously, Taiwan voters elected National Assembly members, who in turn voted for the president. The package was approved by an overwhelming majority during a special plenary session of the KMT's 214-member central committee. The central committee passed all proposals drafted by the party's constitutional reform research task force except one that would have restricted parliamentary speech by subjecting legislators to libel laws. The central committee also added another provision to the reform proposals: that Republic of China [ROC] passport holders living abroad would have the right to vote in future direct elections for the president and vice president. The provision, which was not in the party's original reform proposals, was proposed by former Premier Li Huan during the session and put to a vote. Li's proposal garnered 108 votes, one vote more than the minimum required for it to be incorporated into the party's final amendment proposals. The KMT reform package will be further discussed by the National Assembly when it begins a three-month constitutional reform session later this week. The approved package also extends the terms of legislators from three to four years, allows the president to appoint and dismiss senior government officials without the approval of the premier, and creates the post of speaker and vice speaker in the National Assembly.
