Here is our colleague with the latest Afghan developments. [Correspondent, reporting from Peshawar] Despite the reduction in the severity of the battles in Kabul, reports coming from northern Afghanistan indicate that there has been heavy fighting between the forces supporting and opposing the president in Konduz and Samangan provinces. Sources affiliated to the Jami'at-e Eslami [Islamic Society] say that in those two areas they have achieved some victories and are preparing for a new assault against Mazar-e Sharif. On the other hand Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic Party] sources said today that forces opposing the government have taken the town of Qal'eh-Zal in Konduz Province and are advancing toward the important city of Shir Khan Bandar. Meanwhile a 15 member delegation comprising military commanders from five Afghan jihadi parties, which met with Afghan Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar in Charasyab, has stated that the Jami'at-e Eslami party has given it absolute authority to arbitrate and decide on the current fighting and the means to end it. On the other hand Hezb-e Eslami sources stressed today that it and the other groups opposed to the government have categorically dismissed the principle of arbitration and decisionmaking by the aforementioned commanders. This came today when, according to reports in Jalalabad, the 15-member military commanders council from five jihadi parties, situated in the east of the Afghan capital, called on the warring sides in Kabul to cease fire from tomorrow morning and recall their forces from the battlegrounds in Kabul. The representatives of the Jabha-ye Nejat-e Meli-ye [National Liberation Front], Hezb-e Wahdat-e Eslami [Islamic Unity Party], Hezb-e Harakat-e Eslami [Islamic Movement Party] led by Ayatollah Mohseni, and the Mahaz-e Melli [National Front] party are not among the commanders who have put forward that proposal. Meanwhile, Homayun Jarid, deputy leader of the Hezb-e Eslami, announced that a four member delegation from the government opposition front -- the Afghan Coordination Council -- will arrive in Peshawar today from Charasyab, 25 km south of Kabul, to meet and confer with the Pakistani foreign minister and other officials as well as a group of the Afghan jihadi group leaders.
