Do you agree with the new government's centrist positioning? [Fini] During the electoral campaign, Berlusconi endlessly repeated that Forza Italia is not a right-wing movement, but a center one. On the other hand, National Alliance [AN] is most certainly a right-wing force, a very variegated right, with a thousand different shades and contents. If a government is formed, it will be a center-right government. But these are just labels. [Ballardin] The Knight added: "AN comes from the Right, but it has resolutely asserted its liberal stand. We will judge from their performance whether this resolve is born out by the facts." [Fini] There is no reason whatever why the Right should not be liberal. All this, however, is only wordplay. The government must be characterized exclusively by its platform. [Ballardin] In Pontida [League rally venue], [League Secretary] Bossi said: "We are antifascist, and we will not tolerate any resurrection of that ideology. Let Fini and AN be aware of this." [Fini] Bossi will somehow have to explain to the League's supporters why, after having proclaimed "Never with AN" throughout the electoral campaign, he is now forming a government with us. My reply is that there will be no resurrection, because AN is certainly not a fascist or neofascist formation. I now hope Bossi will contribute to turning 25 April [Liberation Day] into a national appeasement date, rather than one of hate. [Ballardin] Yesterday Bossi was very moderate. [Fini] Yes, I believe that by now he has not only fully accepted joining the government, as he made the League supporters who were present pledge themselves to do, but also that he has understood that certain typically rally-like tones, which he had adopted lately, had to be dispensed with, and this is a positive development. [Ballardin] Major exponents of the international press continue to define you as neofascists. Is this definition correct or unfair? [Fini] One of the reasons why I will not join the government is precisely in order to explain what we really are to the international public opinion. Since I would probably not manage to perform two such important tasks at the same time, as are leading a party and acting as a minister, I have decided to continue to lead AN, precisely so as to dispel any doubts concerning our identity. [Ballardin] Would you rather be called neofascists or postfascists? [Fini] Last January, when it was set up, AN clearly explained that it did not constitute a neofascist Right, but a European Right, that believes in freedom and democracy, and that can be defined as post-fascist. [Ballardin] [League ideologue] Miglio stated that he was very satisfied with the first meeting with AN experts on federalism. [Fini] Miglio knows very well that, for us, the federal model cannot certainly be based on Miglio's three different Italies, or his macroregions. The study conducted by the Agnelli Foundation might constitute a good starting point. We believe in the importance of having a powerful counterweight, in the form of a directly elected prime minister, who should have greater powers than at present. [Ballardin] Speaking of the government, should [Radical leader] Pannella become a minister? [Fini] Personally I have many reservations -- among other reasons, because the Radicals' position on drugs is the opposite of ours. [Ballardin] Should the League be given the Interior Ministry? [Fini] A coalition government can only be formed if its composition is agreed among all the partners involved. It is still too early to discuss the various portfolios.
