Mukherjee, vice-director general of the International Institute of the Chuche Idea [IICI] and president of the Asian Regional Institute of the Chuche Idea, made a report entitled "The Chuche Idea Is a Scientific Doctrine Indicating the Road of Independence, Peace and Friendship". The reporter said the universal truth of the chuche idea has been more eloquently proved by the trend of the development of history in which the desire of the popular masses to advance towards independence has grown more intense than ever before after the end of the Cold War. "President Kim Il-song founded the chuche idea, the first man- centred doctrine in history, which scientifically shows the road of shaping the destiny of man, giving peoples high pride and consciousness of being the masters of the world and their own destinies and powerfully inspiring them to the building of an independent, new world, the century-old desire of mankind," he stressed. Referring to the historical inevitability of the downfall of imperialism and the appearance of an independent, new world, he said: "If the imperialists persist in their policy of strength to maintain and expand the old order of domination and subjugation, taking advantage of the collapse of the balance of forces in the world arena, they will not only face a strong resistance of the anti-imperialist independent forces but also be forsaken by their companions and meet their destruction in the long run. "The downfall of imperialism is inevitable in the development of history but it will never quit the arena of history voluntarily. In order to hasten its fall it is urgent to form a broad anti-imperialist, anti-U.S. joint front. All the countries of the world aspiring after independence and peace, including the socialist countries and non-aligned nations, and political parties, public organizations and international organizations should join this front on a broad basis. "Only when the developing countries realize regional economic cooperation under the banner of collective self-reliance is it possible to jointly defend the regional economic interests from the imperialist plunder and successfully ensure economic exchange and development among nations. "The material foundation of an independent world will be laid when the gap in wealth between the developed capitalist countries and the developing countries is narrowed and homogeneity is increased in economic development. If an independent idea and culture are developed and the world political order is democratized to correspond with this material foundation, the knell of imperialism will be sounded and an independent, new world will come into being". Noting that independence, peace and friendship are the basic idea of global independence, the reporter quoted respected President Kim Il-song as saying: "Independence, peace and friendship are the common ideals of the progressive people of the world. The Cold War has ended and the democratic and independent development of the international community will be accelerated still faster. The 21st century will be a new historic century in which the people of all countries will enjoy welfare and prosperity in a free and peaceful new world." "The basic demand preferential in creating an independent, new world is to apply the idea of independence," the reporter said, and continued: "Independence is the life not only of each man but also of each country and nation and, furthermore, the common life of mankind. "Each nation must firmly maintain its independence and respect other's independence. "Defending the principle of independence in international relations is not contradictory to internationalism but is the basis of true internationalism. "The main target of struggle in realizing the idea of independence is the imperialist forces. This idea will be realized on a full scale when the anti-imperialist independent forces the world over check and frustrate the dominationist moves of the imperialists by their united strength. "It is an indispensable prerequisite to the building of an independent, new world to prevent war and ensure peace of the world. To this end, it is necessary to get rid of the dominationist idea of power almighty favoring the settlement of all issues by strength, which is a mode of thinking in the Cold War. "All the peaceloving forces should launch a vigorous struggle to check and frustrate the arms expansion by the imperialists, remove their aggressive military bases in other countries, get the aggressive military blocs dissolved, create nuclear-free, peace zones in many regions of the world and realize a universal and complete disarmament. "It is an essential requisite to the building of an independent, new world to develop friendly and cooperative relations among peoples defending independence. An important question in developing those relations at present is to destroy the old international order and establish a new, fair one in all spheres, politic, economic and cultural. "Developing South-South cooperation is an important way of ensuring friendship and cooperation among peoples and achieving common prosperity of mankind". Calling for active propaganda and dissemination of the chuche idea, the reporter said: "It is the chuche idea which scientifically indicates the main orientation and ways for the development of the present era heading for an independent, new world. It is the demand of the times and honorable duty to widely disseminate this idea. "What is most important in propagandising and disseminating the chuche idea is to make a deep study of works of Comrade Kim Chong-il, the sagacious leader of the Korean people. His works consummate the precious experiences of the Korean people in successfully building anthropocentric socialism with a singlehearted unity of the leader, the party and the masses and give profound answers to the important theoretical and practical problems arising in the advance of mankind along the road of independence in the present time. That is why his many works, including `The Historical Lesson in Building Socialism and the General Line of Our Party', `On the Fundamentals of Revolutionary Party Building' and `Abuses of Socialism Are Intolerable", have evoked a great sympathy among the progressive people of the world today." The reporter stressed the need to conduct the work of disseminating the chuche idea among the broad masses of people through various art activities based on the chuche view of life and value and in combination with various socio-political activities such as the movement for democracy, anti-war, anti-nuke peace movement and environmental protection movement in close link with progressive political parties. He said each chuche idea study organization should conduct the work of disseminating and applying the chuche idea by its own efforts in conformity with the interests of its people and specific conditions of its country and lead the popular masses to be the masters in this work. He called for an energetic effort for the dissemination of the chuche idea to accelerate with redoubled vigor the building of an independent, new world where the ideals of independence, peace and friendship would be embodied.
