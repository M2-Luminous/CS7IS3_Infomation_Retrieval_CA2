Speaking on Wednesday [27 April], President Ahtisaari expressed the hope that Russia and Estonia can settle their differences on their own, but if their talks become deadlocked Finland could mediate if both sides asked for help. (?Wilf Stinger) reports: [passage omitted] President Ahtisaari said Wednesday that he hopes that the two parties themselves can find agreement without outside help. If Finland were to become involved, he said, the first step would be to find out if there is a real chance that its efforts would be effective--if there's actually a solid basis for agreement. The president described the situation as one which would require the desire of both sides for the Finns to act as mediators, and also a desire by both sides to reach a settlement. President Ahtisaari also pointed out to the press that (?often) in international disputes the expression of the need for a mediator is in fact an act of faith in finding a settlement. The mediator is not always actually needed.
