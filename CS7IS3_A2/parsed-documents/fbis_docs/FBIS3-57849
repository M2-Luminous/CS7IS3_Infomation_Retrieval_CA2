We arrived to embrace the citizens of Diyarbakir and southeast Anatolia. I want to say that the warm welcome and the support I saw made me very happy and confirmed once more the fact that we are truly a united entity. The empathy we received here constitutes our greatest force. We came here to extend support and we leave here next year, that means on 1 January, stronger than ever thanks to the devotion of our people. All we wish is to be able to protect our citizens, children, babies, and old people. Our sole wish is to be able to bring life security as well as the state and the government to the people of the region. What we witnessed here today proves that whatever happens our historical unity cannot be easily disrupted. The state is great and strong, and all our citizens from all regions are happy to belong to such a beautiful country. We are determined to bring the strength of the state to all our citizens -- be they in Diyarbakir, Izmir, or Istanbul -- who are free to live anywhere they want and when they want. For this reason, we invested 1.6 trillion Turkish lira in Diyarbakir last year and this year we are endeavoring to invest an additional 3.7 trillion Turkish lira, which has already been included in the budget. We have arrived in Diyarbakir bringing with us approval of this additional amount within the framework of planning. [passage omitted] [Unidentified correspondent] It has been reported that due to financial difficulties, there has been a stand still in the GAP [Southeast Anatolia Project]. What are your views on this issue? [Ciller] There is no slowdown in the GAP. We are aiming at bringing water to Urfa by means of an internal pipeline until summer. We had a mild backlog on this issue due to a difficulty the contractor confronted but we want to help him. We will overcome this problem by using state mechanisms and negotiating with various banks, among them the Development Bank. The income we will receive from the transportation of water will cover our additional expenses. We are determined on this issue and I am persuaded that we are going to solve this issue in a couple of weeks. On the issue of the Birecik Dam: We first laid the foundations of the dam and then started looking for financial help. The most important event was obtaining [word indistinct], that means Germany's, guarantee and France followed in Germany's footsteps. We are at this moment in contact with the other two countries who belong to the consortium, but I do not envisage any problems on that account because Germany's guarantee was the most important step in the establishment of the consortium. The construction of the Birecik Dam will begin very soon. [passage omitted] [Unidentified correspondents] [passage indistinct] [Ciller] As the 50th government, our main duty is to take care of the problems and the life security of our citizens in southeast Anatolia. We have recruited the world regarding this issue and explained to them that we have to act together in securing these people's right to live, their most important right. I can say that the results we achieved were the most positive results in the last 10 years. We have secured the support of Germany, France, Britain, and the United States -- not achieved till now. We have also started a shuttle diplomacy with our neighbor countries in the east. [passage omitted] We found an opportunity to express Turkey's views on the Bosnia-Herzegovina issue to the world. At the same time, we were explaining our citizens' problems and trying to secure their lives within the framework of human rights. What is happening in Bosnia-Herzegovina today is a disgrace to humanity. We have also pointed out that this disgrace -- in violation of human rights -- spreads the impression of being a Muslim-Christian conflict and therefore poses a great danger to world stability. Within this framework, I cannot say that the world progressed much regarding this issue but in the coming days and months, I will be going to Bosnia-Herzegovina together with Honorable Benazir Bhutto and Margaret Thatcher to draw the world's attention to this disgrace and warn the world. The issue of Bosnia-Herzegovina is not only an issue which is of concern to Turkey but also to Europe and the whole world. Turkey had to try and explain to the world the situation in Bosnia and we will continue in our efforts until a solution is found. This is not an issue that Turkey can solve alone. Concerning Azerbaijan, we also explained to the world that without discriminating we launched a very big aid campaign to the countries which emerged following the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The amount of money that we have transferred to that region is somewhere between $1.5 and $2 billion -- a considerable amount in view of the fact that the total amount of the aid extended by the seven big countries [as heard] together is $5 billion. [passage omitted] Today there is an unjust Armenian aggression against Azerbaijan and this should be condemned. Turkey is determined to continue with its policy of nondiscrimination within the framework of human rights, as it did in Kuwait, Iraq, Somalia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Azerbaijan. Turkey is against all unjust attacks. We expressed this view when we went to Russia. We pointed out to Russia that it has to cooperate with Turkey on the Azerbaijani issue. We have also warned the world in the same way. We warned the world that one day nationalism may raise its head in Russia and we called on the world to assess Turkey's importance in the region as well as other regional balances. [passage omitted] The issue of Cyprus is a completely different matter and great steps will be taken there in the very near future. I think that we have been able to relay a very different picture to the world public. When we first went to the United States, President Clinton said: Turkey has done the best it can. It was very important for us to have Clinton acknowledge that Turkey did its best because till then we were being blamed for being unjust. [passage omitted] We are reiterating that we should not use Cyprus as a tool in foreign policy and this is what we ask from our neighbors and Greece: Let us not make the Cyprus issue a tool for internal politics. Let us not use the Cyprus issue as a means for exploitation. Let us find a solution to this issue together, jointly. The most important point in this issue was the Cyprus administration coming to power by democratic means. We are witness to the last stages of this democratic process and once the government is established we will have the opportunity to tackle this issue under the leadership of the Turkish Cypriots, because they will have to decide their own fate and make the proper decisions. [Unidentified correspondent] There is concern regarding the difficulty in holding elections in the region as well as the designation of candidates. [passage indistinct] [Ciller] Let no one worry. I am going to say this openly. Elections will be held in this region and throughout the country. Every kind of security measure will be taken and there will be justice and freedom. We are taking every measure in order to hold the elections under these conditions. I want to assure the citizens and I call on them to be calm and peaceful. [passage omitted] [Karayalcin] I agree with honorable Ciller's statement. I have not heard anything as to the Social Democratic Populist Party [SDPP] mayors not submitting their candidacy for the 27 March elections. As the leader of the SDPP, I do not want my statements to be taken as an assessment that the present SDPP mayors' candidacy will be automatically renewed. We have not yet reached any decisions on this issue. [passage omitted] As the honorable prime minister expressed, there is no reason for the elections not to be held here. The elections will take place and all the parties that can participate will participate. [passage omitted] [Unidentified correspondent] In your speech, you noted that the population of Diyarbakir increased two to threefold in the past two years. [passage indistinct] Over one thousand villages have reportedly been evacuated. Does your government have any plans to secure the villagers' return to their homes, to guarantee their safety, and failing that, to help these people financially? [Karayalcin] There are no evacuated villages in the region. There are approximately 600 empty villages. Of these, 78 have been abandoned for economic reasons. There are also those that have been left for security reasons, but I believe that the phrase evacuated villages does not apply here. For us, the resettlement of our citizens who are experiencing this internal immigration is extremely important -- be it in Diyarbakir, Batman, Bismil, or any other place in the region. The honorable prime minister supplied figures for a move which is important only for Diyarbakir. Only in Diyarbakir, we are launching a project to include 14,000 housing units built on 280 hectares. As mentioned by the prime minister earlier, we are considering every means in order to overcome the settlement problems and meet the urgent accommodation needs of our citizens in other provinces who are living in tents. Although I was not asked, I would like to make it very clear that it is our aim to extensively implement the rules of democratization in the southeast of the country as well. As the prime minister noted, it is one of our primary goals to reduce and eventually eliminate terrorism and stop the bloodshed in 1994. In conjunction with this goal, our government will undertake great leaps in the field of democratization. [passage omitted] [Unidentified correspondent] Western countries adopted a front against the PKK [Kurdish Workers Party] as a result of your visit to these countries. How long will this last? In Antalya, you stated that terrorism will be eliminated in 1994. We infer from this that the armed struggle will be intensified. If in the future, these Western countries pressure you to stop the armed struggle, then what will you do? [Ciller] Our internal affairs are our own concern. We will be the ones to make the decision. What we did vis-a-vis the outside world was to tell them there are babies, women, elderly and innocent people among our citizens living in this region. These citizens are being cruelly murdered. We must protect these people. We are not only protecting them, but in times of need we also opened our borders and provided shelter and food for 1 million of their brothers across the border. Our problem is not with the people of this region. Our problem is with a terrorist group which is preventing us from providing services, investments, and state support to the region, and which is even trying to oust the political parties and the press from the area. Let us wage this struggle against the terrorists together. Let us do this together in all parts of the world -- in Somalia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Azerbaijan, and Iraq. There is no question of us redirecting our policy in line with their various wishes, and there cannot be such a question. It must be said, however, that until now Germany wanted to stop us using their weapons in the struggle against terrorism, but now the world has realized that these people are terrorists and they are killing our innocent citizens. If our cause is just, we can continue to defend it. It is important that we should be in the right. It is important for us to reach out to our citizens with compassion. To this end, we must surmount all the obstacles before us. We are determined in this. I believe that we have already achieved a significant stage in this struggle and that we will advance our cause even further in 1994. It is impossible to say that terrorism in Turkey will suddenly disappear and be uprooted in 1994. We will, however, reduce it to the same level as the rest of the world, to a level where it ceases to pose a threat, to occupy first place on our agenda, to drain the resources of the state, or to prevent the state from investing in this region. In other words, we will achieve a significant stage in the struggle against terrorism, we will remove it from our priority list, and we will no longer allow it to eat into our resources. We are determined to attain this and I believe that we will. [passage omitted] [Unidentified correspondent] [question indistinct] [Ciller] I would like to answer the question on what the government plans to implement in the first part of this year. Our first project concerns the southeast region. As you know, we just enacted the elections law. Our agenda includes a series of bills to fight terrorism. Immediately after this, we will introduce the law on local administrations. Our bill on the turn-key model for industry will resolve the financing difficulties for the dams to be built in Birecik and its vicinity. The law on local administration accords more resources and more power to municipal authorities. In other words, we want local authorities to solve more problems themselves, rather than involve Ankara in their solution. We will use pilot areas in all parts of the country because we want to overcome problems using experience and on-the-spot implementation. More important, in the first three months of this year, we will provide loans for shopkeepers and small businesses as well as for the youth and housewives through the Halk Bank. We also have a project to sell agricultural Treasury lands that are outside the jurisdiction of the municipalities to those who are utilizing them within their means. We also want to include in our agenda the various Treasury lands in urban areas which have turned into shantytowns. I would also like to mention that we will continue to allocate resources to this region with great determination. This will not consist only of cotton and grain. During 1993, we allocated 1 billion Turkish lira for tobacco to Batman. This will continue. As you know, we have a new tobacco project. The state is determined to continue to allocate resources to this region. [passage omitted]
