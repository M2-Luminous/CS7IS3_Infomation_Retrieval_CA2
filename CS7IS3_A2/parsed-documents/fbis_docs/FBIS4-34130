She said that of that amount, 200 million quetzals were generated by open market operations, a similar amount came from compulsory investments, and another 200 million quetzals resulted from public sector deposits in Banguat. According to the Banguat official, the remaining 400 million quetzals have not negatively impacted the economy because it is invested in short-term investments.
