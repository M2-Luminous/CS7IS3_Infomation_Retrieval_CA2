Maj. Gen. Cuadra yesterday represented the EPS at an official function the National Assembly held in honor of Taiwanese President Li Teng-hui. Cuadra was accompanied at all times by Lieutenant Colonel Ricardo Wheelock, Armed Forces public relations chief. Days earlier, Wheelock also accompanied Cuadra when he held a news conference in Matagalpa to discuss military operations against criminal groups. Since then, the EPS chief of staff has been seen more frequently in public. According to the command roster, he is Gen. Ortega's virtual successor. "In all armies there is a transition period in which the chief of a unit must turn over everything in order," Cuadra insisted. We then asked the high-ranking EPS officer: "In the case of the Army, how long will this process take?" He responded: "It will be a prudent period of time, which will be very clear under the law... but do not worry, because you will learn about it in coming days." Regarding the honors that Gen. Ortega might receive after he retires, Cuadra said this is not included in the Military Organization Law. Nevertheless, he said, "Gen. Ortega has made many contributions to the country and will continue to do so. Therefore he deserves society's recognition." Lacayo: No More Tensions Meanwhile, Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo admitted that with the recent agreement between the Army and the executive and legislative branches on the Military Code and the Army chief's departure, the dispute with the military command has "finally and completely" ended. Regarding the date for Gen. Ortega's departure, Lacayo replied: "Ask BARRICADA." On Wednesday, 4 May, this newspaper reported that an agreement had been reached on the date -- 21 February 1995 -- during a "secret meeting" on 3 May. Ramiro Gurdian, president of COSEP [Higher Council of Private Enterprise], said he hoped that Gen. Ortega's departure would come sooner, but he added that the date announced "is good, because it removes tension from the political environment." Minister Lacayo confirmed the existence of a comprehensive plan against the criminal groups, as was announced by Gen. Ortega. "This plan has been in operation since 15 April. I said in Jinotega that once the last group of the 3-80 Northern Front was demobilized, there would be opportunity to fight with firmness and a strong hand those robbers who are attacking producers," Lacayo added.
