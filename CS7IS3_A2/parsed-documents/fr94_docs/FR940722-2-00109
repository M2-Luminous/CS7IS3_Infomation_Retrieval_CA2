Note: The Advisory Committee will not consider applications from individuals to further their own training or research, or from institutions or organizations whose proposals are not for competitive award programs that are national in scope as defined above. Support for specific activities will be guided by the following policies: _ Publications. Funds awarded in this competition should not be used to subsidize journals, newsletters and other periodical publications except in special circumstances, in which cases the funds should be supplied through peer-review organizations with national competitive programs. _ Conferences. Proposals for conferences, like those for research projects and training programs, should be assessed according to their relative contribution to the advancement of knowledge and to the professional development of cadres in the fields. Therefore, requests for conference funding should be directed to one or more of the national peer-review organizations receiving program funds, with proposed conferences being evaluated competitively against research, fellowship or other proposals for achieving the purposes of the grant. _ Library Activities. Funds may be used for certain library activities which clearly strengthen research and training on the countries of Eastern Europe and the independent States of the former Soviet Union and benefit the fields as a whole. Such programs must make awards based upon open, nationwide competition, incorporating peer group review mechanisms. Funds may not be used for activities such as modernization, acquisition, or preservation. Modest, cost-effective proposals to facilitate research, by eliminating serious cataloging backlogs or otherwise improving access to research materials, will be considered.
