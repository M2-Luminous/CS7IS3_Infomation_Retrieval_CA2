The last meeting of the defense ministers of Ukraine and Russia in Crimea was of a working nature and cannot be a final evaluation of the division of the Black Sea Fleet, Leonid Kravchuk told journalists. The statement by Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev to the Ostankino television company that Ukraine has changed its stand is groundless, he emphasized. Leonid Kravchuk recalled that in accordance with the Yalta accord the fleet should be divided in half. But, proceeding from the current realities, Ukraine will take only 15-20 percent of the ships. The remainder will go to pay off its debts to Russia. Touching on the issue of a base for the Russian ships, the president said that he is insisting on their being stationed in Sevastopol. Balaklava could become the base for the Ukrainian Navy. Leonid Kravchuk will defend this proposal at his next meeting with Russia's President Boris Yeltsin. However, as much as I might respect the defense ministers of the two states, the Black Sea Fleet issue should be resolved by the presidents and governments, Leonid Kravchuk emphasized.
