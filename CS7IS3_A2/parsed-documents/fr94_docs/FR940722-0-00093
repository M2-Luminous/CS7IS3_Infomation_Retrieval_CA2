FR940722-0-00093 FR940722-0-00019 I. Introduction 1. In this Fifth Report and Order, we adopt rules to conduct auctions for the award of more than 2,000 licenses to provide personal communications services in the 2 GHz band, which we call ``broadband PCS.'' These broadband PCS auctions will constitute the largest auction of public assets in American history and are expected to recover billions of dollars for the United States Treasury. More importantly, the auctions will lead to the introduction of an array of new telecommunications products and services that are expected to fuel our nation's economic growth and revolutionize the way in which Americans communicate. 2. We also adopt in this Order provisions to fulfill Congress's mandate that we ensure that small businesses, rural telephone companies and businesses owned by minorities and women are given the opportunity to participate in the provision of broadband PCS. These rules will provide unprecedented opportunities for these designated entities to become meaningfully involved in the provision of a new telecommunications service. This action seeks to ensure that licenses for broadband PCS are disseminated to a wide variety of applicants and to remedy the serious underrepresentation of minorities and women in the provision of telecommunications services. Further, by the actions we take today we seek to ensure that PCS is provided to all communities in this country, including rural areas. 3. Broadband PCS will provide a variety of mobile services that will compete with existing cellular services. In addition, broadband PCS is expected to provide new mobile communications capabilities that are not currently available. These services will be provided by means of a new generation of communications devices that will include small, lightweight, multi-function portable phones, portable facsimile and other imaging devices, new types of multi-channel cordless phones, and advanced paging devices with two-way data capabilities. 1 The introduction of broadband PCS should benefit consumers by raising the overall level of competition in many already competitive segments of the telecommunications industry and by providing competition in other segments for the first time. The broadband PCS industry should also generate thousands of jobs in this country and improve the international competitiveness of the American economy. 1 We already have adopted rules for competitive bidding on licenses to be awarded to provide personal communications services in the 900 MHz band (narrowband PCS), which will be used primarily to provide advanced paging services, and for licenses to provide Interactive Video and Data Service (IVDS), which will be used to provide services such as home shopping and pay-per-view programming. See Third Report and Order in PP Docket No. 99&hyph;253, FCC 94&hyph;98, 59 FR 26741, May 24, 1994 (narrowband PCS); and Fourth Report and Order in PP Docket No. 93&hyph;253, FCC 94&hyph;99, 59 FR 24947, May 13, 1994 (IVDS). 4. Auctions for broadband PCS licenses will be conducted pursuant to Section 309(j) of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. §309(j), which was enacted in August 1993. Section 309(j) granted the Commission express authority to employ competitive bidding procedures to award licenses to use the electromagnetic spectrum. 2 Section 309(j)(1) permits auctions only where mutually exclusive applications for initial licenses are accepted for filing by the Commission and where the principal use of the spectrum is reasonably likely to involve the receipt by the licensee of compensation from subscribers in return for enabling those subscribers to receive or transmit communications signals. In the Second Report and Order in his proceeding, we concluded that PCS as a class of service satisfies the Section 309(j)(1) criteria. See Second Report and Order in PP Docket No. 93&hyph;253, 9 FCC Rcd 2348, 59 FR 22980, May 4, 1994 ( Second Report and Order ), at ¶¶54&hyph;58. Accordingly, if mutually exclusive applications for a broadband PCS license are accepted for filing, we will award that license through competitive bidding. 2 We adopted a Notice of Proposed Rule Making to implement Section 309(j) on September 23, 1993. Notice of Proposed Rule Making in PP Docket No. 93&hyph;253, 8 FCC Rcd 7635, 58 FR 53489, Oct. 15, 1993 (hereinafter ``NPRM'' or ``Notice''). The Commission received 222 comments, 169 reply comments and numerous ex parte presentations relating to this proceeding. Commenters may be referred to herein by abbreviations. 5. We also concluded in the Second Report and Order that we could design auction procedures to govern the award of broadband PCS licenses that would promote the objectives listed in Section 309(j)(3). More specifically, in the Second Report and Order , we determined that the use of competitive bidding to award broadband PCS licenses, as compared with other licensing methods, would speed the development and deployment of new services to the public and would encourage efficient use of the spectrum, as required by Section 309(j)(3) (A) and (D). In this regard, we noted that auctions would generally award licenses quickly to those parties who value them most highly and who are therefore most likely to introduce service rapidly to the public. Id . at ¶57. We also concluded that competitive bidding would recover for the public a portion of the value of the spectrum, as envisioned in Section 309(j)(3)(C). Id . We considered a variety of methods to implement Congress's remaining objectives, set forth in Section 309(j)(3)(B), of ``promoting economic opportunity'' and ``avoiding excessive concentration of licenses'' by disseminating licenses ``among a wide variety of applicants.'' In the Second Report and Order, we adopted rules which provide the Commission with a menu of options to choose from to promote these objectives with respect to particular spectrum services to be auctioned, such as broadband PCS, in service-specific rules. 6. In our Broadband PCS Reconsideration Order , we established bandwidth assignments and area designations for broadband PCS. See Memorandum Opinion and Order in GEN Docket No. 90&hyph;314, FCC 94&hyph;144, 59 FR 32830, June 24, 1994 (`` Broadband PCS Reconsideration Order''); see also Second Report and Order in GEN Docket No. 90&hyph;314, FCC 93&hyph;451, 8 FCC Rcd 7700, 58 FR 59174, Nov. 8, 1993. In that Order, we allocated 120 MHz of spectrum for licensed broadband PCS. We divided the licensed broadband PCS spectrum into three 30 MHz blocks (blocks A, B and C) and three 10 MHz blocks (blocks D, E and F). We also designated two different service areas: 493 Basic Trading Areas (``BTAs'') and 51 Major Trading Areas (``MTAs''). 3 The licenses in frequency blocks A and B will be awarded on an MTA basis, and the licenses on frequency blocks C, D, E and F will be awarded on a BTA basis. A total of 2,074 broadband PCS licenses will therefore be issued. 4 The Broadband PCS Reconsideration Order sets forth eligibility rules for obtaining broadband PCS licenses, and establishes construction requirements to facilitate the provision of PCS services. See Broadband PCS Reconsideration Order at ¶¶102&hyph;132, 147&hyph;158. By these rules, we intend to promote competition in the wireless telecommunications market by as many different qualified providers as the spectrum can reasonably accommodate and to promote the rapid deployment of the infrastructure required to provide broadband PCS. 3 The 493 BTAs and 51 MTAs used in our broadband PCS licensing rules have been adapted from the Rand McNally 1992 Commercial Atlas and Marketing Guide, 123rd Edition, at 38&hyph;39. 4 The Commission has granted pioneer's preference to three broadband PCS applicants, and stated that the parties awarded pioneer's preferences may apply for a 30 MHz MTA broadband PCS license without facing competing applications. See Third Report and Order in GEN Docket No. 90&hyph;314, 9 FCC Rcd 1337, 59 FR 9419, Feb. 28, 1994. If the Commission grants licenses to the three pioneer's preference grantees, three fewer licenses will be awarded through competitive bidding.
