Nevertheless, diplomatic sources do not believe President Gaviria will attain the needed absolute majority of votes during the first round of balloting by the OAS foreign ministers. Tomorrow in Washington, 34 OAS member-nations will elect the seventh OAS secretary general. Colombian President Cesar Gaviria and Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus are the strongest candidates to replace Brazilian Joao Baena Soares as secretary general. [Soares] "The most important thing for me is to complete my term in office by following the principles I established for myself from the very beginning." On the eve of the elections, President Gaviria seems to be leading. Gaviria has the support of 16 countries, three more than his closest opponent -- Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus. [Niehaus] "There are no blocs, and there are no secret commitments. We are only committed to ensuring respect for the OAS Charter." To win the election, a candidate must receive an absolute majority of all votes cast -- in other words, 18 votes to keep the election from going to a second round. [Former Colombian Foreign Minister Augusto Ramirez Ocampo] "If logic prevails, President Gaviria will win. Gaviria is a president, whereas Niehaus is a foreign minister. Gaviria also has the support of the largest countries on the continent." Whoever the winner is, he will face the great challenge of reviving what many international analysts have described as a moribund organization. [Analyst Diego Uribe Vargas, identified by caption] "Whenever it can, the United States disregards inter-American laws and principles, beginning with nonintervention, which is the first and foremost rule." Experts say the new secretary general must bolster the OAS profile, making it stronger in the face of the U.S. Government. Many believe the OAS is excellent in theory, but that does not work in practice. [Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin] "The new secretary general must have the discipline and commitment to work for everyone while excluding no one, especially those that need help the most." This evening the Colombian foreign minister was working hard to ensure the votes of two undecided countries to lock up the 18 votes needed by President Gaviria.
