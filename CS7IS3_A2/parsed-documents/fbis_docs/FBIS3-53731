A senior Syrian official told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that his country's position and concept of a just and comprehensive peace were announced very clearly in Geneva, and that the moment of truth has come for Israel to respond to the voice of peace, which was announced again from Geneva. The Syrian official was speaking after President Hafiz al-Asad's return from Geneva the night before last after his historic meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton. Tahir al-Masri, speaker of the Jordanian House of Representatives, said the meeting is as important as the Madrid conference from which the peace process was launched. Maybe in this context, too, Lebanese President Ilyas al-Hirawi spoke to the Syrian president over the telephone to agree to hold a summit in Damascus, to be attended from the Lebanese side -- in addition to President al-Hirawi -- by Chamber of Deputies Speaker Nabih Birri, Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri, Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz, and Ambassador Suhayl Shammas, head of the peace delegation to the negotiations with Israel. A Lebanese presidential source told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that President al-Asad has asked Lebanese officials to wait two days, to allow him to rest after his journey to and from Geneva. He will receive them later. However, the source said that, if something happens and delays this Lebanese-Syrian summit, Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' will visit Beirut to brief officials on the results of the Geneva summit, and the summit would then be held later in Damascus. On the significance of the Geneva summit, the Syrian official told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the U.S. Administration's renewal of its commitment -- openly and clearly -- and its intention to do all it can to achieve a just and comprehensive peace, is another reason for the optimism about achieving the desired peace. However the official said that this peace is still surrounded by caution, because Israel has not yet expressed its intentions regarding commitment to this peace. It is still maneuvering, claiming it does not understand the peace proposed by Syria. The official said: How can the United States, in particular its President, and the world as a whole understand and support what Syria has proposed with regard to peace, while Israel still has not understood the Syrian view? Does that not indicate that Israel is still acting stubbornly by refusing to accept a peace based on the known foundations endorsed by the resolutions of international legitimacy? The Syrian official pointed out that Syria, which adhered to full sovereignty over the Golan, also clearly adheres to a complete Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon. This applies also to Jerusalem, the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and the Palestinians' rights. This was stressed by President Hafiz al-Asad during his talks with President Clinton in Geneva. The summit reflected a full U.S. understanding of the Syrian view. [passage omitted]
