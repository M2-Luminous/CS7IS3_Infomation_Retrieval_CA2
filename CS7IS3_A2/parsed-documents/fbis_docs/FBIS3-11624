Yesterday, after Ortega concluded his testimony on the Genie case, Gallo proceeded to order a house arrest for the general as per a request by the victims father, Mr. Raymond Genie Penalba. Private Attorney Olivas explained that Gen. Ortega's military rank is not being withdrawn as a result of the precautionary measure, but his movements and duties as EPS [Sandinist People's Army] chief have been restricted. According to the attorney, "at this time he is not the chief." He added that should Ortega's endorsement as EPS chief be required, he would be disqualified from proceeding unless the documents had been dated prior to the date when the house arrest orders were issued. [sentence as received] Ortega was questioned yesterday for more than five hours by Military Prosecutor Lester Gallo, the defense lawyer, and the private attorney in order to learn what he really knows about the 28 October 1990 crime against Jean Paul Genie. The general and his bodyguards are charged with being the alleged perpetrators, accomplices, and accessories to the death of Genie since they shot him to death on the night of 28 October 1990 when he tried to pass them at the 8 km marker on the Masaya highway. Before proceeding to testify, Ortega presented a writ whereby he voluntarily disqualifies himself from duties directly linked to his military obligations as long as the Genie enquiries lasts. Mr. Olivas explained that with the general's disqualification, he, as head of the Armed Forces, will no longer have to decide if the case, in which he is one of the accused, is to be annulled or not. In this case, it will be up to the other members of the EPS General Command to decide if an annulment request will or will not be presented to the Supreme Court of Justice. During lengthy questioning, the EPS chief stated that on the day the incident occurred, after leaving the home of Colonel Lenin Cerna he went to the general command offices and later to his home where he remained all night. The general also stated that on that particular day his chief of security was Roberto Chacon and that they were not carrying any weapons. When asked by the private attorney if he was responsible for giving the orders during the incident, Ortega answered: no, that was the chief of security's responsibility. Based on Ortega's statements, if an indictment is filed against his bodyguards, Roberto Chacon would be the person most likely to be charged with Genie's death given that he would be held responsible for having ordered the shooting. Private Attorney Olivas questioned Ortega on the results of an investigation by the Venezuelan police, in response to which Ortega said that the report is technically inadequate and that they were not in Nicaragua long enough to arrive at serious conclusions. He also described the report as being "politicized." On several occasions, the private attorney also questioned the general on the possible destruction of evidence and obstruction of police investigations. The military officer stated that the commission established to investigate the case in no way refused to cooperate with the police in their investigation. With respect to the destruction of the weapons withdrawal and surrender log, Ortega answered that it was normal procedure to destroy the documents once they were no longer needed. After concluding his testimony, Ortega described the accusations as "a well orchestrated campaign by unimportant groups who have taken advantage of the Genie family's misfortunes to attack the EPS." Ortega's statements were refuted by Raymond Genie who said that the charges are against the general and not the EPS, and that he has never lent himself to be used in any campaign by any group whatsoever. Yesterday, Gen. Humberto Ortega presented a motion to Military Prosecutor Lester Gallo disqualifying himself from some of his military obligations "directly linked to military jurisdiction" as long as inquiries related to the Genie case continue.
