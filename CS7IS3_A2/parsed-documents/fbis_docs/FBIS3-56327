At the consultations both sides plan to discuss such issues as the prevention by joint efforts of dumping liquid nuclear waste in seas of the world ocean by Russia, cooperation in the struggle against pollution of air space, and in ecological protection of tracts of forests in Siberia which have essential influence of the planet's climate. The consultations are called upon to become the first step towards working out concrete programs of cooperation between Russia and Japan in the sphere of environmental protection. The forthcoming talks will be held for the first time since April 1991 when Japan and the former Soviet Union concluded an agreement on bilateral cooperation in the field of environmental protection. One of the major results of this cooperation is that Russia will stop dumping nuclear waste in the Sea of Japan, according to an official from the ecology department of the Russia Defense Ministry. So far Russia has had two tankers being used to store liquid nuclear waste which are now full to the capacity. Japan is reported to have offered its storage tanker to save the situation. Japan shows a particular interest in the settlement of this problem because Russia allegedly dumped 900 tons of liquid nuclear waste in the Sea of Japan in October 1993. This aroused a storm of protests in Japan which is making great efforts to protect environment. At that time Russia explained the incident by the absence of storage space for nuclear waste and financial difficulties.
