Weckbach-Mara report: "Vietnamese Smuggled to Germany -- Government Also Cashes In"] [Text] Gangs of Vietnamese smugglers are illegally smuggling asylum-seekers to Germany with the support of their government. According to information obtained by BILD AM SONNTAG, this is stated in alarming reports by police and intelligence services, which are available to the Federal Government. According to these reports, the state tourism administration (Vietnam National Administration of Tourism) gets about $6,500 for each Vietnamese, who is smuggled into Germany via Moscow, Prague, and the relatively unguarded border. So far, police authorities have registered 100 such smuggling organizations. To prepare the operations -- the reports say -- Hoang D. Tao of the Vietnamese Economics Ministry and Tran T. Ngi of the Vietnam National Administration of Tourism were in Germany. Obviously, they arranged with the Embassy in Bonn that practically any desired document be issued for asylum-seekers in Germany "for a fee." They learned what is needed from Vietnamese asylum-seekers, whom they questioned in reception camps. According to information obtained by BILD AM SONNTAG, the Vietnamese Labor Ministry is officially propagating a policy for the export of Vietnamese workers -- in the hope of getting foreign currency for the state coffers. Bernd Schmidbauer (Christian Democratic Union), the coordinators of the intelligence services in the chancellor's office, told BILD AM SONNTAG concerning the police findings: "We have to take these reports very seriously and we will do everything to prevent a new wave of smuggling operations."
