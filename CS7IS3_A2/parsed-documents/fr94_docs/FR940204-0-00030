FR940204-0-00030 FR940204-0-00016 335&hyph;3&hyph;4&hyph;.17(7)␣ The petroleum resin or asphalt emulsion dust suppressant required in sections 335&hyph;3&hyph;4&hyph;.17(5) and 335&hyph;3&hyph;4&hyph;.17(6) shall be applied at a dilution ratio of 20% for the initial three applications and 12% for subsequent applications. The suppressant shall be applied at the rate of 0.75 gal/yd2 of diluted solution. Other dust suppressants must be applied at an equivalent dilution ratio and application rate as determined by the Director. 335&hyph;3&hyph;4&hyph;.17(8)␣ The source shall maintain at its plant premises, and make available for inspection, records documenting each occasion on which paved areas are cleaned in accordance with sections 335&hyph;3&hyph;4&hyph;.17(2) and 335&hyph;3&hyph;4&hyph;.17(3), and any occasion on which such paved areas are not cleaned according to the required schedule, including any justification for failure to meet the required schedule, such as equipment breakdown or inclement weather conditions. The company shall also maintain, and make available for inspection, records documenting the frequency and amount of applications required by sections 335&hyph;3&hyph;4&hyph;.17(5) and 335&hyph;3&hyph;4&hyph;.17(6). These records shall be maintained for a minimum of two years following the date of the recorded information. 335&hyph;3&hyph;4&hyph;.17(9)␣ The source shall, within 30 days of approval of this section, notify the Department of a designated reclaim area on the plant property and a designated paved road at its premises to be used to transport molten slag from the basic oxygen furnace shop to the reclaim area. These designations shall not be changed without the written approval of the Director. These regulations have resulted in an estimated particulate emission reduction of 1400 tons/year and have allowed Etowah County to demonstrate measured attainment of the NAAQS for PM10. EPA has concluded that the revisions are sufficient to allow the area to continue to attain and maintain the NAAQS for PM10. The approval of these regulations is accompanied by the caveat that the levels of control specified for blast furnace casthouses and coke batteries do not, in the Agency's opinion, represent RACT and would not necessarily be sufficient for nonattainment areas to achieve compliance with the NAAQS. It should be noted that there are no sources affected by this action which receive stack height credits above Good Engineering Practice (GEP) or any other dispersion technique. Final Action EPA is approving the aforementioned revisions to the Alabama SIP. These revisions are consistent with EPA policy and guidance. This action is being taken without prior proposal because the changes are noncontroversial and EPA anticipates no significant comments on them. The public should be advised that this action will be effective April 5, 1994. However, if notice is received by March 7, 1994 that someone wishes to submit adverse or critical comments, this action will be withdrawn and two subsequent notices will be published before the effective date. One notice will withdraw the final action and another will begin a new rulemaking by announcing a proposal of the action and establishing a comment period. The Agency has reviewed this request for revision of the federally-approved SIP for conformance with the provisions of the 1990 Amendments enacted on November 15, 1990. The Agency has determined that this action conforms with those requirements irrespective of the fact that the submittal preceded the date of enactment. Under section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, 42 U.S.C. 7607 (b)(1), petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by April 5, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2) of the CAA, 42 U.S.C. 7607 (b)(2).)
