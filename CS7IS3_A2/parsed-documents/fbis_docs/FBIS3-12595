FBIS3-12595 "drnes042_l_94012" FBIS-NES-94-042 Document Type:Daily Report 3 Mar 1994 ISRAEL Police, Security Portfolio Offered to Refa'el Eytan TA0203184294 Jerusalem New Channel 2 Television Network in Hebrew 1800 GMT 2 Mar 94 TA0203184294 Jerusalem New Channel 2 Television Network Language: Hebrew Article Type:BFN [Excerpts] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has offered Refa'el Eytan the police and internal security portfolio. If Tzomet joins the government, it will receive the environment portfolio as well. In a meeting scheduled for tomorrow, Rabin and Peres will attempt to soften Meretz in anticipation of Tzomet's inclusion in the government. Our party affairs correspondent Yaron Deqel has the details: The Eytan-Rabin contacts began a long time ago. In today's meeting with Likud members, Eytan revealed nothing at all. A nocturnal meeting between the Tzomet chairman and the prime minister on 28 February gave birth to a written document detailing points of agreement between the two. Today the Tzomet Knesset members [MK's] received from Eytan -- each one individually -- information about the document. The Labor-Tzomet document stipulates that Refa'el Eytan will be police minister in charge of Israel's internal security. Tzomet will receive another portfolio -- the environment -- and if that happens, Minister Sarid may be appointed information minister. In the document, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin pledges not to harm the Jewish settlements in Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza and to permit 5,000 completed housing units to be occupied. Today the Tzomet chairman invited NRP [National Religious Party] leader Zvulun Hammer and apprised him of the possibility that Tzomet may join the coalition. [passage omitted] The NRP is not involved in the Tzomet-Labor political moves at this point. The prime minister informed Shim'on Peres of the details two days ago. The meeting was attended also by Histadrut official Giyora 'Eyni, who along with Tzomet MK Pini Badash had negotiated Tzomet's inclusion in the government. Tomorrow Rabin and Peres will meet with Meretz ministers. Ministers Shahal and Sarid are still in the dark about the prime minister's plan to give their portfolios away to Tzomet people. The move seems to be coming together.
