The revision of the rules governing the China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission (CIETAC) follows an increase in the number of disputes in recent years with the influx of foreign investment. Last year, CIETAC dealt with 504 cases, an increase of 88 percent over 1992. The surge in the number of disputes going to arbitration underscores the inadequacy of the current rules which were last amended in 1989. "Because of the increased number of cases, CIETAC needs to adopt clearer rules and bring its procedures into line with international practices," said Michael Moser, a resident partner at the Beijing office of international law firm Baker & McKenzie. Mr Moser is one of five foreign nationals appointed by the Chinese Government to CIETAC's panel of arbitrators. Mr Moser said that in recent years, more foreign companies had been involved in disputes compared with five years ago, when most cases involved mainland and Hong Kong firms. Moreover, the scale of the disputes being brought to CIETAC has increased and multi-million dollar sums are not uncommon. Five years ago, most disputes involved the sale or purchase of goods, but increasingly they involved joint ventures. To cope with the growing demand for arbitration, about 290 arbitrators will be appointed, a substantial increase from the current 90. Of the new line-up about 80 will be foreigners. Previously CIETAC's powers were ill-defined, but the new rules will substantially expand its role, empowering it to deal with international and foreign-related disputes and those between foreign companies operating in China. "When both parties in a dispute are foreign companies, CIETAC can accept the case under the new rule and if the dispute is between two Chinese companies, it can also be arbitrated if the issue in dispute is foreign-related. The old rules never made this clear," said Mr Moser. A second major change tightens up the CIETAC rules with regard to conflict of interest on the part of arbitrators. Under the old rules, either party could object if an arbitrator had a conflict of interest in a case. However, the old rules did not require voluntary disclosure of a conflict of interest. The new rules make it clear that an arbitrator appointed to handle a case must voluntarily disclose any conflict of interest and refuse to handle the case. "This is important to bring CIETAC up to international standards," said Mr Moser. A third area of change covers the power of arbitrators to collect evidence independently. The old rules stated that during the arbitration, the arbitrator could collect his own evidence but was not required to show it to the parties in the dispute. "Many people think this is unfair. So the new rules require that the arbitrator must show his independent evidence to the parties and allow them to comment on that," Mr Moser said. A fourth amendment puts a time limit on the giving of a ruling. "Five years ago when there were not so many cases, CIETAC arbitration was relatively speedy and most cases were resolved within a year. Now, because of the large number of disputes, cases can take two years or longer before a ruling is made. "The new rules require that the arbitrators must issue a decision within nine months from the date the arbitration tribunal is formed to guarantee cases are handled without delay," said Mr Moser.
