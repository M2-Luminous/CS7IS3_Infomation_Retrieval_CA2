If the national government does not check public spending, the Colombian economy could face serious difficulties in the months ahead. Measures adopted by the Bank of the Republic's board of directors guarantee that private spending will be checked substantially by controls placed on domestic credits and obstacles preventing businessmen from building up foreign debts. However, such measures will yield positive results only if the government does its part. This warning comes from Maria Mercedes Cuellar de Martinez, codirector of the Bank of the Republic, who said that if things go well, the economy will return to normal performance in a matter of months. In an interview with EL TIEMPO, the issuing institute official said that the restriction placed on credit is not as tight as it appears to be because growth in loans of slightly more than 30 percent a year is more than sufficient based on the anticipated growth of the economy. She said the measures would not be revised for the UPAC [constant purchasing power unit] system because there has been some price speculation in the construction sector due to the fact that it does not have sufficient capacity to meet the demand that has emerged in recent years. She also said the country cannot afford the luxury of maintaining an undervalued exchange rate, noting that an ideal devaluation would be between 12 and 13 percent rather than the 8 percent to which it has fallen in recent weeks. [Lopera] Why did credit shoot up and why did you take such a drastic measure to halt it? [Cuellar] By mid-February, credit had quieted down and was growing in keeping with the anticipated parameter of 35 percent annually. This was an acceptable rate given last year's growth of over 50 percent. During the last week of February and the early weeks of March, however, outlays of the financial system rose sharply. If things had continued as they were, we would have risen to a rate of over 60 percent or more for the year as a whole, an unmanageable figure. That is why, following a great deal of discussion and analysis of what was happening, the board met and decided to control domestic credit and place restraints on the possibility of contracting debts abroad. [Lopera] If businesses have gone so far into debt with international banks, why was credit growing so fast? Are these consumer loans? [Cuellar] Financial credit is not only growing, but is also being democratized, which is very good for the economy because it shows that the reform of the financial sector is yielding results. What is happening is that business has begun to redirect its efforts. Since the doors were opened last year for private debts abroad, the financial institutions had to go after other customers. There is one very important additional fact however,. Businesses had previously set up chains of credit for others and we did not know how much interest they were collecting. According to reports from the Superintendency of Securities, enormous profits were made in this way, but the action of that middleman has now been curtailed. [Lopera] Is it merely a problem of greater demand, or what is truly happening to the handling of the economy? [Cuellar] What is happening is that the economy is adjusting and growth in credits is part of that adjustment. The problem is that while it is true that it is a very good process, the readjustment is happening too quickly and has generated other phenomena that we have to control, such as fast growth in means of payment (money in the hands of the public and current accounts). Monetary and exchange control is more difficult in an open economy. [Lopera] What are these phenomena and how do you intend to attack them? [Cuellar] Four problems have emerged. On the one hand, there is strong inflationary pressure, and the Bank of the Republic had to intervene with credit. That is a political and economic decision. Second, problems with the rate of exchange persist, and in the board's judgment we must protect Colombian exporters' ability to compete. In addition, we have to begin to analyze why credit is growing so much: Is it because there is more income or because people are saving less? We now have evidence that the level of savings is dropping and that the financial system has more delinquent loans. Fourth, there is excessive spending, both public and private. In the case of the former, the government is now pledging to postpone more spending, and temporary controls placed on credit will slow down growth in private spending. In order for the measures to function properly and be temporary, we must reduce spending on these two fronts. [Lopera] But is that measure not very drastic and does it not cause many problems precisely at a time when the economy is being opened up? [Cuellar] By law, monetary authorities cannot restrict credit for over 120 days (four months), but I do not think the decision implies any great restriction of the ministry in view of what the economy needs for good growth. Furthermore, borrowing abroad was not completely stopped, as some thought. Postponing government spending is necessary because it rose 11 percent in real terms last year. It is estimated that this year, there could be a nominal increase of 37 percent in the Central Government alone. [Lopera] Finally, is the government cutting or postponing spending? What kind of an agreement did the minister of finance make with the board? [Cuellar] The government could end the year with a fiscal surplus of 500 billion pesos, equivalent to 1 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP). Without counting revenue from the cellular telephone and privatizations, the economy could end up balanced. An estimated 100 billion pesos of those resources would be obtained as a result of greater efficiency in collecting taxes, plus another 200 billion by cutting or postponing spending. The remaining 200 billion could be "saved" by certain problems anticipated for the months ahead. The first is the Medellin Metro. The second is the fact that since the Statute on Administrative Hiring has just been signed, the signing of a few contracts has been postponed. [Lopera] And what if the some 369 billion pesos in postponements and cuts announced at the beginning of the year cannot be made? [Cuellar] If the government does not make those cuts and postponements, the situation may become more complicated in the months ahead. Nevertheless, we must remember that it is easier to cut or postpone spending in the Central Government, which is not the case at the other two levels: the decentralized and local levels, which are more difficult to control. [Lopera] Do you think that with the check on foreign credit, we can truly avoid a revaluation of the peso? How much of a devaluation should be made in order not to discourage exporters? [Cuellar] The country cannot afford the luxury of maintaining an undervalued rate of exchange. While it is true that there is no problem in short-range terms, we cannot allow this to go on for long. The real rate of exchange is already slightly below 100 points and the devaluation is at about 8 percent. We hope that with reduced revenue in dollars and prepayments on the foreign debt that are being made, apart from greater control on the issuance of bonds in order to attract resources abroad, we will check the revaluation process. The ideal devaluation rate would be between 12 and 13 percent. [Lopera] It is argued that money laundering has risen greatly. Is that already reflected in international reserves? [Cuellar] I do not know where such stories start or how they can measure such money laundering. So far this year, international reserves have grown only by about $110 million. [Lopera] When credit was closed, it was said that the measure was an alarm for the financial system because there are more and more delinquent loans. What can you tell us? [Cuellar] That is true. Loans due and payable are growing at such an alarming rate that according to one FEDESARROLLO [Federation for Development] study, loans six months overdue had risen by 66 percent! The financial sector will have to be more careful in handling its portfolio in order to avoid a repeat of what the country went through in the early 1980's. [Lopera] The construction sector and particularly the savings and housing corporations are very unhappy with the restriction on credit because they are the ones who will feel the effects the most. Do you expect to adjust the rules to facilitate their operations? [Cuellar] What is happening in the construction sector is that it has been unable to meet the high demand. They do not have sufficient, which is generating some price speculation. Housing construction costs are among those that have risen the most since last year because neither the cementworks nor the brickyards are providing an adequate supply, and the producers of other types of goods are in the same situation. If they cannot meet demand, they can perfectly well sell less without putting upward pressure on prices for such goods.
