The U.S. plan of partnership for peace was adopted. For the countries that belonged to the former Warsaw Pact, among them Romania, this can be considered as a disappointing result. Romania can consider itself a country that deserves to have a more reassuring status for its own national security. Mr. Roman also said that the plan for partnership for peace represents a compromise between the direct request of the former socialist countries to be accepted in NATO and Russia's insistent demand not to have such an expansion of that organization.
