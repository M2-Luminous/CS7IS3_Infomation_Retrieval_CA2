Are Being Squandered''] [Text] Throughout the entire world there is a legal norm according to which those who pollute and destroy nature must pay. This is also stipulated by Ukraine's Law on Environmental Protection. Money exacted from enterprises, officials or just citizens is supposed to be used for the purposes of environmental protection. Seventy 70 percent of this money is to go for establishing nonbudgetary environmental funds under local soviets, and the rest of it is to go for establishing a state environmental fund. Recently the Ukrainian procurator general checked up on fulfillment of the requirements of legislation regarding the establishment, formation and use of these funds. Olga Kolinko, Ukrainian deputy procurator general, tells about the results of this inspection. Kolinko: Before talking about the environmental funds' receipt of funds and expenditure of them, it should be said that these funds do not yet exist in all oblasts. Often they are not established under rural soviets until after the procuracy has intervened. That was the case in Odessa, Kirovograd, Sumy, Cherkassy, Volynskiy and Zhitomir oblasts. Because of that, money collected for the violation of environmental-protection legislation and for the restitution of losses went into the accounts of the rayon finance departments or was left for the use of monitoring agencies. In 1991-1993 environmental funds in Ukraine failed to receive at least 100 million karbovantsy for this reason. In other places, enterprises' payments were credited to the rayon nonbudgetary fund. In Perevalskiy Rayon, Lugansk Oblast, such a fund has been established under the rayon state administration, rather than under the rayon soviet. Another example in which payments have been misdirected: The Lisichansk Petroleum Refinery, in transferring 5 million a year to the city soviet's nonbudgetary fund, does not pay a single kopeck to the Belogorovka, Maloryazantsevo or Volcheyarovka settlement soviets, on whose land it is located. However, they should be the first to be compensated by the refinery for its harmful impact on land, bodies of water and air. And very often people at the local level ``forget'' that payments for environmental pollution are supposed to go precisely to city and rural soviets. And the rayon and oblast soviets may receive only part of the payments for the use of natural resources. Gashin: But do the soviets always receive those payments? Kolinko: Unfortunately, no. Today a situation has developed in which payments are made only by conscientious--as strange as this may sound--polluters. The amount of those payments is supposed to be determined by the local state administration, and agencies of the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources are required to report allowable levels of discharge to them. However, the job of making the necessary calculations has been transferred to the enterprises themselves, and the agencies in question merely confirm the figures that are presented to them. Therefore, not wanting to pay, enterprises are in no hurry to make the calculations. To this day, allowable levels of emission and discharge have not been set for more than 100 enterprises in Odessa, Donetsk and Zhitomir oblasts alone. And in Kupyanskiy Rayon, Kharkov Oblast, for example, one in every three enterprises is not making payments because of the lack of any set allowable levels. The state also sustains considerable losses because of flaws in the recalculation of payments. Given today's inflation, delays play into the enterprises' hands, especially since local soviets and state administrations, and state administrations of the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources have not been exercising their powers to charge penalty fines. There have also been cases in which enterprises have simply been relieved of payments for environmental pollution. This has been done either by agencies that lack the power to do so, or without grounds for doing so. Gashin: And just how is the money that does actually end up in nonbudgetary environmental funds being utilized? Kolinko: That is where the greatest number of violations were uncovered. For example, last year the executive committee of the Zolochevskiy City Soviet in Lvov Oblast allocated 4 million karbovantsy to hold a gala concert during the celebration of the city's 500th anniversary. Altogether, in 1992 about 15 million karbovantsy was spent out of the nonbudgetary funds to build roads, landscape cemeteries, hold soccer tournaments and acquire equipment. In Kharkov monies from the fund were used to augment the social development fund and fund for the social protection of the population, and to provide loans, while in Yenakiyevo, Donetsk Oblast, such monies were used to improve the health of the employees of the city soviet executive committee, the tax inspectorate and the civil defense agency. The most violations of this sort occurred in Kirovograd, Lugansk, Volynskiy and Ivanovo-Frankovsk oblasts and the Crimea. The problem is that the statutes on nonbudgetary environmental funds that have been confirmed by nearly all the local soviets do not accord with existing legislation. This includes that part of the statutes that pertains to the funds' use. Gashin: That's at the local level. What about the ``center?'' Kolinko: No better. Local deputies ``copied'' those very statutes from the Statute on the State Nonbudgetary Environmental Protection Fund that the government confirmed last year--a statute that also codifies the unlawful expenditure of ``environmental'' money. Therefore, it is no surprise that over the course of 1991-1992 monies from the state fund were spent to index the wages of scientists working under contracts with the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources, to support the journal RODNAYA PRIRODA, and to make contributions to all manner of funds. One gets the impression that environmental-protection objectives are really going unnoticed. After all, last year only one-sixth of the republic fund was utilized. And this year, having 80 million karbovantsy and 20 million in hard currency at its disposal, the Cabinet of Ministers, based on a representation by the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources, has confirmed an estimate of only 28 million karbovantsy. That is not the end of the ``bad examples'' that the center has set for local governments. For example, Instead of transferring to the state fund 30 percent of the fines and sums paid in restitution for damages that had been collected, agencies of the Ukrainian Gosrybkhoz [approximate expansion: State Committee on the Fish Industry] spent more than 1 million to pay bonuses to their employees. Only at the procuracy's demand was the violation eliminated. Back last September the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources sent out a letter explaining that enterprises supposedly had to pay restitution for damages only when those damages were caused by the accidental discharge of pollutants. Following a protest by the Ukrainian procurator general, the unlawful explanation was withdrawn. However, for nearly a year the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources filed no claims for the restitution of damages. Gashin: Why has such a widespread practice of ignoring the law become possible? Kolinko: The soviets of people's deputies, local agencies of the state executive branch, and specially authorized state agencies, especially the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources, have made fundamental miscalculations and errors in setting their priorities for monitoring activities. There's the main reason. And the violations of the law really are widespread, and they exist in every oblast, without exception. If we do not get rid of them, they could cause substantial damage to the state's interests. Gashin: Has the procuracy already taken any measures? Kolinko: Based on the results of the inspection, 83 orders to eliminate violations have been issued, 63 protests have been lodged, and 147 claims have been filed for collection of a total of more than 80 million karbovantsy. Considering the seriousness of the situation, a representation has been made to the Cabinet of Ministers demanding the urgent elimination of violations. I. Plyushch, chairman of the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet, has been informed. The government has responded rapidly to our efforts, the Supreme Soviet Commission on the Environment and the Rational Utilization of Natural Resources has expressed its gratitude, and reports have been coming in from localities where efforts are also being made to rectify the situation.
