Addressing about 250 people at a public meeting in Nelspruit, Dr. Hartzenberg said he had great respect for Gen. Viljoen on military matters, but he said the fact that the general had offered his Freedom Front to the Inkatha Freedom Party and Bophuthatswana to take part in the election, ensured participation in the election and not support for a volkstaat [homeland]. Dr. Hartzenberg reiterated his view that participation would lend credibility to the election, and his party would therefore not take part in it. [Begin Hartzenberg recording, in Afrikaans -- in progress] In this case the constitutional principle -- that a nation must have the right to self-determination, to have the right to choose its own government -- is being cast aside completely. Here our people do not choose our government, other nations collectively choose a government for South Africa, and that constitutional principle becomes completely crushed. [end recording]
