Last year, the Shenzhen Government said a second runway should be built on reclaimed land. But yesterday, in his report to the Shenzhen Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), vice-chairman Liu Bo said many deputies thought one runway was enough and a second might not be urgently needed -- at least in the next 10 years. It would require a lot of money and too early a start would put a strain on the Government's capital for infrastructure projects, Mr Liu said. However, William Man, a Hong Kong deputy to the Shenzhen CPPCC Standing Committee, and chairman of Yuen Long District Board's Transport Advisory Committee, said construction for the second runway should go ahead. Because completion of Hong Kong's new airport before 1997 looked unlikely Shenzhen airport could be used to ease congestion, Mr Man said. He suggested building an international airport terminal at Shenzhen airport and connecting it with the Lok Ma Chau border checkpoint by a 25-kilometre enclosed highway. Hong Kong Customs could be transferred to the Shenzhen terminal and the problem of transport between Hong Kong and the areas beyond the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone would be solved.
