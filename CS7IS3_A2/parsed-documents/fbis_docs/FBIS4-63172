Zhirinovskiy told lawmakers that his party "can no longer tolerate lies and slander in the press". He added that in retaliation he had designed "a complex of measures", but did not elaborate. The scandal erupted after Nikolay Svanidze, an anchorman of the "Podrobnosti" (details) news programme of the Russian TV announced that Zhirinovskiy is paying his party members. Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin told lawmakers that his deputy Mikhail Mityukov had sent a message to Oleg Poptsov, head of the Russian TV, demanding to sack Svanidze. However, the anchorman told TASS on Friday that he is ready to submit proofs of his statements in court. Svanidze denounced Zhirinovskiy's demands to sack him until a court ruling is passed. "I could have with the same success demanded to keep the LDPR leader from work in Duma", he said and added that he is ready to invite Zhirinovskiy to clarify the scandal in the "Podrobnosti" programme.
