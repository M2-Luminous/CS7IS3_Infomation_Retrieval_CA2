He also said that the peace process was over and laid the entire blame for this on Georgia. On March 10, the Georgian parliament charged Abkhazia's Council of Ministers with the task of performing the Abkhazian parliament's functions pending early parliamentary elections, and granted the Council of Ministers the status of a temporarily discharged body. The Georgian parliament's resolution says that all legal acts passed by the Abkhazian separatists shall be considered invalid.
