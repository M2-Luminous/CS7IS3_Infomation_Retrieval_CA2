It is also of great significance to the expansion of the Sino-Singaporean ties, he said, adding that "China is ready to cooperate with Singapore and make the project a success." Qiao, chairman of the Standing Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress (NPC), made these remarks during a meeting with Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong and Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew here this morning. China and Singapore have enjoyed long-term traditional friendship and are linked with deep-rooted cultural origins, Qiao said. This provides favorable conditions for the two countries to increase their cooperation. In recent years, the bilateral ties of friendship in every field have gained smooth development, with trade increasing steadily and mutual investments expanding. Recalling his trip to Singapore last July, Qiao said, "the visit was short, but we learned a lot." The delegation was impressed by Singapore's successful experience in rapidly developing its economy with capital and technology imported from the West, while retaining its own oriental cultural features, Qiao said. During today's meeting, Qiao briefed the guests on China's economic development and economic legislation. Prime Minister Goh told Qiao that he came here to participate in the signing of the agreement on the joint development of Suzhou Industrial Park and was very pleased to meet Qiao again. Though Singapore is to jointly develop with China the Suzhou Industrial Park, its investment is not limited to Suzhou alone, Goh said. Citing its fruitful economic cooperation with China's Shandong Province, Goh said Singapore would also like to have active cooperation with other parts of China. He also expressed his appreciation of China's rapid economic growth. Earlier, Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing met with Goh. Referring to it as a major event in Sino-Singaporean relations, Li said that the agreement on the joint development of Suzhou Industrial Park bears significance even to China's cooperation with other countries. The park is open to the world and welcomes investors from other countries to join in the project, Li noted. With the support from the governments and leaders of the two countries, Singapore is confident in the project's success, Goh said. Goh is scheduled to leave here for home this afternoon.
