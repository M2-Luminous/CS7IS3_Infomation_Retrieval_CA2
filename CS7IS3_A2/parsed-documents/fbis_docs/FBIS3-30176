The move has drawn threats of a political backlash from Australia's large Greek community which objects to the use of the name, Macedonia, also the name of a Greek province. A protest rally by the Greek community in Melbourne yesterday attracted a crowd of about 60,000. Senior Liberal Party figures joined the rally, condemning the government's recognition of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- speeches described by Senator Evans as the worst kind of dangerous political opportunism. Sen. Evans has told his caucus colleagues the government will always conduct Australia's foreign policy to advance and protect Australia's national interests. He also told them the government will govern for all Australians, not just those who shout or threaten the lives, he said.
