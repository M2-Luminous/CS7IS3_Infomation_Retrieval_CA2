FR940413-0-00023 FR940413-0-00005 In order to avoid this possibility, Commission orders approving each of the current non-proprietary XM programs have required participating market professionals to execute agreements whereby they subordinate their XM-related claims to customer claims based on non-XM positions in the event of the clearing member's bankruptcy. The net equity claims of non-XM customers thus have been accorded priority over the net equity claims of XM customers. The relevant Commission orders approving the various cross-margin programs and various subordination agreements, as prescribed by relevant exchange rules, among market professionals, their clearing members and the clearing organizations involved, established the previous bankruptcy distribution framework. In the case of the bankruptcy of a clearing member participating in a non-proprietary XM program, the trustee would marshal all of the assets that were available to satisfy customer claims as set forth in Commission Rule 190.08 (whether such funds derived from XM customers, non-XM customers or any other available source and irrespective of whether the shortfall in the segregated funds accounts were attributable to XM or non-XM customers). The trustee would determine if there were sufficient funds to satisfy in full the net equity claims of all non-XM customers cleared by the clearing member. If all such net equity claims of non-XM customers could be satisfied in full, the trustee would make the appropriate distributions and market professionals who participated in an XM program would receive any remaining funds to be shared on a pro rata basis. If there were not sufficient funds to satisfy non-XM net equity claims in full, the trustee would distribute to the non-XM customers only whatever funds were available on a pro rata basis and market professionals participating in the XM program would receive nothing. The result of the market professionals' subordination required by the Commission orders has been that the market professionals' XM-related assets would be included within the pool of customer funds available to meet the claims of the clearing member's non-XM customers. 7 Upon satisfaction of these ``regular'' customer claims, any excess customer property would be distributed to the various market professionals cleared by the defaulting member based upon their XM-related claims consistent with the pro rata distribution scheme of the Bankruptcy Code and part 190 of the Commission's rules. Thus, non-XM customers would never receive less than they would have received in the absence of an XM program. 8 7 Market professionals also would be included within this group of customers to the extent they had non-XM related customer claims. 8 Where there is a shortfall in the amount of funds in segregation attributable to non-XM customers and there are remaining funds in segregation attributable to XM customers, non-XM customers could achieve a greater distribution than if there were no XM program and subordination agreement. IV. New Bankruptcy Distribution in the Context of XM Programs When the Commission adopted its part 190 bankruptcy rules, 9 it included an appendix intended to facilitate a trustee's operation of the estate of a bankrupt commodity broker. This appendix includes a schedule of trustee's duties, forms concerning customer instructions for return of non-cash property and transfer of hedge contracts, and a proof of claim form. The Commission has now adopted a new appendix to part 190 to provide further guidance to a trustee of a bankrupt FCM with respect to the appropriate distribution of property where the FCM had been a participant in an XM program that includes non-proprietary positions. As described above, such programs are now numerous and include non-proprietary positions in certain instances and where they do so, participating market professionals have been required by Commission order, among other things, to execute agreements whereby they subordinate their XM-related claims to the claims of non-XM customers in the event of bankruptcy in all instances. 9 48 FR 8716 (March 1, 1983). The new bankruptcy appendix will continue the concept of subordination for purposes of assuring treatment of the market professionals' securities included in an XM account as part of the commodity estate, but will modify the method for distribution of property of a bankrupt FCM which had participated in an XM program that includes non-proprietary positions such that the subordination to futures customers in the event of bankruptcy is more limited. However, the Commission orders and the clearing organization rules will continue to require each market professional participating in an XM program to agree that all of his XM assets carried by his clearing member, including securities options, will not be deemed to be ``customer property'' under SIPA and will be treated pursuant to the commodity broker liquidation provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. Thus, the market professional will remain removed from the class of customers whose claims will be disposed of pursuant to SIPA 10 and, accordingly, the market professional's XM assets carried by a securities broker-dealer would continue to be considered as other than SIPA customer property, since such property is defined to include only cash or securities held for the account of a SIPA customer. 11 10 Specifically, SIPA excludes a person from the definition of a SIPA customer ``to the extent that such person has a claim for cash or securities which by contract, agreement, or understanding, or by operation of law *␣*␣* is subordinated to the claims of any or all creditors of the debtor␣*␣*␣*.'' 15 U.S.C. 78 lll (2)(B)(1988). 11 15 U.S.C. 78 lll (4); Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34&hyph;29991, 56 FR 61458 (December 3, 1991); Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34&hyph;30041, 56 FR 64824 (December 12, 1991).
