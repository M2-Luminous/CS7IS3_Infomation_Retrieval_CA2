He said that for the Home Front Command it does not matter where the missiles are launched, whether from Iran, Syria, or Iraq. However, if they are launched in Iran it poses much more complex operational problems. The commander made the remarks to our Army affairs correspondent Karmela Menashe. The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] today fired a 155 mm gun into a concrete wall as part of a series of tests aimed at developing defenses for settlements along the confrontation lines to enable them to withstand a direct hit by a shell.
