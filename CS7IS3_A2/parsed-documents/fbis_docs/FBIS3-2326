The proposed penalties include life imprisonment or a death sentence for "snake heads," as the mercenaries engaged in the traffic have been dubbed. The members of the standing committee of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC) were today deliberating a draft supplementary decision on the punishment of organizers of illegal emigration and border crossing. The lawmakers said the draft decision is ready to be promulgated in the current fifth session of the NPC Standing Committee. Such a decision is expected to help the country in combating illegal emigration and border crossing, to maintain border order and protect the legitimate rights of Overseas Chinese, according to the lawmakers. The draft said that snake-heads could face life imprisonment or the death penalty if they committed other serious crimes against emigrants they organized. Lin Liyun, member of the NPC Standing Committee, said that some snake-heads become involved in crimes of violence, murder, drug trafficking and selling human beings. "Life of overseas Chinese are disturbed by the crimes and their legitimate rights infringed upon because of the influence," Lin said. Member of the NPC Standing Committee Cai Cheng said the decision was necessary to curb the illegal border crossing and illegal emigration along China's vast border areas, and is conducive to stability in border areas and the nation's security.
