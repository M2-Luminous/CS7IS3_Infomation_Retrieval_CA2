An inappropriate complaint. If the Basic Law had wanted the person with more adherents among the people to become head of state, it would have been written there: The president is elected by the people. However, our constitution entrusted a representative body with the election, the Federal Assembly. If the German state wants to introduce the election of the president by the people, it can do so anytime. Those who advocate it do not want "a new republic" for that reason alone, as the chancellor thinks. However, what the Basic Law determines today is valid today. This should also be the guideline for criticism from a party whose candidate was defeated in the presidential election. Losing hurts. How hard it was for Rau to get over the defeat in the vote is indicated by his reproach that part of the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] was not interested in electing the right candidate. That can only mean that he, Rau, is the right candidate. Apparently, such propaganda for oneself is part of the last ramifications of the first presidential election campaign that our state went through. The parties struggled; but the candidates also struggled, as if the last vote had to be pressed out of the reservoir of voters in the countries. In these weeks, what the president's office requires and what has to be demanded of its bearer is being rehashed everywhere in a conformist way. However, one does not hear anywhere what would have to be said above all after the experiences of the year 1984 and again since last autumn: The office of president is nothing that one may strive for like a Bundestag mandate, a ministerial office, or a state secretary's post. It is not suited to be the subject of a career plan. Therefore, it cannot be found in books that are entitled "How To Work One's Way Up" or "The Road to the Top." Readiness is the only thing that someone whom a party wants to be its candidate should have. He is to wait patiently until the election act in the Federal Assembly; every word in public that he does not speak in this time is gold, for, afterward, the person who has been elected will not be intoxicated with his victory and the person who has not been elected will not be depressed.
