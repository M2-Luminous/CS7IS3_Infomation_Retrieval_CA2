FR941004-1-00077 FR941004-1-00018 We have also proposed a procedure for allowing additional Indian tribes to become eligible in FY 1996&hyph;1998. (See §1357.50(d)) 9. Administrative Costs We have proposed what we believe is a definition of administrative costs that will be easy for States to administer. (See §1357.32(g)) 10. Technical, Editorial, and Conforming Changes Because 45 CFR Parts 1355, 1356, and 1357 have not been amended recently, we are taking advantage of this opportunity to make technical, editorial, and conforming changes. We welcome comments on all aspects of the NPRM, particularly on the scope of the plan and the level of effort and usefulness of the proposed planning process. In the regulatory text, we specify which sections are applicable to States and which are applicable to Indian tribes. In those sections that apply to both States and Tribes, we use general language such as ``The CFSP must include_'' to indicate that all grantees must meet this provision. B. Section-by-Section Discussion We are proposing major amendments in 45 CFR part 1357 and primarily technical and editorial changes in 45 CFR parts 1355 and 1356. The most important change is found in 45 CFR 1357.15, comprehensive child and family services plan requirements, in which we propose a planning process leading to the development of a consolidated five-year plan for the two Federal child and family services programs under subparts 1 and 2 of title IV&hyph;B. Our discussion of these proposed amendments will follow in numerical order, beginning with a change in the title of subchapter G of chapter XIII of title 45 of the Code of Federal Regulations. In the title, we propose to delete the term ``child welfare'' and replace it with the term ``child and family services'' to reflect the change in the name of title IV&hyph;B of the Social Security Act made by Pub. L. 103&hyph;66. 1. Part 1355_General Section 1355.10␣Scope This part contains general requirements applicable to both title IV&hyph;B and title IV&hyph;E of the Social Security Act. We are proposing to clarify in §1355.10 that the title IV&hyph;B requirements also are applicable to Indian tribes unless otherwise specified. Section 1355.20␣Definitions In §1355.20, we are proposing to make technical changes in four definitions and to add one new definition. The terms ``ACYF'' and ``Commissioner'' are revised to reflect a change in name and organizational structure which combined two of the Department's operating divisions (Family Support Administration and Office of Human Development Services) into the Administration for Children and Families in 1991. The term ``State'' is revised to delete an outdated cross-reference to two sections in 45 CFR part 1356 and to clarify which jurisdictions are eligible for funding under titles IV&hyph;B and IV&hyph;E. The term ``State agency'' is revised to reflect the requirement in sections 422 and 471 of the Social Security Act that the State title IV&hyph;B, title IV&hyph;E, and title XX (social services block grant) programs must be administered by the same State agency. An exception to this requirement for States with certain administrative structures in place on December 1, 1974, is permitted by section 103(d) of Pub. L. 96&hyph;272 and is included in the definition. Because the Independent Living Program (ILP) is now permanently authorized under section 477 of the Social Security Act and is a part of the State's child and family services continuum, we have added a definition of the ILP in this section. Section 1355.21␣State Plan Requirements for Titles IV&hyph;B and IV&hyph;E We are proposing a conforming amendment in §1355.21(c) to clarify that the State and the Indian tribe must make the five-year Child and Family Services Plan and the Annual Progress and Services Reports available for public review and inspection. The requirement that the State title IV&hyph;E plan also be available is a current requirement in §1355.21(c). Section 1355.25␣Principles of Child and Family Services A new §1355.25, Principles of child and family services, is proposed to be added. These general principles are provided as guidance to States and Indian tribes as they develop and operate child and family services and move towards a more coordinated service delivery system for children and families. These are the principles most often identified by practitioners and others as helping to ensure responsive and effective services, particularly for family support and preservation services.
