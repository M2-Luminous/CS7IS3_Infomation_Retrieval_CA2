An aide to UNPROFOR chief General Jean Cot said the March 7 date, given on Sunday by the UN chief of peacekeeping operations, Kofi Annan, "only relates to the arrival of the UN first troops" from the Nordic Battalion at the airport. A full handover of the airport in northeastern Bosnia to the UN peacekeepers "is not expected until March 17, and the first flight on March 18 at the earliest," he said. "We have not made this timetable public, as it is still not final," he continued. "There could be further delays for a number of reasons, for example if we run into difficulties getting supplies. If that happens, public opinion will be quick to complain about the lack of political will." Earlier Tuesday, General Cot told reporters that Annan "should speak to me before making statements. Give us a bit of time." The strategic Tuzla airport, which lies in a Moslem-led Bosnian enclave, has been closed since May 1992 by Serb shelling. The Nordic Battalion of 1,000 Swedish and Danish troops has been working for three months on a plan to reopen the airport.
