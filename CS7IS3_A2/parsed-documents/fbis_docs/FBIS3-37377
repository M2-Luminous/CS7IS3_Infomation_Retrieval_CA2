There are no eminent politicians among its organisers. It claims to represent the interests of the middle class. But this is now done by practically all the political organisations of Russia. However, representatives of the leadership of the Democratic Party of Russia, attending the congress as observers, believe that the party is being set up for Yuriy Luzhkov, the mayor of Moscow. In their opinion, this is borne out, among other things, by the presence of representatives from the Moscow and regional elites (no journalists were allowed to the congress hall). Indicative also is the fact that the congress was opened by a message of greetings from the mayor of Moscow. In the opinion of representatives of the Democratic Party of Russia Yuriy Luzhkov is thereby making his first preparations for the next presidential elections. Asked by ITAR-TASS, assistant head of the Russian president's administration Igor Kharichev, who was invited to the congress as guest, said he had wary feeling about the new party. The proceedings of the congress show that the delegates are disinterested in such documents as procedural rules or party charter. The selfsame representatives of the Democratic Party of Russia believe that regional businessmen have gathered in Moscow to settle their financial problems and that they are not very much inclined to set up a new party. Judging by the scope of the congress's organisation, the initiators of the party obviously have much money at their disposal. Quite staggering is the huge number of men from the party's security service. Everybody is searched with the help of metal-detectors. The cultural centre of the RIA-NOVISTI news agency, where the congress is being held, is full of security guards equipped with walkie-talkies. None of the party's organisers were able to explain why such a strict police regime was needed at a congress of a political party.
