This means that [Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf] Denktas continues to reject the final U.N. paper on the confidence building measures of March 21, which has been described by the U.N. Secretary-General as fair and balanced and as offering advantages to both sides. Clark's visit was clearly the result of the intense pressure exerted by Washington and London to resolve the deadlock and so avert the adoption of the U.N. Secretary-General's report which blames the "lack of political will" by the Turkish side for the failure of the talks. Despite the clearcut conclusion of Butrus Butrus-Ghali the British and the Americans continue to credit Denktas with the will to reach an agreement. The point is, what kind of agreement? Clearly not the one hammered out by the U.N. officials as a compromise, which no matter how painful and controversial, has been accepted as is by President Glavkos Kliridhis as yet another sacrifice by the Greek Cypriot side for the sake of reaching an agreement as long last. The Turkish side, however, is clearly not satisfied with the occupation of north Cyprus, the expulsion of the Greek Cypriot population through a major ethnic cleansing operation, and the illegal usurpation of the refugees' properties. It has the effrontery not only to mock the Security Council by refusing to implement any of its numerous resolutions on Cyprus, but insists in effect on the legitimisation of its criminal actions. The tragedy of the Cyprus story is that the major powers, particularly the United States, acting on the basis of its own global interests, and the once-upon-a-time imperial Britain, which is only too happy to see the continuation of the island's division, even through it is a guarantor of its territorial integrity and independence, both refuse to sanction any action that would force Turkey to behave. British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd declared this week that there was a chance of "decisive progress," adding that the stone has been pushed almost to the top of the mountain and should not be allowed to roll down again. Would this were truly so. Regretfully, as President Kliridhis pointed out yesterday, the differences, resulting from the Turkish rejection of the U.N. document are substantial, and "becoming worse," as a result of the insatiable appetite of the Turkish side to ask for more and more, which keeps growing as long as the Security Council continues to take no action to see that its resolutions do not remain hollow words. As Kliridhis pointed out in connection with Hurd's assessment that agreement was so close, why doesn't the British minister then persuade Denktas to accept the "fair and balanced" March 21 document? It remains to be seen now whether the Security Council will, finally, take a stand, by closing the long-drawn-out efforts by successive secretary-generals of the U.N., which have led nowhere due to the lack of political will by the Turkish side, and at long last demand that Turkey implements the U.N. resolutions on Cyprus without further delay. If the Council succumbs to Anglo-American pressure, as it has been doing ever since the 1974 invasion, and once more chooses to do nothing concrete, ignoring Butrus-Ghali's call for the adoption of alternative ways, Cyprus will be left with no option but to rethink its strategy and tactics which have so far been based solely on the clearly pointless U.N.-sponsored negotiation.
