FBIS4-66262 "jpcar032___94017" JPRS-CAR-94-032 JPRS China 19 March 1994 SOCIAL Statistical Report on 1993 Educational Development Statistical Report on 1993 Educational Development 94CM0258A Beijing ZHONGGUO JIAOYU BAO in Chinese 19 Mar 94 p 3 94CM0258A Beijing ZHONGGUO JIAOYU BAO Chinese CSO [Statistical Communique on 1993 Educational Development] [Text] In 1993, the CPC Central Committee and the State Council promulgated the "Outline Program for the Reform and Development of Education in China," a blueprint for building a socialist education system with Chinese characteristics. Then, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress approved the "Teachers' Law of the People's Republic China," which put the construction of China's teacher contingent under the legal system. Later, the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Committee adopted the "Decision on Some Issues Concerning the Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic Structure," which further outlined the direction of our educational reform and development. The promulgation and implementation of the above principle, policy, and law have instilled new vitality into our education work and effectively propelled the development of education projects in all fields and at all levels. At the same time, some questions have also appeared and deserve our attention. Basic Education 1. Steady progress in popularizing nine-year compulsory education. Since the "Compulsory Education Law of the People's Republic of China" was promulgated in 1986, elementary education has been popularized in most parts of the country. In big cities and some economically developed areas, efforts are being made to popularize junior high school education. To further promote the nine-year compulsory education throughout the country, the State Education Commission has instituted a "two basic" (basically popularizing the nine-year compulsory education and basically wiping out illiteracy among middle-aged and young people) appraisal system. Up to now, 26 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities have conducted such "two basic" appraisals covering some 350 counties (cities and districts). Meanwhile, continued efforts have been made to popularize compulsory education at the elementary school level. In 1993, our country had 697,000 elementary schools. Students admitted to the schools that year numbered 23,534,800, up by 1,702,800 from the preceding year. The total enrollment was 124,212,400 million, surpassing the preceding year by 2,199,600 million. Of the school-age children around the country, 97.7 percent were attending schools (covering different school ages and school systems in various localities). This was 0.5 percentage points higher than the preceding year. The percentage of elementary school graduates attending junior high schools reached 81.8 percent, up 2.1 percentage points compared with the preceding year. Compulsory education at the junior high school level also showed a certain degree of development. In 1993, there were 68,415 regular junior high schools across the country. The number of new students enrolled that year was 14,789,400 million, surpassing the preceding year by 139,300. The junior high schools had a total enrollment of 40,822,000 million, up by 162,900 compared with the preceding year. In addition, there were 1,582 vocational junior high schools. New students enrolled in 1993 numbered 266,500, and the total enrollment was 562,400, roughly the same as a year ago. The gross rate of children attending junior high schools was 73 percent, or 1.2 percentage points higher than the preceding year. The percentage of junior high school graduates going to senior high schools was 44.1 percent, an increase of 9.7 percentage points above the preceding year's record. 2. Regular senior high school education continued to decline in scale. In 1993, our country had 14,380 regular senior high schools, less than the preceding year's number by 470. New students admitted to these schools totaled 2,283,400 million, down by 63,900 compared with the preceding year. The total enrollment was 6,569,100 million, showing a drop of 479,800 from the preceding year. 3. Relatively big progress in developing special and preschool education. In 1993, our country had 1,123 special education schools, 96 more than the preceding year. New students admitted to the special education schools in 1993 reached 33,500, surpassing the preceding year by 4,000. The students studying in these schools totaled 168,600, up by 39,100 over the preceding year. There were 165,200 kindergarten across the country with a total enrollment of 25,525,400 million. The enrollment was 1,243,300 million more than the preceding year's record. 4. Increased number and better quality of teachers of high and elementary schools. In 1993, there were 3.1668 teachers in the regular high schools (including junior and senior high schools) throughout the country, 20,700 more than the preceding year. Elementary school teachers totaled 5,551,800 million, or 25,300 more than the preceding year. Among high and elementary school teachers, the percentage of those with qualified educational backgrounds was on the rise. Among senior high school teachers, the percentage was 51.1 percent, or two percentage points higher than the preceding year. In the case of junior high school teachers, it was 59.5 percent, or 3.9 percentage points higher than the preceding year. As for elementary school teachers, it was 84.7 percent, or two percentage points higher than the preceding year. With regard to the percentage of teachers with professional teaching backgrounds, it was as high as 90 percent for senior high school teachers, surpassing the preceding year by four percentage points. The percentage was 81 percent for junior high school teachers, three percentage points higher than the preceding year, and 83 percent for elementary school teachers, two percentage points higher than the preceding year. The percentages of high-grade and first-rate teachers in senior and junior high schools and elementary schools were 42.18, 18.71, and 11.88 percent respectively. Compared with the preceding year, these were up, respectively, by 3, 1.6, and 1.5 percentage points. 5. Arduous task in popularizing junior high education. On the whole, since the Decision on the Reform of the Educational System was promulgated in 1985, our country's basic education has developed well, and relatively big progress has been made in popularizing the nine-year compulsory education. Now, the percentage of elementary school-age children attending schools has increased each year, and elementary education has been basically popularized in most localities. However, development of junior high school education is still at a slow pace. For many years, the number of students at junior high schools has remained at the same level--around 40 million. To meet the target of 55 million junior high school students by the end of this century, we must gear up our efforts. In 1993, the gross rate of students attending junior high schools was only 73 percent, well below the target rate. Moreover, the dropout rate in junior high schools continued to rise in the last two years--5.8 percent in 1992 and 7.1 percent in 1993. Among junior high school teachers, only 59.5 percent had qualified educational backgrounds, while high-grade and first-rate teachers accounted for only 18.7 percent, less than one-half of the percentage in senior high schools. Because of this, strengthening junior high education and striving to increase the rate of students attending junior high schools should be considered a key to achieving the "two basic" objectives in developing education. 6. Inadequate funds and other conditions for developing elementary and high schools. The last few years have witnessed an acute shortage of funds for developing education. The part of public funds used in running schools has declined each year. Particular noteworthy is that, in many provinces and autonomous regions, elementary and high schools are unable to pay their teachers on time. With regard to the renovation and construction of school buildings, elementary and high schools have by and large met the target of "one no and two have" (no school has a dilapidated building; every grade has a classroom, and every student has a desk and a chair) in recent years, thanks to the efforts made to raise funds from various sources to meet the schools' needs. In 1993, the percentage of dilapidated buildings in elementary and high schools nationwide showed a slight decline to 1.96 percent from the preceding year's 1.97 percent. However, the percentage in rural areas began to pick up--it was 2.19 percent in 1992 but rose to 2.27 percent in 1993. Vocational and Technical Education 1. Considerable progress of secondary vocational and technical education. Under the impact of the State Council's "Resolution on Vigorous Development of Vocational and Technical Education," education in this field has shown considerable development. In 1993, there were 16,842 vocational and technical schools of various kinds equivalent to the level of senior high schools. This number was 280 more than the preceding year. A total of 3.1612 million students were admitted to these schools in 1993, surpassing the preceding year's record by 725,600. The total enrollment reached 7.623 million, showing an increase of 795,000 over the preceding year. The proportion of such students to the total number of students at the senior high school level reached 53 percent as against 49 percent in 1992, meeting ahead of schedule the target set in the above-mentioned resolution. 2. Rapid development of ordinary specialized secondary schools In 1993, the number of ordinary specialized secondary schools reached 3,964, an increase of 61 compared with the preceding year. The number of students admitted to these schools that year was 1.1489 million, an increase of 269,700, or 30.7 percent, over the preceding year. The schools had a total of 2,820,300 students. This was 411,900 more than the preceding year's figure. Changes are noted in the specialties chosen by new students. Numbers of students of finance and economics, physical education, and arts were on the rise, while there was a downward trend of students choosing engineering as their major. Among the new students, those majoring in finance and economics increased sharply. Of the above-mentioned 269,700 additional new students, 95,000 were finance and economics majors, accounting for 35 percent. 3. Considerable progress in developing vocational secondary schools In 1993, our country had 8,430 vocational senior high schools, 136 more than the preceding year. New students admitted to these schools numbered 1,348,800, an increase of 208,800 over the preceding year, while the total enrollment was 3,063,500 million, up by 199,700. 4. Skilled worker training school took in more students In 1993, the number of schools for training skilled workers reached 4,477, an increase of 85 from the preceding year. New students admitted to these schools numbered 663,500, up by 61,700 compared with the preceding year. The total number of students was 1.739 million, surpassing the preceding year by 183,000. Regular Higher Education 1. A sharp increase in students attending regular institutions of higher education. Students admitted to regular institutions of higher education continued to increase in the past two years, the magnitude of increase each year being more than 20 percent. In 1993, the number of regular institutions of higher education reached 1,065, up by 12 over the preceding year. Students admitted to regular and special colleges numbered 924,000, surpassing the preceding year by 170,000 or an increase of 22.5 percent. The total number of students was 2.5355 million, up by 351,100, or 16.1 percent over the preceding year. Students admitted to graduate schools totaled 42,100, surpassing the preceding year by 8,700 or 26 percent. Of the new students, 6,200 were studying for doctorate, and 35,700 for the master's degree. Graduate school students totaled 106,800, showing an increase of 12,600, or 13.4 percent, compared with the preceding year. They included 17,600 students studying for doctorate and 88,800 for the master's degree. 2. A further increase in students under the entrusted training program and students paying their own tuition. While the state mandatory plan remained stable with respect to enrollment of students, there was a rapid increase in the students enrolled under the state regulatory plan. Of the new students admitted to institutions of higher education, 561,000, or 60.7 percent, came under the state mandatory plan. This was 12.26 percentage points less than the preceding year. Those under the entrusted training program and those paying their own tuition totaled 360,200. They accounted for 39 percent of the new students, up 12.31 percentage points over the preceding year. Of the total number of students, 1,926,500, or 75.98 percent, were under the state mandatory plan, down by 9.09 percentage points compared with the preceding year, and 603,700, or 23.81 percent, were students under the entrusted training program or were tuition-paying students, up by 9.64 percentage points. 3. Changes in proportions of students at different levels and of different majors. With the increase in the students admitted to institutions of higher education, there was a change in the proportions of graduate students, undergraduates, and students studying in regular and special colleges. Newly enrolled graduate students and undergraduates were in the ratio of 1:25.9 as against 1:25.4 in the preceding year. Of the newly enrolled undergraduates, the ratio of students studying in regular colleges to those in special colleges increased to 1:1.16 from the preceding year's 1:1.39. The change in the majors of newly enrolled students was that there were more students majoring in liberal arts, finance and economics, politics and law, physical education, and various fields of arts. The percentage of new students majoring in finance and economics increased by 3.16 percentage points over the preceding year. A downward trend is noted in the percentage of students majoring in science and engineering. 4. Inadequate facilities for operation of institutes of higher education. With the rapid development of higher education, some noteworthy problems have cropped up: The imbalance between investment and development became further intensified. The problem of inadequate facilities for conducting higher education was even more pronounced than before. A further decline is noted in both the students' living conditions and the schools' teaching facilities. An increased number of schools had inadequate facilities to meet the requirements for conducting higher education. In regular institutions of higher education, the average campus building space per student dropped to 42.4 square meters from the preceding year's 46.7 square meters. Some schools had insufficient dormitory space for their students. The average dormitory space per student in regular institutions of higher education declined to 6.2 square meters from 7.2 square meters in the preceding year. Another problem was that some schools were seriously short of laboratory equipment for education and research. Adult Education 1. Rapid development of certificate-awarding higher education for adults. After several years' curtailment of its scale, certificate-awarding higher education for adults began to show fast development in 1992. In 1993, there were 1,183 institutions of higher education for adults, a drop of 15 from the number in the preceding year. In addition, 796 regular institutions of higher education had correspondence courses and night schools for adults. New students enrolled in adult institutions and schools (including radio and TV universities, correspondence schools, and night universities) totaled 862,700, an increase of 271,000, or 45.8 percent, over the preceding year. Total number of adult students was 1,862,900 (including 131,000 students of radio and TV universities and correspondence courses), an increase of 384,200. Of all institutions of higher education for adults, management cadre colleges and radio and TV universities showed the fastest increase in enrollment. The new students admitted to these two categories of schools increased from 30,000 and 145,800 in 1992 to 59,600 and 213,300 in 1993, up 98.7 and 46.3 percent respectively. 2. Changes in specialties of certificate-awarding higher education for adults. There was an increase in the percentage of adult students admitted to schools of finance and economics, politics and law, science, and medicine. New students majoring in finance and economics showed the fastest increase. Their percentage was 6.73 percentage points higher than the preceding year. Students admitted to normal colleges declined by 4.12 percentage points. 3. Less students taking non-certificate-awarding courses run by institutions of higher education for adults. There was a decline in the number of students taking non-certificate-awarding courses (exclusive of seminars giving professional certificates) run by institutions of higher education for adults. In 1993, 1,567,200 million adults finished such courses, down by 204,000, or 11.59 percent, from the preceding year. Those taking on-the-job-training courses showed a remarkable 23.3 percent decline from the preceding year. 4. Further development of elementary and secondary technical education for adults. In recent years, the number of elementary and secondary technical schools for adults, mostly farmers, has been on the rise. In 1993 the number of adult technical schools throughout the country increased to 298,300, or 14,200 more than the preceding year. As many as 57,068,000 million people attended these schools and graduated, showing an increase of 7,482,900 million above the preceding year. Of these schools, 288,500 were technical schools for farmers, 17,000 more than the number a year ago. The number of graduates from these schools reached 52,814,600 million, or 8,213,600 more than the preceding year. Farmers attending such technical schools accounted for 12.2 percent of the total rural labor force, up 1.8 percentage points compared with the preceding year. Throughout the country, 30.7 percent of the townships and 81.1 percent of the villages had technical schools for farmers. Meanwhile, there were 9,800 technical training schools for staff members and workers. This number was 2,800 less than the preceding year. The number of graduates totaled 4,253,400 million, down by 730,700 from the preceding year. Secondary specialized schools for adults, mainly staff members and workers, showed a certain degree of development. The number of such schools reached 4,783. This was seven more than the number a year ago. New students admitted to the schools numbered 856,700, or 143,600 more than the preceding year. The total enrollment was 2,067,600 million, an increase of 323,300 over the preceding year. 5. Relatively quick development noted in conducting special examinations at higher and secondary levels for self-study students. In 1993, nationwide examinations for self-study students at higher education level were held for 142 specialties. This was 11 more than the preceding year. A total of 4,838,100 million people took part in the examinations. Of them, 127,100 passed the examinations. In addition, 15,100 passed the examinations equivalent to the level of secondary specialized schools. In 1993, some professional-qualification examinations were also held for those who had completed non-certificate-awarding education courses. 6. Upwards of 5 million illiterates educated in three years. In 1993, there were 106,400 literacy schools (classes) across the country. This was 5,000 less than the preceding year. A total of 5,481,700 million people attended the schools (classes) and graduated, showing an increase of 248,600 over the preceding year. The efforts over the past three years benefitted more than 5 million illiterates, and each year the plan for wiping out illiteracy was overfulfilled.
