As KRASNAYA ZVEZDA has already stressed, the examination of one of the State Committee for the State of Emergency's key figures gives rise to many questions, and not only from state prosecution representatives. Yazov stated the precise number of troops brought into the capital and also told of the subunits which were to have reinforced this grouping. In his opinion, halting the process of the USSR's disintegration was entirely practicable in these conditions. Just one small thing was lacking -- plans to introduce a state of emergency had to be supported by Mikhail Gorbachev. During the examination it also emerged that troops had been brought into Moscow even earlier and what is more, Yazov stressed, often on Gorbachev's oral instructions. This took place three or four times in 1990-1991, as a rule prior to the opening of the next Supreme Soviet session and on holidays. The president's edict on joint patrolling by Ministry of Internal Affairs and Defense Ministry forces served as the basis for this. There is another aspect of the examination which is of no mean importance. Yazov stressed that many leaders of former Union republics -- Georgia, Lithuania, and Ukraine -- had reacted to the State Committee for the State of Emergency members' plans "with understanding." True, it is difficult to judge how deep and sincere this "understanding" was. Most likely the "let's wait and see" principle was operating here. However much the Military Collegium tries to avoid the trial's political slant, it nonetheless emerges from time to time. Thus, during a recess between sessions (on Thursday) [27 January] defendant Anatoliy Lukyanov went up to Roman Barsegyan, state prosecution representative, and asked him: "Why are you participating in this sordid affair and what will happen to you after the trial?" Barsegyan regarded this as a blatant attempt to put pressure on a prosecutor's office representative, which is what he told the court members after the recess. The Military Collegium called on all participants in the trial to "observe propriety." On Friday the examination of Yazov went on behind closed doors, so the press was not allowed into the courtroom. It has been ascertained that former USSR KGB Chairman Vladimir Kryuchkov also answered questions from the court, state prosecution, attorneys, and defendants yesterday. The next session in the case of the State Committee for the State of Emergency will take place next Tuesday [1 February].
