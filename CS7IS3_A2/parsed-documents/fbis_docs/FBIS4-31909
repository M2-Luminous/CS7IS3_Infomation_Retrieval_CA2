Cernak said that talks between the two parties continued and a NDS leaders' solution was expected on Saturday [18 June]. "Since cooperation with the right of center parties had always been more important for the NDS than its cooperation with the Christian Democrats we decided to cancel talks with the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH)," said Cernak, who as recently as this Saturday held talks with the KDH on probable participation of NDS candidates on its slate. He said that the KDH's proposal did not satisfy the National Democrats as their five candidates would gain places in parliament only if the KDH won 16 percent of voter support, which is unlikely. Cernak said that the possibility of a joint slate for right of center parties was taking shape because the right-wing bloc of the Democratic Party (DS) and the Party of Slovak Entrepreneurs and Tradespeople (SPZ) was also holding talks on cooperation with Moravcik's party. Nevertheless Cernak did not confirm that the talks with the KDH had been stopped. According to the May poll conducted by the FOCUS agency 5.9 percent of voters would vote for Moravcik's DU if elections were held now, which is sufficient to enter parliament, while the potential partners of the right of center coalition would not get in parliament independently -- the DS enjoys the support of 3.6 percent of the respondents, while the popularity of Cernak's National Democrats did not cross the three-percent border. (Five percent voter support is required for a party to enter parliament according to the recently passed Slovak election law).
