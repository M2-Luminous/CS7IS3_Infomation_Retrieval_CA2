FR940622-0-00050 FR940622-0-00011 Comment: One commenter recommended that the 72-hour reporting requirement for receiving hospitals suspecting improper transfers should begin from the time a problem is first identified rather than from the date of the transfer. Response: The time of the receipt of an improperly transferred patient is the time of the occurrence. We do not see any substantive time difference between the time of receipt and the time of identification that a patient had been improperly transferred. However, to make reporting less onerous, we are revising ยง489.20(m) and ยง489.53(a)(10) to require a hospital to report to either HCFA or the State agency, rather than both as proposed. Comment: One commenter suggested that the regulation be amended to permit HCFA to terminate a receiving hospital only for a ``knowing'' failure to report suspected violations. Response: We see no reason to require that HCFA prove that a hospital ``knowingly'' violated its obligation to report instances of suspected dumping before it may take action against a non-complying hospital. As with other conditions of participation imposed on providers for the protection of the health and safety of those benefitted by title XVIII, including those protected by section 1867 of the Act, whether a hospital fails to meet its obligations knowingly is of little concern to those the requirement is designed to benefit. We believe this is especially true since section 4008(b)(3) of OBRA 90 deleted the provision under which HCFA had to show first that the hospital's actions were either knowing and willful or negligent before terminating the hospital's provider agreement. We do not believe the enhanced enforcement and, hence, deterrence, behind requiring receiving hospitals to report instances of suspected dumping, would be advanced by adding any requirement that the violation be knowing before a hospital's failure to report could result in its termination. We expect hospitals to have and enforce policies and procedures to require its employees and staff physicians to report to the administration instances where an individual has been inappropriately transferred under this statute. Comment: Two commenters believe that HCFA and State survey agencies should protect the receiving hospitals and their personnel from legal actions for reporting alleged cases of improper transfer. Response: We do not have the authority to confer immunity on a provider that identifies an alleged improper transfer under these regulations. However, HCFA has a history of protecting the identity and confidentiality of entities who report program violations and this protection will be extended to hospitals and individuals reporting improper transfers. Additionally, we also note that section 4027(k)(3) of OBRA 90 amended section 1867(i) of the Act (Whistleblower Protections), which was enacted under OBRA 89, to prevent a hospital from penalizing or taking adverse action against any hospital employee because the employee reported a violation of this requirement. We have revised ยง489.24(d)(3) of the regulations to reflect this statutory amendment. Comment: Eight commenters claimed that the statute does not support the obligation to report suspected dumping or provide for the termination of a provider that does not report suspected violations. Five commenters suggested that we extend the responsibility to report suspected dumping violations to all Medicare providers and suppliers; ambulance service suppliers, in particular, are in a position to suspect violations if the hospital to which the ambulance is transporting the patient refuses to accept that patient. Several commenters recommended that the reporting requirements be extended to physicians and that a failure to comply with these requirements would subject the physician to a civil monetary penalty. Response: We believe our requirements relating to reporting instances of dumping are supported by current law. Section 1861(e)(9) of the Act permits the Secretary to impose on hospitals such other requirements as he finds necessary in the interest of the health and safety of individuals who are furnished services in the institution. It is under this authority that the Secretary has obligated hospitals that participate in Medicare to report when they receive patients that have been inappropriately transferred. Under section 1866(b)(2) (A) and (B) of the Act, the Secretary may terminate the provider agreement of a hospital that is not complying substantially with the statute and regulations under title XVIII or that no longer substantially meets the provisions of section 1861 of the Act. Application of the anti-dumping provisions to all Medicare providers and suppliers should occur through a statutory amendment. Section 1867 of the Act imposes duties directly only on hospitals that provide emergency services to which individuals come for screening or treatment. No similar statutory authority generally exists to regulate the conduct of non-providers, suppliers and practitioners. Comment: Many commenters believe that we should not require receiving hospitals to report suspected cases of dumping, since it may lead to overreporting or malicious reporting in addition to unnecessary work and extra costs for HCFA and hospitals. Response: We disagree. We are looking to those institutions in the best position to discern when an inappropriate transfer has taken place in violation of the statute, because Congress regards them also as victims of ``dumping''. (See section 1867(d)(2)(B) of the Act.) This reporting requirement is not, however, an impediment to negotiation among hospitals for the care of emergency patients. Indeed, it should encourage hospitals to cooperate in planning for appropriate emergency care by eliminating inappropriate transfers. Comment: Several commenters wanted us to define ``suspected,'' so hospitals will have further guidance concerning when they must report violations. These commenters also recommended that we define which individuals in the hospital must hold the suspicion. Response: We agree that ``suspected'' is a vague term. As a result we are revising proposed ยง489.53(a)(10) to require a hospital to report violations when a hospital has reason to believe that a violation has occurred. However, we see no need to define which individuals in a hospital must hold the suspicion since we do not want to narrow the source of reports. Definitions Active Labor Comment: Several commenters recommended that we adopt the definition of active labor used by the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) in enforcing a hospital's Hill-Burton obligations contained in 42 CFR 124.603(b). One commenter stated that there are also written decisions and directives interpreting this issue and that using the OCR definition would relieve Hill-Burton facilities of the risk of being required to comply with inconsistent treatment standards for women in active labor.
