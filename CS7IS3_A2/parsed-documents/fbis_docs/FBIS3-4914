The Education Ministry said 1,135 of the 1,330 teachers reinstated in their former profession had reported to new assignments across the country. Of the rest, 159 will be assigned to schools during the current semester and the remaining 36, who are either members of city or county education boards or involved in lawsuits, will be given jobs when their board tenure expires or when their cases are cleared up. Among the 1,419 teachers expelled for union activities, 89 were not reinstated for refusing to grant government officials an interview, for not taking a refresher course or for vowing to continue in the union, the Ministry said. In Seoul, 454 of 508 sacked teachers have been reinstated and reported to some 340 schools in the capital area. But most schools are expected to avoid placing these teachers in charge of a class for fear of the influence they, as former unionists, may have over students.
