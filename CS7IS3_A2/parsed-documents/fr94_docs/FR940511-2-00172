FR940511-2-00172 FR940511-2-00109 Such warrants shall be direct obligations of their issuer subject to cash settlement in U.S. dollars, and exercisable throughout their life ( i.e. American style) or exercisable only at expiration ( i.e., European style). Upon exercise, or at the warrant expiration date (if not exercisable prior to such date), the holder of a warrant will be entitled to a cash settlement value computed in accordance with a formula specified in the issuer's prospectus. If ``out of the money'' at the time of expiration, the warrants will expire worthless. Warrants may be structured either to increase or decrease in value based on the increase or decrease in the price or yield of the government bond or bonds. Because all payments will be required to be in U.S. dollars, there would be no currency risk except to the extent that fluctuations in the value of the relevant currency affect the price or yield of the government bond(s). The Amex will require that member firms only sell such warrants to investors whose accounts have been approved for options trading pursuant to Amex Rule 921. The Exchange also will distribute a circular to its membership prior to the commencement of trading calling attention to the risks associated with the purchase and trading of such warrants. At this time, the Exchange anticipates the listing of a warrant issue based on the prices of between three and five foreign government issues. Holders of such warrants would be entitled to receive from the issuer in U.S. dollars a cash settlement value, if any, based on changes in the arithmetic average yield to maturity of the bonds as calculated by the designated Calculation Agent based on prices obtained from three dealers in the bonds. 3 3 The Exchange represents that it will consult with Commission staff prior to listing warrant issues tied to government bond(s) with respect to (1) the specific calculation methodology to be used by individual warrant issuers, and (2) the adequacy of available bond pricing information. The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act in general, and furthers the objectives of Section 6(b)(5) in particular in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices and to promote just and equitable principals of trade, and is not designed to permit unfair discrimination between customers, issuers, brokers and dealers. (B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition The Amex believes that the proposed rule change will not impose an inappropriate burden on competition. (C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants, or Others Written comments on the proposed rule change were neither solicited nor received. III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action Within 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the Federal Register or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents, the Commission will: (a) By order approve such proposed rule change, or (b) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved. IV. Solicitation of Comments Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission , 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC. Copies of such filing will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office of the above-mentioned self-regulatory organization. All submissions should refer to File No. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;94&hyph;05 and should be submitted by June 1, 1994. For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 4 4 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12)(1993).
