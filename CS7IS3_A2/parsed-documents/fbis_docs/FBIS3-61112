Romanticism is played out. And small joys have sped off together with it to some warm parts of recollections of the "dawn of democracy." Remember? There really is a choice (that is, choosing from several), and there they are, in the highest legislative body--our people (whoever is against "them" is a priori one of ours)--they are speaking, and no one is sending them down for doing so.... The delights of the barbarian who has seen a telephone are fewish today. I call at the election headquarters of New Wave--an interparty independent association of professionals, as this group calls itself--that has just opened in Lvov. I see the faces of people whom I have reason to consider intelligent and decent, and I estimate that many of them have a chance of negotiating the election marathon successfully. And then? After two years of what is considered de jure independence, merely obtaining a platform for the declaration of one's views in order subsequently to lose round after round, bearing part of the responsibility for senseless decisions, murderous for the state, is negligibly little. It is precisely this, however, that is before one's eyes and in one's recollections. And here once again, people are arguing until they are hoarse about programs, rejoicing in the grains of rationality in them. Grains doomed to fall on a land scorched by "Sovietness"? Or perhaps I am wrong, and it is simply the dark, cold December with prices inducing the temperatures of galloping tuberculosis that has bestowed the pessimism? We are talking with Taras Stetskiv, a deputy at this time, one of those prepared to set out on the coming election voyage from New Wave. [Andreyeva] A somewhat naive question, perhaps, but how many "head," how many persons, with whom reform steps could be defended were there in this Supreme Council? [Stetskiv] No more than 60. I refer to those who not only employed slogans of independence and market reforms, but also knew how to do so. [Andreyeva] Once again it is ridiculous, most likely, to speak about an arithmetical quantity, but how many bills that may be considered reform, progressive bills, were adopted by the Supreme Council? [Stetskiv] Of the more than 120 bills that were adopted altogether, 25-30 may be deemed to afford scope for market reforms. And, despite their incomplete nature, it should be acknowledged that under Ukraine's conditions they afforded an opportunity for something to be done. The laws on privatization and securities and the stock exchange, concerning credit unions and stock companies and the amendments to the land code that legalized private property. All this, given the good will of parliament and, most important, given the good political will of the government, afforded an opportunity (not the best, but normal conditions) for the development of market reforms. [Andreyeva] Something as ephemeral and nonmaterial as this good will itself was lacking, it has to be thought.... [Stetskiv] The trouble is that this, in principle, very small legal foundation was not realized in the least. The government sought in the laws not what opens the way to reforms, but what affords an opportunity to block them. [Andreyeva] So the blame for our situation today lies with the government (more precisely, the governments). And the Supreme Council? [Stetskiv] To blame, without any doubt. Another example of such a quantity of inconsistent steps is hardly to be found in contemporary history among the European revolutions that ousted communism. One market law would be adopted, the next, antimarket. One declares privatization by way of auction, a second determines the path of privatization via leasing. This is an indicator of the lack of professionalism of the Supreme Council and the absence of a conceptually defined path. Thus, not a single consistent reform action has been implemented in the two years of independence in Ukraine. [Andreyeva] Consequently, the real use factor of the group of reformers within parliament is about zero. We will not today, if you do not mind, speak about the propaganda effect. We will recall the bitter pictures of defeats: All arguments are exhausted, and the majority--the reliable "voting machine"--has once again ridden roughshod over the shoots of what is new. Nor do we have far to go--I recall the face of Sergey Holovatyy as he came into the corridor following the adoption of the latest retrograde article of the Election Act.... [Stetskiv] Yes, this was a defeat. It showed once again that there can be no accords or preliminary gentlemen's agreements with the communist majority: It has broken them all. [Andreyeva] When cursing this act and harvesting its fruit, people will say: "Parliament adopted this." Consequently, part of the responsibility is borne by everyone. [Stetskiv] No. As far as the Election Act is concerned, the democratic part of parliament, the People's Council, ceased taking part in the voting after the adoption of the notorious Article 24. [Andreyeva] But the act has been adopted.... [Stetskiv] Yes, the act has been adopted, and, as in any state based on the rule of law, we will submit to it and run in accordance with it. [Andreyeva] And on what part of the progressively thinking, reform-minded members of the new parliament can we count? [Stetskiv] This might seem somewhat romantic, but on one-third, about 130-150 persons, I believe. [Andreyeva] Your forecast is quite optimistic; on what do you base this optimism? [Stetskiv] On a particular analysis. First, I can in descending order of chances, so to speak, name the three main forces that will play a part at these elections: the "power party," the corps of directors, and the interests of private business. Second, even at the most critical moments of its existence, society does not elect a large percentage of marginals of both a communist and nationalist persuasion. Marginals are of no benefit to any of the above-mentioned three forces, and they will all try to promote those of a more or less centrist frame of mind. Only the corps of directors and the power party will rely on people whose thinking tilts in the direction of the preservation of state property, and private property will support those who are more explicitly oriented toward capitalism. Thus the center, constituting the main part, will be divided into two groups. [Andreyeva] We have already had something similar. If it is considered that private business is weaker than the other forces mentioned, the groups will be unequal. The difference in interests has already produced an inconsistency, which we spoke of earlier, which has jerked society around. Are you, who put yourself among the reformers, not afraid of once again being in the obscure minority? [Stetskiv] This cannot be ruled out. But it seems to me that the new parliament will be, if not by much, better. It is worth going to the polls, worth voting, even for this. If we elect no one, we will get dictatorship. As regards obscure opposition. It seems to me that the confrontation in the new parliament will differ from the confrontation in the previous one: In the present one the contradictions of the opposition and the majority have been of an ideological nature; in the next one, they will assume an economic nature. [Andreyeva] It is hard to believe that things will get easier thanks to a change in the nature of the confrontation, and in such a vital direction, what is more. [Stetskiv] The point is that the contradictions will not be implacable. The struggle will be conducted over the pace and direction of the reforms. After all, even the body of state directors understands that it is no longer possible to preserve everything as it is. The contradiction will be between the supporters of a quiet drift in the direction of capitalism, into which it is desirable for them to ride, high up on their sluggish camel, and the supporters of this form or the other of shock therapy capable of producing a visible result. [Andreyeva] Nonetheless, the last question from a pessimist, of whose role today, judging by my frame of mind, I will not manage to rid myself. What if there is once again a blank confrontation? The nerves of the members of the opposition at the microphones, the withdrawals and arrivals, sundry demarches (there is nothing left, after all), and the next day we read the text of the latest law, pushing the country toward ruin? What, in your view, should be the actions of people today heading for parliament with the best of intentions? [Stetskiv] If it is like this, the sole opportunity for the market opposition is to put the emphasis on the presidential elections. To try to realize the alternative of a decisive reformer president. If this is unsuccessful, there will be distressing times for Ukraine.
