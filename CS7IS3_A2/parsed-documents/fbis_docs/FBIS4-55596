The army of the republic of Srpska can boast more than two years of war experience, and during that time the effectiveness of many kinds of weapons has been actually tested in battles, while many weapons have been modified and adjusted to meet some practical demands. Although the military textbooks strictly proscribe the use of certain weapons, experience has shown that innovations are always welcome. A photograph taken by REUTER news agency several days ago at Serbian positions near Brcko shows four of these honeycombed rocket launchers (normally used as an airborne weapon) installed on a truck, and used for shelling targets on the ground. This mobile rocket launcher of middle-ranging destructive power, the modified version, contains 48 shells in one charge. This rocket launcher has the greatest effect if it is used in combination with other standard artillery weapons and rocket systems, in fighting across wide front lines, where the distance from the enemy is relatively short. Its range is only several kilometers, but the effect is great because a great number of rockets disperse over a wide area over a rather short period of time. The rockets are neither guided, nor self-guided, but this does not diminish their effect in any case, because of their wide dispersion. Compared with other similar weapons, the destructive effect of the honeycombed launcher approximates to that of the Osa rocket launcher, but the difference is that its one charge contains 48 times the number of rockets in a charge of the Osa. The honeycombed launcher's firing system is electrically activated, and it is possible to activate several launchers linked together on the same platform at the same time. The recharging is done relatively simply and quickly, but in order to achieve that at least four gunners are necessary. In the former Yugoslav People's Army [JNA] the honeycombed rocket launcher was a part of the equipment of almost all fighter aircraft: the Jastreb, the Galeb, the Super Galeb, the Orao, and the MiG-29. It was also installed in MI-8 transport helicopters. These launchers were also used against ground targets. In the storehouses of the JNA in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina a great quantity of such launchers were deposited, and in the course of time they have been modified quite successfully, and are now being used for fighting on the ground. At the beginning the launchers were manufactured in the former Soviet Union, but it was quite a long time ago that the manufacture was taken over by Yugoslav arms factories.
