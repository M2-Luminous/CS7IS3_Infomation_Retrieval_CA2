The first report in our program tells you about the work of this session. [Correspondent] Eduard Shevardnadze, chairman of the Georgian Parliament and head of state, delivered a report on the extension of the operation of the state of emergency on the territory of the Republic of Georgia. Our main task is to restore order in the country. Therefore, the address by the chairman of parliament started with a call for an improvement of the work of the supreme legislative body. He said that it is necessary to introduce a principle of coordination in the work of the parliament and to exclude spontaneity. Among other central problems Mr. Eduard Shevardnadze listed an improvement of the rules of procedure and the necessity to step up work in commissions and to listen to their reports. Our public, said the head of state, has a great desire that fruitless confrontation in the work of the parliament be overcome. The main result of the introduction of the state of emergency is that Georgia has averted a major civil war which was about to engulf western Georgia. But for the emergency rules, the country might have been in a more serious condition. Unless order is established in the country, nothing will save either the economy or culture and science, and the country will not be able to emerge from the crisis, the head of state stressed. He also said that unless order is restored, all achievements and agreements reached during talks with other countries will remain on paper. We should be guided by this principle in our work. As for an extension of the emergency rules, it was said that they should be extended for a month -- of course, provided that the parliament agrees. [passage omitted] Mr. Jaba Ioseliani presented to the parliamentarians a comprehensive report on the results of the Geneva talks. He began by criticizing the press, or, rather, the official press. Mr. Jaba Ioseliani said that the talks in Geneva finished five days ago and almost all international newspapers comprehensively covered and assessed this important event. Meanwhile, the Georgian population has not been offered even a single report. We will not repeat today the assessment of the talks by the head of the Georgian delegation, since Georgian television has broadcast several times a long interview covering these issues. We will point out that there was a difference of opinion regarding the assessment of the results, which is customary for some deputies. The significance of the results of the talks will become clear to all of us only after their implementation, which is expected to start in the immediate future. And that was the end of the Parliament's work today. [Announcer] We would like to add that the republic's parliament decided today to extend for another month the state of emergency on the entire territory of the republic.
