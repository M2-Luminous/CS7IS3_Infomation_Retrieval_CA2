On the other hand, the environmental organization Global 2000 is starting a large-scale signature campaign: It calls on U.S. Congress deputies to prevent the financing of Temelin: ``The nuclear power plant project has already been rejected by the World Bank and other banks with reference to cheaper and safer alternatives,'' the lists of signatures say: ``Therefore, we are appealing to you not to support the short-term economic interests of the U.S. nuclear industry.'' This campaign is supported by Education Minister Rudolf Scholten: ``If signatures are collected in schools, I endorse that.'' The first prominent person to sign is [singer] Rainhard Fendrich. Lists for signatures can be obtained at ``Global 2000,'' 1120 Vienna, Flurschuetzstrasse 13, telephone 0222/812 57 30. Prague environmental activist Petr Hlobil of the Czech environmental organization ``Children of Earth'' believes that ``the majority of the people in southern Bohemia are against the project.'' Organized resistance is already forming, according to Hlobil. Hlobil does not accept his government's argument that Temelin is necessary to close down the outdated coal-fired power plants in northern Bohemia. Until 1995-96 -- the earliest date of Temelin's coming into service -- most of the coal-fired power plants in the region will already have been closed down or improved. Only 430 of the 2,000 megawatts of Temelin will then be needed in northern Bohemia.
