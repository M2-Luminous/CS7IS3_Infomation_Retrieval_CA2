Ilagan] [Text] Top officials of the Philippine Army have ordered the deactivation of two infantry battalions in Bicol and Davao del Sur to streamline the military organization. This is aimed at improving the efficiency and effectiveness of Army troopers both in combat and non-combat missions, Lt. Gen. Romulo F. Yap, Army chief, said. He ordered the disbandment of the 49th Infantry Battalion based in Barangay [Village] Bacolod, Una, Sorsogon, and the 37th Infantry Battalion in Sitio [Village District] Cogon, Barangay Tuban, Sta. [Santa] Cruz, Davao del Sur. Yap said the deactivation of the two battalions, each with about 300 troopers takes effect on 1 July. With the deactivation of the two battalions, only 76 remain engaged in counterinsurgency, ecological preservation, and support operations to police forces in neutralizing organized criminal organizations. The Army chief said 20 percent of the battalion's personnel who were undertaking administrative jobs in their headquarters unit can be reassigned to other battalions as part of the regular forces. "While we lessen the manpower involved in administrative jobs in every headquarters, unit we increase the regular troopers engaged in combat missions," Yap said. When Yap assumed command of the Philippine Army last April, he urged the implementation of the total quality management (TQM) approach aimed at maximizing the efficiency of every unit despite the constraints in material resources to achieve the command's objectives. Army authorities, who refused to be identified, said more battalions will be deactivated, as part of the military's streamlining efforts.
