It comes at a highly sensitive time, with multiparty elections coming up on 17 May. On the line to Lilongwe, Jeremy Skeat asked our reporter, Charles Simango, what was in the cargo. [Begin recording] [Simango] There were about 71 kg of bulletproof jackets, 81 kg of shotgun accessories, 345 kg of shotgun ammunition, and about 360 kg of (?pellets) -- I am not quite aware what that is -- totaling around 857 kg of guns, ammunition, and bulletproof jackets. [Skeat] Now, you say all these arms and bulletproof jackets were found in a container. Where was the container due to go to? [Simango] The container was addressed to the Agricultural Development Corporation of Malawi, which is (?Admac). (?Admac) here deals in agriculture, loaning farming inputs [as heard] to farmers, and buying farm produce. [Skeat] Can you think of any reason at all why this Agricultural Development Corporation would need arms? [Simango] That was very puzzling indeed, because Manica Freight, which deals in air cargo, cargo in general--air or land cargo--were contacted today and they say that the addressee, really, they do not know who it is. So, we do not know. Maybe the Agricultural Development Corporation has just been framed. Or they know something--it was something that was done by the back door. [Skeat] What are the police and customs officials saying about this whole (?thing)? [Simango] The customs officials just managed to hand over the arms and ammunitions to the Malawi Army and Police and, apparently, at the moment the police have taken over the case. So far, we have not heard anything, any comments from the police, so definitely they are investigating. [Skeat] You say these arms were flown into Malawi. Where did they come from? [Simango] It is quite clear that these arms and ammunition have originated from South Africa, because there is a document which clearly indicates an import and export permit from the South African Police. In fact, this document, half of it is written in English and half of it, particularly the import and export permit, is written in Afrikaans. [Skeat] Has there been any political reaction to this arms [word indistinct]? [Simango] Not at the moment. Apparently, most of the politicians are not aware of this discovery yet. [end recording]
