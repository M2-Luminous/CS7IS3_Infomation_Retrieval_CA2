ACTION: Direct final rule. SUMMARY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) conditionally approves a revision to the State implementation plan (SIP) submitted by the State of Washington for the purpose of bringing about the attainment of the National ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers (PM&hyph;10). The implementation plan was submitted by the State to satisfy certain Federal requirements for an approvable moderate nonattainment area PM&hyph;10 SIP for Tacoma, Washington. DATES: This final rule will be effective on December 12, 1994 unless adverse or critical comments are received by November 14, 1994. If the effective date is delayed, timely notice will be published in the Federal Register . ADDRESSES: Written comments should be addressed to: Montel Livingston, SIP Manager, Environmental Protection Agency, Air and Radiation Branch (AT&hyph;082), 1200 Sixth Avenue, Seattle, Washington 98101. Documents which are incorporated by reference are available for public inspection at the Air and Radiation Docket and Information Center, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background The Tacoma, Washington, area was designated nonattainment for PM&hyph;10 and classified as moderate under sections 107(d)(4)(B) and 188(a) of the Clean Air Act (CAA), upon enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) of 1990. 1 See 56 FR 56694 (November 6, 1991) (official designation codified at 40 CFR 81.348). The air quality planning requirements for moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas are set out in subparts 1 and 4 of part D, title I of the Act. 2 EPA has issued a ``General Preamble'' describing EPA's preliminary views on how EPA intends to review SIPs and SIP revisions submitted under Title I of the Act, including those State submittals containing moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area SIP requirements (see generally 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992) and 57 FR 18070 (April 28, 1992)). Because EPA is describing its interpretations here only in broad terms, the reader should refer to the General Preamble for a more detailed discussion of the interpretations of title I advanced in this notice and the supporting rationale. In this rulemaking action on the State of Washington's moderate PM&hyph;10 SIP for the Tacoma nonattainment area (referred to as Tacoma or the Tacoma Tideflats), EPA is applying its interpretations taking into consideration the specific factual issues presented. Additional information supporting EPA's action on this particular area is available for inspection at the address indicated above. Those States containing initial moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas (those areas designated nonattainment under CAA section 107(d)(4)(B)) were required to submit, among other things, the following provisions by November 15, 1991: 1 The 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act made significant changes to the Act. See Pub. L. No. 101-549, 104 Stat. 2399. References herein are to the Clean Air Act, as amended (``the Act''). The Clean Air Act is codified, as amended, in the U.S. Code at 42 U.S.C. 7401, et seq. 2 Subpart 1 contains provisions applicable to nonattainment areas generally and subpart 4 contains provisions specifically applicable to PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas. At times, subpart 1 and subpart 4 overlap or conflict. EPA has attempted to clarify the relationship among these provisions in the ``General Preamble'' and, as appropriate, in today's notice and supporting information. 1. Provisions to ensure that reasonably available control measures (RACM) (including such reductions in emissions from existing sources in the area as may be obtained through the adoption, at a minimum, of reasonably available control technology (RACT)) shall be implemented no later than December 10, 1993; 2. Either a demonstration (including air quality modeling) that the plan will provide for attainment as expeditiously as practicable but no later than December 31, 1994, or a demonstration that attainment by that date is impracticable; 3. Quantitative milestones which are to be achieved every three years and which demonstrate reasonable further progress (RFP) toward attainment by December 31, 1994; and 4. Provisions to ensure that the control requirements applicable to major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10 also apply to major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10 precursors except where the Administrator determines that such sources do not contribute significantly to PM&hyph;10 levels which exceed the NAAQS in the area (see sections 172(c), 188, and 189 of the Act). Additional provisions are due at a later date. States with initial moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas were required to submit a permit program for the construction and operation of new and modified major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10 by June 30, 1992 (see CAA section 189(a)). The Washington State Department of Ecology (WDOE) submitted the new source review requirements for this area on October 22, 1993. EPA will address that submittal in a separate Federal Register document. Such States also were required to submit contingency measures by November 15, 1993, which become effective without further action by the State or EPA, upon a determination by EPA that the area has failed to achieve RFP or to attain the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS by the applicable statutory deadline (see CAA section 172(c)(9) and 57 FR 13510&hyph;13512 and 13543&hyph;13544). EPA addresses the contingency measures the State has submitted for Tacoma in part II.8 of the discussion below. II. This Action Section 110(k) of the Act sets out provisions governing EPA's review of SIP submittals (see 57 FR 13565&hyph;13566). Section 110(k)(4) of the Act authorizes EPA to approve a plan revision based on a commitment by the State to adopt specific enforceable measures by a date certain, but not later than one year after the date of approval of the plan revision. EPA would then assess the approvability of the submittal after the State fulfilled its commitment. However, if the State fails to comply with its commitment, section 110(k)(4) provides that a conditional approval shall be treated as a disapproval. If the conditional approval is converted to a disapproval, the sanctions clock under section 179 of the Act and the Federal implementation plan clock under section 110(c)(1) of the Act will begin. In this action, EPA is granting conditional approval of the plan revisions submitted to EPA for Tacoma, Washington, on November 15, 1991 and June 30, 1994 (hereafter generally referred to as a single submittal), except for the following elements of the SIP which are described below or in the Technical Support Document associated with this rulemaking. EPA is approving these following elements without conditions: exclusion from precursor controls, the monitoring network, the procedures for consultation and public notification, the provisions for revising the plan and the adequacy of funding and authority. EPA conditionally approves the submittal because it does not fully meet certain applicable requirements of the CAA for moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas. The submittal does not meet the requirements to provide for the implementation of RACM (including RACT), to demonstrate timely attainment of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS (or demonstrate that timely attainment is not practicable), and to provide for quantitative milestones and reasonable further progress. See CAA sections 172(c)(1), 189(a)(1)(C), 189(a)(1)(B) and 189(c). Some of the control measures relied on to satisfy these requirements have not been made enforceable emission limitations. CAA sections 110(a)(2)(A) and 172(c)(6). However, the State has submitted a commitment to adopt specific enforceable measures on or before January 1, 1995, and to address the applicable requirements of the Act. In its June 30, 1994 SIP revision, the State committed to submitting federally enforceable emission limits to EPA by January 1, 1995 for the following major stationary sources identified in the SIP: Buffelen Woodworking, Continental Grain, Continental Lime, Domtar Gypsum, Puget Sound Plywood, USG Interiors, US Oil and Refining, Woodworth, Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical Corporation and Simpson Tacoma Kraft Company. The submittal is substantive and contains some specific enforceable control measures. Accordingly, EPA is conditionally approving the submittal, as authorized under section 110(k)(4) of the CAA. EPA also approves, without conditions, the separable exclusion from precursor controls as described in part II.5 below, the monitoring network, the procedures for consultation and public notification, the provisions for revising the plan and the adequacy of funding and authority. Analysis of State Submission 1. Procedural Background The Act requires States to observe certain procedural requirements in developing implementation plans and plan revisions for submission to EPA. Section 110(a)(2) of the Act provides that each implementation plan submitted by a State must be adopted after reasonable notice and public hearing. 3 Section 110(l) of the Act similarly provides that each revision to an implementation plan submitted by a State under the Act must be adopted by such State after reasonable notice and public hearing. 3 Also section 172(c)(7) of the Act requires that plan provisions for nonattainment areas meet the applicable provisions of section 110(a)(2). The EPA also must determine whether a submittal is complete and therefore warrants further EPA review and action (see CAA section 110(k)(1) and 57 FR 13565). EPA's completeness criteria for SIP submittals are set out at 40 CFR part 51, appendix V. EPA attempts to make completeness determinations within 60 days of receiving a submission. However, a submittal is deemed complete by operation of law if a completeness determination is not made by EPA six months after receipt of the submission. The State of Washington Department of Ecology conducted a public hearing to receive public comment on the State implementation plan revision for PM&hyph;10 in Tacoma on November 7, 1991. WDOE adopted the implementation plan for the area on November 15, 1991, and submitted it to EPA the same day. In 1994, the plan was revised to amend its request for conditional approval. WDOE conducted a public hearing to obtain public input on this revision on February 17, 1994. The letter revising the request for conditional approval was submitted to EPA on June 30, 1994. The November 15, 1991 and June 30, 1994 SIP submittals were reviewed by EPA to determine completeness in accordance with the completeness criteria set out at 40 CFR part 51, appendix V. Letters dated May 12, 1992 and August 1, 1994, were forwarded to the WDOE indicating the completeness of the submittals and the next steps to be taken in the review process. 2. PM&hyph;10 Emissions Inventory Section 172(c)(3) of the Act requires that nonattainment plan provisions include a comprehensive, accurate and current inventory of actual emissions from all sources of relevant pollutants in the nonattainment area. The emissions inventory should also include a comprehensive, accurate and current inventory of allowable emissions in the area. See, e.g., CAA section 110(a)(2)(K). Because the submission of such inventories are necessary to an area's attainment demonstration (or demonstration that the area cannot practicably attain), the emissions inventories must be received with the attainment/nonattainment demonstration submission (see 57 FR 13539). WDOE submitted an emissions inventory of estimated actual emissions for the base year of 1987 and the attainment year of 1994. The 24-hour emission inventory identified three major source categories contributing to particulate matter in the Tacoma Tideflats. These are, in descending order of greatest contribution, industrial stack emissions (66 percent); vehicle resuspended road dust (18 percent); and industrial fugitive emissions (13 percent). Other contributing sources were area sources, such as residential wood combustion and motor vehicle exhaust. The emission inventory is dominated by one point source, the Simpson Tacoma Kraft Company (Simpson), a paper pulp producer, which accounts for 45 percent of the emission inventory. For sources within the nonattainment area, the emissions inventory provides a comprehensive list of particulate sources and utilizes appropriate factor and estimations that were available at the time the SIP revision was prepared. However, the emission inventory may underestimate the impact of PM&hyph;10 sources outside of the nonattainment area. Possibly due to where the nonattainment area boundaries were drawn, there may be a significant source of PM&hyph;10 outside of the nonattainment area. As is discussed in the Technical Support Document (TSD), substantial evidence indicates that imported residential wood combustion accounts for a large portion of the PM&hyph;10 in the Tacoma Tideflats. For further information, the reader is referred to the TSD accompanying this action, which is available at the EPA address indicated above. The emissions inventory estimating actual emissions along with additional available information provides a sufficient basis for determining the technical adequacy of the attainment demonstration for this area consistent with the requirements of section 172(c)(3) of the Clean Air Act. 4 An additional attainment year emission inventory issue, relating to the attainment demonstration, and other requirements, is the use of actual instead of allowable emission estimates for projecting attainment. This issue will be discussed in more detail under the demonstration section of this document. Again, the reader is referred to the TSD corresponding with this action for further information. 4 The EPA issued guidance on PM&hyph;10 emissions inventories prior to the enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments in the form of the 1987 PM&hyph;10 SIP Development Guideline. The guidance provided in this document appears to be consistent with the Act. See CAA section 193. 3. RACM (Including RACT) As noted, the initial moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas must submit provisions to ensure that RACM (including RACT) are implemented no later than December 10, 1993 (see CAA sections 172(c)(1) and 189(a)(1)(C)). The General Preamble contains a detailed discussion of EPA's interpretation of the RACM (including RACT) requirement (see 57 FR 13539&hyph;13545 and 13560&hyph;13561). In broad terms, the State should identify available control measures evaluating them for their reasonableness in light of the feasibility of the controls and the attainment needs of the area. A State may reject available control measures if the measures are technologically infeasible or the cost of the control is unreasonable. In addition, RACM, does not require controls on emissions from sources that are insignificant (i.e. de minimis) and RACM does not require the implementation of all available control measures where an area demonstrates timely attainment of the NAAQS and the implementation of additional controls would not expedite attainment. 57 FR 13540&hyph;13544. Washington's control strategy for the Tacoma area provides for attainment of the 24-hour standard based on control of industrial emissions, fugitive industrial emissions including resuspended road dust, and residential wood combustion. However, as indicated below, some of the control measures are deficient because they are not reflected in enforceable emission limitations. See CAA sections 110(a)(2)(A) & 172(c)(6). The State has committed to address this deficiency and, based on section 110(k)(4) of the CAA, EPA is conditionally approving the submittal relative to the RACM (Including RACT) requirement. The available control measures to be implemented in Tacoma include the following: a. Industrial Controls The largest single reduction in the projected emission inventory results from the control of industrial stack emissions. As stated earlier, Simpson accounts for 45 percent of the emission inventory. In 1991, Simpson replaced the #2,3,4,5 hogged fuel boilers and #1 oil boiler at the mill with a new hogged fuel boiler. Emissions from the new boiler represent a 984 kg/day reduction in emissions, almost half of Simpson's previous emissions, or roughly 19 percent of the total baseline emissions inventory. In addition, changes in industrial processes resulted in decreased emissions; for example, U.S. Oil and Refining and Simpson changed fuel sources to burn natural gas. The SIP assumes that emissions from mobile sources will grow modestly from 1987 to 1994. Even including these growth projections, the overall reduction in industrial PM&hyph;10 stack emissions due to implementation of controls for all sources combined is projected to be 17 percent of the base year's inventory. However, these industrial changes and controls have not been expressed as enforceable emission limitations. As discussed earlier, WDOE has committed to submit enforceable emissions limits on the industrial sources by January 1, 1995. b. Industrial Fugitive and Resuspended Road Dust The Tacoma emission inventory identified industrial fugitive emissions and resuspended road dust as significant contributors of particulate matter to the airshed. The Puget Sound Air Pollution Control Agency (PSAPCA) is a local air pollution control agency that has jurisdiction over four counties in Washington State; PSAPCA's jurisdiction includes the Tacoma Tideflats. PSAPCA's fugitive dust regulation (Regulation I, section 9.15) was designed to reduce fugitive dust from commercial and industrial activities and also to reduce dust emissions from paved and unpaved roads and parking lots. PSAPCA requires ``Best Available Control Technology (BACT)'' under section 9.15 for all fugitive emissions from all incinerators, boilers, manufacturing equipment and air pollution control equipment. The Tacoma attainment plan lists and documents emission reductions from several major facilities that were required to pave roads or add PM&hyph;10 controls as the result of PSAPCA's application of section 9.15. Puget Sound Plywood, Lone Star, Woodworth and Buffelen were required to either pave roads or modify production processes to comply with section 9.15. The SIP estimates that the application of section 9.15 would result in a reduction of 73 kg/day of fugitive emissions from industrial sources. After accounting for an increase of 39 kg/day due to industrial growth, the net total reduction from the base year to the attainment year of fugitive emissions is 34 kg/day. EPA accepts the emission reductions claimed from this control measure as reasonable. Since it is generally impractical to source test fugitive emission sources, a SIP must rely on calculated emission estimates, and control efficiency estimates, to arrive at emission reduction estimates. Control of resuspended road dust is a significant component of section 9.15. PSAPCA applies the same section 9.15 BACT provisions to dust emissions from both private and public paved and unpaved roads. In addition, all private roadways adjoining paved public roads and all commercial properties with access points abutting paved public roads in the Tacoma nonattainment area are required to implement BACT to stabilize vehicular entrances and exits. The control measure also appropriately prioritized preventing material deposition on roadways over mitigating measures after deposition. Looking specifically at the control of resuspended road dust, the plan uses an overall emission reduction credit of 37 percent from resuspended road dust. EPA accepts this estimate as reasonable. c. Residential Wood Combustion As previously noted, there is a substantial body of evidence indicating that imported residential wood combustion is a large source of Tacoma's PM&hyph;10. All three receptor models concluded that woodsmoke was one of the main sources of particulate matter in the Tacoma Tideflats area. The most recent receptor modeling study suggested that residential wood combustion was an unexpectedly strong source of PM&hyph;10. This is also supported by the Saturation Study conducted by EPA. Additional discussion of the impact of imported residential wood combustion can be found in the TSD associated with this action. Because of the likely impact of imported residential wood combustion on Tacoma's airshed, the available control measures adopted for residential wood combustion are discussed here. PSAPCA initiated a voluntary woodsmoke curtailment program throughout its four county jurisdictional area, including Tacoma, in the winter of 1987&hyph;88. The program changed to mandatory curtailment beginning with the 1988&hyph;89 heating season, pursuant to WAC 173&hyph;433 and the PSAPCA Regulation I, Article 13. The curtailment program is a two stage plan. At Stage I, which is imposed when ambient PM&hyph;10 levels reach 75 μg/m 3 , the use of uncertified stoves and fireplaces are banned. At Stage II, imposed when PM&hyph;10 levels reach 105 μg/m 3 , all woodheating (fireplaces, certified and uncertified woodstoves) is prohibited. The program exempts homes with no other source of heat. WDOE and PSAPCA regulations contain additional controls, including the prohibition of all fuels except dry, seasoned wood in woodheating devices. Plume opacity for woodheating devices is limited to 20 percent, with brief exceedances allowed for fire starting and stoking. PSAPCA serves as the primary enforcement agency for the curtailment and opacity portions of the control program. Both WDOE and PSAPCA administer public education programs targeted at residential wood burning. Throughout the State, WDOE also enforces a ban on the sale of uncertified woodstoves. The strength and depth of the legislated woodsmoke program, and the size and historical effectiveness of the agencies involved, demonstrates to EPA's satisfaction that the Tacoma area is achieving a sufficient compliance rate to justify the 70 percent emission reduction credit taken for these measures. A more detailed analysis of the Washington woodsmoke curtailment plan is contained in the TSD. Since PSAPCA administers the woodsmoke curtailment program throughout its four-county jurisdictional area and the program affects sources both within the nonattainment area and in adjoining areas, the 70 percent emission reduction credit is applicable to both residential wood combustion generated in the nonattainment area and imported residential wood combustion. As indicated, where sources of PM&hyph;10 contribute insignificantly to the PM&hyph;10 problem in the area, EPA's policy is that RACM does not require the implementation of potentially available control measures. 57 FR 13540. Further, EPA has indicated that for some sources in areas which demonstrate timely attainment, RACM does not require the implementation of otherwise available control measures that are not ``reasonably'' available because their implementation would not expedite attainment (see 57 FR 13543). In the Tacoma situation, EPA believes the significant sources, as well as several less significant sources, of PM&hyph;10 in the area have been reasonably controlled. Thus, EPA believes that RACM does not require the implementation of potentially available control measures or technology for other de minimis sources of PM&hyph;10 in the area. Further, EPA believes implementation of such additional controls in this area would not expedite attainment. A more detailed discussion of the individual source contributions, their associated control measures and an explanation as to why certain available control measures were not implemented, can be found in the TSD. EPA has reviewed the State's explanation and associated documentation and concludes that it adequately justifies the control measures to be implemented. However, as addressed in more detail in part II.4 below, not all of the emission reductions necessary to ensure expeditious attainment of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS are embodied in enforceable emission limitations. Thus, EPA is conditionally approving the control measures submitted for Tacoma, based upon a commitment by the State that it will submit to EPA by January 1, 1995, legally enforceable emission limits for the significant stack sources in Tacoma. See CAA section 110(k)(4). This conditional approval is discussed further in the section below. 4. Demonstration As noted, the initial moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas must submit a demonstration (including air quality modeling) showing that the plan will provide for attainment as expeditiously as practicable but no later than December 31, 1994 (see section 189(a)(1)(B) of the Act). The General Preamble sets out EPA's guidance on the use of modeling for moderate area attainment demonstrations (57 FR 13539). Alternatively, if the State does not submit a demonstration of attainment, the State must show that attainment by December 31, 1994, is impracticable (CAA section 189(a)(1)(B)(ii)). Several studies have been conducted to determine sources of particulate matter in the Tacoma nonattainment area. WDOE and PSAPCA employed pollutant dispersion models in the Tacoma nonattainment area using both guideline and non-guideline models. Neither RAM (guideline) nor WYNDvalley (non-guideline) yielded results that were well correlated to measured values. It is difficult to determine precisely why dispersion modeling failed to yield acceptable values in the Tacoma Tideflats when similar approaches have proven successful elsewhere, but the TSD raises possible explanations, including where the boundaries of the nonattainment were drawn and how the background PM&hyph;10 concentration was established. The reader is referred to the ``Description of Air Quality Modeling'' section of the TSD associated with this action for further information. In addition to dispersion modeling, three receptor modeling studies were conducted in the Tacoma Tideflats to try to determine source contribution of PM&hyph;10. Separate from these receptor modeling studies, a saturation study was conducted to determine the site of maximum impact in the Tacoma nonattainment area. Unfortunately, no single study conclusively apportions the amount of PM&hyph;10 attributable to different sources. As is discussed in the TSD, EPA has reservations about each of these studies because of study design flaws, errors in conducting the study, or changing composition of particulate matter in the airshed. See the ``Attainment Demonstration'' section of the TSD for a longer discussion of the individual studies. Faced with several studies, none of which were definitive, the WDOE attempted to address several diverse scenarios to demonstrate attainment and maintenance of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS in the area. The SIP contains three demonstrations of attainment and maintenance all using rollback, a modified attainment demonstration that EPA may accept on a case-by-case basis. The first demonstration presented in the SIP is based on receptor modeling and proportional rollback; the second used a dispersion modeling study and proportional rollback; and the last was based on straight rollback. Tacoma's SIP meets the criteria for using rollback as outlined in EPA guidance (Attachment 5 of''PM&hyph;10 Moderate Area SIP Guidance: Final Staff Work Product,'' April 2, 1990). EPA's primary concern about the demonstrations in the SIP is that they underestimate the amount of PM&hyph;10 from residential wood combustion coming into the nonattainment area from surrounding areas. As discussed in the TSD, EPA believes that when looking at the receptor modeling and saturation studies as a whole, there is a substantial body of evidence indicating that residential wood combustion was and is a major source of PM&hyph;10 in the airshed. As discussed in the TSD, this residential wood combustion is probably being imported into the nonattainment area, and a conservative lower bound estimate is that 35&hyph;45 percent of the PM&hyph;10 in the Tacoma Tideflats on the design day is attributable to residential wood combustion. A more detailed discussion of this point can be found in the ``Attainment Demonstration'' of the TSD. EPA notes that there has been uncertainty over source contribution in the Tacoma nonattainment area despite numerous efforts by PSAPCA, WDOE, EPA and other entities to characterize the airshed. In reviewing the SIP, EPA has considered all relevant studies referenced in the SIP as well as additional information, such as the saturation study. Based on these studies, EPA finds that imported residential wood combustion is a much larger source of PM&hyph;10 than currently accounted for in the SIP. To evaluate the impact of imported residential wood combustion into the nonattainment area, the TSD associated with the rulemaking contains a rollback analysis that incorporates a relatively conservative estimate of the residential wood combustion being imported into the nonattainment area. As noted earlier, Tacoma's SIP meets the criteria for using rollback. In the ``Attainment Demonstration'' discussion of the TSD, EPA sets out a rollback scenario that incorporates the estimate that 35&hyph;45 percent of the PM&hyph;10 in the Tacoma Tideflats on the design day is attributable to residential wood combustion. A mandatory residential woodsmoke curtailment program is being imposed over a four-county area that includes the Tacoma Tideflats and surrounding contiguous areas. As discussed earlier in section II.3 of this document, PSAPCA's mandatory woodstove curtailment program warrants a 70 percent control measure credit. After applying control measure credit for the mandatory woodstove curtailment program, the rollback scenario presented in the TSD demonstrates; to EPA's satisfaction, that the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS will be attained by 1994. Assurance of attainment and maintenance rests with the SIP's control measures. The SIP contains a broad array of control measures aimed at both industrial and residential sources. Based on the emission inventory and related information about the estimated contribution from residential wood combustion, these control measures, when they are made fully enforceable (see below), will be sufficient to ensure attainment and maintenance. It should be noted that a major problem with the attainment demonstration is the attainment year emission inventory used for point (stack) sources. The inventory was based on actual emission estimates. EPA's Guideline on Air Quality Models (Revised, July 1986) generally requires use of allowable emissions in inventories for the purposes of modeling attainment of the NAAQS (see also CAA sections 110(a)(2)(A), 110(a)(2)(K) and 172(c)(6) of the Act). The requirement takes into consideration possible increases from existing sources allowed by their permits, registrations, or other regulatory mechanisms and ensures that the control measures relied on in the SIP are based on enforceable emission limitations. WDOE and PSAPCA, based on comments from EPA, were not able to demonstrate that all point source emissions in the nonattainment area would be unable to increase significantly above actual levels. Consequently, there is no objective assurance, or legally enforceable mechanism in place, to restrict a point source from emitting above the estimated actual rate, should the source have the physical capacity. Therefore, to ensure that the NAAQS will be protected in the Tacoma nonattainment area, the currently allowable emission limits must be reduced. Despite the fact that Tacoma has been monitoring daily at the site determined to be the site of maximum impact and has not had an exceedance of the NAAQS at any monitor in four years, there are no legal limits in place to prevent future increases from a few industrial facilities that could consequently threaten attainment of the NAAQS. On June 30, 1994, WDOE submitted a request for conditional approval of the Tacoma nonattainment plan based on a commitment to reconcile the actual/allowable emission limitation issue and thereby establish an enforceable attainment demonstration. WDOE's commitment includes a schedule to issue regulatory orders to appropriate point sources within the nonattainment area that will restrict emissions (i.e. establish allowable emission limitations) at or below the ``actual'' emission estimates used in the attainment demonstration. EPA conditionally approves the attainment demonstration for Tacoma on the basis of this commitment. See CAA section 110(k)(4). The revisions to the emission limitations for the affected sources will make enforceable the actual emission limitations already being achieved and implemented in the area. Like the attainment demonstration, Tacoma's SIP contained three maintenance demonstrations. The first demonstration is based on receptor modeling and proportional rollback; the second used a dispersion modeling study and proportional rollback; and the last was based on straight rollback; however, the last demonstration failed to show maintenance through 1997. EPA believes that the failure of the third demonstration to show maintenance through 1997 is due to the SIP's low estimate of imported residential woodsmoke. In the ``Evaluation of Attainment Demonstration'' section of the accompanying TSD, EPA considered additional information and analyses in assessing the maintenance demonstration, including using rollback that differs from the SIP in its estimate of the amount of residential wood combustion affecting the airshed. EPA believes that after evaluating all of the studies of the Tacoma Tideflats, there is sufficient evidence to support an interpretation that imported residential wood combustion is a much stronger source of PM&hyph;10 than currently accounted for in the SIP. Similar to the demonstration of attainment presented in the ``Attainment Demonstration'' of the TSD, EPA believes a greater background value that accounts for a large importation of residential woodsmoke should be employed in the maintenance demonstration. Using the emission inventory, growth factors, and point source emission levels presented in the SIP, considering additional information about the contribution of residential wood combustion and employing the same background value as was used in the attainment demonstration discussed in the TSD, the rollback analysis demonstrates maintenance through 1997, and would therefore satisfy the initial quantitative milestones due for this area, as discussed in part II.6 below. However, as with the attainment demonstration, some of the control measures relied on to demonstrate continued maintenance of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS in the SIP are deficient because they are not reflected in enforceable emission limitations. See CAA sections 110(a)(2)(A) & 172(c)(6). The State has committed to address this deficiency and, based on section 110(k)(4) of the CAA, EPA is conditionally approving the submittal relative to the quantitative milestone and reasonable further progress requirements discussed below. The accompanying TSD discusses the dispersion, receptor and saturation studies conducted in the Tacoma Tideflats, estimates the amount of PM&hyph;10 attributable to residential wood combustion, and presents a rollback demonstration for attainment and maintenance that incorporates the estimate that 35&hyph;45 percent of the PM&hyph;10 in the Tacoma Tideflats on the design day is attributable to residential wood combustion. The reader is referred to the TSD associated with this document for a more detailed discussion of any of these points. 5. PM&hyph;10 Precursors The control requirements which are applicable to major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10, also apply to major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10 precursors unless EPA determines such sources do not contribute significantly to PM&hyph;10 levels in excess of the NAAQS in that area (see section 189(e) of the Act). The General Preamble contains guidance addressing how EPA intends to implement section 189(e) of the Act (see 57 FR 13539&hyph;13540 and 13541&hyph;13542). The three receptor modeling studies conducted in the Tacoma Tideflats show that sulfates and nitrates are not a significant portion of the Tacoma PM&hyph;10 in the airshed. The three studies are discussed in the TSD. The two receptor modeling studies conducted during the 1980s show that nitrates accounted for less than 4 percent of the total PM&hyph;10 sampled mass, while sulfates contributed even less measuring less than 2.5 percent. The third receptor modeling study, the Evaluation of the Atmospheric Deposition of Toxic Contaminants to Puget Sound study was conducted in the Tacoma Tideflats during 1989 and 1990. The Atmospheric Deposition Study collected fine particulate (> 2.5 μm) and coarse particulate (> 50 μm). Most of the precursor particles would be occurring in the fine particle range. The analysis of the fine particles showed that SO 4 was 9.3 percent of the total mass of fine particles, while NO 3 accounted for approximately 5 percent of total mass of fine particles. As discussed in the ``Evaluation of Attainment Demonstration'' in the accompanying TSD, the Atmospheric Deposition Study was conducted during a period when the airshed was considerably cleaner than the design year. Moreover, control measures were in place during the Atmospheric Deposition Study's sampling period; five of the sampling days occurred during a ban on the use of uncertified woodstoves. Therefore, the results of this study are likely to show less PM&hyph;10 due to woodsmoke than probably occurred during the design year. Correspondingly, the study's assessment of the amount of SO 4 and NO 3 found in the airshed is likely to be greater on a percentage basis than would have been the case during the design year. Due to the relatively small amount of sulfates and nitrates in the airshed, EPA has determined that it is unlikely that precursors do not contribute significantly to PM&hyph;10 levels which exceed the NAAQS in Tacoma. In addition to these receptor analyses, a review of the emissions inventory for this area did not reveal any major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10 precursors. The effect of this finding is to exclude major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10 precursors from PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area control requirements. While EPA is making a general finding about the contribution of PM&hyph;10 precursors for Tacoma, the determination is based on the current character of the area including the existing mix of sources in the area. It is possible, therefore, that future growth could change the significance of precursors in the area. The EPA intends to issue future guidance addressing such potential changes in the significance of precursor emissions in an area. 6. Quantitative Milestones and Reasonable Further Progress (RFP) The PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area plan revisions demonstrating attainment must contain quantitative milestones which are to be achieved every three (3) years until the area is redesignated attainment and which demonstrate RFP, as defined in section 171(1), toward attainment by December 31, 1994 (see section 189(c) of the Act). Reasonable further progress is defined in CAA section 171(1) as such annual incremental reductions in emissions of the relevant air pollutant as are required by Part D or may reasonably be required by the Administrator for the purpose of ensuring attainment of the applicable NAAQS by the applicable date. While section 189(c) plainly provides that quantitative milestones are to be achieved until an area is redesignated attainment, it is silent in indicating the starting point for counting the first 3-year period or how many milestones must be initially addressed. In the General Preamble, EPA addressed the statutory gap in the starting point for counting the 3-year milestones, indicating that it would begin from the due date for the applicable implementation plan revision containing the control measures for the area (i.e., November 15, 1991 for initial moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas). See 57 FR 13539. As to the number of milestones, EPA believes that at least two milestones must be initially addressed. Thus, submittals to address the SIP revisions due on November 15, 1991 for the initial moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas must demonstrate timely attainment of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS, the second milestone should, at a minimum, provide for continued maintenance of the standards. 5 5 Section 189(c) provides that quantitative milestones are to be achieved ``until the area is redesignated attainment.'' However, this endpoint for quantitative milestones is speculative because redesignation of an area as attainment is contingent upon several factors and future events. EPA believes it is unreasonable to require planning for each nonattainment area to cover quantitative milestones years into the future because of the possibility that such time may elapse before an area is in fact redesignated attainment. On the other hand, EPA believes it is reasonable for States initially to submit a sufficient number of milestones to ensure that there is continuing air quality protection beyond the attainment deadline. Addressing two milestones will ensure that the State continues to maintain the NAAQS beyond the attainment date for at least some period during which an area could be redesignated attainment. However, in all instances, additional milestones must be addressed if an area is not redesignated attainment within the time period covered by the initial milestones. In implementing RFP for this initial moderate area, EPA has reviewed the attainment demonstration and control strategy for the area to assess whether the initial milestones have been satisfied and to determine whether annual incremental reductions, different from those provided in the SIP, should be required in order to ensure attainment of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS by December 31, 1994 (see CAA section 171(1)). As indicated, the State of Washington's PM&hyph;10 SIP for Tacoma demonstrates attainment in 1994 and maintenance through 1997, and therefore would satisfy RFP and initial quantitative milestones (see 57 FR 13539) if all of the control measures relied upon were reflected in enforceable emission limitations. However, as discussed previously, WDOE and PSAPCA based attainment and maintenance demonstrations on actual emission estimates instead of the required allowable rates. The State has committed to adopt the necessary enforceable allowable emission limits by January 1, 1995. Accordingly, as with other requirements discussed elsewhere in this document, EPA is conditionally approving the submittal relative to the RFP and initial milestone requirements. CAA section 110(k)(4). 7. Enforceability Issues All measures and other elements in the SIP must be enforceable by WDOE and EPA (see CAA sections 172(c)(6), 110(a)(2)(A) and 57 FR 13556). EPA criteria addressing the enforceability of SIP's and SIP revisions were stated in a September 23, 1987, memorandum (with attachments) from J. Craig Potter, Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation, et al. (see 57 FR 13541). Nonattainment area plan provisions must also contain a program that provides for enforcement of the control measures and other elements in the SIP (see CAA section 110(a)(2)(C)). WDOE's control measures and regulations for control of Particulate Matter, which are contained in the SIP, are addressed above under the section headed ``RACM (including RACT).'' These control measures apply to the types of activities identified in that discussion including, for example, fugitive emissions from point sources; vehicle resuspended road dust; and residential wood combustion. The SIP provides that the affected activities will be controlled throughout the entire nonattainment area. The TSD contains further information on enforceability requirements including enforceable emission limitations; a description of the rules contained in the SIP and the source types subject to them; test methods and compliance schedules; malfunction provisions; excess emission provisions; correctly cited references of incorporated methods/rules; and reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Both WDOE and PSAPCA have responsibilities in the implementation and enforcement of control measures in the Tacoma nonattainment area. PSAPCA retains authority over all area sources and all but the two stationary sources in Tacoma that are regulated by the Department of Ecology. PSAPCA has many compliance inspectors and, as discussed further in the TSD, EPA considers PSAPCA's staffing level adequate to ensure that the Tacoma attainment plan is fully implemented. As a necessary adjunct of its enforcement program, PSAPCA also has broad powers to adopt rules and regulations, issue orders, assess penalties, require access to records and information, and receive and disburse funds. The Washington State Department of Ecology has adequate authority to implement and enforce the plan in the event PSAPCA fails to make a good faith effort to implement and/or enforce the regulations. The two point sources in the Tacoma nonattainment area not under PSAPCA's jurisdiction are the Simpson Tacoma Kraft Company and Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical Corporation. These sources are regulated by the Washington State Department of Ecology. The Washington State Department of Ecology's legal authorities, personnel and funding sources are discussed in the accompanying TSD. EPA finds these authorities and funding mechanisms adequate to ensure that the State will be able to enforce the control measures in the Tacoma nonattainment area. Controls on area sources, such as the residential wood combustion program and the fugitive dust control program are also enforceable. Discussion and justification of EPA's reasoning can be found in the control measure section of this document and the TSD. However, as discussed elsewhere in this document, the use of actual emission estimates rather than the significantly higher emission limits allowed in the current WDOE or PSAPCA regulations is unacceptable. WDOE, PSAPCA, and EPA could only enforce the allowable emissions that are currently contained in the WDOE or PSAPCA regulations. There are no mechanisms for any of the regulatory agencies to enforce the emission estimates used in the attainment and maintenance demonstration because they are well below the legal limits allowed in the WDOE or PSAPCA regulations. A discussion regarding the use of actual instead of allowable emissions contained in the demonstration portion of this document provides background for the enforceability decision. The Region is granting a conditional approval of the Tacoma attainment plan based on the commitment contained in the June 30, 1994, submittal which will make the emissions from point sources enforceable at or below the levels used to demonstrate attainment and maintenance. EPA will need additional technical documentation from WDOE if the emission levels in the regulatory orders are greater than those used in the attainment and three year maintenance demonstrations. Additionally, WDOE would need to provide cogent attainment and maintenance demonstrations in order for the SIP to be fully approved. 8. Contingency Measures As provided in section 172(c)(9) of the Act, all moderate nonattainment area SIP's that demonstrate attainment must include contingency measures (see generally 57 FR 13510&hyph;13512 & 13543&hyph;13544). These measures must be submitted by November 15, 1993, for the initial moderate nonattainment areas. Contingency measures should consist of other available measures that are not part of the area's core control strategy. These measures must take effect without further action by the State or EPA, upon a determination by EPA that the area has failed to make RFP or attain the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS by the applicable statutory deadline. Assessing the adequacy of Tacoma's contingency measures is tied to the attainment demonstration because Tacoma has submitted industrial emissions controls in excess of those needed to demonstrate timely attainment of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS as a contingency measure. As discussed above, Simpson's boiler replacement alone represents a 984 kg/day reduction in emissions, almost half of Simpson's previous emissions, or roughly 19 percent of the total baseline emissions inventory. Based on the rollback discussion provided in the accompanying TSD, the Tacoma SIP contains emissions limits and contingency measures that provide for reductions greater than the 25 percent contingency measure emissions reduction value suggested in the General Preamble (57 FR 13543&hyph;13544). Further discussion can be found in the ``Contingency Measure'' section of the accompanying TSD. The contingency measures submitted as part of the Tacoma SIP ranged from a commitment to implement mobile source controls to crediting the emission limitations already existing in the SIP that would be in excess of those needed to address the RACM (including RACT) requirement. The two mobile source contingency measures in the 1991 SIP were directed at reducing emissions from diesel vehicles: (1) the establishment of an inspection and maintenance (I/M) program, and (2) the reduction in sulfur content of on-highway diesel fuel. In 1993, Washington State expanded its I/M program to include the Tacoma area, and the desulfurization program was implemented nationally. Only the measures that are being implemented prior to a determination that the area has failed to timely attain or achieve RFP, that would be in excess of those necessary to provide for timely attainment of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS and that, therefore, go beyond RACM (including RACT) can be relied on as contingency measures. The measures will provide for continued emissions reduction progress beyond the core control strategy. Further, because the State would implement these precautionary measures prior to a determination that the area has failed to timely attain the NAAQS or achieve RFP, these measures essentially provide advance contingency benefit and satisfy the requirement that they ``take effect . . . without further action by the State, or the Administrator.'' EPA believes it would be unreasonable to penalize or otherwise discourage the State from taking the arguably more precautionary air quality management step of accelerating the implementation of these contingency measures. However, it cannot be determined whether these measures are in excess of those necessary to provide for expeditious attainment and necessary to address RACM (including RACT) until the State addresses the deficiencies associated with its core control strategy. As indicated elsewhere, the State has committed to convert measures necessary to address RACM (including RACT) to enforceable emission limitations. Until this commitment is fulfilled, EPA cannot conclude that the contingency measures go beyond the core control strategy. Therefore, EPA is conditionally approving these contingency measures. Due to the submission of emission reductions that are purportedly in excess of those necessary to demonstrate timely attainment and necessary to satisfy RACM as a contingency measure, final approval or disapproval of these contingency measures must be determined when WDOE submits the regulatory orders establishing enforceable emission limits for the stationary sources in the Tacoma Tideflats. III. Implications of This Action EPA conditionally approves the plan revisions submitted to EPA for the Tacoma, Washington, nonattainment area on November 15, 1991, and June 30, 1994, except for the following elements which EPA approves in full. EPA also approves, without conditions, the separable exclusion from precursor controls as described in part II.5 above, the monitoring network, the procedures for consultation and public notification, the provisions for revising the plan and the adequacy of funding and authority. EPA will assess the final approvability of the submittals EPA is conditionally approving after the State fulfills its commitment to submit enforceable emission limitations by January 1, 1995. If the State fails to comply with its commitment, the conditional approval will become a disapproval. IV. Administrative Review This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the Federal Register on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2224), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. OMB has exempted this regulatory action from Executive Order 12866 review. Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by December 12, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (see CAA section 307(b)(2), 42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(2)). The EPA is publishing this action without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. This action will be effective on December 12, 1994 unless adverse comments are received by November 14, 1994. If the EPA receives adverse comments, the direct final rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on the proposed rule (please see the proposed rule published, simultaneously, in the proposal section of this Federal Register ). Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq. , EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. Conditional approvals of SIP submittals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any new requirements, EPA certifies that it does not have a significant impact on small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds. Union Electric Co. v. U.S. E.P.A. , 427 U.S. 246, 256&hyph;66 (S.Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2). If the conditional approval is converted to a disapproval under section 110(k), based on the State's failure to meet the commitment, it will not affect any existing State requirements applicable to small entities. Federal disapproval of the State submittal does not affect its State-enforceability. Moreover, EPA's disapproval of the submittal does not impose a new Federal requirement. Therefore, EPA certifies that this disapproval action does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities because it does not remove existing State requirements nor does it substitute a new Federal requirement. Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any State implementation plan. Each request for revision to the State implementation plan shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.
