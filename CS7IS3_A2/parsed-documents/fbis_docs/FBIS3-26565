The State Council, China's cabinet also decided to delegate more power to local governments for taxing animal slaughter and banquets. The five obsolete items had covered trade fairs, livestock trading, salary adjustments, bonuses and oil burning. China introduced the bonus tax in the early 1980s to prevent inflation. The country's economy at that time was just lifting from a decade-long low, and enterprises were paying more to their employees because of improved efficiencies. In particular, managers of State run enterprises, who were able to control their ventures for a designated period of time on a contractual basis, tried to win the support of employees by lining their wallets. Caught off guard by the freewheeling bonus-giving, the State Council created the bonus tax on enterprises in 1984. The provision stipulated that a State-run industrial or commercial enterprise was subject to taxation if its annual bonuses to employees exceeded an amount equal to their standard salaries for two and a half months. The bonus tax rate could be as high as 300 per cent. The tax successfully curbed the practice of raising bonus levels, thereby easing the country's inflationary pressures. But that was only one side of the coin. The bonus tax also hampered a quick increase of individual incomes in China. The new individual income tax law took effect at the beginning of this year, replacing the old bonus (and salary adjustment) tax. Under the new system, enterprises find it easier to raise the employees' income levels. However now the individuals, not the units must pay the tax for their extra income, including bonuses. The emphasis on individual rights and obligations comes closer to international practice and effectively relieves the enterprises' burden, while steering away from possible inflationary hikes. Chinese individuals are now liable for taxation if their monthly income (including bonuses) surpasses 800 yuan ($92). The ceiling will be higher for taxable foreigners, but the amount is still to be decided by the State Council. Economists said the structural reform of China's tax system will not cause a heavier burden on tax payers. China will tax only 18 items, compared with more than 30 in the past decades. Yesterday's announcement reflects the State's consideration to strike a virtual balance between the revenues of central and local governments.
