The first lecture, entitled: "The Great Significance and Main Points of the 'Decision' adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee," is given by Zeng Peiyan, vice minister in charge of the State Planning Commission. Zeng begins by briefly introducing the 10-part series, which is cosponsored by the CPC Central Committee's Propaganda Department and State Council's General Office, and is aimed at helping viewers "accurately grasp the contents of the several major reform programs currently going on in the finance and taxation, banking, foreign trade, investment, and enterprise systems." According to Zeng, the titles of the remaining eight lectures are: The Industry and Business Tax System, The Foreign Exchange Control System, Separated Financial and Taxation System, The Banking System, Mechanisms for Price Formulation, The Financial Investment System, The Foreign Trade System, and The Modern Enterprise System. The final part in the series is a question and answer session on the lectures. As he turns to the subject of first lecture -- the decision on establishment a socialist market economic structure -- the vice minister underscores the "profound, practical, and far-reaching historical significance" of the decision, hailing the major CPC document as "a concrete expression of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics" and "program of action for building a socialist market economy." He cites the decision at length to explain the development of productive forces as the basic task of socialism, saying: "The socialist market economic structure is linked with the basic system of socialism, and the establishment of this structure is aimed at enabling the market to play the fundamental role in resource allocations under macro- economic control by the state." Hence, in the course of reform, he stresses that we must "decide on the various steps of reform and judge their success or failure by always adhering to the basic criterion of whether they help develop the productive forces of socialist society, enhance the overall strength of the socialist state, and improve the people's living standards." He outlines the contents of the decision, which consists of 50 sections in 10 parts involving reforms in various aspects of Chinese economic life, as well as stresses the need for the CPC to strengthen leadership in striving to initiate the socialist market economy by the end of this century. Describing the "basic features" of the decision, he notes its consistency in summarizing experiences in socialist construction since the PRC's founding and its emphasis on coordination between various reform programs. At 1350 GMT the vice minister concludes the lecture by saying: The establishment of socialist market economy is a pioneering undertaking unprecedented in history and it requires tackling many extremely complicated problems. However, so long as the Chinese people unswervingly adhere to Deng's theory and the party's basic line, they can stand all kinds of tests and successfully achieve the great goals of reform, opening to the outside world, and modernization.
