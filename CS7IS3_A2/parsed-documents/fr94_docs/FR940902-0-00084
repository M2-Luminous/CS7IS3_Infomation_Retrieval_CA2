FR940902-0-00084 FR940902-0-00010 A few commenters noted an ambiguity in the interim final regulations, that §628.804(d) and (e) limit the provision of preemployment and work maturity skills training and work experience, in addition to job search assistance, unless they are accompanied by additional services; while §628.535(b)(2) states, as an example, that work experience can be combined with job search training. Accordingly, §628.535(b)(2) is revised to specifically exclude this example as well as other services which may not be used to meet the combination requirement. Additional services which may be provided in conjunction with job search may include the training services specified in JTPA section 204(b)(1), except stand-alone skill assessment, counseling, work experience and case management, and the direct training services listed in 264(b) of the Act excluding tutoring, stand-alone skill assessment, counseling, work experience and case management. Commenters also pointed out that the title II&hyph;C program does not contain an ``exceptions'' provision to this requirement as section 204(c)(2)(B)(ii) of the Act does for the title II&hyph;A program. To address this inconsistency, §628.535(c) is amended to state that the exceptions are not applicable to title II&hyph;C. On the other hand, it is important to note that, for the purposes of this section, because title II&hyph;C in-school youth are enrolled in educational programs, they meet the requirement of being enrolled in ``other additional services'' (§628.804(d) and (e)). The Volunteer Program Several commenters felt that the requirements at §628.540 were too restrictive and burdensome. In response, and in consideration of the principle that a volunteer program should, in fact, be voluntary for former participants, the Department is removing the goals, objectives and documentation requirements in the final rule. Section 628.540, as revised, merely repeats the statutory requirement which the Department believes is self-explanatory. The Department encourages the SDA's to work with former participants to have them share their experiences in the program and in the workplace with current participants. The Department also advises the SDA's to document any use of JTPA funds for this volunteer program. Linkages and Coordination Sections 205 and 265 of the Act require that SDA's operating adult and year-round youth programs establish appropriate linkages with other Federal human resource programs, including Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) JOBS program, the Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Comprehensive Modernization Program, the Department of Energy's (DOE) Low Income Weatherization Grant program and programs under the National Service Act. Other linkages may also be established with appropriate State and local educational, social service, and public housing agencies, including CBO's, business and labor organizations, volunteer groups and others, such as women and older worker organizations, to avoid duplication and to enhance the delivery of services. In addition, youth programs are required to establish linkages with appropriate educational agencies which include formal agreements for procedures for referring and serving in-school youth, methods of assessment, notification when students drop out of school, and arrangements with educational agencies for services for in-school and out-of-school youth. These provisions are reflected in §628.545. Several commenters urged that coordination should begin at the Federal level. The Department agrees and has begun discussions with a number of other Federal agencies to increase coordination at the Federal level and, as the commenters requested, to seek ways to develop common definitions and procedures applicable across program lines. The commenters were concerned that all the responsibility for coordination rests on the JTPA system. It is, of course, true that the Act and these regulations, since they focus on the JTPA system place a burden on the system to be a prime mover in the process of developing coordinated program relationships. A State or SDA is required to make good faith efforts to seek coordination and cooperation where it is possible to do so. Several commenters questioned the ability of SDA's to establish appropriate linkages if other agencies are not operating under similar mandates. Some comments recommended that the Governor encourage coordination efforts through the SJTCC and, where feasible, develop agreements at the State level which would provide the basis and authority for local agreements and ensure the best utilization of funds between agencies. The Department agrees that these recommendations are a good way to establish effective and systematic coordination and language to this effect is added to §628.545(a). The new language recognizes both the SJTCC and the HRIC, whichever is in place in a State, as useful focus points for coordination efforts. In addition, a few comments referred to the importance of the SDA's documenting instances of attempted coordination efforts and of sharing this information with the Governor's office. This provision also is included in §628.545(a) to link State coordination agreements with local achievements by means of the job training plans. In addition, to emphasize the importance of ``one-stop shop'' career centers and seamless ``single point of contact'' delivery systems, which was the concern of several commenters, a new §628.545(b) is added. SDA's are encouraged to facilitate such delivery systems in coordination with other agencies, which may include both the development of ISS plans and of a common program application, as well as a unified job development effort and comprehensive program design. Such linkages may provide for a JTPA entity jointly funding or administering a program with funds from another agency, such as an SDA jointly funding aspects of a public housing agency's Comprehensive Modernization Program or the local JOBS program. Alternatively, when appropriate, the SDA could earmark funds to be spent within public housing areas for services to residents.
