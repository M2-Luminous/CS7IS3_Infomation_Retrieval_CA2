What is important in the new period is to maintain political stability in order to gradually achieve economic, cultural, and social development, as well as strengthening of national defense and security. Taking advantage of the renovation policy, open borders, and international circulation, the adversary forces from without have been strengthening their infiltration across the borders, maintaining contact with the reactionaries within the country to develop their strength, and building covert installations along the borders and the coast. Through touristic activities, visits with relatives, and border crossings, they have been bringing in people, means, and reactionary materials to support the forces within the country. They have been taking advantage particularly of our ethnic people's current economic difficulties in order to incite them, to distort our party's policies and line, and thus to destroy their confidence in the party, and at the same time using economic means to gain the support of the masses, to attract them to their side, and to gradually create an opposition force fighting against the revolution. In the last several years, they had been taking advantage of the nationalistic and freedom-of-religion policies adopted by our party to engage in illegal propaganda, with the hope that they could raise complicated political issues, gain influence toward the masses, and cause instability from within, particularly in border areas, where the standard of living and intellectual capacity of the people remained low. Although the development of a market economy and business deals with foreign countries was active, there appeared a lot of complications such as across-the-border smuggling, criminal acts, and social ills, which sometimes destabilized law and order in border areas and made the border defense troops' responsibility for protecting and managing the borders much heavier. In the last 5 years, the forces in charge of the southern sea zone caught 596 foreign boats which had violated our fishing grounds. With active support from the people, the border defense troops handled 186 cases of illegal border entries and 8,567 major cases of smuggling involving 533 cars and motorcycles, 2,284 kilograms of opium, and so on. To help the people, particularly the ethnic people, has always been considered by the border defense troops their central work. Their activities, such as "medical doctors of blue military rank" and "teachers of blue military rank," reflecting their spirit of sacrifice in saving the people in natural disasters like storms and floods, and in sharing food and clothing with the people, have further strengthened the close relationships between the army and the people. On 22 February 1989, the Council of Ministers issued Decision 16/HDBT to set the 3rd day of March every year as the Border Defense Day. Since the promulgation of this decision, party committee echelons, local administrations, mass organizations, and social organizations have been showing their wholehearted interest in turning the activities on "Border Defense Day" into a widespread movement being carried out in many rich and lively forms. In border provinces and cities throughout the country, many movements, such as "assault youth being the masters of borders," women "for our borders," "peaceful hamlets," "model elders and village chiefs," and so on, have succeeded in mobilization.
