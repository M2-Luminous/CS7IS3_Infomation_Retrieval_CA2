The plan has entered the process of approval by the EU [European Union] Commission. Papandoniou dismissed rumors to the contrary and stressed that through the five years of the plan, real wages and pensions will experience a positive increase. Correspondent Mimi Spiropoulou has the following report. [Begin Spiropoulou recording] National Economy Minister Ioannis Papandoniou announced the basic directions of the amended convergence plan and stressed that the plan includes policies that aim for social justice and economic growth, and that reflect the economic philosophy of the PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] government. The plan's philosophy provides for gradual acceleration of the rate of the GNP [Gross National Product] from 1.1 percent this year to 2.6 percent by 1997 and 3.5 percent by 1999. As is known, the minister stressed, the fiscal handling by New Democracy led to surpassing the deficit of the state budget by thousands [as heard] of drahmas in relation to the goal. That represented an excess of 5 percent of the GNP. In general, the convergence plan provides that from 1996, there will be a clear trend toward decreasing the ratio of the public deficit to the GNP. The convergence plan also puts emphasis on the fiscal adjustment that will result from an increase in revenues and a decrease in expenditures. However, the government ruled out the possibility of new taxes. The increase of revenues will come from direct and indirect taxes. The national economy minister stressed that, regarding new hiring in the public sector, there is a commitment for a drastic decrease. On the other hand, the limitation on the public deficit will be facilitated by the 150 billion drahmas that will be available annually from the sale of shares of DEKO [Public Firms and Organizations]. The sale of OTE [Greek Telecommunications Company] and DEP [Public Petroleum Corporation] shares on the stock market is planned for 1994. Regarding inflation, the convergence plan aims for a decrease by 2.5 percent annually on average, ending with 5.9 percent in 1999 down from 10.8 percent which is the figure today. [passage omitted] [end recording] Former National Economy Minister Stefanos Manos criticized the process with which the convergence plan was submitted. Furthermore, Political Spring Chairman Andonios Samaras said at Thessaloniki Airport that the convergence plan is an austerity program. [Begin recording] [Manos] They [the government] will be discussing it with the Europeans and they do not show it to us. Today they present it as if they had agreed on it with the foreigners. [Samaras] In the next few days we will submit a plan for convergence through growth. Without dialogue, the government today submitted a convergence plan, unfortunately through austerity again. [end recording] Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said that the Greek economy's convergence plan does not include any surprises, but it represents a systematization and confirmation of the already implemented fiscal and tax policy. He stressed that there was a need to draw up a new convergence plan, because the previous one drawn up by New Democracy was impossible to implement and did not lead anywhere. The spokesman also said that New Democracy's reaction yesterday was unjustified, improvised, contradictory and politically motivated. Venizelos said that New Democracy should have had the wisdom to wait and study the convergence plan before opening wounds for which it is responsible. He stressed that it is not enough to say one supports the national economy, but it is necessary to put one's plan into effect too.
