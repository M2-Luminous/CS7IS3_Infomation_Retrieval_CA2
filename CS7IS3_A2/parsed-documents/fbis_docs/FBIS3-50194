"Who could think five years ago that in 1994 I would speak in front of a Bulgarian Parliament elected by democratic means, but even then one could feel the first signs of the coming change," President Mitterrand said, recalling his previous visit to this country in January 1989, several months before the downfall of the communist regime. The French president came to Bulgaria on condition that he would meet dissidents. He stressed that he has good memories from this country, from his meetings with Bulgarian students whose courage he then admired. Often Mr. Mitterrand's address was interrupted by applause. "I want to express my admiration and respect for how much you have accomplished in such short terms, because you had to build a new society, starting from nothing," the French guest said. He stressed on his respect for the Bulgarian Parliament several times. Mr. Mitterrand spoke in general terms, giving also his personal evaluation, about the democratic values, freedom and the hardships accompanying an economic reform. The French president stressed that Bulgaria will be the first East European country to preside over the Council of Europe's Committee of Ministers. "Believe me, both Bulgaria and Europe have made a progress," he said. The speaker went on to say that France is most supportive of a speedy ratification of a number of accords Central and East European states have signed with the European Union (EU). He said that France may be expected to ratify the agreement on Bulgaria's association with the EU by the end of April. Mr. Mitterrand pledged to insist that this issue be settled in the first days of the French Parliament's session. These words were met with loud applause. The French president evaluated in highly positive terms this country's desire to join the European states. "Europe belongs to you as much as it belongs to us," Mr. Mitterrand said. He said that Bulgaria has already found decisions to unsolvable problems and went on to cite as an example the peaceful co-existence of Bulgarians with the Turkish-speaking community here. "The Balkan Peninsula will probably hold you up as a model," the French president stressed, adding that Bulgaria could have a positive influence on the other Balkan countries. He praised highly Bulgaria's stand on the Yugo-conflict and the strict observation of the UN sanctions which costed this country a lot. "You lost profits but win international recognition and Europe's respect," he said. "Any European country which sees a threat should rely on the solidarity of the other democratic states," President Mitterrand said, commenting on the Partnership for Peace plan. According to him, it is unthinkable that Bulgaria could face any threat and not have the support of the other democratic countries. Mr. Mitterrand said that France had tabled a European security pact to be put to discussion in Paris this April. He expressed his hope that this conference would turn into a new forum, which Bulgaria will choose to join. The speaker also expounded his idea for an European confederation. The French president traced back in history the roots of the Bulgarian-French relations and commented on their future. He concluded his address expressing the hope that Bulgarian President Zhelev will pay an official visit to France sometime soon. Introducing French President Mitterrand to the Bulgarian MP's, National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov said that they themselves could see how far Bulgaria had reached along the road of deep democratic changes. During his visit at the Bulgarian Parliament, Mr. Mitterrand was accompanied by his wife Danielle Mitterrand. Bulgarian President Zhelev, Prime Minister Berov and ministers were also present to hear President Mitterrand's address. Since 1990, the Bulgarian Parliament have been addressed by Israeli President Chaim Herzog (June 1991), King Juan Carlos II of Spain (May 1993) and Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro (July 1993).
