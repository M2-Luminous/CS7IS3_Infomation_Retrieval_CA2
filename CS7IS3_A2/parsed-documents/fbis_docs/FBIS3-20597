In this letter, he related the living difficulties of coal miners. I reproduce some passages below: "In this era of opening and reform, the domestic economy is increasing rapidly. Through 31 December (1993), our mine has had 1,373 continuous days of safe production, our No. 1 Coal Mining Area has had as much as 7,019 continuous days of safe production, and in addition, we have accomplished the entire year's assigned output 20 days ahead of schedule." "However, in our coal mine it is hard to even pay wages, let alone give out bonuses. In 1993, there was no one in the entire mine who received full wages. The mine leaders decided to pay 90 percent (of their wages) to the first line workers who work underground, 80 percent to the second line workers, while they themselves received only 35 percent. In the mine's electronic section, supply section, and labor service company, not only were just 80 percent of the wages given out, they also only gave 100 people the wages of 90 people, leaving them to work out the shortages. How are they supposed to cope with this?" "The problem is coal's lack of value. It now costs more than 71 yuan to produce one ton of coal, while it can only be sold at a fixed price of 67 yuan, so that producing one ton of coal causes the mine to suffer a loss of over 4 yuan. The more coal we produce, the greater the loss. We have heard that the prices of steel, wood, and cement--essential goods for mining coal--will rise in 1994, and that tax revenue will rise from (1993's) 2.17 yuan per ton to 13.6 yuan per ton. So the cost of producing each ton of coal will be up to 100 yuan. At that time, we fear that we coal miners will not have enough to eat." "Everyone knows that a coal miner's work is very hard. While making more contributions to society, we hope that our lives will improve year by year along with the whole nation." That same afternoon, I took the letter to the Urumqi Bureau of Mining Affairs, located in the city's suburbs. The leaders of the Bureau were not there, but the person in charge of the Planning Department was, and after reading the letter, said frankly that, "This matter of inability to pay wages is not just confined to the Jiangou coal mine. To some degree it exists in every one of the Bureau's coal mines. The major cause is the lower coal price for the State-owned coal mines. In 1993, the average coal price for the whole bureau was only 68 yuan, while the prices for the "three types of materials" needed for coal mining have been going up, the cost of maintaining and replacing coal mining facilities has risen, the level of charges by relevant industries and departments for producing and selling things linked to mining are also rising. These increases have pushed the per ton cost of to more than 90 yuan. When there is a major increase in the cost of production, while the price of coal is fixed and cannot be raised, it is inevitable that enterprises will suffer losses." "It is not just our bureau: the entire coal enterprise industry is suffering losses. In the past, there was a State subsidy given to our State-owned key coal mines, more than 10 yuan for every ton of coal produced. With the key State-owned coal mines from throughout Xinjiang having an output of over 4.4 million tons of coal, the amount of the subsidy got up to more than 60 million yuan. Since 1993, the State has gradually relaxed the price of coal and reduced the subsidy, to push State-owned key coal mines to the market. Although these are good measures, much depends on how they are implemented. Look, the subsidy to our Bureau was cut by more than half, but the price of coal hasn't be relaxed completely. In addition, default payments are hard to get, many mine directors are very worried at payday, and even the cleverest housewife can't cook a meal without rice--one can't make bricks without straw." At the Bureau's Publicity Section, I saw the "Information Extracts Report" edited by the Bureau and issued on 7 January. The report listed the Bureau's debit account: there was a debit of 9.32 million yuan for safe production facilities and equipment, a debit of 19.41 million yuan for developing production, a debit of 16.37 million yuan for construction projects, and a debit of 23.56 millon yuan for staff and workers' welfare. The construction company attached to the Bureau was listed as in "extreme difficulties", with 80 percent of its workers paid only 75 yuan for living expenses in 1993. On the afternoon of the 15th, I called at the office Li Yifan [2621 0111 0416], Vice General Manager of the Xinjiang Coal Shipping and Marketing Company, seeking his opinions concerning relaxing the price of coal. He said that it is imperative to relax the coal price in Xinjiang's State-owned key mines; this would be an important step towards putting enterprises onto the track of the market economy and to compete on an equal footing with local and privately owned coal mines. The mining affairs bureaus in Ningxia, Shanxi, Henan, and Xinjiang Hami have raised their coal prices from 20 to 30 yuan, but nothing has been done in the Urumqi Bureau of Mining Affairs. "The Autonomous Region's government leaders care about reform in coal enterprises and the lives of coal miners." Vice General Manager Li told me that after repeated estimates, Vice Chairmen Wang Lequan [3769 2867 3123] and Wang Yousan [3769 2589 0005] have approved a 30 yuan per ton rise in the price of coal, which has brought it up to 98 yuan per ton since 1 January 1994. This will undoubtedly be good news for the Bureau's 12,000 coal miners." Will the rise in coal prices affect the lives of the Xinjiang Autonomous Region's masses? Vice general Li's answer is, "The whole of Xinjiang produces over 22 million tons of coal every year. About one-tenth of this, about 2 million tons, is from the Urumqi Bureau. It won't have too much affect on the lives of the masses."
