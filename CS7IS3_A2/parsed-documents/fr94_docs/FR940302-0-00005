SUMMARY: On November 29, 1993, the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) issued an interim rule to the regulations for the livestock emergency programs, which are authorized by the Agricultural Act of 1949 as amended, and the CCC Charter Act. The interim rule, provided an amended and simplified method for determining the value of livestock feed needs. Other minor changes to update the regulations included changes in weight ranges and an appropriate amount of energy required to provide the daily maintenance needs for dairy goats; determining pasture value; applying the $50,000 payment limitation to crop year rather than calendar year; and calculating interest on refunds due CCC. This rule adopts as final the interim rule published on November 29, 1993. EFFECTIVE DATE: March 2, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: James C. Williams, Program Specialist, Emergency Operations and Livestock Programs Division, Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, United States Department of Agriculture, P.O.

Based on information complied by the Department, it has been determined that this final rule: (1) Would have an annual effect on the economy of less than $100 million; (2) Would not adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; (3) Would not create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency: (4) Would not alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or rights and obligations of recipients thereof; and (5) Would not raise novel, legal, or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or principles set forth in Executive Order 12866. Regulatory Flexibility Act It has been determined that the Regulatory Flexibility Act is not applicable to this final rule since the CCC is not required by 5 U.S.C. 553 or any other provision of law to publish a notice of proposed rulemaking with respect to the subject matter of these determinations. Environmental Evaluation It has been determined by an environmental evaluation that this action will not have a significant impact on the quality of the human environment. Therefore, neither an Environmental Assessment nor an Environmental Impact Statement is needed. Federal Assistance Program The title and number of the Federal Assistance Program, as found in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance, to which this rule applies are: Commodity Loans and Purchases_10.051. Executive Order 12778 This final rule has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12778. The provisions of the final rule do not preempt State laws and are not retroactive to 1992 and prior crop years. Before any judicial action may be brought regarding the provisions of this regulation, the administrative appeal provisions set forth at 7 CFR part 780 must be exhausted. Executive Order 12372 This program/activity is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. See notice related to 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V, published at 48 FR 29115 (June 24, 1983). Paperwork Reduction Act The amendments to 7 CFR part 1475 set forth in this final rule will not result in any change in the public reporting burden. Background An interim rule was published in the Federal Register on November 29, 1993, at 58 FR 62510 which amended 7 CFR part 1475 to provide for administering CCC's livestock emergency programs. The interim rule amended §1475.3 to modify the definition for dairy cow ``weight ranges'' and to add a weight range for dairy goats in the table. The interim rule amended §1475.6: (1) Paragraph (c), to change the reference from CCC&hyph;653 to CCC&hyph;651; (2) Paragraph (e)(4), to clarify the manner in which pasture value is actually calculated for 1991 and subsequent crop years; (3) Paragraph (i)(1)(i)(A), to change the method for determining the value of livestock feed needs; and (4) Paragraph (i)(2)(iii), to correct a misprint in the Federal Register . The interim rule amended §1475.10(b) to clarify when the emergency livestock feed program may be suspended or terminated in a contiguous county. The interim rule amended §1475.17(a), (c), and (g) to clarify what type of interest will be charged on refunds to CCC. The interim rule amended §1475.22 to change the payment limitation from ``calendar'' year to ``crop'' year. The interim rule provided for a 30-day public comment period which ended on December 29, 1993. No comments were received during the comment period. Accordingly, under the authority of 7 U.S.C. 1427, and 1471&hyph;1471j and 15 U.S.C. 7146 and 714c, the interim rule amending 7 CFR part 1475, which was published at 58 FR 62510 on November 29, 1993, is adopted as a final rule without change. Signed at Washington, DC, on February 24, 1994. Bruce R. Weber, Executive Vice President, Commodity Credit Corporation.
