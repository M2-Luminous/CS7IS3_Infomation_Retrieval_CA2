He said that although the Thai Government tried to solve the problem and arrested the Thai businessmen for sending workers to Libya without official permits, there has been no change in the situation. The three companies are: the SPC Suphachok, or SPC Supertrade; V and M Engineering; and an affiliated firm of Wintrade and Winman. The ambassador said the three will be barred from doing business with American companies. Wirot Sakunmuthita, owner of the V and M Engineering Company, has denied the charges, but admitted designing and overseeing the construction of a "safety bunker" in a complex which the United States believes is the chemical weapons factory. Wirot said his arrest was politically motivated and carried out under U.S. pressure. He said he has cancelled all contracts to build "safety bunkers" in Libya. Following the arrest in October of Thai businesses sending workers to Libya, Libyan Leader Mu'ammar Al-Qadhdhafi threatened to expel Thai workers from his country. Although no concrete action was taken afterwards, hundreds of Thai workers left Libya for home. There are about 20,000 Thai workers left in Libya.
