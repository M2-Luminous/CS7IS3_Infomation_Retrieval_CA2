FBIS4-53567 "dreas098_a_94022" FBIS-EAS-94-098 Daily Report 20 May 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Four Lower House Members Defect From JNP Four Lower House Members Defect From JNP OW2005091894 Tokyo KYODO in English 0903 GMT 20 May 94 OW2005091894 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, May 20 KYODO -- Four House of Representatives members on Friday [20 May] defected from former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's Japan New Party [JNP] due to differences with the party leadership. They are Satoshi Arai, Yukio Edano, Yuichi Takami and Seiji Maehara, all of whom were elected to the lower house for the first time on the JNP ticket in last July's general election. "It was tough and painful to part from our colleagues...We will continue doing our utmost to revamp Japan's politics," Arai said at a news conference. The four will form a new parliamentary group and seek a tie-up with the 18-member parliamentary group of new party Sakigake [Harbinger]/Seiun and new party Mirai. They said their reason for quitting the two-year-old party rested in the formation of a new parliamentary group, Kaishin, in late April. Kaishin was abruptly established by ruling coalition parties, excluding the Social Democratic Party (SDP), a move that led to the SDP's withdrawal from the coalition and forced Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata to form the first minority government in 39 years. The lawmakers also noted they want to pursue a management style that differs from the JNP's, though they share political goals. Edano said he shares political ideals with a number of JNP members and hopes he can join forces with them in the future. On Thursday, Edano and Takami revealed they would quit the JNP, and Arai and Maehara decided to follow suit on Friday. Last month, three JNP members left the party after Hosokawa and his party leadership formed closer ties with key coalition strategist Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of the coalition's core party Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]. The three defectors established the Seiun group. Wtih the latest breakaway, the JNP's strength in the lower house is pared down to 33. Meanwhile, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai told a news conference the defection from the JNP -- a move that also reduces the strength of the ruling coalition -- is regrettable. But the top government spokesman also declared the governing forces will stay united and march forward despite the departure.
