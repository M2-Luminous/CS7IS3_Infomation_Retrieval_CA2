According to the report, a number of economic indicators provide evidence of Egypt's economic stability and the success of its economic liberalization policy, the most important of these being the decrease in the rate of inflation, stability of banking transactions, and an increase in domestic production of all types of energy. By means of an examination of the most important information that appeared in the annual report dealing with Egypt's economic performance in 1993, we can monitor the important economic indicators in this "economic thermometer." First we note the most important indicator of the economic stability, the success of the fiscal policy, and the monetary transactions, and this is the clear decrease in rates of inflation during the months of 1993, as opposed to the months of 1992. After inflation reached 22.1 percent in May of 1992, it began to decrease slowly during the subsequent months until it dropped to 13.6 percent by the end of the year. In 1993, inflation continued to gradually go down until May, when it was 10.6 percent, and then it once again went up slightly until it reached 12.1 percent during the months of November and December. The indicator of foreign currency exchange rates during 1993, until the end of the first week of February of the current year, shows an increase in the exchange rates of the dollar and the Japanese yen, whereas there was a decrease in the exchange rates of the pound sterling, the German mark, the French franc, and the unified European currency. Although the exchange rate of the dollar rose only slightly all during 1992, the dollar underwent lots of rate changes in during 1993. In January of 1992 its rate was 332.47 piasters, and in January of 1993 its rate was 333.76 piasters, but by January of 1994 its rate had risen to 337.24 piasters and it went up several milliemes by the first week of February of this year. Continuing Decrease The interest rate on treasury bonds continued to go down during the last two years. After having been 19.6 percent in October of 1991, it went down to 16.6 percent by the end of 1992 and was 14.4 percent by the end of 1993. The average interest rate by the first week of February of this year was 13.8 percent. This decrease had an effect on the continuation of the decrease of the average interest rate on deposits in Egyptian pounds. After the rate had been 18 percent in January of 1992, it went down to 15.2 percent by the end of the year. During the first half of 1993 it continued to decrease, and it has hovered around 12.5 percent since last July until the first week of February of this year, and it is expected to decrease slightly during the coming months. These expectations are reinforced by the decrease in the relative difference between the rate of inflation and the interest rates on deposits. During the months of November and December of last year, the rate of inflation reached 12.1 percent. Likewise, there was a continued decrease in the lending and discount rate, which had fallen to 20.5 percent in January of 1992, then 18.5 percent in January of 1993, and then 16.25 percent by January of 1994 and the first week of February of this year. However, actual loans made by banks indicated a transaction rate of 13 percent. Private sector loans in local currency from banks decreased during the second half of 1993, in spite of the liquidity that accumulated in the banks. Therefore expectations are that there probably will be a decrease in the loan interest rate, since this is one of the means by which one can emerge from the current situation of stagnation. Interest rates on U.S. dollar desposits have nearly stablilized. In January of 1993 they were around 3.25 percent, then they went down to 3.04 percent by April of last year, and have stayed at this point since then until the first week of February of this year Steady Increase All of the indicators dealing with the Suez Canal show an increase in 1993 compared with the previous year. The number of ships going through the canal increased by 798, or 4 percent, making the total 17,329. The number of oil tankers going through the canal increased by 51, or 1.6 percent, making the total 3,204. Consequently, tonnage carried by ships going through the canal increased by about 27 million tons, or 7 percent, making the total 397 million tons. This resulted in an increase in revenues of about $85 million, or 4.5 percent, making the total $l.96l billion. In the sea and air transport sector, there was an increase in the volume of nonpetroleum goods transported by sea and by air. The increase was 14 percent over last year, and totaled 25.987 million tons. In the sector of land transport, the total number of vehicles by October of 1993 was 2.236 million, of which 935,000 were private vehicles and 384,000 were trucks. Increase in Firms and Decrease in Bankruptcy The number of stock corporations obtaining operating licenses, increased by 29, or 10 percent, over last year, and they totaled 847. The Corporations Administration gave its approval to 594 of these companies, and the remaining 253 were approved by the Investment Authority. The capital of these corporations was 53 percent, or 2.803 billion pounds, less than the capital of companies which obtained licenses in 1992, thus making the 1993 total 2.133 billion Egyptian pounds, as opposed to 4.754 billion Egyptian pounds. [figures as published] Business bankruptcies went down to 4,798 during the first nine months of 1993, after they had totaled 5,918 during the same period in the previous year. The number of bankruptcies was lowest during March of 1993, whereas the highest rate was in May of 1993. Tourism Down Indicators showed a decrease in tourism in 1993, as compared with the previous year, of 29 percent in terms of the number of overnight stays in Egypt and 20 percent in terms of the number of tourists coming to Egypt. The number of tourists who came totaled 2.,503 million, representing a decrease of 643,000. The total number of overnight stays was 15.890 million, representing a decrease of 6.929 million. At the same time, there was only a very slight decrease in the average length of stay of the tourists, since this figure was 5.8 overnight stays as opposed to about 6.7 overnight stays. These indicators were also reflected in the total in income earned from tourism until November of 1993, which was $1.294 billion, representing a decrease of $953 million, or 42 percent, over the same time period in the previous year. Progress in Energy The forms of energy produced were as follows: The total production of generated electricity in 1993 was 47.937 million megawatt-hours. This represents an increase of 1509 million megawatt-hours, or 3.2 percent, over production in 1992. In spite of this increase, the total in electric services provided was about 1.788 million megawatt-hours, or 4.6 percent, less in 1993 than it was in 1992. Petroleum production for 1993 increased so that it totaled 46.364 trillion tons. This represents an increase of 1.109 million tons, or 2.4 percent, over the previous year. Petroleum consumption in 1993 also increased, totaling 21.707 million tons, representing an increase of 268,000 tons, or 1.2 percent, over the previous year. The percentage of domestic consumption of petroleum, as compared with the total production in 1993, was 46.8 percent, and this represents a 56-percent decrease over the previous year. Natural gas production in 1993 totaled 8.884 million tons, representing an increase of 1.706 million tons, or 23.7 percent, over the previous year. The same increase occurred in natural gas services, the total being 8.229 million tons in 1993, representing an increase of 1.102 million tons, or 15.4 percent, over the previous year. This was reflected in the increase in the percentage of total gas consumed as compared with total gas produced, which was 99.2 percent in 1993, as opposed to 92.6 percent in the previous year. Sales of cement in the construction and building materials sector decreased by 946,000 tons, or 5.7 percent, over 1992. The total for 1993 was 15.553 million tons. The months of January, February, and March showed the lowest rates of sales, whereas the months of July, August, and September showed the highest rates. Unlike sales of cement, sales of reinforcement iron in 1993 increased over the previous year. This increase was by about 82,000 tons, or 7.2 percent, and the total for the year was 1.210 million tons. The month of September showed the lowest rate of sales, whereas the months of December and May showed the highest.
