[Belyayev]Unfortunately, it is getting worse. This year there was an avalanche of morbidity due to diphtheria. In 9 months, 7,628 cases of diphtheria were recorded and 300 persons died. Morbidity due to pertussis, measles, and other infections that may be controlled by vaccine prophylaxis also increased. There are several reasons for this crisis. People's immune defense of their bodies has weakened because of a deterioration of food quality. Energy hunger is now being observed among 20 percent of the population. And constant stress situations because of uncertainty regarding tomorrow are affecting the human immune system. In addition, in the past 2 years, the public's faith in vaccines has been undermined as a result of an antivaccine campaign in certain parts of the mass media. We were only able to correct the situation at the end of this past year by initiating propaganda for wide-scale vaccination of the population. But time had already been lost. Yet another reason for the increase in morbidity due to diphtheria and diseases in its group is hidden in the fact that physicians have begun to fear giving vaccinations because of possible complications and contraindications. Instead of preparing a contingent for vaccination, they simply reduce their number. We have not raised the question of mass vaccination very strictly. And Russia is no exception here. In the United States, the most democratic country with private health care, a child with no vaccination record is not even allowed near a school. Even our emigrants there write letters to the committee requesting that their vaccination records be sent. [Bayduzhiy]And when, in your opinion, will it be possible to change this situation? [Belyayev]A headquarters for the fight against diphtheria has now been created. The government has passed a special decree for it and has begun allocating money. We had planned to vaccinate the entire population by the beginning of 1994. Because of insufficient production of the vaccine, however, this will evidently only be possible by the end of the year. By that time, morbidity due to diphtheria should fall. The same applies to other diseases in its group. [Bayduzhiy]With diphtheria things are more or less clear. But the worsening of the sanitary-epidemiological situation in the country is hardly tied to an outbreak of morbidity due to it alone... [Belyayev]The rapid spread of three other groups of infections is worrying us greatly. First, there are intestinal diseases, among which dysentery and cholera stand out. Here the situation is exacerbated by large migration flows, and this summer was a difficult one for our service. Eighteen cases where cholera was carried into Russia from distant countries were recorded. It was only thanks to emergency efforts that the situation was kept under control. A program to protect Russia's boundaries and territories from dangerous human, animal, and plant diseases being carried in from abroad has now been developed. It will be presented to the government this month. Recently, however, natural foci of the following infections have been revived in Russia herself: malaria, fever, and plague. Ten natural foci of plague alone have been counted on her territory. Among them, the Astrakhan and Kalmykia foci have recently become highly active. Plague causative agent is beginning to circulate actively among the animals there. People's access to these rayons has been sharply restricted; however, a falloff in discipline could lead to very negative consequences. And finally, there is yet another group of infections with increasing morbidity -- venereal diseases. This year, 30,000 cases of early syphilis have been recorded. The level has never been this high since the war. This is especially alarming against the background of the growing threat of AIDS. Despite the fact that 688 HIV-infected individuals have been registered in Russia, we have still been able to hold back the onslaught of AIDS. It is important to do so as long as possible until an antitoxin to this infection is found. [Bayduzhiy]Do they understand how serious the sanitary-epidemiological situation is in the government? [Belyayev]If they did not, Russia would already have millions of patients suffering from infectious diseases. The situation in Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, where a catastrophic increase in morbidity has occurred, would have been repeated. Everyone, including the president, is working with us. A concept and federal program for development of sanitary-epidemiological monitoring has been developed. The service has the status of an independent service, and by law, no one has the right to intervene in our activity. [Bayduzhiy]And what attempts have there been? [Belyayev]As soon as the service began to acquire authority and influence that was unanticipated by many, individuals appeared who desired to take it into their hands. This included both local authorities and the Ministry of health, who wanted to subordinate it to itself. The problem of counteracting mafia structures, which given our poverty, are trying to influence the service's specialists through bribes, is becoming increasing acute. Incidentally, financing is perhaps the most painful issue for us. Since September we have been in no way able to increase our workers' wages by a factor of 1.8 -- a measure stipulated by presidential edict. Unlike physicians at medical institutions, who receive their salaries from the local budget, workers of the independent sanitary-epidemiological monitoring service are unable to do so. As a result, a stream of specialists are leaving the service. This is forcing us to seek the possibility of including nonbugdet funds by introducing a charge for our services. Such practical measures evoke criticism, but we cannot survive otherwise. [Bayduzhiy]A couple of years ago any conversation about sanitary-epidemiological problems inevitably came around to the total absence of any laws in this area. Today there are laws. But do they work? [Cheburayev]The first law, titled ``Regarding Sanitary-Epidemiological Well-Being,'' was issued in 1991. It declared principles that at the time were absolutely new for the USSR and Russia: people's right to a clean environment and participation in its protection, the obligation of government bodies to inform the public of the ecological situation, and the need to compensate for damage to health. In reality, however, the mechanisms of realizing these policies did not exist, and some of them, for example, the opportunity for the public to participate in developing an environmental protection policy or the right to financial compensation for damage inflicted to health, only existed on paper. Problems of a methodological nature became the great obstacle here. How, for example, would it be possible to isolate the role of any one enterprise in harming a person's health as a result of emissions from other factors such as the person's own harmful habits, his heredity, and his unhealthy way of life? Perhaps we have only succeeded in realizing the principle of openness of information most completely. All of the data that the service has regarding the sanitary-epidemiological situation is accessible and published regularly. [Bayduzhiy]Does the service have enough economic levers to act upon the sanitary-epidemiological situation? [Belyayev]We can fine a violator three months' wages. And we recently received the right to fine enterprises. Much remains to be regulated, however. Today, for example, it is very difficult to halt construction that is violating public health standards. Before, everything was simple -- an instruction was given to the bank, which was a government structure, and it halted financing of the construction. Now with the commercial banks, nothing can be done. Or take another example. The legal board has taken a document regarding compensating citizens for damage inflicted on their health that we agreed upon with interested departments and has been tossing it around under various pretexts for half a year already. Obviously, as soon as it is approved, there will be a squall of requests from the public, and they are afraid of this. I think, however, that we will nevertheless push through a similar policy, especially since it is fixed in the draft of the new constitution. [Bayduzhiy]In essence, such a measure would mean a revolution in the government's relationship to the public's health. [Belyayev]Yes, but it is not coming to us easily. Some day, when I am retired, I will write my memoirs about how all of this happened. [Bayduzhiy]But here again comes the question of whether it will be possible to transform what is written on paper into real life. As far as I know, the prepared draft of the law titled ``Regarding Providing the Public With Drinking Water'' contains a provision something like the following: Water line owners must compensate the public for damage to their health resulting from consumption of poor-quality water. In some specialists' opinion, in practice, even in the first year after it takes effect, the law will result in the ruin of most water supply services. Can such a policy be implemented? [Cheburayev]Even if it cannot, it is no reason for changing the law. The main thing is to formulate the task and begin performing it. In this case, the threat of fines and actions will compel water suppliers to make the expenditures to modernize their equipment. This will inevitably make water more expensive, and so be it. Today in our country, 25 to 27 percent of drinking water goes for industrial purposes, and in some cities the figure is as high as 50-60 percent. Naturally, in the event of such a policy, there will not be enough purification facilities or reagents. The pattern of squandering nature must be changed. [Bayduzhiy]The leadership of the Russian Federation State Committee for Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight, together with other representatives of the Russian Council of Public Health Physicians, became engaged in the preelection conflict as a part of the ``Kedr'' [cedar] block. What dictated this step? [Cheburayev]Years of work in the sanitary-epidemiological monitoring system have shown that it is impossible to improve the situation regarding protecting the environment and human health at the level of competence possessed by the previous legislature. There is no system to the legislation that has been passed. Thus, individual laws regarding policy in the area of handling radioactive wastes and nuclear power generation have been developed in the absence of general legislation about radiation safety. That is putting the cart before the horse. Completely unacceptable policies are being put into other laws at the very moment of their development. In the Principles of the Law Regarding Labor Safety, for example, compensation and benefits for harmful labor conditions are stipulated. The measure appears to be progressive, but in reality, it stimulates work in dangerous industries and, in essence, selling one's health. And in our country today such workplaces number 12 million. The law should have stipulated another solution to this problem that is termed ``protection by time.'' Essentially, this means that if it is hazardous to work under certain conditions for an entire work day, the work day should be reduced to the safe limit, whether 6.3 hours or even 30 minutes, and the person should receive a full day's wages. Benefits and compensation may only remain in situations involving no damage to health during work but rather the risk accompanying work as, for example, in the case of pilots or miners. Without the development of competent legislation and entry into parliament, it will not be possible to change the attitude toward protecting the environment and human health. The election of ``Kedr'' to parliament was necessary because unlike many other ``green'' parties and movements, it does not talk but really acts. In today's situation, this is very important. ITAR-Tass Postscript The plan of the State Special Program for Ensuring the Russians' Sanitary-Epidemiological Well-Being in 1994-1996, which was prepared by the Russian Federation State Committee for Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight and presented to the Russian Federation government for consideration, has been tabled for a month for revision. The principal comments made at the government's meeting on 2 December concerned reducing proposed expenditures for sanitary and epidemiological measures and tightening the public health service's control over enterprises' and organizations' ecologically harzardous activities. Instead of having the state committee plan expenditures for equipment to neutralize toxic wastes, the Soviet recommended that factors without such neutralizers be shut down. It has been proposed that the total expenditure estimate, which initially amounted to 70 billion rubles, be sharply cut.
