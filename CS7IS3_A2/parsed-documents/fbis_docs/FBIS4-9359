If not, then with which country would you refuse to do this? Gyorgy Fabri, Agrarian Federation: "Good-neighborly relations with the states of the east European region and the establishment of a viable system of relations is a distinctly important goal of our foreign policy concept. With this in mind, we are willing to lay down the recognition of the current borders and their unchangeability in basic treaties with all neighboring countries." Karoly Herenyi, Hungarian Democratic Forum: "The term `unchangeability' actually means a ban on all changes. The international agreements in force do not suggest and do not even allow any such categoric bans. Together with the other democratic parliamentary parties, we also claim that, in agreement with the international norms, the given populations, the given countries, and the international community, border changes are theoretically possible. It is a different matter that, rather than at border changes, Hungary's political endeavors are directed at achieving that all national minorities be able to live within such an institutional and political framework that makes it possible for them to survive within the current borders. The establishment of such circumstances also guarantees the security of the states, and the inviolability and stability of borders. We would like to have these included in the treaties with our neighbors." Istvan Szent-Ivanyi, Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ]: "According to the SZDSZ, Hungary will not need to initiate any kind of border changes in the future, either. We support the inclusion of this in basic treaties with all our neighbors, however, the signing of a basic treaty is a political gesture that also has to settle other important areas of bilateral relations, including the situation of the national minorities, and the expansion of economic and cultural links." Lorant Benedek, Hungarian Justice and Life Party [MIEP]: "As various international agreements -- including the Paris peace treaty and the Helsinki agreement -- lay down the unchangeability of the current borders when the interested parties cannot both agree, the MIEP considers further such agreements completely unnecessary. In fact, more treaties like these would only serve the purpose that the neighboring countries that advocate this will be able to support their obviously false propaganda claim according to which the Hungarians are intending to aggressively conquer territories, and this is why these countries need to coerce Hungary to sign such treaties." Laszlo Urban, Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz]: ``In the Fidesz's view, the basic treaties are suitable for settling the situation of national minorities living beyond the borders. Therefore, it supports the signing of these treaties, especially with those neighboring countries where Hungarian minorities are living. However, negotiations on the Romanian and Slovak treaties have been suspended. Both these neighbors insist that Hungary again declare in the treaty that it does not want any border changes (neither in violent nor in peaceful ways). On the other hand, Hungary wishes to receive institutional guarantees in the basic treaties on settling the situation of national minorities. ``Hungary does not want to change the borders through either violent of peaceful ways. The Fidesz cannot see any obstacles to including these in the basic treaties. At the same time, it considers it important for the basic treaty to also contain a section on national minorities. The views of the Hungarian minority have to be taken into consideration when drawing up this section. ``The Fidesz urges the signing of basic treaties with the neighboring countries as a culmination of good-neighborly relations. However, it is important to establish a system of diverse bilateral agreements because, without these, the basic treaty would be a formal act without any content.'' Gyula Thurmer, Workers Party: "The Workers Party wishes to base our relations with the neighboring countries on three pillars. We are offering a treaty in which we first declare that we do not want to change the borders. Second, we mutually ensure the rights of national minorities in accordance with the European norms and the possibilities of the affected countries. Third, we put down in writing that we cooperate in all areas." Gyorgy Janosi, Hungarian Socialist Party: "It is expedient to sign the basic treaty with Slovakia and Romania as soon as possible. In the documents, the current borders have to be confirmed, and the guaranteeing of national minority rights in accordance with the European norms has to be stipulated. After the the South Slav crisis is settled, we will immediately have to begin placing our relations with Yugoslavia and Serbia on new foundations. Using the opportunities that will arise from signing the basic treaties, we further have to expand our relations with Croatia, Slovenia, and Ukraine. Also bearing Hungary's security policy interests in mind, there is no alternative to historical reconciliation." Marica Korondy, Mrs. Balla, Independent Smallholders Party [FKGP]: "According to the FKGP's foreign policy program, the Hungarian Republic has to observe the Helsinki Final Act that was also signed by the Hungarian Government. Hungary is not intending to change the borders, and it sees Central and Eastern Europe's stability and security in recognizing the region's national minorities as political entities. It is unnecessary to surrender our future rights in the basic treaties with the neighboring countries. At the wish of the Hungarians in the neighboring countries who were forced into a minority situation as a result of the Paris peace system, a system of viable autonomies has to be established, and this way, the transparency of borders can be achieved when the border issues will no longer need to be raised." Zoltan Kiraly, Social Democratic Party of Hungary [MSZDP]: "If the MSZDP gets into a position to make decisions, then it would be willing to lay down the unchangeability of the current borders in basic treaties with neighboring countries."
