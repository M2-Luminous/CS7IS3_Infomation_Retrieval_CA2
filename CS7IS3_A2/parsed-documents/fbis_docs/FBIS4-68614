If political games did have a logo, Elections-94 would be personified by a scared hare caught on an island in high tide, rather than a likable bear cub, the mascot of Olympics-80. Think of this: There are now 33 parties in Ukraine (the last one, the Human Rights Party, was registered one week ago), whereas just a few made their way to the "dry valley," that is, the parliament. More precisely, only the following will be represented in the new Supreme Council: the KPU [Communist Party of Ukraine]--about 100 seats, Rukh--about 30, the SelPU [Peasant Party of Ukraine]--18, and the SPU [Socialist Party of Ukraine]--15. They are followed by the URP [Ukrainian Republican Party] with nine deputies, the Democratic Party, with three deputies, the Christian Democrats, with three deputies, and the Social Democrats with two. The leaders of this latter group of parties, with the exception of the Democratic Party, have lost the elections personally. To be sure, there will also be several representatives of national-radical and pro-fascist forces in the parliament, but they will not play any particular role. This sad arithmetic suggests only one conclusion: "Although before the elections radio and TV put on the air in turn 30 political parties which we allegedly have, most of them do not have a single deputy in the new Supreme Council. Vociferous party declarations turned out to conceal a void, a complete absence of party structures at the local level. These dwarfish parties did not have enough cadres to put together a corps of deputies, nor did they have supporters to ensure the conduct of the election campaign. "Meanwhile, in Churchill's words, parties are 'machines for winning elections.' So it turns out that the political activity of the people was bound like a river with ice, and the parties could romp on the ice. But high tide came (and it is high this year) and this showy tinsel was swept away. What are these parties to do now? Who should they expect to be rescued? Whether they want it or not, there is only one way out--to hop into the boat seeking protection from Old Man Mazay." I hear the outraged voice of the pro-Rukh reader: "Here is a fine how do you do from the left. It is not enough for them to have rallied 120 deputies around themselves, they also covet other democrats! And in all this they humiliate--dwarfish parties, they say, lacking cadres, a void." Let us make it clear: The above quote does not come from a presentation by the leader of the Communist Party, P. Simonenko, whose press conference we have promised to discuss, but from a report by...V. Chornovil at the recent Fifth Rukh Congress (you see, Sir Vyacheslav, how frequently PRAVDA UKRAINY quotes you!). This congress was far more sober than the previous forums and press conferences of Rukh following the elections. At the latter, triumphant trumpets were heard, whereas at the former--sad violins. Chornovil did not succeed in putting a good face on a bad situation. In particular, S. Odarich, member of the Rukh central leadership, stated at the congress straightforwardly that Rukh had failed to keep the status quo, as Chornovil was trying to prove, that Rukh had suffered a defeat, that it had pursued a bad cadre policy: Twenty-one chairmen of regional Rukh organizations had run as candidates for people's deputy, and only five had been elected. The chairman of the Kharkov regional organization, G. Altunyan, spoke in the same vein: Our candidates were unable to clearly explain the essence of Rukh's economic program to the voters. The reader will stop me: "Wait a minute. You promised to tell us one thing, but you are telling us quite another. Why did you change the subject? Where is the report on the communist press conference?" No, I have not changed the subject. It is just that this is a long lead-in. The leaders of the Communist Party carried on in a calm and dignified although somewhat dry manner at their press conference. Instead of picturesque reports and victorious communiques they produced specific statistics and facts by way of a business card. Here they are. "Despite the Communist Party joining the struggle for the credentials of people's deputies before completing the process of its establishment, it confirmed by deeds that it is the most influential political force. Almost 100 deputies are communists from among 168 people's deputies with a party affiliation (out of the 338 deputies elected). Of these, five are members of the Central Committee Presidium, five are first secretaries of oblast committees, 15 are members of the Central Committee, five are workers, four are women, 11 are enterprise managers, 14 are kolkhoz chairmen and directors of agricultural enterprises, and six are college instructors." As far as age is concerned, may the statement about the aging of the party burden Chornovil's conscience: Only one of the elected communist deputies is beyond retirement age; the others are under 50. In Kiev alone the ranks of the communists grew by a factor of 1.5 during the election campaign. Questions followed, which members of the Presidium and Central Committee secretaries, O. Grachev, A. Martynyuk, B. Oleynik, and KPU Representative at the Central Election Commission G. Kryuchkov fielded along with P. Simonenko. [Question] Is it true that a meeting between President Kravchuk and First Secretary of the KPU Central Committee P. Simonenko will be held soon? [Answer] Yes, Kravchuk solicited the meeting himself. [Question] Specifically how does the Communist Party intend to proceed in the economic sphere? [Answer] First of all, for the duration of this crisis situation we will regulate the key sectors of the economy. We will try to put taxes and the financial and credit system in order, and begin to combat crime harshly. [Question] Many parties, in particular the socialists, are proposing to hold the first session of the new Supreme Council before 15 May. What is the attitude of the Communist Party towards this? [Answer] We believe that there is no reason to hurry. We should prepare well. [Question] How is this to be interpreted: The Communist Party is against the essence of the institution of the presidency, and yet you have nominated a candidate? [Answer] We see fit to take advantage of the new election campaign to propagate our program and our ideas. [Question] It has become known that Boris Oleynik was also nominated as a contender for the post of president, along with Simonenko, at the last conference of the KPU. Why did he withdraw? Did he obey party discipline? [Oleynik] They say in our village: "One should do what one has been trained to do." [quote rendered in Ukrainian in the original] I would not cope with the presidency. I am a writer, a poet. [Question] Will you be able to find a common language with the Kuchma-Grinev bloc? [Answer] We will seek ways for a rapprochement with this bloc and other forces which are truly concerned about the good of Ukraine. We can promise one thing firmly: We will not be the first ones to seek confrontation. There were many other questions--those just out of curiosity and those openly inflammatory. When the latter were voiced, the leaders, while bristling deep down, sought a way to smooth over the rough edges. This might be the reason why the sugary smell of incense which the members of the Central Committee were burning to themselves was clearly felt in the auditorium. Of course, they did not rejoice or embrace as soccer players do after scoring a goal, but nonetheless tried to prove that all of their affairs were proceeding as planned and that getting to the parliament was indeed a piece of cake. But is this so? After all, it was no secret that out of 28 communist candidates in Kiev and Kiev Oblast, only three qualified for the runoff election, and not one was ultimately elected. It is known that there was friction not only between the Rukh people and the Republican Party, but also between the socialists and the communists, and in particular, that the communist V. Trizna fought, in Pecherskiy District of Kiev, the socialist A. Bozhko, A. Moroz's first deputy. There were a lot of other snags and rough spots, to put it mildly. Why conceal them? Why did the official statement of the Communist Party on the results of the election which was approved at its first conference breathe not a word of self-criticism but rather consist of solid self-glorification? G. Kryuchkov answered my question with a question: "And why should we make this into Yaroslavna's wailing?" As if he did not know himself what happens when one fails to notice even a small splinter in time. Was the lesson learned not enough, all the more so because, by all signs, the leftist forces are preparing to play the role of Old Man Mazay in order to rescue our motley democracy?
