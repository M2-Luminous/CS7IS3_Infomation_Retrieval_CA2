Filkus: We Are Not Contemplating the Third Way"] [Text] There are many officials in the Moravcik government who are not very well known, even to the Slovak public. This does not apply to the finance minister of the Slovak Republic, renowned Slovak macroeconomist Rudolf Filkus, who granted the following interview to the HOSPODARSKE NOVINY Bratislava correspondent: [Zabojnik] What are the principal objectives for your work in the ministerial post? [Filkus] We must prove our efforts aimed not only at macroeconomic stability but also at microeconomic stability. We want to continue in the steps already made and never again contemplate some third way to the market. We have already passed through trade and price liberalization, the internal convertibility of the currency, privatization, and the restrictive macreconomic budgetary and monetary policies. Because of the conditions that emerge here, we will continue on this path. [Zabojnik] Can you be specific about the monetary policy, for instance? [Filkus] The finance minister should not speak about what the monetary policy should be like. That is the business of the National Bank of the Slovak Republic [NBS], and no one should interfere. The NBS is here to choose the steps according to its criteria, foreign currency reserves, inflation, or the deficit budget. Of course, mutual consultations and joint considerations of future steps are possible, but only insofar as I, as the minister, must help to seek such solutions, given the deficit budget, that would not accelerate inflation. I am thinking of the combination of banking, monetary, and economic tools. [Zabojnik] Which sector of the Slovak economy do you see as the most troubled? [Filkus] At present, the economic microsphere is the most risky one because it lives not off its results but off the principal. This is directly connected to insolvency, and especially to privatization, not only from the point of view of its acceleration, but also from its depolitization. This important tool of the transformation process has become here a tool of concentration of political power. [Zabojnik] You were not enthusiastic about this year's Slovak budget when you were in the opposition. What specific outlet for these opinions will you use now as the minister, at the time you are contemplating an amendment to the Law on the State Budget? I would be interested most of all in how you want to deal with the expenditure side of it. [Filkus] Many of our predecessors proceeded in such a way that, if they wanted to balance the budget, they were little by little cutting expenditures. The minister and the ministry must also be very interested in the revenue channels rather than in just keeping on cutting expenditures. Hence, I must also be interested in taxes and customs, where there are tremendous reserves in scrutiny. [Zabojnik] Thus, you indirectly agree with your predecessor, who said that, when the coffers are empty, you can whistle for it? [Filkus] O.K., but we have several handicapped sectors, like education, health care, and culture, where we cannot effort to reduce expenditures. [Zabojnik] Given the objective possibilities of Slovakia, can this government proceed in relations with the Czech Republic any differently from the way Meciar did? [Filkus] First of all, we must reach such an agreement that the results would be in the best interest of both parties. This applies to the certificates, customs union, and clearing accounts. We have to accommodate each other. In the customs union, for instance, the point of departure must be advantageous for the two sides, but one must also note the disadvantages for either party. Regarding the certificates, we made an accommodating step that will facilitate the continuing validity of the treaty on the mutual recognition of Czech and Slovak documents, and a situation such as there was before will not arise at the border. We have also unanimously agreed that the old lot of the clearing account [obligations originated before the currency division on 8 February 1993] must be abolished, but this also depends on parliament.
