FR941212-0-00023 FR941212-0-00011 Regulatory Evaluation This regulation is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT is unnecessary because operators of commercial vessels have indicated that they can adjust to the changes without impact on their businesses. Small Entities After considering the comments submitted in response to the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking published in the Federal Register on Friday, October 8, 1993, (58 FR 52466), the Coast Guard finds that any impact on small entities, if any, is not substantial. Therefore, the Coast Guard certifies under section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ) that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Collection of Information This rule contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ). Federalism Assessment The Coast Guard has analyzed this final rule under the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and has determined that it does not raise sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Environmental Assessment The Coast Guard has reviewed the environmental impact of this rule and concluded that under section 2.B.2 of the NEPA Implementing Procedures, COMDTINST M16475.1B, this final rule is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation because promulgation of changes to drawbridge regulations have been found to not have a significant effect on the human environment. A Categorical Exclusion Determination is available in the docket. List of Subjects in 33 CFR Part 117 Bridges.
