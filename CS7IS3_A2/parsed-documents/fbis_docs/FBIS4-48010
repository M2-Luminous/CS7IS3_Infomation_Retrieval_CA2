They said that the shooting was carried out by the soldiers. You heard this in our midday bulletins. Therefore we asked the army's spokesman, Lieutenant Colonel Jean-Bosco Daradangwa, for the truth of the matter: [Begin Daradangwa recording] It is true that some people fled their homes after hearing the shooting. As you know, last week the disarmament of the population was launched. You know that the process started [words indistinct]. Some of the rebels escaped. In some places the people, in conjuction with security forces, discovered where they were hiding. One of the hiding places is in Muyira, at a place called Kirombwe. That is why the Armed Forces are now trying to dislodge 200 people from there. It is the shooting between those people and the Armed Forces which made the the citizens flee in fear. [end recording] Daradangwa also told us that the Armed Forces captured guns and other weapons, such as grenades.
