The Interior Ministry is one of the active ministries with regard to finding solutions to many of the issues dealing with citizens that are published in the press. Many people follow up on TV the interior minister's, Watban Ibrahim al-Hasan, weekly meeting with citizens, because this meeting is proof that the official is seeking the truth and exposes it--in its entirety--extremely frankly to citizens. In addition, the Interior minister's willingness to listen to citizens encourages them to tell him the whole truth without reluctance or fear. We would like to thank the Cabinet for commenting on the article about the absence of competition, which was published on 20 February 1994. The Cabinet requested the Interior Ministry's views and comments about the article. Following is the response that the Cabinet received from the Interior Ministry and a copy that the ministry sent us, while requesting our comments about its second paragraph. The response states that the prices of sweet potatoes, rose because of the increased demand for them during the month of Ramadan and the decline of production during the fall season. Sweet potato prices rose both before and after Ramadan. This season's production is more than that of the last season; prices for the last season did not reach more than half those for this season. In spite of the fact that growers tried to keep sweet potatoes in the ground as long as possible, there is plenty of supply in markets this season. This fact reinforces our statement. We also affirm that there are hundreds of trucks loaded with sweet potatoes waiting at al-'Alawi so that sellers could speculate on prices. The reason the high price reached 40 dinars per kilogram is that, although sweet potatoes have been available in markets, so far, the Ministry of Agriculture has not yet fixed their price. To the Cabinet Secretariat: Please accept the ministry's best regards... Referring to your correspondence M/2136 of 22 February 1994, we would like to make the following remarks: 1. The ministry's responsible department continues to monitor and follow up all factors that may impact on the easy flow of exposed goods. As a result of this monitoring, a large number of violators are apprehended daily in the different distribution centers and subjected to the required legal procedures. For example, during the two months of January and February 1994, 4,079 violators were apprehended. 2. The article referred to sweet potato prices in the domestic markets. It should be indicated that prices for sweet potatoes have not yet been fixed, therefore, the prices rose because of both the greater demand for sweet potatoes during the month of Ramadan and the decrease in the production of the fall season. The statement in the article referring to the hundreds of loaded trucks at al-'Alawi awaiting the highest prices possible is not a precise one, because prices of sweet potatoes in the domestic market are subject to the mechanism of supply and demand. 3. There are a few major reasons for the fact that grocery stores do not adhere to the prices fixed for goods such as sweet potatoes and cauliflower. One of the reasons is that grocery stores are distributed over large geographical areas. Baghdad is a case in point where grocery stores are to be found on all streets--big and small. Another reason is that Baghdad's distribution centers work around the clock. A third reason is that citizens do not cooperate, and many of them are not aware of the prices of goods, which are not made public by the media. We would also like to indicate that the Economics Department held some meetings with representatives of sales offices and grocery store owners to enlighten them and indicated to them the necessity of adhering to fixed prices as this matter concerns citizens' daily food. We are also monitoring those producers who are not selling their products at al-'Alawi; legal procedures such as impounding, confiscating goods, imposing fines, and closing sales offices have been taken against violators. This is for your information, with our appreciation. Watban Ibrahim al-Hasan Interior Minister
