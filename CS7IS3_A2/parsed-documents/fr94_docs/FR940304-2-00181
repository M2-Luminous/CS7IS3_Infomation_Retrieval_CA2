FR940304-2-00181 FR940304-2-00098 With respect to the failure to provide usage and maintenance instructions, the petitioner has argued that this information has always been provided with belts distributed to the general public. As for the belts covered by the petition, Am-Safe has concluded that since they are currently in service, lack of instructions for maintenance and use at this point is inconsequential as it relates to safety. With respect to this argument, NHTSA believes it more likely than not that instructions accompanying packaged belts will be discarded once the belts are installed. In addition, similar petitions from vehicle manufacturers have stated that maintenance and use instructions for belts are included in the operator's manuals of the vehicles in which the replacement belts have been installed. Given the fact that all seat belts must conform to Standard No. 209, NHTSA believes that there is such a sufficient similarity between belts of all manufacturers, whether used as original or replacement equipment, that the maintenance and use instructions in any specific vehicle operator's manual will be of general applicability. For the foregoing reasons, the petitioner has met its burden of persuasion that the noncompliances herein described are inconsequential as they relate to motor vehicle safety, and its petition is granted.
