And Tomorrow? A. Millers: I Think This Administration Is Leftist"] [Text] [Selecks] Let us begin, Mr. Millers, with a brief look at the past. Following the events of August, 1991, you became Minister of Industry and Energy. How do you now rate your job as Minister? [Millers] That was a time when, like so many others, I performed my job with a great deal of enthusiasm, not thinking about resources, the family, and not considering what would happen when I no longer had authority and was no longer needed by anyone. Of course, I do not regret the two years I spent as Minister, because they opened up other horizons. I gained a much wider circle of acquaintances. This keeps me alive and working at present. I don't want to bring up my personal accomplishments in the Ministry. We were working as a collective, and if something valuable was accomplished, then it was by joint effort. Our capabilities were predetermined by the conditions or rules of the game. First of all, I should mention the existing, or more often non-existing legislation, which was dependent on the Supreme Council's activities. Second, there was the matter of the resources allotted to us to carry out the resolutions and directives of the Supreme Council. I was uncomfortable with these game rules. But we were unable to change them. What were we being asked to do most often? Create favorable conditions for business activities. That was our Ministry's main objective. What to produce, in what volume, and how to accomplish this -- these were not our concerns. [Selecks] What do you feel are your main accomplishments? What was done correctly? [Millers] I think this was to replace the management staff in the industrial concerns. As you know, many plant managers were against Latvian independence. I had no objections to them as people, but they could not remain as managers of state property, if at one time they had been opposed to this state. It should be noted that the public's negative opinions about industry were, to a great extent, related to the activities of these plant managers. This was a very difficult and unrewarding job, because it was necessary to go and say -- we no longer need your services. This had to be told to managers who had worked in their positions for many years. We made a effort to follow the rule -- while changing the management, the plant's activities must not be allowed to deteriorate. Overall, about 70 percent of the largest concerns received new directors. At that time, there were many political leaders -- quite a bit more than necessary. But there was a lack of management specialists. Therefore, it was difficult to find new plant directors. I would have been unable to accomplish this if the Ministry had not operated as a unified team. At present, we can see that the change in management has been unsuccessful in only three or four cases. [Selecks] At present, we are hearing claims that the Ministry of Industry has destroyed industry... [Millers] The decline of industry was apparently an independent process. We were unable to slow it down, although we tried. Of course, to a large extent, it was influenced by the Supreme Council. The Ministry proposed various reforms, but was unable to realize them because the Supreme Council rejected them. For example, we wanted to replace Moscow's centralized board with a collective industrial board, and studied foreign experience with such a measure. But the Supreme Council, by adopting the law on the state enterprise board rejected our proposal. Supposedly, bureaucrats would interfere with the director performing his job. In this matter, the viewpoints of Mr. Kehris and those of the pro-interfront plant directors coincided. We were unsuccessful in fending them off. This is because the viewpoints of the deputies were such as they were in the particular situation. Changing them was impossible. The concept could not be realized because it was not accepted by the public nor supported by the deputies in parliament. All the same, such a concept did not become realized. [Selecks] But the sudden decline in industry was not only induced by the mistakes of the Supreme Council. [Millers] Once again, I stress that it was an independent process, influenced by various factors. After the political changes in Latvia, we were left without work, and our products had no buying market. Engineers and managers were not prepared to reorient themselves quickly. It was necessary to develop contacts with the West, but our enterprises did not know how to purchase assembly components, nor how to sell completed products. For example, for many years, "Radiotehnika" produced one grade of equipment for the Soviet Union. From the latter, we received many components, which we assembled and sent back as a completed product. Naturally, the entire production line fell apart when this contact was lost. That was an unavoidable process. If we want to save and develop radioelectronics in Latvia, which, in my opinion, has potential, then we have to reorient ourselves on the West -- buy components from them, produce high-quality goods, which would be on the same level, qualitatively, as the imports, which have flooded all of our stores. There is one more request -- for the state to protect enterprises that are producing goods for internal consumption. [Selecks] In what manner? [Millers] The same manner as in other countries. In this respect, there are many measures available. Including taxes and customs. The main thing is for people to have jobs. If there is work, a person can get by, and he also pays taxes. Thus, there are resources for social assistance, education. We will not become rich only by selling. For this reason, every country protects its market, thus protecting the jobs of its people. [Selecks] Supposedly, Latvia's industry has very little potential, and therefore, we must refocus on trade, financing. What do you say about this? [Millers] I do not agree. The state cannot exist without manufacturing. In all developed countries, about 25 to 30 percent of the workforce is involved in manufacturing. That is the main source of financial income. It should be the same in Latvia. Also, agriculture is necessary. If only to promote a uniform distribution of residents throughout the country. It will be necessary to subsidize agriculture, and the resources for these subsidies can only come from manufacturing. Therefore, we must consider its development. [Selecks] But the Swiss are given as an example of major banking potential. [Millers] We should obtain more objective and correct information about Switzerland. Even there, 30 percent of the workforce is employed in industry. This is a paradox for a nation, which everyone only considers to be a banking and financial paradise. Yet, even this small country cannot get along without industry. [Selecks] Thus, you feel that Latvia's industry could develop, if the state creates a system for protecting the local market. [Millers] That is the first requirement. But it is not the only one. Another important condition is a good taxation policy. Right now, Latvia is moving in a ridiculous direction. The theory predominates that -- the greater the taxes, the larger the budget. I cannot agree with this. I wonder why such thinking is predominant in economics. Unfortunately, it was strong even under the Godmanis administration. Budgetary problems are constantly being solved by measures to increase taxes. There are a sufficient number of examples in the world, which show the absurdity of this psychology. Even in such a small country as Cypress. What is the sales tax there? Only 8 percent. In addition, there is a great deal of easement for those enterprises that wish to start up activities, invest capital, create new jobs. The so-called tax-exempt days are extended even to 10 to 20 years, relative to the invested capital and number of jobs created. When starting a business in Latvia, all investments must be made from the profits remaining after you have paid off earnings and other taxes. Sales tax -- 18 percent, earnings tax -- 25 percent (incidentally, this is one of the highest tax rates in all Europe), social taxes -- 37 percent, etc. Under such conditions, no foreigner will start a business in Latvia. The gains he receives from cheap labor do not balance out the losses created by high taxes. Thus, there is no basis for the hope of foreign investments. In addition, the taxation policy is constantly changing, which creates supplemental difficulties. [Selecks] How do you feel about the optimistic prediction that a growth in manufacturing volume is expected this year? [Millers] In my opinion, there is no basis for any discussion of a growth in manufacturing volume at present. The administration, already last year, promised to create the State Property Fund, Privatization Agency, and much more to promote the development of manufacturing. Of course, we can see that these promises have not been fulfilled. This means that the conditions for an upswing have not been created, and therefore there is no basis for a promising outlook on the future. Industrial development will start when attitudes towards manufacturing are changed. I have good contacts with many plant directors, and I know that the current situation in industry has not improved, because many places are only working three or four days per week. Naturally, many enterprise managers have now learned how to overcome the problems with selling their goods. But they have done so by dismissing many workers. The number of workers in manufacturing has declined by 30 or 40 percent. We are working less and producing less. Another situation, which reinforces pessimism, is that privatization has been halted. In the past year, nothing has moved ahead. [Selecks] We have to conclude that there is no perceptible movement towards a market economy, or capitalism. Therefore, instead -- are we preserving socialism? [Millers] I think this administration is leftist. I think they are less competent than the preceding administration. Some sort of reforms were started before the necessary prerequisites were prepared. The Cabinet of Ministers does not comprehend the true status of the situation. I feel that it was a huge mistake to eliminate the Ministry of Industry. In two years, we had collected a competent group of people. These people were not stagnates, but rather specialists with practical work experience in business. In connection with the new reforms, they were all dismissed. I feel that in the administration's circle, there are very few people who are orientated in economics, let alone industry. How can you be a manager if you have never even walked through a single business enterprise? Theory is one matter, but -- practice is completely something else. When I accepted becoming Minister, I realized that this was a very sudden leap forward in my career. I was not ready for this and only accepted the proposal because I could not recommend anyone else in my place. I had to study long and hard to learn the specifics of my duties. The same thing happened with many other officials, who had suddenly jumped up the career ladder, without actually being prepared to do so. At that time, such actions could be understood and explained. Frankly speaking, it was a revolutionary situation, and it was necessary to act quickly and extraordinarily. But why does everything now have to be started all over again? That I don't understand. [Selecks] Apparently, this is in following with the party loyalty principle. New forces have come to power, and they are attempting to place their own people in all positions of authority. [Millers] Then, obviously, there is something wrong with the activities of the party, because rational, management-oriented people do not become party hacks. Politics, naturally, is related to economics. Unfortunately, for us, politics generally pertain to such questions as the citizenship law, national relations. In normal countries, politics deal with methods through which questions of economics are resolved, primarily the question of taxes, because that is the basis of all other questions. The attitude towards taxes shows how large a role you are granting to the state, for the community pot, and it determines how leftist or rightist you are. I hope that Latvia will understand the same with its politics, as does the whole world. [Selecks] How would you explain that very few Latvians are engaging in business activities? [Millers] Not by saying that the Latvian is lazier or dumber, as is often heard said. Present day business is such that it scares away Latvians. The first reason is taxes, which we already discussed. They are so high that a business which pays them honestly cannot survive. It becomes necessary to hide profits, to balance on the edge of breaking the law. Such a situation is not acceptable to many Latvians. A second factor, which scares them, is the crime situation. There is no hiding that. Financial authorities, various police and security forces are associated with criminal circles in some way, growing together. Working in such a situation, it is necessary to maintain your bearings, to know how to maneuver, in order to protect your earnings and your life. It is not easy to enter this circle from the outside. There are no instructions or lessons. And the third condition -- is corruption. I must admit that we could not resolve this problem in the preceding administration. But now, corruption has increased dramatically. Growing dramatically! Furthermore, this is all obvious to the naked eye. It is one of the factors that promotes non-payment of taxes and other violations of law. It is not permissible that laws are written for some, but -- not for others. If an official takes bribes, that means I do not have to pay taxes. These three factors, in my opinion, are the main reason why Latvians shy away from business. If the former were to disappear, or at least decline, then Latvians could also start a business and achieve success. The many Latvians living in the West have demonstrated that, under civilized circumstances, members of our nationality are also able to be successful and prosperous businessmen. But business in Latvia is such that it is incompatible with the Latvian mentality. Those who are involved in it must feel some discomfort, because they have to make certain compromises.
