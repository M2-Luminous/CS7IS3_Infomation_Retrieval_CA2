Vondra, who returned from a twelve-day trip to the three countries, also pointed to their large markets which make them attractive for European partners. Czech politicians and entrepreneurs should pay more attention to these countries because privatization has been advancing there and local economies are adapting themselves to the new budgetary and taxation policy, Vondra said. Despite changes in the political climate in the past on both sides, the long-term traditions of good commercial relations with these countries have remained. It would be erroneous not to take this into account and not to strive to maintain and develop all the good moments in the tradition of mutual relations, he added.
