The sharp drop of land under cultivation is now under control in some areas. Director of the State Land Administration Mr. Zou Yuchuan stressed the importance of protecting arable land in a national meeting on legislation regarding land. Mr. Zou pointed out that a net cut of land under cultivation was put at some four million mu across the country last year, equivalent to the total of arable land in seven medium-sized counties. Should the situation not be reversed, the consequences would be very serious. He said that China had to guarantee at least one mu of arable land per person on average by the year 2050 or the food problem would by then become a crisis. There is to date cultivated land totalling 1.43 billion mu with per capita land measuring 1.2 mu. The administration has suggested that planning for the use of land had to be worked out and strictly implemented. The appraisal and approval of land had to be unified in accordance with the law and administration of various kinds of development zones had to be strengthened. A protection area for farming fields had to be drawn up while policies on the administration of collective use of land for non-agricultural purposes had to be strengthened.
