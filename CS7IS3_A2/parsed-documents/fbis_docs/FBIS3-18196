The four government parties are going into the Folketing election on their own platforms and will not run on a joint program, asserted Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen (SDP) yesterday [12 February]. Nyrup denied on the same occasion that the Center Democrats' [CD] positive stand on the Western European Union would be a problem in a future governing coalition. This is being said following CD political spokesman Peter Duetoft's announcement last week that Danish participation in the West European Union should be part of [the program] in a new governing coalition. "The Center Democrats have their view, but this will have to be dealt with when we know the election outcome," said Rasmussen after a meeting between the SDP Folketing group and the party's leadership council. At the joint meeting the SDP's European and domestic policy goals were adopted. The SDP stands firm on the National Compromise and says no to a common defense and a common currency. Regarding the latest cabinet shake-up, Rasmussen said: "The leadership council understands the government shake-up of 28 January. The decision yesterday (the departure of Bente Juncker -- BERLINGSKE TIDENDE SONDAG editor) had been under study by the leadership council, which was unanimous in the decision."
