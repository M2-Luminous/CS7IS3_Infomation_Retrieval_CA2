The experiment to study antiarrhythmic adaptation effect was carried out on 60 200-250 g Vistar male rats which were divided into four groups: intact, adapted to cold, adapted to physical stress through swimming, and adapted to the combined effect of cold and physical stress. The experimental procedure is outlined. The experiment shows that at a -11ï¿½C temperature, animals not adapted to cold die after 5-7 h while the adapted ones survive for at least 16 h. The adapted animals also had 1.5 times more fat. The animals not adapted to physical stress swim with a load of 10% of their body mass for no more than 10 min while the adapted animals swim for at least 25 min. Adaptation to combined physical stress and cold facilitated a reliable twofold decrease in mortality in subsequent acute myocardial ischemia and a decrease in the ventricular fibrillation rate and duration. The effect of adaptation and acute myocardial ischemia on the enkephalin concentration in the myocardium and the effect of adaptation and acute myocardial ischemia on the cyclical nucleotide concentration in the myocardium (M+/-m) is summarized. The findings demonstrate that adaptation to the combined exposure to cold and physical stress is the most effective in developing the endogenic opioid system stimulation and preventing arrhythmia in acute myocardial ischemia as well as lowering the experimental animal mortality. The study also reveals that intravenous administration of dalargin (enkephalin) before the coronary occlusion inhibits an increase in the cAMP concentration induced by acute myocardial ischemia, probably due to activating presynaptic opiate receptors. A limitation of the adrenergic effect on the myocardium in acute myocardial ischemia facilitates a decrease in the rate of cardiac arrhythmia. The findings attest to the fact that endogenic cardial enkephalins may play a significant role in the mechanism of antiarrhythmic effect of adaptation in acute myocardial ischemia; this effect is attributed to a decrease in the adrenergic influence on the heart and serves as an indirect evidence of a decrease in the sympathetic effect of the peptide on the heart.
