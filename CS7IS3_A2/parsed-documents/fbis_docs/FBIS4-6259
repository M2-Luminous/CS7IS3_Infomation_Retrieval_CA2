The former governor-general of Canada, Edward Schreyer, after visiting the Panmunjom cooperative farm in the demilitarized zone along the military demarcation line said he has learned at first hand there that the DPRK does not build arms, contrary to so many false reports about it in the West now. He further said: Here on the spot, I found every house is occupied, unlike I was told in Seoul. Today I called at any house I wanted and saw it is occupied. It is a sheer lie to say that nobody lives in this place. The executive director of the Summit Council for World Peace, Antonio Betancourt, said after going round the farm that they were told in the South that nobody except army soldiers lives in this place. "But what I have seen here is quite contrary to what I heard there," he said. He said those who don't want peace are now making distorted reports about the reality of Korea. "The looks of Pyongyang will be introduced as it is to many countries by the journalists of different countries included in the visiting group," he added. Vice-president of the Summit Council for World Strategy of Japan, Togashi Takayoshi, said he has clearly learned through the current Korea visit that the Korean people earnestly desire peace. Ex-president of Costa Rica, Rodrigo Carazo Odio, who is heading the visiting group, said after inspecting the West Sea barrage that he didn't think the Korean people built this great structure to destroy something.
