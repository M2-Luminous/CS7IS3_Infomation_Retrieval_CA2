In his hour-long speech he mainly talked about domestic problems, stressing health and security, the two key points. President Jefferson, who was the pioneer in U.S.-style democratic politics, once abolished the practice of personally going to Congress to deliver an address; he held that it was a kind of "British habit," which was reminiscent of the way in which the British monarch speaks to the parliament at the beginning of every legislative year. In 1913, President Wilson restored the practice of going to Congress to deliver the address, hoping that by making an open speech he could win the support of the public to overcome obstruction from Congress. Clinton's speech yesterday also put Congress in the position of an imaginary enemy, while he himself emerged as a reformist, who described Congress as a force obstructing reform. He pulled out a pen, which he waved as he said that if the law adopted by Congress could not guarantee a health program enjoyed by the whole people, he could use the pen to sign a veto order. Taking Tough Measures To Fight Crimes At the same time when Clinton raised the reformist banner, he also tried to avoid an excessively radical image. U.S. political analysts commented that in his "State of the Union Address," Clinton shifted attention to programs of the middle-of-the-roaders and abandoned the left wing of the Democrats to win the support of the middle class and even set foot in areas traditionally guarded by the Republicans. For example, the problem of law and order is one which has always been emphasized by the Republicans. Clinton used a lot of time in his address to claim that he would take tough measures to fight crime, in contrast to the Democrats' constant advocacy that criminals must be treated leniently. He even borrowed jargon from baseball and said one "must be out after three strikes," meaning that persons who have committed serious crimes three times must be sentenced to life imprisonment. He demanded, on the one hand, a reform of the health and medical insurance system, so that it can benefit more the 37 million people who are currently not covered, and on the other hand, he thought that it is necessary to encourage work and employment, and that there should not be too much welfare; he suggested that the time for claiming unemployment assistance should not be more than two years, while retraining must be given as a backup. All these are quite able to meet the values of the middle class. Reform Launched Simultaneously on Two Fronts In his "State of the Union Address," Clinton linked welfare reform to health and medical reform, and this drew attention. Before this, Clinton's draft on health reform was a 1,300-page document, which involved a great many complicated arrangements, and was strongly criticized by the Republicans and would probably run into strong resistance in Congress. Some political analysts thought that in order to win support for his draft of health reform from a majority of congressmen, Clinton might succumb to the pressure of congressmen in other areas, or even China's most-favored-nation trading status would become a trading condition in congressional politics. Now that Clinton has added the welfare reform plan to his address, it would be more difficult for the plan to pass in Congress. There are also some people who hold that this is a kind of strategy offered by the strategists in the White House, with the purpose of deliberately allowing the health and welfare reform plans to run into hindrance by Congress, so that they cannot be adopted this summer, thus, in November when mid-term elections are held, the Democrats would be able to push responsibility onto the Republicans, and accuse them of ignoring public interests, and by so doing they can win votes. Thus, the problem may not have to be settled before June.
