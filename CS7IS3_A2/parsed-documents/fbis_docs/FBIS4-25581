In the context of a market economy, in order for products to attain market share, production operators must follow the market mechanism in utilization of resources (manpower and physical resources). Once the utilization of resources is determined and implemented, it works on the entire process of production. Market mechanisms are reflected through commodity price signals. Price changes are always caused by quantitive changes of supply versus demand. Therefore, one can observe the market demand on the variety and quantity of commodities through price changes. It is by such observation and judgment that production operators determine utilization of resources in determining parameters and making projections. This is the very role of market mechanism. As we know, the operation of social production starts with the utilization of resources and ends with the realization of market share. In the continuous operation of social reproduction, market reaction to past production must be used as a link to consider and arrange utilization of resources for current production. If all production units can correctly analyze and master the objective reality of market changes based on market share of the foregoing period and make accurate projections and properly utilize resources, they should be able to help utilization of resources society-wide move toward optimization and promote smooth and unobstructed development of a market economy. However, we should also be aware that the continuous development of a market economy is driven by the mechanism of competition. Competition among different operation units in pursuit of their own interests promotes development on the one hand, and, on the other, inevitably also has some blindness, causing a market economy to experience imbalance, fluctuations, and even crisis from time to time. It is necessary to point out here that what is called the role of market mechanisms means the operation and role of the law of value in a theoretical sense, because the law of value is brought into play via market mechanisms. What is called market mechanism-led utilization of resources is in fact an issue of conscious application of the law of value. The law of value is the basic law of a commodity economy. It is in essence a law which describes changes of value and price and, through such changes, subsequently describes changes of supply and demand. The basic function of the law of value lies in determination by value, i.e., using value as the yardstick for measuring cost and efficiency. High-efficiency products can bring high profits as their resource consumption is less than the average; on the other hand, low efficiency and high consumption will cause losses. This mechanism also reflects the mechanism of competition. It encourages the advanced and spurs the backward. Only with outstanding efficiency can an enterprise become a winner in competition, or else it will be eliminated. Therefore, a production operator must be good at consciously applying the law of value to match the utilization of resources with the objective reality of market changes. Whether or not the utilization of resources is appropriate finally has to be tested by market share through economic operation. The above discussion is based on a market economy in the context of large-scale socialized production. This includes a developed market system (incorporating production element markets) and subjects of operation with independent decisionmaking power. To achieve market mechanism-led utilization of resources, our country naturally should create the necessary conditions, so that it will not end up being nothing more than empty talk. Market Economy Under Macroregulation and Control In the context of a market economy, microeconomic units always conduct their respective disposition of resources in accordance with the requirements of supply and demand on the market. Generally speaking, this will roughly lead to a balanced relationship between supply and demand and therefore lead the social economy to develop in a normal way. However, a market economy is all-powerful, because disposition of resources, after all, reflects human social behavior. It is inevitable that operators engage themselves in blind competition in pursuit of greatest profits and give rise to a state of anarchy, which in turn lead to market mistakes, loss of market effectiveness, and even economic crisis. In today's China, some blind worshippers of the market economy believe that men are rational and rationalization of the utilization of resources can be achieved with the "invisible hand." This assumption is probably too naive. In fact, this theory was long ago falsified by the experience of capitalist market economies. In modern times, since Keynesian theory appeared, state intervention in market economies in capitalist society has been a widely accepted fact. Even before this, as Samuelson, an authority on capitalist economics, put it, a capitalist market economy had never reached the realm of total laissez-faire. Since the late 19th century, in almost all countries, the role of government in the economy has been increasing. Today, all countries practicing a market economy see state intervention as a routine practice. For example, the United States, known for its capitalist freedom, also conducts macroregulation and control on its market economy through legal means, such as taxes and import restrictions. Germany follows the mode of a social market. Japan's economy is industrial policy-led, "manipulating the economic lever with a visible hand," and is a government-coordinated market economy. Since 1955, Japan has drawn up 12 medium- and long-term economic plans and has now begun to implement an economic development strategy for moving into the 21st century. France practices what is called "planned" market economy. Since World War II, France has never stopped making analytic and prognostic plans and controlling its economy with plans. As to the so-called "Asia-Pacific mode" of the market economy, like that in the Republic of Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore, the strength of its macrocontrol is even greater. This was the very basis on which their economic takeoff was established. Naturally, however, all countries and regions practicing macroregulation and control follow the principle of not infringing on the role of market mechanism and their purpose is to increase orderliness in the market and reduce blindness in market competition. Our country's socialist market economy is naturally no exception in exercising macrocontrol, which is also an integral part of the socialist market economic system. The socialist market economic system is one under a socialist system. A socialist country should naturally take advantage of the strengths of market mechanisms to promote the development and prosperity of social economy. But in the meantime, it should also use "a visible hand" to minimize blindness in market competition and solve problems that cannot be solved with market mechanisms alone. The intrinsic characteristic of a socialist economy is the public ownership of the means of production. Generally speaking, microeconomic units based on public ownership should be receptive to state guidance to reduce blindness in economic development. However, the reality is not that simple. Because our market development is far from perfect and market legislation and standards have yet to be established or improved, such phenomena as plunging into hot fields in swarms, blind investment, reckless starting of projects, and overlapping production keep happening. This shows that the task of macroregulation and control in our country is indeed an arduous one and will take a long time to accomplish and that the establishment and improvement of a macroregulation and control system is truly the top priority. As to the macroregulation and control system, the "Decision" of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee pointed out that it is necessary to establish a mechanism that coordinates planning, banking, and finance, so that overall plans can be made. It also gave clear instructions on their respective functions, which will not be repeated in this article. Here, I would like to discuss only the issue of how to understand the great significance of macroregulation and control. Some people have a very incomplete understanding of macroregulation and control, thinking that it is like "treating the head for a headache and the foot for a footache," i.e., making adjustments wherever there is a problem. There is no denying that it is necessary to find a specific remedy for any problem that crops up in the economy and try to solve it. However, this is not everything about the important value of macroregulation and control. Take for example the disposition of resources under macroregulation and control. Before microeconomic units have even done this, there is no knowing where the disease is. At this point, should we treat the head or the foot? Thus it seems that the important value of macroregulation and control should be realized with the government establishing an overall control target for socio-economic development and subsequently pointing out the right direction of development for microeconomic units even before the latter begin their disposition of resources. The so-called control target, to put it in a nutshell, refers to the definition of what to encourage and what to restrict in a country's development and the definition of what necessary economic policies and measures to adopt toward the encouraged or restricted industrial sectors. The publication of this target should guide microeconomic units to conduct their own disposition of resources and economic activities with this as the beacon and road sign. In fact, when economic operation runs into problems, a country's macroregulation and control should also be conducted with this set target as criterion and yardstick. It is in no way an aimless, no-principle practice of "treating the head for a headache and the foot for a footache." It goes without saying that the control target for on-going economic development is also based on the market economy. However, though it comes from market realities, it is higher than this. In other words, it has gone through distillation and become a beacon for the development of market economy. Macroregulation and Control and Planned Management The development of socialist market economy is based on market mechanisms and led by macroregulation and control. The two elements are mutually complementary and bring out the best in each other. Together, they promote social and economic development and prosperity. In the past, some people had too many doubts and worries about commodity and market economies, a fear of slipping down the capitalist road. In fact, the intrinsic distinction between socialism and capitalism lies in the difference of ownership and distribution systems. But a market economy is a shared form of economic operation in the context of large-scale socialized production. Since the beginning of reform and opening up, people have changed and gradually improved their understanding of the importance of commodity and market economies. But some people are dreaming of a laissez-faire market economy and lack a correct understanding of the necessity of macroeconomic control and planned management in the development of market economy, as if planning is something that should be done away with. Some people are frightened of the thought of planning, avoid talking about it, and even play down its significance, for fear of a resurgence of "planning." Before reform started, there were indeed many mistakes in our planning system and work, such as excessive, overly strict, and overly rigid controls, centralism, pushing through of mandatory plans, and acting on administrative orders. As a result, the planned economy became a command and monopoly economy, with the euphemistic epithet of "the superiority of a planned economy" which gave a sense of pride. Back in the 1920's, Lenin warned that "the biggest danger is to bureaucratize the issue of state economic planning.... The complete, all-inclusive, and true planning equals `bureaucratic fantasy.' Do not pursue this kind of fantasy." Regrettably, however, our mistake happened to be the pursuit of this kind of fantasy and we happened to commit the mistake of this "biggest danger." Our reform in planning is to eliminate this planning system, in which "bureaucracy kills," and the many long-standing maladies deriving from it. It does not mean we do not need planning any more. By suggesting that the future society should have planning, Marx meant that it was necessary to use planned, organized production to replace the state of anarchy so that proportionate and orderly social and economic development could be maintained. He did not mention how to implement this idea specifically. Lenin said: Any plan is a yardstick, criterion, beacon, road sign, and so on and so forth. In our reform, we must firmly and thoroughly eliminate all maladies of the old planning system. But this does not mean we do not need planning. We must not throw out the baby with the bath water. In the past two years, authorities at all levels have been emphasizing macroregulation and control. This is perfectly correct. In my opinion, macroregulation-control and planned management are "one and the same." All the tasks related to macroregulation and control, such as the balance of total supply and demand, structural optimization, and development speed, are part of economic planning. As pointed out in the "Decision" of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, planning means "determining a strategy for national economic and social development, the targets of macroregulation and control, and industrial policies; doing a good job in economic forecasting; and designing major economic structures, the pattern of distribution of productive forces, national land improvement and development, and key construction projects." This shows that macroregulation and control is based on macroplanning and macroregulation and control targets. If planned regulation is a means, the role of planning, the "visible hand," is brought it into play by macroregulation and control. One can see from the "Decision" that for macroregulation and control, its function in facing the society, mobilizing forces, and executing tasks in the economic forefront should be emphasized, while for planning, its function as an economic advisory sector of a macrostrategic and policy nature should be highlighted. The planned management of our country since reform began has been mainly medium-term and long-term planning, focusing on guidance and coordination. The macroregulation and control system comprises planning, banking, and finance, all of which are concerned with overall interests. However, banking and finance aim at giving play to their respective roles in monetary credit, fiscal, and taxation fields. It is planning and planning alone which oversees the overall development of the economy, and brings together and coordinates economic relations among various quarters. The planning organ is a brain trust and the designing institute of social-economic development, which draws grand blueprints. Accomplishing this important task requires the guidance of superior political-economic ideas and scientific viewpoints. The crux of the matter is that the subjective should correctly or relatively correctly reflect the objective, and subjective initiative should be integrated with objective law in an organic way. As far as short-term planning is concerned, it is naturally necessary to be led by market mechanisms and to base planning on the law of value, i.e., referring to market information, determining parameters, making forecasts, and formulating rational and feasible macroplans. I must point out here that state macroplanning is not a simple simulation of the market. For instance, the industrial structure and infrastructure are designed by the state by considering the overall needs of social-economic development and are for the purpose of showing enterprises the right way to go in their development. As to medium- and long-term planning, it is even less likely that a solution could be found by merely relying on market mechanisms. Medium- and long-term plans should also proceed from the current market economy and result in future economic development forecasts, but the market cannot throw much light on the long-term future. Furthermore, a market economy arouses the initiative of people in competing for benefits, but low-profit or nonprofit undertakings will not receive any attention. State macroplanning, on the other hand, must consider the needs of overall social development. Medium- and long-term planning for a number of years to come mainly serves the purpose of establishing the orientation and goal of strategic development. Therefore, it is imperative to stand high and see far by taking into account the domestic and international political and economic situations, analyze and predict their trends and changes, and use them as the basis for formulating medium- and long-term plans. Such plans should cover unified arrangement for the balance of total supply and demand; optimization of the industrial structure; rationalization of distribution of productive forces; development of high and new-technology; establishment of new industries; attaching importance to such soft infrastructural facilities as scientific research and education, while attending to such hard infrastructural facilities as energy and communications; showing concern for ecological balance and the protection and improvement of environment; fair distribution; social welfare undertakings; and so on and so forth. These grand and long-term strategies are both plans and policies. Only when decisionmaking is built on the basis of science and democracy can its feasibility and effectiveness be enhanced. When a medium- or long-term plan is broken down to yearly plans for implementation, it should naturally be specified in light of the current market needs. The implementation of macroplans, which are usually of a guiding nature, requires the cooperation of microunits. All this should be standardized by way of legislation. Conclusion The development of a socialist market economy should be subjected to macroregulation, macrocontrols and planned management to improve its orderliness. However, fundamentally speaking, it depends on the perfection and development of the market system, in particular, the establishment and improvement of the production elements market. If this market fails to developed, the so-called market mechanism-led utilization of resources will be a bubble. In the meantime, it is also imperative to decontrol prices, because adjustments in market mechanisms are signalled by price changes. Controlled and distorted prices cannot reflect the true developments of market mechanisms. The subjects of enterprise operations in the behavior of a market economy should be independent economic legal persons which make decisions for themselves. Only such operational subjects have the courage to go all out to come to the top in market competition. Therefore, the state must, instead of making promises only, truly let state-owned enterprises become independent economic entities with decisionmaking power. Without true enterprises, a true market economy is not possible. In the meantime, with regard to enterprises operating at a loss, the state should stop the absurd practice of taking infinite responsibility for all losses. And, if they fail to end loss-making and begin profit-making, leaders of enterprises which suffer from losses caused by mismanagement should be subjected to the punishment that they deserve. Only by so doing can enterprises "responsible for profits, but not for losses," come back onto the right track. After ownership and management authority are separated, no government at any level can interfere in routine enterprise operations and management. Legal responsibility should be affixed for those who abuse their powers and arbitrarily interfere. (See "Regulations on Changing the Operational Mechanisms of Industrial Enterprises Under Ownership by the Whole People") The state is the owner of state-owned enterprise property; the government manages and supervises them on behalf of the state and collects profits in proportion to the volume of investment. This is actually performance of investor duties, not exercising state power. In the past, those two were confused. Now, such confusion should be put right. In my opinion, this is not a matter of changing government functions. It is high time we stopped incorrectly drawing a parallel between investor functions and the exercise of state power. I would like to say in passing that the general management functions performed by the state toward the social economy, such as taxation, industrial and commercial administration, macroregulation and control, and planning and guidance apply to both non-state-owned and state-owned enterprises. There is no question of changing functions. In short, we must create necessary conditions for the development of a socialist market economy and conduct necessary macroregulation-control and guidance to standardize the market economy and enable it to operate in an orderly way. This way, the market will be active and the economy prosperous, increasingly so by the year.
