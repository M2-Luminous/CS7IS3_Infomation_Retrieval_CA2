About 200 most destructive projectiles were fired and there was fire from tanks, howitzers, mortars, antiaircraft machine guns, and antiaircraft guns. All chetnik strongholds were in operation and the targets were, apart from the defense lines, Tuzla airport and the settlements of Vukovije, Medjas, Kalesija Center, and Zukici. There was huge material damage, particularly on family and economic buildings, and the town industrial zone has been almost razed. The aggressor is continuing his fierce artillery attacks as I report. The defenders are energetically responding and virtual artillery duels are being carried out.
