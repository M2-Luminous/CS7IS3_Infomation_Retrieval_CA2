The programme comprises 11 major road and rail links including access to the Channel tunnel train between Paris, Brussels and London, plus the Brenner axis linking Verona with Berlin, and the Oeresund rail-road link between Denmark and Sweden. The other projects, all of which are to be started "by 1996 at the latest," are based in Ireland, Greece, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain. The 11 works programmes will cost an estimated ECU68.5 billion (81.5 billion dollars) by 2010. A final decision on the financing was put off until the next full EU summit in six months time. The 12 European leaders, closing a two-day EU summit Saturday, also reconfirmed their commitment to the European Commission's white paper on employment and competitivity which they adopted in December. "The improvement in the economic situation (in Europe) should not lead to a slackening of efforts to promote structural adjustment in Europe...particularly in the field of employment," they said, in a final summit statement. Reforms set out in the white paper included plans to boost labour market flexibility, making it easier for employers to hire and fire, and increase training. However, there was no action on a Commission proposal to switch the cost of Europe's social benefits from charges on businesses to an antipollution energy tax. The European Council "takes note of the progress on the CO[.sub]2[/]/Energy tax issues, underlining the need to ensure that environmental costs are better reflected throughout the economy," the statement said. The EU's 11 transport projects represent the first slice of a multi-billion dollar scheme to span the EU with transport, telecommunications and energy networks stretching eventually into East Europe. They are intended to increase the efficiency of the single market, make businesses more efficient and create better and safer communications in general. The EU leaders agreed to continue work on extending the transport links into "neighbouring countries, in particular to Central and East European countries and to the Mediterranean basin." And they urged continuing work on preparing eight major projects in the energy sector, but refused to give them a green light. Britain had urged holding back on final approval for the transport projects until their financing had been agreed. The summit statement stressed that unspecified "measures will be taken -- if proved necessary -- to ensure that priority projects do not run into financial obstacles which would jeopardize their implementation." The summit accepted European Commission President Jacques Delors' proposal for "round tables" of experts to speed up the action on the transport projects. They also agreed on his proposal for a minister in each EU member country to coordinate on the setting up of information super-highways linking the member states. On Friday, the 12 agreed the outlines of a common economic policy vital if they are to bring their economies towards greater union. Talks on the agreed themes of price stability, sound public finances and labour market flexibility were brief, the main points having already been approved at a meeting of the EU member's ministers of economy and finance two weeks ago, diplomatic sources said.
