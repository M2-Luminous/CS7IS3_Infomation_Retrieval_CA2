It has been concluded that the key to peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina can be found through the Croat-Muslim agreement [as heard]. Americans, Germans, and Italians are involved in the search for that key. Minister Granic told us that he came to Rome today in order to clarify the Croatian standpoint regarding the creation of a Croat-Muslim federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. There are some differences as regards the set-up of the future Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, Granic told us that the Croatian position was met with understanding by the Italian side. Croatia's view of Italy's importance in the negotiations is positive, Granic told us. In reference to his talks with Tauran, he said that the Holy See assessed as positive the fact that Croatia has accepted the Vatican's suggestions.
