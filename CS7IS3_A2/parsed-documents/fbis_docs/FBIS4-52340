However, we must review the situation with a strict distinction between the desire for the economy to improve and whether objective conditions exist that substantiate a rebound in the economy. Voodoo Economics If we were to merely piece together fragments of favorable data, we would not be able to remove ourselves from the purview of voodoo economics. Whether the data are favorable or unfavorable, we must begin with a process of gaining an accurate picture of the current situation in order to begin a debate about the proper economic countermeasures. Such an approach requires that we engage in analysis and debate covering the basics of macroeconomics and analysis of personal income. Fundamental macroeconomics teaches the basic relationship that, if the combined investments of the private sector and public works grow, production and incomes will grow after a time lag, and that an expansion in incomes will result in the growth of private-sector consumption. About one year after the start of the sharp drop in stock prices at the beginning of 1990, despite the increase in public works investments, the sharp decline in private-sector investments led to a start in sluggishness in overall investments and one year thereafter the gross domestic product (GDP) became sluggish. Both private-sector consumption and GDP became sluggish at the same time. Even the economic decline of the latter half of fiscal year 1993, which was unexpected by government authorities and the majority of economic commentators, should not have been any surprise as long as they were dispassionately observing the significance of the sharp drop in capital investments and sharp decline in overall investments owing to untimely economic measures which took place in the second half of 1992. It was readily obvious that arguments that fiscal expansion had no effect on the economy were in error. Economic measures were definitely not taken in a timely manner. However, if the public works investment increases ordered under economic measures had not taken place, overall investment declines would have been much sharper and the economic situation would have been much worse. Those who argue that fiscal expansion had no effect on the economy assert that fiscal expansion caused domestic interest rates to rise, led to a stronger yen, caused a decline in demand for imports, and negated benefits of demand expansion effects of fiscal policy. However, those were the results of inadequate monetary relaxation measures taken in response to fiscal expansion and were not of a nature that could be directly tied to the ineffectiveness of fiscal policy. Attention Focused on Overall Investment Trends The question now is, what can we project in the way of trends for GDP if we focus on overall investments? A survey of capital investment plans for a variety of categories indicates that the growth in capital investments will fall to an annual negative growth rate of 5 percent to 10 percent. Residential investments represent about 33 percent of the overall capital investments, while recent rises in residential loan interest rates are expected to bring housing growth to a standstill, and, when combined with overall capital investments, will have no major effect on private-sector investment trends. Public works investments are expected to grow at an annual rate of 10-20 percent. They grew about 15 percent over the prior year period between the second and fourth quarters of 1993. If the growth rates for private-sector investments and public works investments are simulated on the basis of the foregoing expectations, we can arrive at the growth rate for overall investments. The economic outlook based on the most optimistic overall investment forecasts indicates that GDP growth will be moderate. Strong Yen May Call for Downward Revision At issue here is that the survey of capital investments published thus far does not reflect the potential for downward revision of capital investment plans based on the strong yen beginning in the middle of February 1994. Actual capital investments are running at a rate 10 percent below the projected low range. They will probably run along the same trendline in fiscal year 1994 as a result of downward revisions. Additionally, if public works investment growth is estimated at 15 percent on an interim basis and we arrive at an average overall investment scenario, fiscal year 1994 will witness a further decline and the possibility of further worsening in the economy. Further, when one considers the delay in the approval of the fiscal year 1994 budget and that public works investment growth in fiscal year 1993 fell below 15 percent, there is the major possibility that overall investments will fall below the average scenario levels.
