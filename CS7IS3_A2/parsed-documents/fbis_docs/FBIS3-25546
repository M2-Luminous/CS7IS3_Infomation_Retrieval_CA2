It is difficult to say for the time being despite the promises of the president of the Republic but one thing seems certain. Apart from the assassination of a fierce opposition leader, the killing of the Social Democratic Party secretary general has another objective: To sabotage the setting up of the transitional institutions planned for today. As you know, the ceremony did not take place today. How can one imagine the ceremony taking place in an atmosphere of mourning? Who has an interest in seeing the setting up of the transitional institutions postponed? Three names come to the mind of the least attentive observer: First, Liberal Party Chairman Justin Mugenzi, for well-known reasons. He would like to impose his deputies on the National Assembly but has met with opposition from people, like the late Gatabazi, who defended democracy. Second, there is the National Republican Movement for Democracy and Development [MRND] which is pulling strings behind Mr. Mugenzi and has an interest in supporting him. Finally, there is the Revolutionary Democratic Council, Coalition for the Defense of the Republic, the MRND's ally, whose pretext for sabotaging the establishment of the transitional institutions is because they were denied a seat in the Transitional National Assembly. So many parties for one reason or another could have acted to prevent the establishment of the transitional institutions. None of them have never hidden this desire and they would like to sabotage the setting up of transitional institutions and the disappearance of late Gatabazi could be advantageous in this. May his soul rest in peace.
