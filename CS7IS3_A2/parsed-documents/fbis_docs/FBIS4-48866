At the meeting, the citizens expressed heartfelt thanks and congratulations to Mr. Taylor for defending the cause for which the people's popular uprising was launched. They expressed their commitment and loyalty to the leadership of the NPFL, and stressed that they will do everything possible to fully support the goals and principles of the Revolution. In a petition to the former president of the NPRA [National Patriotic Reconstruction Assembly] Government, Mr. Charles Gankay Taylor, the citizens said the infiltration and taking over of compound numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 by the Liberian Peace Council in Grand Bassa County was masterminded by ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group]. According to the petition, under the disarmament process ECOMOG disarmed and encamped over 200 NPFL soldiers, without deploying troops of the expanded ECOMOG in those areas, thereby giving grounds to the self-styled Liberian Peace Council [LPC] to commit mayhem and atrocities in Grand Bassa County. The petition says towns and villages are being burned down to ashes, including [words indistinct], by forces loyal to the LPC, which is being aided and armed by the Nigerian contingent of ECOMOG. At the same time, the citizens have appealed to local and nongovernmental organizations operating in the country to speedily deliver medical and relief supplies to the starving population in that part of the country. Meanwhile, Mr. Taylor has set up a committee comprising of top military brass of the NPFL to work closely with chiefs, elders, and superintendents in the area to restore law and order.
