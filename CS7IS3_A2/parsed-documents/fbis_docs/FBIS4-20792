The Government has directed the premier oil exploration and production agencies, the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and the Oil India Limited (OIL) to step up output by 15 per cent annually over the next three years. This is essential to meet the target of 47.08 million tonnes of output by the terminal year of the Eighth Plan. Unless production is raised to these levels, oil imports will have to be substantially increased to bridge the growing demand-supply gap. Official sources say the higher production will be required to meet domestic demand even though the hydrocarbons sector is facing an acute resource crunch. As much as 70 per cent of total Plan outlay has already been utilised, with another three years remaining in the Eighth Plan. In view of the constraints on resources, sources point out there is no escape from liberalisation and restructuring of the hydrocarbons sector in case the country is serious about achieving the goal of self-sufficiency in oil production. Several measures have already been taken to ensure greater flow of resources like inviting foreign oil majors to participate in the process of crude exploration and production of proven oilfields. But evidently the terms and conditions have not proved attractive enough as the response for exploration has not been as enthusiastic as desired. On the other hand, multinationals are keen to enter into projects for production and processing of proven fields where contracts have recently been awarded to Reliance Industries in collaboration with Enron of the U.S. and Videocon in a tie up with Marubeni of Japan. Increase in Imports Expressing concern over the low domestic crude output in recent years which has already led to an increase in oil imports, the Petroleum Ministry notes that production during 1992-93 was only 26.95 million tonnes. This is 5.3 per cent lower than the target and nearly 21 per cent lower than the peak of 34.09 million tonnes achieved in 1989-90. Even during the current financial year, output is likely to be marginally lower than in 1992-93, according to latest reports. The decline in production over the last few years, however, was due to unavoidable factors. One of the primary reasons was the need to carry out rectification measures in the Bombay High offshore fields, the most prolific oil producing area. The rectification was necessary since the fields were "flogged" by overproduction in the mid-eighties. As a result, the reservoir was damaged leading to the present situation where numerous wells have had to be closed down for workover operations. Another factor affecting production has been the law and order situation in Assam, which has effectively curbed output from the northeastern region. Though these are factors beyond the control of the ONGC or OIL, there is no getting away from the fact that there has been considerable slippage in achieving Plan targets. The Petroleum Ministry and Planning Commission are believed to have directed the two leading exploration and production agencies to take remedial steps quickly to take corrective action so that production targets are achieved. The increase in availability will have to be achieved despite the shortage of resources. Latest official data shows that the outlays for the first two years of the Eighth Plan have absorbed as much as 70 per cent of the total allocation of Rs. 24,000 crore for the petroleum sector in the Plan period. The ONGC which has lately been converted into a public limited company is already in the process of raising funds by disinvesting 20 per cent of its equity. The disinvestment programme which is to be completed this year will be partially in European capital markets and partly within the country. The company is expected to become more effective in its prime role of oil exploration in its new restructured incarnation as a corporation instead of a commission.
