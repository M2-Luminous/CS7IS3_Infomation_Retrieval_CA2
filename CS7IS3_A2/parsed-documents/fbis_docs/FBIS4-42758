However, not all are equally optimistic. Among Christian Democratic Union [CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU] adherents, 54 percent expect an economic improvement. In February, only 27 percent had such hopes. Among Free Democratic Party [FDP] adherents, the confidence increased from 14 to 45 percent. However, those who are close to the Social Democratic Party [SPD] are pessimistic: 14 percent in February and 23 percent at the end of May expected an economic upswing. The dissimilar mood in the political camps is influencing the upcoming European election. From the beginning to the end of May, the share of CDU/CSU adherents who think that it its "particularly important" increased from 35 to 53 percent. Among FDP adherents, 44 percent (early May: 36 percent) are of this opinion, as compared with 43 percent in the SPD (early May: 29 percent), and only 39 percent (early May: 31 percent) in the Alliance 90/Greens. Among all voters, CDU/CSU adherents are most firmly determined to participate in the election. From the beginning to the end of May, the share of those who are determined to participate increased. "I will certainly participate in the election," said 61 percent of the CDU/CSU adherents at the end of May, as compared with 48 percent in early May. Among the FDP adherents, the "certain intention to vote" increased from 44 percent to 60 percent. However, there was stagnation among the SPD's friends. "I will certainly participate in the election," said 46 percent of them both at the beginning and the end of May. This dissimilar intentions result in a turnout of about 60 percent, as in 1989. In western Germany, it will presumably be five points higher than in the east. After the poll concluded on 27 May, the presumable election result in the European election would be as follows: 36.5 percent for the CDU/CSU, including the votes for the CSU of about 6 percent, 35.5 percent for the SPD, 10.5 percent for the Alliance 90/Greens, 6.0 percent for the FDP, 3.0 percent for the PDS, and 2.5 percent for the Republikaner. The upward tendency for the CDU/CSU is continuing. Regarding the second-vote intention ("if the Bundestag election were held next Sunday"), the SPD has a narrow lead before the CDU/CSU with 37.3 percent and 36.0 percent respectively. The FDP gains about 8.6 percent and the Alliance 90/Greens 10.6 percent; 3.3 percent want to vote for the Republikaner and 3.1 percent for the PDS.
