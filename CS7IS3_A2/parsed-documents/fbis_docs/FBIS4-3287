The world is moving toward multi-polarity and the Chinese Government holds that such a trend is of positive significance, he said. "It is the common aspiration of people throughout the world to preserve peace, strengthen cooperation and promote development," he noted. "However, we should also be aware that some problems left over from the Cold War era remain to be resolved, while many new conflicts and contradictions continue to crop up, leaving the world far from peaceful," he added. Also, many developing countries are becoming poorer, he pointed out. "The issue of world peace is yet to be addressed, while the problem of development is even more glaring," he said. On the whole, the world is still locked in complicated and profound changes, he said. "Therefore, the establishment of a new international political and economic order represents the urgent desire of all the peoples in the world." "The new international political and economic order we advocate is different in essence from the old order which was marked by hegemonism and power politics," he said. Li said, "we believe such a new order includes many contents, but its core is as follows: -- In handling international relations, the principles of mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, non-interference in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence should be strictly followed. -- The right of different nations to choose the social system and mode of development compatible with their national conditions should be respected. -- All nations, big or small, strong or weak, rich or poor, are entitled to participate in international affairs, which should not be determined by one or several big countries. -- Disputes between nations should be settled in a fair and reasonable way through peaceful negotiations, in the spirit of equal consultation, mutual understanding and mutual accommodation. When conditions are not ripe, disputes can be shelved temporarily, in an effort to seek common ground while reserving differences. Disputes over some issues should not hamper the development of normal nation-to-nation relations. -- Trade and economic cooperation should be conducted in line with the principles of equality, mutual benefit and exchange of equal values. Developed nations face unshirkable responsibilities for gradually reducing the gap between the North and the South, or between developed and developing nations. Li called the establishment of a new political and economic order of the world "a long-term and arduous task," saying "we are ready to work unremittingly towards that, along with all countries in the world."
