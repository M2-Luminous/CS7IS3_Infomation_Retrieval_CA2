Hata inaugurated a minority cabinet Thursday -- the first such cabinet in 39 years -- after three weeks of political infighting within the ruling coalition. The resultant withdrawal of the Social Democratic Party [of Japan -- SDPJ], the largest ally in the coalition, leaves the governing body as a minority force in both chambers of the Diet. Despite the bleak outlook for his administration, the prime minister will visit Europe during the holiday-studded "golden week" while most Japanese are enjoying several days of leisure, to make his international debut in Japan's top political post. Hata, who served as foreign minister and concurrently deputy prime minister in the cabinet headed by former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, is expected to leave Monday for a six-day tour of Italy, France, Germany and the European Union's headquarters in Brussels. During the European trip, he aims to start building personal relationships with European leaders before attending July summit of leaders from the Group of Seven (G-7) major industrial powers in Naples, Italy, government sources said. Hata will tell his European counterparts that he will take over and develop Hosokawa's economic reform policies, they said. Meanwhile, newly appointed Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa will visit several Middle East nations between May 2 to 8 to promote the Middle East peace process, Foreign Ministry officials said. The trip will take Kakizawa to Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Syria and the occupied territories. He is scheduled to meet Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Mahmud Musa, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, Jordanian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister 'Abd- al-Salam al-Majali and Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar', the officials said. They said the foreign minister may also meet Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasir 'Arafat during his trip. For his part, Japan's new Trade Minister Eijiro Hata will attend an international conference of economic, industry and trade ministers from western industrial nations and East European countries to be held May 6-7 in Warsaw. The conference is expected to take up three major topics -- investment promotion in Eastern Europe, how to smoothly privatize formerly state-owned enterprises, and East-West trade promotion, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] said. The Warsaw gathering will be the third of its kind, following one in Munster in 1992 and another in Tokyo last year. MITI officials said Japan hopes to explore the possibility of resuming the stalled "framework" trade talks with the United States when the minister meets his U.S. counterpart in Warsaw. A top White House official recently said the U.S. would welcome the opportunity to resume the talks following the installation of a new Japanese Government. Japan hopes to settle its protracted trade dispute with the U.S. before the G-7 summit in Naples pledging a second package of market- opening measures in June to reduce its huge trade surplus with the U.S. The two countries have been unable to resume the trade talks that broke down in February over failure to iron out differences on "objective criteria" for gauging foreign access to Japanese markets. Meanwhile, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii will attend the annual conference of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) slated for Tuesday through Thursday in Nice, France. On the domestic political front, other coalition leaders are expected to devote themselves to canvassing support for the new government among reform-oriented legislators of the top opposition Liberal Democratic Party and the Social Democratic Party, political analysts said. At the first news conference after taking office Thursday, Hata said, "Although my administration will face difficult times... I will ask the SDP to cooperate with us on whatever policies they can, such as the legislation of budget bills." "I will also ask the LDP to cooperate with us, as I believe the LDP will also be ready to cooperate on agreed-upon policies," he said. "The LDP was once our colleague with whom we used to run the government together." However, both the LDP and the SDP immediately rebuffed his plea, pointing their fingers at Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], an LDP breakaway, in an apparent reference to the dominance of Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa in the policy-making process. Despite the bleak political scene, a record 455,000 people are expected to leave for trips abroad during the golden week, representing a 20.5 percent rise over the same period of 1993, the Japan Travel Bureau Inc. (JTB) predicted. Hawaii tops the list of destinations, followed by Hong Kong and tourist spots in South Korea.
