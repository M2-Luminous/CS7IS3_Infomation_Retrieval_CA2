This will be his first public engagement. Today he summoned the Italian ambassadors in Europe to a meeting in the Belgian capital. Francesco Mattioli reports: [Begin Mattioli recording] Is there an Italian problem for our European partners? [Martino] I would not call it an Italian problem. However, there is no doubt that we must immediately tell our European partners -- and also the U.S. -- that our foreign policy will not change much. [end recording] [Mattioli] Antonio Martino -- as his first public engagement as the newly-appointed foreign minister -- has decided to take this message to Brussels. He will meet Jacques Delors and the EU foreign ministers tomorrow. This afternoon he met the Italian ambassadors based in countries of the European Union. The problem of the Italian eastern borders does not exist, Martino said. It is not on the agenda. However, at a time of important changes, there is a need to explain the changes to the European family. [Begin Martion recording] The governments of the various European countries always exchange information about domestic politics and on foreign policy strategies. Of course such a need is even greater now that the Italian political scene is changing so much. This is why I decided to rush here without even waiting for the confidence vote. [Mattioli] So you want to reassure that there will be no changes, in spite of statements made by some people? [Martino] Absolutely. Of course I am absolutely not saying that nothing will change. What I am saying is that the main points of the Italian foreign policy will remain the same as in the past. [end recording]
