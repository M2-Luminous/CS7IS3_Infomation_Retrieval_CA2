I welcome you warmly, dear brothers and sisters. We are pleased that another year has passed since the formation of our honorable Islamic Majles. [passage omitted] What I deem necessary to mention at this juncture is that the slightest issue that might give hope to the enemy should not emerge from the centers of responsibility. We have nothing to do with irresponsible individuals. The government and Majles should work shoulder to shoulder. The Majles should be a source of help for the government. This is not a new idea. It has been like this for centuries. If the people's deputies do not render assistance to the governments, the governments are unable to carry out their work. The Majles is a legislative center. The power of restraint is in the hands of the Majles. The Majles has its foot on the brakes too. If a government moves and you put your foot on the brake, it cannot move. If the Majles were to neglect to direct the government, no good result would be gained. Directing should be carried out. Attention should always be paid to the issue of independence and sense of responsibility and bravery. But a situation should not arise in which a conflict may be felt between the government and the Majles, lest one should think that there is conflict between these two. Today, too, thanks be to God, is not like that. Of course the enemy may magnify any small matter tenfold, sometimes a hundredfold. However, praise be to God, the Majles supports the government and the government too works toward the legislative process of the Majles. The running of the country is a difficult task. [passage omitted] Of course one should never defend mistakes that mainly take place in the second and third ranks of the government. No one should defend them. If someone makes a mistake, it should be pointed out to him. Thanks be to God, our president is a knowledgeable scholar, is aware of changing times, and is in control of the running of the country. Among all the people that are known to us, he has exceptional capabilities. He pays attention to all the affairs and the suggestions of the deputies will assist him too. You can make use of the instruments that the law has put in your hands, such as points of order, questions, and so on. You have these resources too. The most important instrument is the legislation, which guides the government on which directions to take, and the government has an obligation to obey. You can prevent mistakes by this means completely. Today the situation is very sensitive. Today it is the turn of one of the most difficult tasks -- that is, the task of reconstruction. Destruction is much easier than construction. There is a difference between destroying a building that is collapsing and constructing a straight and powerful building. The first takes two days and the second might not be finished in two years. It is a difficult time, difficult work. The foreign enemies are serious in their hostility too. You only observe a corner of their animosity in their propaganda. The esteemed deputies might of course have access to secret reports. Therefore, you see how much the enemy is trying to prevent the Islamic Republic from realizing its set aspirations. Under such circumstances, thanks be to God, we have this Majles that is alive, religious, committed, aware, familiar with its duty, and courageous; we have this capable and authoritative government; and we have this experienced president who has shown his presence in all the arenas. This is a good basis for work. We should go forward with speed and power, God willing. Nothing should prevent us from undertaking correct action. [passage omitted] I hope that all the brothers and sisters will be successful. I hope that the esteemed speaker of the Majles -- thanks be to God that the same shining face has been appointed -- and other esteemed deputies who have responsibilities within the Majles will be successful. God will award you further successes. [passage omitted]
