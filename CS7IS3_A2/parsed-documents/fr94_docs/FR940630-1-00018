FR940630-1-00018 FR940630-1-00005 The Pennsylvania enhanced I/M program requires coverage of all 1968 and newer LDGV, LDGT1 and LDGT2 up to 9,000 pounds GVWR which are registered or required to be registered in the I/M program area. As of the date of the SIP submittal, 5,815,580 vehicles will be subject to enhanced I/M testing. The Commonwealth's regulation does not currently include vehicles operating on all fuel types but Pennsylvania commits to adding the required testing of these vehicles once EPA promulgates regulations on alternative fueled vehicle I/M testing. Act 166 and the Pennsylvania I/M regulation provide the legal authority to implement and enforce the vehicle coverage. This level of coverage is currently approvable because it provides the necessary emission reductions to meet the performance standard. Pennsylvania's program provides that large fleets will make special testing arrangements with the Pennsylvania I/M contractor. This will include appointments scheduled during non-peak hours using a dedicated lane, testing scheduled after hours and the establishment of a test lane at a large fleet location if such a fleet determines that this would be a more cost effective approach for their particular needs. Small fleets will be tested on a first-come, first-served basis at the regular test stations in the same manner as a privately-owned vehicle. The Commonwealth's plan for testing fleet vehicles is acceptable and meets the requirements of the federal I/M regulation. The Commonwealth's regulation requires vehicles which are operated on Federal installations located within an I/M program area to be tested, regardless of whether the vehicles are registered in the state or local I/M area, and is approvable. The Commonwealth's regulation provides for no special exemptions. Test Procedures and Standards_40 CFR Part 51.357 Written test procedures and pass/fail standards shall be established and followed for each model year and vehicle type included in the program. Test procedures and standards are detailed in 40 CFR part 51.357 and in the EPA document entitled ``High-Tech I/M Test Procedures, Emission Standards, Quality Control Requirements, and Equipment Specifications'', EPA&hyph;AA&hyph;EPSD&hyph;IM&hyph;93&hyph;1, dated April 1994. The federal I/M regulation also requires vehicles that have been altered from their original certified configuration (i.e. engine or fuel switching) to be tested in the same manner as other subject vehicles. The Commonwealth's regulation includes a description of the test procedure for idle emission and evaporative system pressure testing and for a visual emission control device inspection which conform to EPA approved test procedures and are approvable. The Commonwealth regulations provide a general description of the test procedure for transient emission and evaporative system purge testing. However, the Commonwealth regulations do not provide specific transient and purge test procedures as described in the EPA document entitled ``High Tech I/M Test Procedures, Emission Standards, Quality Control Requirements, and Equipment Specifications'', EPA&hyph;AA&hyph;EPSD&hyph;IM&hyph;93&hyph;1, April 1994. The Pennsylvania SIP states that the regulation will be amended by January 1995 to include the test procedures found in the July 1993 version of the EPA document referenced above. EPA interprets this language as a commitment on the part of the Commonwealth to amend the Commonwealth regulations by December 31, 1994 to incorporate the test procedures from the EPA document. Since the release of the July 1993 version of the EPA document, a final version, dated April 1994, has been released which contains minor changes from the July 1993 version. EPA believes that the Commonwealth can incorporate the minor changes from the final version into their regulation amendments. Section 178.205(2) of the Commonwealth's regulation allows the Commonwealth to approve alternate purge procedures if they are shown to be equivalent or better than Commonwealths' existing purge test procedure. EPA's concern is that this provision does not require EPA approval before implementation of the alternate test procedure in the Commonwealth's program. EPA is proposing to find that the test procedure requirements of the federal regulation are satisfied based on the condition that the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania will submit to EPA by December 31, 1994 the amended Commonwealth's regulation incorporating the transient and evaporative purge test procedures from the final version of the EPA I/M document referenced above and requiring EPA approval prior to the use of any alternate purge test procedure. EPA proposes to conditionally approve the Pennsylvania SIP based on the Commonwealth's commitment to amend its regulations consistent with this finding. The effective date of these regulation amendments must coincide with the start date of the enhanced I/M program. If the Commonwealth fails to fulfill this condition by December 31, 1994, EPA will consider the commitment not met and will promptly issue a letter to the Commonwealth indicating that the conditional approval has been converted to a disapproval.
