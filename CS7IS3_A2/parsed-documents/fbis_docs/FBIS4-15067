Enterprises Do Not Want To Fill Military Orders at Their Own Expense"] [Text] If the government allocates a mere 5.5 trillion rubles [R] for defense, arms, and military hardware production while at least R28 trillion is required to maintain Russia's defense capability, a decision should be made to abolish the military order in principle because the funds allocated will barely be enough to cover defense enterprise debts, and will secure standby status for the space and nuclear forces. This was announced by Yuriy Glybin, Goskomoboronprom's first deputy chairman, at a joint session of Goskomoboronprom and the State Duma's Committee on Industry, Construction, Transport, and Power Engineering leadership held at the defense industries headquarters on 4 April. Mr. Glybin complained that in order to offset the cost of arms and military hardware production, unpaid by the Defense Ministry, defense industry enterprises have to seek credits from commercial banks and repay them out of their profits received from marketing civilian goods. Last year, for example, no more than 30 percent of enterprises in the defense sector were solvent, mainly because, Yuriy Glybin believes, they had to pay R400 billion from their profits to repay commercial credits on defense orders. The Defense Ministry still owes the enterprises R870 billion. Naturally the enterprises are refusing to credit state defense expenditures, and by the end of March, for instance, they have signed merely 35 percent of contracts sought by customers. Vitaliy Vizirov, chief of Goskomoboronprom's Main Science, Technology, and Conversion Directorate, said in particular that in the military aviation sector only 17 aircraft are to be manufactured -- half of an annual production program of one enterprise. Last year, he said, not a single new military equipment or weapon prototype was developed. A mere 3 to 7 percent of the requisite funds is allocated to continue the building of warships, so they will take some 20 years to complete. Armor production capacities are also operated at 8 to 10 percent. Yelena Novikova, chief of Goskomoboronprom's General Economic Directorate, stated that with the defense expenditures envisioned under the 1994 draft budget, one should think not about filling the military production order but about closing and converting, in a civilized way, nearly one-third of defense enterprises so as not to leave 1.4 million people without the means of livelihood. The meeting closed without any specific decisions or political statements although some parliamentarians were ready to raise the question of whether the situation within the military industrial complex has not come about a result of high treason on the part of the executive branch. At any rate, the parliamentarians promised the defense industry their support in discussing the draft budget in the State Duma on condition that the latter "put an end to political inaction."
