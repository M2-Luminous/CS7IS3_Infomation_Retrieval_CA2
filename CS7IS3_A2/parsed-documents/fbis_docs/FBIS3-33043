As the Brazilian Government's final attempt to solve this problem, Amorim accepted U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor's invitation to meet at 1330 today. According to the foreign minister, bilateral disagreements may be overcome through the joint effort of the interested parties. In Amorim's opinion, the controversial items -- the local manufacturing of pharmaceutical products, the retroactive recognition of patents (pipeline) [preceding word in English], the parallel importation of medicines and microorganisms, gained strength given the interpretation by each country. These differences, said Amorim, became more obvious during the GATT's Uruguay Round. One of the things Amorim intends to explain Kantor is that Brazil fully accepts the section related to industrial protection (TRIPS) [Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights]. Amorim added that he must explain that the Brazilian Congress does not intend to reject the TRIPS. The foreign minister went on to explain: "The problem is that Congress will only vote on the TRIPS after its text has been signed by all the countries that signed the agreement during the meeting in Morocco last April." Amorim added: "I am certain Congress will approve it." The agreement that may be reached today will have a significant impact on the approval of the Brazilian Industrial Property Code (CBPI) that has been submitted to the Senate.
