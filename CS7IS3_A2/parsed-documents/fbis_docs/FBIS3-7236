This source also touched on the issue of stopping remittances to North Korea from Japan if the UN Security Council [UNSC] decides to impose economic sanctions. He said that while remittances through banks can be stopped, those passing through Hong Kong and other third countries can only be stopped with the cooperation of the governments concerned. However, regarding cash carried in person to North Korea from Japan: "It is impossible to prohibit North Korean residents in Japan from visiting the DPRK. We are still considering to what extent we can check the flow of cash when they exit the country, and whether or not to issue reentry visas (because human rights issues are involved)." The Foreign Ministry source also stated that economic sanctions will be imposed in several stages and that in such a case, considerable measures can be taken under existing laws. With regard to the UNSC resolution that may be adopted by 25 March (New York time) at the earliest, this source predicted that "it will not touch on sanctions and will be limited to a call to accept unconditional inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)." He said that whether or not sanctions are imposed "depends on how North Korea behaves after the resolution is adopted."
