The contract was signed by Sichuan provincial officials and Tsui Tsin-tong, chairman of the Hong Kong company. The original Chengdu-Mianyang highway, in one of the most economically active areas of this southwest China province, has been a bottleneck in the region's economic growth. The Hong Kong company will pay for 60 percent of the 1.35 billion yuan (about 155 million U.S. dollars) total cost of the project and Sichuan the rest. The express highway is due to be completed in three years from the day work starts, according to the contract. Officials said that the Chengdu-Mianyang express highway will link up with two other main highways in the region and is expected to boost the local economy.
