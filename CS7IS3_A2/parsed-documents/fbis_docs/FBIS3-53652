Prior to issuing the announcement, Rabin conferred separately with Deputy Defense Minister Mordekhay Gur and Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres. Peres believes the government should retain both options: holding a referendum or calling an election once an agreement has been reached. In his opinion, no decision is called for at this point, but the appropriate option should be chosen at the right time. The prime minister does not plan to submit the proposal to the cabinet for approval any time soon, and will only do so when the time comes to make a decision. [passage omitted]
