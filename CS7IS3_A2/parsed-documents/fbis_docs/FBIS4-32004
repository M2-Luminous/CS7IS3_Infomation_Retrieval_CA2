FBIS4-32004 "dreeu117__a94025" FBIS-EEU-94-117-A Daily Report 16 Jun 1994 ANNEX Poland Nigerian Embassy Denies Report Nigerian Embassy Denies Report LD1606212494 Warsaw PAP in English 2054 GMT 16 Jun 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY LD1606212494 Warsaw PAP English BFN [Text] Warsaw, June 16 -- The Nigerian Embassy denied on Thursday the information that Nigerian ministries had attempted to transfer millions of dollars to the accounts of Gdansk institutions. PAP reported on Wednesday that two Nigerian federal ministries of industry and trade, and of national defence approached customers of one of the Gdansk banks and asked them to have the money transfered on their accounts in return for 30 per cent of the transferred amount. A similar proposal made allegedly by the Nigerian Construction Ministry and the Nigerian Oil Corporation was reported in the "DZIENNIK BALTYCKI" daily quoted by the PAP. The embassy states in its communique sent to PAP on Thursday that all these "so-called federal ministries are fake" and adds that "the letters reportedly circulating among some banks in Gdansk have not emanated from federal government ministries or any federal government corporation." The embassy claims that such letters are "handiwork of fraudsters using fictitious names and titles, and aimed at duping unwary and greedy foreign businessmen." The embassy reported on similar cases in its recent regular news bulletin of February 1994 and warned the Polish business community to be on alert. The embassy advised recepients of such letters to report to the embassy but the banks in Gdansk chose to ignore this advise, reads the communique.
