Vivekanand] [Text] Amman--The Lower House of Parliament Tuesday [22 March] called on the government not to resume its peace negotiations with Israel until the U.S.-led blockade on the Red Sea port of al-'Aqabah is actually lifted and the lifting is announced at the U.N. Security Council. The call by the legislature came shortly before U.S. Middle East coordinator Dennis Ross arrived in Amman as part of Washington's preparations to resume the next round of Arab-Israeli peace talks. It also came against the backdrop of reports that a German vessel carrying general cargo bound for Jordan was blocked at the Tiran Straits at the mouth of al-'Aqabah. The ship was prevented from proceeding to al-'Aqabah when it arrived at the straits on Friday, shipping agents said. Officials said the interceptions of al-'Aqabah-bound ships as part of the enforcement of the 43-month-old international sanctions against Iraq were one of the key topics for discussions with Mr. Ross. The lawmakers' statement said: "The Jordanian Parliament condemns the continued American aggression against the Arab Nation in implementation of the American aims to control Arab wealth and serve Israel's interests in the region." "It also condemns the unjust American embargo which continues to deprive the brotherly Iraqi people of food and medicine and basic services and the unjust blockade of the port of al-'Aqabah aimed at pressing Jordan through all means and methods to deprive its freedom of decision in all matters related to the Arab Nation," said the statement. We request the government not to go back to the negotiations table until the blockade of the Gulf of Aqaba is actually lifted and the lifting is announced at the U.N. Security Council," it said. During a session of Parliament earlier in the day, Prime Minister Abdul Salam Majali told the lawmakers that the government was pursuing all efforts to lift the blockade of al-'Aqabah. Dr. Abd-al-Salam al-Majali said he had met with U.S. Ambassador Wesley Egan Jr. Tuesday morning to lodge a protest against the continuing blockage at al-'Aqabah. Dr. al-Majali referred to the repeated presentations Jordan made to the U.S. and the U.N. Security Council, which imposed the sanctions against Iraq following that country's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. He was replying to deputies, some of whom demanded that Jordan, whose economy is suffering as a result of the blockade at al-'Aqabah, refuse to abide by the sanctions against Iraq. While that was not possible in view of Jordan's long standing commitment to international resolutions and decision of the U.N. Security Council, the Kingdom is following up on proposals which would do away with the negative impact on Jordan of the interceptions of al-'Aqabah-bound shipping, officials said. "The process is continuing," said a senior official, referring to a proposal that the inspection of goods coming to Jordan be moved to al-'Aqabah port rather than the Tiran Straits. The proposal, tabled during a January visit to the U.S. of His Majesty King Husayn, was reportedly received positively by U.S. administration officials, but the pace of follow-up process is very slow, officials said. Under the proposal, an independent agency shipping unit, would carry out the inspections of all cargo being unloaded at Aqaba for violations of the sanctions against Iraq. In his comments to Deputies, Dr. al-Majali recalled that the government had sent a strong protest to the Security Council several weeks ago pointing out that the inspection of Jordan-bound ships at high seas was illegal and was hindering the Kingdom's regular maritime operations. Dr. al-Majali was asked by deputy 'Abdallah Akhu Irshaydah to clarify a report that Jordan had shipped 80 tones of chemicals to Iraq. "For the best interests of Iraq, I prefer not to answer that question," Dr. al-Majali said. Informed sources said the reported shipment was of chemicals for refinery. No further detail was immediately available. The latest ship to be intercepted by the U.S.-led naval forces patrolling the Red Sea was the German Skyman, carrying 3,000 tones of cargo for Jordan, said Ibrahim al-Na'uri, an official of the Gharghur Shipping Agency. He said the inspectors kept the vessel waiting for one day at the straits before inspecting on Saturday and ruling that cargo aboard the ship was not accessible to them for inspections. "They checked the ship four times since then," Mr. al-Na'uri told the JORDAN TIMES. "The last inspection took place Tuesday afternoon." Mr. al-Na'uri said he had contacted the government as well as parliamentarians over the stand-off. According to Mr. al-Na'uri, Jordan-bound cargo aboard the Skyman include steel rods, animal feed and general cargo and the ship is not carrying any goods destined for Iraq. At least four ships were intercepted and delayed at the Tiran Straits during February in what was seen an escalation of what Jordanian officials and shipping agents describe as intentional harassment of al-Aqabah-bound vessels despite American pledges to address Jordan's repeated pleas for an end to the siege of its only port.
