FDP General Secretary Werner Hoyer described the result here this evening as an "electoral disaster" and "a bitter moment for the Liberals." What is needed now above all is to give FDP members enough motivation for the forthcoming state and federal elections, he said. According to Hoyer, the reasons for the result lie in "the poor image of the federal FDP as a whole" and also in certain special reasons regarding the FDP in Saxony-Anhalt.
