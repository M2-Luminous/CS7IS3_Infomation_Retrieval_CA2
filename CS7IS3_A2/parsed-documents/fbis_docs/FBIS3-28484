In the statement they shared the view that they should fight it out to prevent the agricultural market opening which would drive the South Korean agriculture into bankruptcy, and urged the authorities to leave unfilled blanks of the final plan for the enforcement of the opening which was due to be submitted by February 15. They also declared that they would fight in concert to prevent a "parliamentary ratification" of the agro-market opening.
