Cisneros explained that U.S. laws "do not contain deadlines, but mechanisms for presenting proposals," admitting, however, that 30 April is the date foreseen in this mechanism. The official said dates "are not arbitrarily set by U.S. executive officials." They are part of U.S. laws. Cisneros explained that these laws "do not establish deadlines, but provide mechanisms and certain dates for submitting proposals." The Foreign Ministry secretary said U.S. laws contemplate economic sanctions against Argentina if a new law on pharmaceutical patents is not approved within the established period. Cisneros said the Argentine Government "will respond to this pressure, defending the country's interests." Cisneros added that the new law will not "solely respond to foreign pressure, but also to Argentina's national interests." "U.S. Government and Argentine interests are not necessarily incompatible. Compatibility ends when interests become incongruous," Cisneros warned. "This is not being difficult or different from what is being done by other Western economies in similar situations," Cisneros said, adding: "We are not doing anything different from what was done within the GATT." Regarding the possibilities of the bill's approval by Congress, Cisneros said: "We do not see any problems." He added: "Congress will approve the measure when legislators think our national interests are served." Cisneros admitted that it will be very difficult to get a new law approved by the last day of next month. "Economic sanctions are not good, but Argentina handles its own schedule for approving laws and pursues its own interests." Cisneros confessed that U.S. Vice President Albert Gore received a sort of promise that the bill will finally be approved because the Government "must draft and send the bill and then get it approved."
