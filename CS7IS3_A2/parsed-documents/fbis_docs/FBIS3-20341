A committee of parliament chaired by Speaker Philippe Seguin lifted the parliamentary [immunity] of Chammougon, the independent MP for the French West Indies island of Guadeloupe, whose arrest was authorised. Chammougon is accused in connection with commissions paid by the town of Baie-Mehault, of which he has been mayor since 1977. The town's budget is in the red to the tune of 208 million francs (about 35 million dollars). The MP is also being asked to explain the origin of two million francs (330,00O dollars) that were paid into his bank accounts. Two other French MPS face embezzlement charges, but have not been jailed. Olympique Marseille President Bernard Tapie, a former minister in the socialist government, faces two embezzlement cases and has also been accused of bribery and interfering with witnesses in an attempt to throw a match. On Tuesday conservative Michel Noir, the mayor of Lyon and also a former minister, was charged with embezzling public money and ordered to put up bail of 2.4 million francs (420,000 dollars). Three ministers in the government of Prime Minister Edouard Balladur have meanwhile been named in a judicial report exposing illegal financing of the right-wing Republican Party, part of the ruling coalition. The report by Rennes examining magistrate Renaud Van Ruymbeke, who has also probed illegal financing of the former ruling Socialist Party, said Gerard Longuet (Industry), president of the party, Francois Leotard (Defence), honorary president, and Trade Minister Alain Madelin were all aware of cash payments into Republican Party coffers of 28 million francs (4.9 million dollars) between 1987 and 1991.
