The talks proceeded in a pragmatic and friendly [wu shi you hao 0523 1395 0645 1170] atmosphere. Dzhumagulov said: Kyrgyzstan and China enjoy traditional friendly relations. These relations are being increasingly enriched and constantly developed. He said: Kyrgyzstan, which is currently in a stage of economic reform, attaches great importance to strengthening economic ties with China and to learning from its experiences, including those in agricultural reform. He said: Xinjiang and other regions in China have established more than 70 joint ventures in Krygyzstan, including those engaged in food processing and leather making; these joint ventures are operating smoothly. Experts on the two sides are considering cooperative projects in papermaking, public health, pharmaceuticals, and other fields. Dzhumagulov also briefed Li Peng on Krygyzstan's economic situation. Li Peng said: The economic difficulties facing Kyrgyzstan during the course of reform are temporary; it is entirely possible to overcome them through great efforts. Li Peng said: Over the past two years or so, the two countries have successfully initiated economic cooperation and trade, and they have made impressive progress. Bilateral trade, which has developed rapidly, continues to show potential. The Chinese Government -- the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in particular -- will strive to develop cooperation in trade, economics, and other fields with Kyrgyzstan. In the future, the two countries should exploit and utilize their favorable conditions more fully, act in accordance with the law of the economy, ensure that benefits will accrue to both sides, constantly introduce diverse forms of cooperation, and improve and upgrade their trade. To this end, both sides should create better conditions, including those aimed at solving communications and transportation problems that are hampering the development of economic cooperation and trade. Li Peng added: "A number of entrepreneurs are accompanying me on my current trip, thereby enabling the two sides to increase contacts. The Chinese Government encourages and supports participation by Chinese entrepreneurs in Kyrgyzstan's economic construction on the basis of equality and mutual benefit." Premier Li Peng invited Prime Minister Dzhumagulov to visit China at a convenient time. Dzhumagulov expressed his thanks and accepted the invitation with pleasure.
