The Preliminary Working Committee (PWC) political sub-group prefers either a multi-seat, single-vote system, or proportional representation. The Legislative Council has already enacted legislation to introduce a single-seat, single-vote system for the 1994/95 district board municipal council and Legco polls. A revised report by the political sub-group will be tabled to the third plenary meeting of the PWC in July. PWC member Professor Lau Siu-kai said scrapping the single-seat, single-vote system would not create great shock in the community. "The impact on society will be limited," he said. "Even if we adopt a different voting method, it will only have a limited effect on the result of the elections." Professor Lau said China had always voiced opposition to the single-seat, single-vote method, but the PWC would try to gauge public opinion on the issue. Another departure from the 1995 model will be the line-up for the nine new functional constituency seats. Hong Kong co-convenor of the political subgroup, Leung Chun-ying, said members agreed that the nine new seats should be created with a franchise similar to the existing functional seats. Members also agreed to lowering the voting age from 21 to 18, Mr. Leung said. Another contentious issue was how to cope with the legislative vacuum following the disbanding and re-organisation of the legislature upon the change of sovereignty, according to Professor Lau. Members felt that it could be resolved either by forming a provisional lawmaking assembly or delegating the power to the chief executive, he said. Ending a two-day session in Hong Kong, mainland members of the political sub-group will meet political parties in the local Xinhua (New China News Agency) Wan Chai headquarters today and tomorrow. Meanwhile, Senior Executive Councillor Lady Dunn yesterday stressed that Hong Kong would remain under British rule until mid- 1997 despite the presence of the PWC in the territory. Speaking after yesterday's Executive Council meeting, Lady Dunn said: "It is clearly stated in the Sino-British Joint Declaration that Britain will rule Hong Kong until June 30 1997. I firmly believe that both the British and Chinese governments will uphold the Joint Declaration." She said the PWC, which China claimed was only an advisory body, posed no threat to the Government. "The PWC is only an advisory body but not a power organ. Where they hold their meetings is no big deal. Given the fact that there are Hong Kong and mainland members, it is easy to understand why they want to meet in Hong Kong," she said.
