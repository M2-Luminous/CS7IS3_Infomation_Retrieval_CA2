During the activities, Division General Antonio Riviello Bazan, Mexican national defense secretary, said the Mexican State does not intend to repress public demonstrations with the newly purchased water cannons, referring to the famous Cobra vehicles that have been so severely criticized. Defense Secretary Riviello Bazan said that if public peace is threatened, this equipment will be used. Go ahead, Jesus, we are listening. [Casasola] Here again, Pepe, I want to mention that it is not the government's decision to suppress any public demonstration. If the social well-being is threatened by the presence of violent groups, however, the riot equipment recently purchased by the National Defense Secretariat will be used. This is the warning National Defense Secretary Antonio Riviello Bazan made today. In a news conference held in the San Miguel de los (Agueyes) Military Base in Huehuetoca Muncipality, Mexico State, he pointed out that the 24 armored vehicles cost $100,000 each. He added that they will be used only when state officials who are confronted by violent groups require their use. Here are the defense secretary's words: [Begin Riviello Bazan recording] If we had to intervene, this equipment causes no more harm than getting wet. Anyway, we feel it has not been well received by the public, but the Army has to take precautions. This is a precaution. If the public, however, wants us to remove the water cannons and replace them with 105mm cannons, then we will replace them. [laughter] Yes, there are two; we are talking about two different types. One is the riot cannon, the other is not precisely for that purpose. You can see the government does not intend to prevent any public demonstration. It is not up to the National Defense Secretariat. It is up to the proper civilian authorities to make a request through the Government Secretariat and, in the last instance, the president gives the authorization. We are not autonomous. [end recording] [Casasola] Antonio Riviello Bazan reiterated that the purchase of the riot equipment is part of a plan to upgrade the Army's equipment, since it has equipment which dates back to 1942. Jokingly, he said: This is a good opportunity for anyone who wants to buy antique cars. He also spoke about the State of Chiapas case, indicating that the National Defense Secretariat is currently analyzing two recommendations made by the National Human Rights Commission. Concerning the current conflict in this state, he added: [Begin Riviello Bazan recording, in progress] ...in a state of alert by the Armed Forces. We are determined to continue supporting the government's efforts. [end recording] [Casasola] As for the elections, the national defense secretary said the Mexican Army will participate in the security and transportation of the electoral ballots. On the recent creation of the National Commission of Public Security, he said his department is not subordinate to anyone. After the news conference some members of the media were invited to a military demonstration in which live ammunition was used.
