Ozolas publicly labelled the Polish and Belarusian ambassadors in Lithuania security officials. He also expressed his astonishment at Lithuania agreeing to the diplomats'appointments, disregarding their services to the former system. The Foreign Ministry stated on 10 March that such statements are irresponsible and without foundations. This harms the right of choice by a neighboring state, complicates mutual relations between states, and humiliates the prestige of the Lithuanian state.
