The subcommittee will compile an outline for its interim report in the first part of May next year, and thereafter consider nuclear fuel recycling operations, international relations, etc., separately before issuing its final report. The Basic Policy Subcommittee of the Advisory Committee for Energy has been meeting since September to deliberate stability and flexibility in energy supply. During the course of these discussions, it was noted that there is a need to consider the role of nuclear energy in light of a new energy policy based on changes in the environment. While keeping a close eye on the status of the Long-Term Plan for Development and Use of Atomic Energy that is currently under review, the Atomic Energy Subcommittee decided to hold intensive discussions on improving the safety measures for nuclear power generation. The first points for consideration are measures to improve safety in LWRs, which are the mainstream of nuclear power generation in Japan, and improving and expanding activities to present information and promote atomic energy in order to increase understanding of nuclear power generation among the general populace. Second, it is important to obtain international understanding about nuclear fuel recycling operations in light of increasing interest throughout the world in nuclear non-proliferation, so the subcommittee will consider the course of future policy that can measure up to questioning from both foreign and domestic sources as it reaffirms the path toward reprocessing and recycling. Third, the subcommittee will consider methods for cooperation in nuclear power safety, mainly with the countries in the vicinity of Japan that have already introduced nuclear power generation or plan to do so in the future.
