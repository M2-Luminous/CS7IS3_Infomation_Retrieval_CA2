Haavisto pointed out that the Eduskunta's targets, when it discussed the application for membership, were that agricultural production should continue at almost its present level and that, for instance, milk production would grow. The negotiators were to try to get the largest sum possible from the European Union [EU] and the rest was to be funded by Finland in the form of national subsidies: "The negotiations were conducted precisely according to this plan." The EU did not take into account Finland's special position, but treated the country on the same basis as Germany, even though that country's crop yield is twice as high as Finland's, so there is a greater need for national subsidies: "This solution implies that, without an agreement on national subsidies, Finland may be left with just a few farms producing milk for consumption," Haavisto added sharply. Haavisto's personal position regarding the EU is also based on national subsidies: "I cannot recommend that people vote `yes' to a solution that would destroy Finland's rural areas. National subsidies are a crucial issue." The timetable of the EU referendum is open. Without signed approval of the agreement by the European Parliament, no referendum can be organized. The situation is exacerbated by the recent hardening of Britain's standpoint on the minority vote issue, Haavisto said. There are also many open issues and questions of interpretation over and above those concerning national subsidies. The EU Commission interprets agricultural questions in a different manner than was agreed at the ministerial level. Haavisto also emphasized that running down the rural areas would be terribly expensive for Finland. He points to the enormous investments in infrastructure made over the decades, including roads, schools, telecommunications, and health centers. If the countryside becomes a desert, these will be wasted and new infrastructures will have to be created for the people who move south in search of work. "The benefits of EU membership have been exaggerated. For instance, membership will not bring investments to Finland. It would increase Finland's attractiveness, but the prerequisites for foreign investment are high-quality manpower and favorable raw-material, energy, and capital costs." Something has, however, become clear to the farmers. Grain growers within the EU receive CAP [Common Agricultural Policy] support for the difference when the price per kg drops from 1.10 markkas to 80 pennia. This subsidy rate, however -- much to the displeasure of Haavisto and the farmers -- is linked to the average crop per hectare of the last half of the 1980's, a period with two exceptionally severe years of crop failure in Finland. The average crop per hectare was 2,900 kg, and you cannot survive on that, Haavisto said. There will be subsidies for unprofitable regions, from which some 300,000 hectares south of a line from Rauma to Loviisa will be excluded, offering Finnish farmers compensation of 900 markkas per hectare or unit of livestock. According to Haavisto, half of France and almost all of Luxembourg benefits from this support. There is also a promise of annual environmental protection subsidies worth 850 million markkas. The environmental support is linked, among other things, to reducing fertilizers and the number of livestock per hectare: "A farm cannot survive on that kind of money. Without national support they will not even get back their operating costs, never mind making a profit. This is a vital issue for the nation. Industry will benefit from the agreement anyway. But there is some price to be paid in view of the risk that Finland's food-production industry may loose nearly 300,000 jobs." The European Union, before the Maastricht treaty, was 70 percent an agricultural community, Haavisto pointed out. Its basic objective is to keep European grain production competitive. Pork, eggs, and broiler hens are treated like secondary cereal products in Europe [as published]. According to this principle, the production of milk, lamb, and beef would be left over for fringe areas like Finland, since they are secondary-grazing-area products. In spite of the gloomy prospects for producers in the latter three categories, Haavisto thinks that the future looks brighter for lamb and beef producers than for the cereal farmers. Some of the member countries are not very interested in Finnish membership or that of the other Nordic countries, while other countries, like Germany, want Finland to join. Without the efforts of the Deputy Chairmanship -- countries like Germany and Belgium -- negotiations would have broken down, Haavisto said: "The process was confusing. It was not managed properly by the EU. Quarrels between member countries caused confusion and everybody tried to wrest some form of benefit for himself. I am sure that the internal order of the EU will improve if the Nordic countries become members."
