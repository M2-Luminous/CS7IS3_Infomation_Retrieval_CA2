Assistant Secretary-General Marrack Goulding. He will hold talks with the prime ministers of the two republics, will hand over to the Tajik Government a message from the U.N. secretary-general. This news was furnished to ITAR-TASS by Marrack Goulding, who is now attending a U.N. conference on disarmament here. Goulding bluntly refused to disclose the contents of Butrus Ghali's message, but noted that it was devoted to the political situation in Tajikistan and to the settlement of the existing differences between the Tajik Government and the opposition. Goulding's visit to Tajikistan will take place on the eve of the multilateral consultations on the situation in that republic, which are expected to begin on June 4. Goulding spoke highly about Russia's efforts to settle the conflict in Tajikistan. "Moscow is rendering the most vigorous support to the U.N. efforts to achieve a settlement in that republic," he stated. The U.N. assistant secretary-general ruled out the possibility of U.N. peace-making forces being sent to the republics of the former USSR. "We regard the achievement of political concord between the conflcting groups as an indispensable precondition for this," he stated. "But there is no such precondition in any of the republics, including Georgia, which urges us to send our troops to Abkhazia. Therefore," Goulding pointed out, "we welcome Russia's full-scale participation in the settlement of inter-ethnic conflicts in the former USSR, and we believe it is very important to ensure close cooperation between the United Nations and Moscow in this effort." Chief of the analysis and forecasts department of the Russian Foreign Ministry Ednan Agayev, who is attending the U.N. conference in Hiroshima, told ITAR-TASS that he welcomed Goulding's visit to Tajikistan. He expressed the hope that this would contribute to more active U.N. participation in the effort to settle the conflict in that republic. "Unfortunately, the U.N. still does not display any readiness to assume a greater share of the responsibility for this effort. It is adhering to a passive stand," he noted.
