The Duma is now situated in the former Comecon building and lawmakers complain that it is incovenient for work. The government offered parliamentarians five new places, including the building of the Russian Management Academy in the south west of the capital and two buildings in downtown Moscow. No reports whether the prime minister and the Duma speaker had reached any agreement were available. However, several lawmakers said that the Duma continues to insist that the former parliament building which was pounded by tanks during the October revolt and then transferred to the government, be returned to the legislature.
