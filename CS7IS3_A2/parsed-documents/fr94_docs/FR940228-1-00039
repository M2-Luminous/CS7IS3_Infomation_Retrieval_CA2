FR940228-1-00039 FR940228-1-00003 Appendix A_Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis for Revision of 10 CFR Part 34 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is proposing to amend its regulations governing industrial radiography. The proposed rule would include additional safety requirements to enhance the level of protection of radiographers and the public and would clarify the regulations so that licensees may have a better understanding of what is expected in radiographic operations. The proposed rule includes a number of updated radiography regulations that have been adopted by many Agreement States. The format of the radiography regulations would be adjusted to place requirements into descriptive categories. The radiography industry in the United States consists of approximately 700 firms, employing about 20,000 individuals, that perform radioisotope radiography either at fixed locations or at multiple temporary job sites. Of these firms, approximately 200 are NRC licensees employing about 3,400 radiographers with an additional 2,000 radiography supervisors and radiographers' assistants. This estimate is based on 1990 data for the number of individuals monitored for radiation exposure to comply with 10 CFR Part 20. The industry uses an estimated 3,500 radiographic exposure devices that employ either cobalt-60 or iridium-192 radioisotope sources. Roughly one-quarter of the firms conduct radiography at a single location and the other three-quarters work at multiple locations generally referred to as temporary jobsites. Approximately 90 percent are considered to be ``small entities'' under the criterion established in Section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980. Most of the radiography licensees are in the business of non-destructive testing in which radiography represents only a part of their total income. A few small firms work only in radiography. Much of the work in the field involves the inspection of welds in bridges, oil, gas, and other pipelines and in the steel framework of commercial buildings under construction so that the success and viability of the industry is closely tied to the economic health of the country. NRC surveys indicated that 76 percent of NRC radiography licensees had annual receipts of over $500,000, and most of the remainder had annual receipts exceeding $250,000. In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 605 (b)), the Commission believes that this rule may, if promulgated, have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The proposed revisions to part 34 are intended to provide additional safety requirements to enhance the level of protection of radiographers and the public and to clarify the regulations so that licensees may have a better understanding of what is expected in radiographic operations. The proposed rule includes a number of radiography regulations which have been adopted by the Agreement States. The proposed revisions to part 34 can be grouped into major and minor impacts. Of the five major impacts, the proposed requirement to have a second qualified individual at temporary jobsites may have a significant effect on small entities, who would be more likely to use single-person crews. It should be recognized that under the current rule many licensees already need to have, at least, two qualified individuals present at a temporary jobsite to maintain direct surveillance of radiographic operations so as to protect against any unauthorized entry into the restricted area. Therefore, this proposed requirement will only impact those operations where two individuals are not currently required. It was assumed in the draft Regulatory Analysis that approximately 25 percent of NRC licensees who perform radiography at temporary jobsites will need to hire and train additional staff to meet the proposed requirement. Other assumptions used in the draft Regulatory Analysis were that each of these 50 licensees would need to hire 3&hyph;4 additional workers, and that the cost of each assistant is $24,000 per year including benefits. The other major impacts include mandatory certification requirements for radiographers, additional training for radiographers' assistants, a specific requirement for a Radiation Safety Officer (RSO) who meets certain training requirements, requirements for permanent installation alarms, and additional requirements for alarm ratemeters. The estimated costs for all of these changes are significantly less than the costs associated with adopting the two-person rule. The initial costs to certify radiographers is approximately $4080. The initial costs for each licensee to provide an additional eight hours of training for radiographers' assistants is approximately $1,200. The initial costs to provide the additional training required to meet the proposed RSO requirements is $3,700 per RSO. The initial costs to install alarms in permanent installations is estimated to be $3,000. The initial costs to purchase additional upgraded alarm ratemeters is estimated to be $1800. The other proposed revisions which are of a minor nature, would result in initial costs of $700-$800 per licensee. In addition, the proposed rule includes a reduction in the number of field inspections to be conducted, from quarterly to annual. This reduction would lead to an estimated annual savings to each NRC licensee of approximately $16,000. The proposed rule also includes a reduction in the frequency for radiation survey instrument calibrations from 3 months to 6 months. This reduction would lead to an estimated annual savings to each NRC licensee of approximately $1400. Of these changes, the costs to adopt the two-person rule may have the most impact on a substantial number of ``small entities''; however, the Commission believes that by requiring at least two qualified individuals to always be present when radiographic operations are being conducted, there will be a significant increase in assurance that operational safety measures and emergency procedures will be implemented effectively. The potential for a lowering of the risk of unintended public exposure can be viewed as a potential cost savings to the industry. This proposed rule does not duplicate or conflict with other Federal rules. No other alternative regulatory provisions that would minimize the economic impact on small entities were considered.
