FR941004-2-00159 FR941004-2-00090 8. Participants in any Plan may elect to transfer to such Plan any amounts deferred by the Participant under any Pre-Existing Plan offered by the relevant Fund. Amounts transferred from Pre-Existing Plans will continue to earn a rate equal to the yield on 90-day U.S. Treasury Bills (as provided under the Pre-Existing Plans). Conversion to Phantom Shares of amounts transferred to the Plans from accounts under the Pre-Existing Plans will be effected at the net asset value of the relevant Fund(s) as of the date of any other granting exemptive relief or an appropriate date thereafter. Applicants' Legal Analysis 1. Section 18(f)(1) generally prohibits a registered open-end investment company from issuing senior securities. Section 13(a)(2) permits an investment company to borrow funds or issue senior securities only as described in the recitals of policy contained in its registration statement, unless authorized by its shareholders. Applicants assert that the Plan contain none of the characteristics of senior securities that led Congress to enact the restrictions on the issuance of such securities. The Funds would not be borrowing for securities speculation. All liabilities created by a accruals under a Plan will be offset by assets of its corresponding Fund, which would not otherwise exist if Participants' compensation were paid on a current basis. Applicants also believe that, given the common existence of deferred compensation plans today, the Plans will not confuse shareholders, complicate the valuation of a Fund's shares, convey a false sense of safety, or be inconsistent with the theory of mutually of risk. 2. Section 13(a)(3) prohibits an investment company from deviating from the fundamental investment policies set forth in its registration statement without authorization by the vote of a majority of its outstanding voting securities. Applicants request an exemption from this section to enable the Funds named in the application to purchase shares of investment companies in The American Funds Group as underlying securities for their Participants' Deferred Payment Account without shareholder approval. Most of the Funds have fundamental investment policies that prohibit them from purchasing the securities of other investment companies. 3 This policy would prevent the Funds from purchasing shares of any other Funds in The American Funds Group without shareholder approval. Each Fund will disclose the existence of the Plans in its prospectus and, if applicable, the exception to its fundamental policies for which relief is requested herein in its statement of additional information. Applicants content that the value of the underlying securities will be de minimis in relation to the total net assets of each Fund. Furthermore, the value of the underlying securities held by a particular Fund in respect of a Participant's Deferred Payment Account would at all times equal the value of the Fund's obligations to pay deferred fees in respect of the corresponding Phantom Shares credited to such account. Consequently, changes in the value of such underlying securities would not affect the value of shareholders' investments. Thus, permitting the Funds to invest in underlying securities without obtaining the shareholder approval required by section 13(a)(3) would result in no harm to shareholders. 3 An exemption from section 13(a)(3) is not necessary for the EuroPacific Growth Fund, the SMALLCAP World Fund, Inc., or the Capital World Growth and Income Fund, Inc., whose fundamental policies permit them to invest up to 5% of their assets in shares of other open-end investment companies. Applicants do not expect the Plans to cause these limits to be exceeded. 3. Section 17(a)(1) generally prohibits an affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any affiliated person of such person, from selling any security to such investment company. This section was designed to prevent sponsors of investment companies from using investment company assets as capital for enterprises with which they were associated or to acquire controlling interests in such enterprises. The sale of securities issued by a Fund pursuant to a Plan would not involve Congress' concerns in enacting this section, but would merely facilitate the matching of a Fund's liability for a Participant's deferred fees with the underlying securities that would determine the amount of such Fund's liability. 4. Section 22(f) prohibits a registered open-end investment company from restricting the transferability or negotiability of any security of which it is the issuer unless the restriction is disclosed in its registration statement, and does not contravene rules and regulations prescribed by the SEC. The section was designed to bar only those restrictions on transferability or negotiability that were either not disclosed to the holder of the security or were expressly prohibited by SEC rules and regulations. Applicants assert that neither of these circumstances would apply to the restriction on transferability of a Participant's benefits under a Plan; such restrictions are clearly set forth in the Plans and do not adversely affect the interests of the Participants or of any Fund shareholder. 5. Section 22(g) prohibits a registered open-end investment company from issuing any of its securities for services or for property other than cash or securities. The provision was intended to prevent the dilutive effect on the equity and voting power of the equity of an open-end company that could result from the issuance of securities for consideration not readily value. Applicants believe that the Plans do not have this effect, particularly in view of current disclosure requirements applicable to directors' compensation. Moreover, a Fund's obligation to make payments under a Plan would not be ``issued'' for services or for property other than cash or securities. Although any Participant's fees which become payable to the Participant would be for services rendered to the relevant Fund, any such fees would become payable independently of the Plans.
