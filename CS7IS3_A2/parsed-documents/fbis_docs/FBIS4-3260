Meanwhile, three lower chamber members of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's Japan New Party (JNP), one of the seven ruling coalition partners, said they have left the party. The five LDP defectors said they quit the single largest party to launch a new parliamentary group in an effort to reorganize the political structure in Japan. They are Koji Kakizawa, Seiichi Ota, Shokei Arai, Taku Yamamoto and Shizuo Sato. "We decided to quit to accelerate the current development by our action," Kakizawa told a press conference in Tokyo. Another LDP lower house member, Kenji Kosaka, also left the party today, saying he will join Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party), the coalition's core party led by Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata. Five other LDP Dietmen who defected the party Friday [15 April] formed a new party today called the New Party Mirai (Future). The three JNP members, Fumihiko Igarashi, Sakihito Ozawa and Akio Nakajima, handed their letters of resignation to Hosokawa, who is the JNP leader. The three, who gained parliamentary seats for the first time in the 1993 general election, have expressed dissatisfaction with Hosokawa's approach to Shinseito. They told reporters that they feel an affinity with the New Party Sakigake (Harbinger), the Social Democratic Party and the Democratic Socialist Party, the three coalition partners that abhor Shinseito co-leader Ichiro Ozawa.
