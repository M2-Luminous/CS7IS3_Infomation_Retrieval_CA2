FBIS4-59106 "drnes091_d_94002" FBIS-NES-94-091 Daily Report 7 May 1994 Libya Al-Qadhdhafi Addresses World Islamic Popular Command Al-Qadhdhafi Addresses World Islamic Popular Command LD0805173894 Tripoli Libyan Television Network in Arabic 2005 GMT 7 May 94 LD0805173894 Tripoli Libyan Television Network Arabic BFN [Speech by leader Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi at the World Islamic Popular Command in Tripoli on 7 May--recorded] [Excerpts] In the name of God: First, I welcome you warmly in your country, among your kinfolk, given that Islamic homes are homes for all Muslims. [passage omitted] We know that the reason behind the founding of the World Islamic Popular Command [WIPC] is the bad situation of the Islamic nation due to the infringements of the enemy of this nation, its greed, and its interference. This command was established to face up to this bad situation, to try to save the nation from the situation in which it finds itself. The real reason that brought us together and made us found the WIPC was, in fact, what happened to Libya. This is just an example that justifies the correctness of our theories, the fact that the nation is facing danger, infringement, and aggression. [passage omitted] Western interventions and attempts to impose negotiations and various deals are meant to secure and entrench a platform for the realization of the plan against the Islamic nation. The effort made by America, for instance, in what is called a peace process, ensuring the success of negotiations, removing obstacles between Palestinians and Israelis and the Arabs and Israelis do not represent American eagerness to bring about peace. America is not keen to save the lives of the Arabs and Muslims. America is keen to ensure the success of its imperialist scheme, and it is paving the way for this scheme by its interventions. We know that this is the reality. If the rulers of the Islamic-Arab nation are trying to fool the masses and tell them the lie that this is a peace process, we are not taken in by this lie. America is not eager for peace in the Middle East. Since when has America been keen about peace? America is the real enemy of peace. Since when has America been eager about the right or liberties of peoples? America is the real enemy of peoples, the real enemy of freedom. [passage omitted] Against whom is America continuing to arm itself? Against Hungary, against Lithuania? Against which small state still existing? Never. America made a statement through its ambassador in Italy. He said: The confrontation is now finished with communism, and the front line was Berlin. Now starts confrontation with the Islamic world, so that the latter will have the same fate as the communist world. The front line is now Rome. We return to this official statement made by the American ambassador in Rome. This is a grave warning that will turn into a military, economic, and political action. America is the one that enabled the Jews to occupy Jerusalem and turn it into an eternal capital for the Jewish state. America will enable them--and these words are for history-- to occupy Mecca and Medina. It will enable them to reach the oil wells in the Gulf. America cannot leave the income from Mecca and Medina, the annual material income from the pilgrims, a large tourism income, thousands of billions every year, it cannot leave it for the Arabs, and the oil fields cannot be left for the Arabs or Muslims. [passage omitted] We want to embarrass them, to embarrass this false diplomacy in the Islamic world, this submission, this shameful prostration. We say frankly: We are facing a Christian-Jewish alliance. We did not create it, they did. We just talk about it. They have now launched a religious war. No Arab or Islamic ruler in all the Islamic world would dare say that we are facing a religious war because they are hypocrites, showing the opposite of what they think. [passage omitted] Regrettably, with the exception of just a few, the Arab and Islamic states generally are paving the way for the victory of the Christians and Jews over Muslims. We spoke about the reason that made Islamic groups resort to violence. These groups say they are terrorists, and they do not see terrorism with the same eyes as others because this term appeared in the Koran: Against them make ready your strength to the utmost of your power, including steeds of war, to strike terror into the enemies of God and your enemies. We are applying, practicing terror. God said to have the strength to instill terror into all these enemies. What is the reason behind the Islamic groups practicing terrorism? We have found a justification in prostration, the shameful submission of the official regimes in the Arab and Islamic world before the enemies of the nation. [passage omitted] I personally do not support any Islamic movement seeking power. The question is controlling the streets, not securing power. When we control the streets and mobilize the streets, then the veto will be in the hands of the Islamic masses in the streets. When the American secretary of state comes to visit us, we make people in the streets move. Roads will be closed down, airports will be shut, and no one will offer him even a glass of water. He will then return home ashamed. If you are rulers, then you would welcome him and offer him all the signs of honor and hospitality. [passage omitted] Once, I stopped over in Paris when coming from Yugoslavia. [words indistinct] in Paris, and I was due to meet the French president. I arrived at the Elysee from the hotel where I was residing with difficulties because of the Jews. They tried to prevent me from reaching the French president. They closed all the streets and put up barricades. [passage omitted] They sprinkled metal spikes that puncture car tires in the street in front of my motorcade. Have you ever seen a Muslim doing this to an Israeli? An Arab doing it to an Israeli? This has happened to me. I, myself, am a witness. They tried to destroy my car. There was a violent clash with the police. They brought a large number of police to enable me to arrive at the Elysee with difficulty. [passage omitted] If we direct our attention to power, I am against the Islamic movements that contend with the rulers for power, because they would be compelled to become agents. As we said in this place years ago, however, we do not want power. We want the Islamic street. We want the Islamic street to rise. It would be wrong to rise in the violence that we have seen, because this is blind violence that, in fact, is out of place. It is illogical when Egyptian Muslim terrorists fight some Egyptians in the street and leave 'Um Rashrash under occupation. It would have been more appropriate for them to liberate 'Um Rashrash, which separated the Arab and Islamic worlds, broke the back of the nation, and severed the pilgrimage route. Who can cross from Egypt to Jordan or from Jordan to Egypt? They have 'Um Rashrash, which the Israelis call Eilat, in front of them. The Egyptian jihad should be directed toward liberating 'Um Rashrash and not for killing innocent people. What happened when they killed the speaker of the Egyptian People's Assembly? A new People's Assembly speaker was elected. When they killed the president of Egypt himself, another president was elected. [passage omitted] In fact, this is a blind orientation. We only benefit from it to express anger in the Islamic street against the surrender of the official Islamic regime before the crusaders and against abandoning the nation. This is the only benefit from it. This is a suicidal act that brings no results. It is a suicidal act that is similar to a person who protests against something and openly sets fire to himself in the street in front of the people, throws himself from a high place, throws himself in the sea, or shoots himself to publicize his protest against something. I have done this in protest against so-and-so issue, as Buddhists and Hindus do. We interpret this in the following way: It is a suicidal act that leads to no results, because the person who commits suicide would be the only person to commit suicide. This is a suicide attack, expressing dissatisfaction with what is going on. Islam would never succeed with the suicide attacks we witness in Egypt and Algeria. These would not lead to the success of Islam and will not awaken the Muslim nation. On the contrary, these suicide attacks will lead to sedition, civil war, and to the fall of Islam and national unity. Islam itself will be finished. Not all the people who would like to embrace Islam would like to embrace terrorism at the same time. The vast majority embrace Islam because it is Islam. If embracing Islam becomes linked to the bomb, the gun, and underground action, people will turn away from Islam. It is a serious matter. Islam is becoming associated with suicide. It is either: You join me within this suicide group, or you are not a Muslim and are an infidel and we will kill you. This is what propaganda is making of Islam. Islam is said to consist of terrorist acts, for instance, accepting suicide attacks, and killing those who do not belong to the suicide groups. All this will keep people away from Islam. The majority will say: We do not want Islam with a bomb and a gun. The battle is not one of bombs and guns; if only it was so. If the battle with the United States was a battle of guns, we would definitely defeat the United States. The United States is a terrorist power and not an occupation power. We would then defeat it when we became fearless of terrorism. The United States is only a terrorist power, and it could not win with other means. The United States was defeated in Vietnam by the rifle. Its planes were defeated and destroyed when it attacked Libya, a small country. It could not occupy Iraq. Its soldiers were worried to enter al-Ahwaz, al-Ahwar, and the marshes. [sentence as heard] The United States was defeated in Somalia's forests by Somali gun and stones. It fears revolutionary Korea. If only the battle was one of guns, the United States would definitely be defeated. The United States is a winner, not because of the bomb or the machine gun. No, it is because it feels it is psychologically strong. It feels strong on another plane: on an economic, social, and political plane. Therefore, we need a movement to motivate the nation politically, socially, and economically. We need to restore ethics and authenticity. We can close our streets without a gun, and not a single Israeli would be allowed to enter Arab land. Even the countries who recognize Israel could not have diplomatic ties with us, because if we are in control of our streets, the ambassador would not be able to walk in our streets. There would be no room for him. He would not come in the first place if he knew the streets were closed, even if the governments would recognize him. We want a full mobilization of the nation before thinking of guns. We will not call for the killing of the Israelis who have been touring and trampling down Arab soil these last days and weeks. We do not call for their killing. We call for their rejection and the closure of our streets to them so that governments are forced not to receive Jews again or assume the responsibility for their safety, food, and drink, which are no longer guaranteed. For your information, in Libya there is legislation issued by the Libyan people within the Basic People's Congresses on the implementation of the Islamic law. All the laws in Libya are compatible now with Islamic law. This is a step forward. Yes, we should put pressure throughout other Islamic and Arab countries to implement Islamic law. You all know about the air embargo against Libya and the attempts to freeze Libyan assets abroad and to force countries to reduce their diplomatic representation in Libya, but the majority of countries did not respond to these attempts because they had interests in Libya. A group of Libyan pilgrims have gone to Mecca by a Libyan plane in the past, maybe last year or the year before, to perform pilgrimage, but they were intercepted in the air and forbidden to land in accordance with the air embargo issued by the United States, Britain, and France. The pilgrims found that this decision, issued by these Christian countries, applied to Mecca and Medina. They were shocked and extremely outraged and swore by God to go to occupied Jerusalem--as Mecca has become like Jerusalem--in order to announce to the Muslim nation that Mecca has become subjected to the will of the United States, France, and Britain. They then returned and travelled by rented cars to Egypt from an airport near the artificial Egyptian-Libyan borders. From Egypt they hired the services of a travel agency in the occupied territories to take them to Jerusalem. The Israeli tourism minister and his entourage tried to consider this as an initiative from the Libyans to hold contacts with the Israelis, but they were shocked and disappointed when the Libyan pilgrims announced that they had come to announce that Jerusalem is occupied and should be liberated and that they had come to Muslim Jerusalem in response to our rejection from Mecca . The Israelis demanded a speedy departure of the Libyan pilgrims from the Aqsa Mosque because their presence constituted a threat. Their statements were inciting to the Muslims in the occupied territory and outside and had also exposed the difficult situation of holy Mecca. Consequently, all the parties that sought to cover themselves exerted pressure on the Libyan pilgrims in order to make them depart quickly. They actually asked them to leave. This year we were expecting the Arab countries responsible for Mecca and Medina and the countries that lie between Libya and Mecca to disregard the embargo on the route that leads to Mecca. We were expecting them to say: The Libyans are free if they can fly from their country. We open the skies before them and open Mecca before them and would not ask them to have permission from the Security Council before entering Mecca nor deny them permission to fly through our skies to Mecca without permission from the Security Council. The entire world knows what the Security Council is; the Security Council is America, Britain, and France. How can we ask permission for pilgrimage from Christians? This is blasphemy that is not allowed and is rejected. The Libyan pilgrims were obliged this year to travel to Mecca on the backs of camels. I beg you to inform all peoples of the Islamic nation of this and to disseminate the news through all of the Muslim information media so that the Islamic world will know the difficult situation in Mecca and the deteriorated conditions in which the Islamic and Arab peoples are living. [passage omitted] You have to think of freeing your will so that Mecca is subjected to Christian domination before thinking of pilgrimage. I believe and I am convinced that this pilgrimage will not be accepted by God ever. It is blind imitation and tourism, and it helps improve Saudi Arabia's income only. This is a pilgrimage I attack, and I consider it as a pre-Islamic ritual, [words indistinct] [passage omitted] I believe that the aim of the Libyan pilgrims, who have left on camel back and whose caravan set off yesterday or today, is to expose the shameful situation in which we and those in God's house and the tomb of God's messenger are in. We want to show for example that Sudan banned aircraft because it implements the resolutions of Christian states. Egypt, for instance, banned aircraft because it implements the resolutions of Christian states, and Saudi Arabia banned pilgrims because it implements the resolutions of Christian states. Even Libya, if it does not have the courage to launch its aircraft, is cowardly and implements the resolutions of the Christian states. The aim, then, is to show them the trouble imposed by America, Britain, and France on Muslims, on a Muslim people. Let the Islamic nation watch women, children, men, and old people who want to perform real pilgrimage and who cannot go by air and sea. Their private cars cannot get them to Mecca, and they cannot hire cars to go to Mecca. So they went by camels, which was the means available. [passage omitted] We challenge Egyptian Islamic extremist groups to only open up the land route to pilgrimage via 'Um Rashrash. Those groups are, of course, fighting the Egyptian Government, so if they were to carry out this act, it would definitely not be blamed on the Egyptian Government because the latter itself is at war with those groups. So, if these groups go and fight to liberate 'Um Rashrash, which is Eilat, do you think it would affect the peace process between Egypt and Israel, or will it be blamed on the Egyptian Government? Never, ever, because as I said, the Egyptian Government itself is in a state of war with these groups. Yes, we challenge the Afghan mojahedin, the Algerian Islamic Salvation Front militants, the Islamic movement in Sudan. We challenge them all to go and open up the land route to the pilgrimage so that the nation can be territorially united again. The nation's back is broken. The Israelis have stretched their power from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean Sea, so no crossing is allowed. Of course, this meeting is an emergency meeting. It coincides with the pilgrimage season, because pilgrimage is in a critical situation. I wish our brother and friend Fahd was not a political leader of a political state. Saudi Arabia should become like the Vatican, especially after he declared himself the custodian of the two holy mosques and not a king. He is officially called Fahd Bin-'Abd-al- 'Aziz, custodian of the two holy mosques. When he gets this religious status, he will then become absolved from the UN Security Council and U.S. domination and so on. If Saudi Arabia wants to serve God's house, it should change into a state like the Vatican. It should withdraw from the political arena and remain a respected religious state. We then would respect our Saudi brothers and hold great esteem for them as the sponsors, servants, and guardians of God's house--provided they cancelled the army, the police, their political identity, and their diplomatic passports and remained a state concerned only with the holy places and living off pilgrimage income. This is the right status, which should, as of now, be raised to the Muslim nation and in the Muslim world. We are saying so because we were very affected by the nonexistence of such a status. We might have news today, tomorrow, or after tomorrow on some of our women or men pilgrims dying on their way to Mecca on camels. We do not know how many of those pilgrims, who went in their hundreds, will come back. Thus, we have been and will continue to be affected as long as the pilgrimage is in such a condition. This is not an attack on Saudi Arabia at all. It is to help our brothers in Saudi Arabia because they are incapable of resisting America. The Islamic nation should stand by the Saudis to enable them to resist America. Once, after Iraq entered Kuwait, I telephoned King Fahd and asked him if it was true that America was entering Saudi Arabia. I said that we could--on the Arab and Islamic level--interfere and get Iraq's army out and regain Kuwait. Fahd told me that America was a superpower, and who would stop it if it entered Saudi Arabia. If the situation is like that, therefore, America's resolutions will be applicable even in Mecca, because America is a superpower. Therefore, the Islamic world should embrace, support, and strengthen Saudi Arabia so it can say no to America. These are reasonable statements. Our brothers in Saudi Arabia might not be able to oppose America, because America is a superpower. Not every one of us can oppose America. However, we, at least, say no, even if we die. If our brothers in Saudi Arabia are unable to stand up against America's resolution, which is currently applicable in Mecca, barring Libyan or even Iraqi pilgrims from the town, in this case, we should stand by our brothers in Saudi Arabia to strengthen their position in order to say no to America and to give the Americans a sore eye. Brothers, Mecca should never be part of a political state because this political state might go to war with another country. How would this other country's president travel to Mecca to perform pilgrimage? Iraq was in a state of war with Saudi Arabia. Could the Iraqi president travel to Mecca to perform pilgrimage? They would have arrested him because his country was in a state of war. He would be respected and would not be arrested if Mecca did not have a political status. [passage omitted] We know that American troops are present in Saudi Arabia, and the reason is a fear of Iraqi invasion of Saudi Arabia following its occupation of Kuwait. Undoubtedly, Mecca is under American protection. This talk should not be misinterpreted, saying that al-Qadhdhafi has attacked Al Sa'ud and Saudi Arabia. Not at all; we are not attacking Saudi Arabia. I do not believe in media attacks or similar nonsense because it does not lead to anything. On the contrary, I do sympathize with the Saudis and see them in a situation not to be envied. We urge the Islamic nation to stand by them in order to give the Americans a sore eye, and we urge Saudi Arabia, if it wants to be responsible for Mecca, to become a religious state only. [passage omitted] If Saudi Arabia wants to remain a political state, it has to relinquish Mecca and Medina to the Islamic Conference Organization to run them. Actually, this is what we have been demanding constantly. Due to Mecca's bad and difficult condition, this emergency meeting of the general secretariat of the WIPC has been held. Now, we can try and make Libyan pilgrims request Sudan's permission to let a Libyan airplane cross Sudan's airspace and head for Mecca. Let us see what Sudan would say. If it said to get permission from the Security Council, then Sudan and the way to Mecca would be controlled by Christian countries. Or if Egypt did. If Sudan gave permission and said that this plane could go to Mecca and said: I am not interested in how the plane gets out of Libya. That is Libya's responsibility. If you want to cross our airspace, then do so, as long as you are going to Hajj. After arriving in Saudi Arabia, let us see what Saudi Arabia would say. Would they say: Get permission from the Security Council in order to enter Mecca? Do we enter Mecca with America's permission? Never! [passage omitted] Even international communism and all communists throughout the world thought that communism was invincible and that planet Earth would be red. We said: No, there is something wrong with this theory. We said that these peoples would not continue to be subjected to the communist parties--though we have a common denominator, which is the struggle against imperialism. Communism was a deterrent to America. America has no morals. It fears. It was afraid of Brezhnev and Khrushchev. When America's masters went way, it appeared naked and without morals before the world--roaring, sending its troops everywhere, interfering in everything, deciding whatever it wished, stumbling over human rights and sovereignty-- because it used to be afraid. America has no morals. The present U.S. President Clinton--though he is a man of peace, young, etc. and has no bad past record and was against the Vietnam war--he himself is a victim of American imperialism and the CIA. He is afraid for himself. Morals make a head of state. American intelligence has no morals and is an arch enemy of all the world and wants to give itself a licence to violate the whole world. [passage omitted] Clinton is afraid of the CIA. He is a victim of the CIA. He is afraid because U.S. establishments have no morals. They are hellish, as are the big multinational syndicates. The CIA and the White House are all bugged. Clinton is living in hell. The head of state has no morals. America has no morals. The West has no morals and hates the Islamic world. The West said: We do not recognize Mohammad. We Muslims recognize Jesus. Westerners consider Mohammad a liar and a crook. [passage omitted] America has abandoned, when its interests were at stake, its best agents. Not its friends, because America has no friends. It has either an enemy or an agent. America has no friend at all. You will either be its agent or its enemy. America abandoned its best agents when its interests were at stake. The West has decided on the nonexistence of an Islamic state in Europe, and they are going to eliminate Bosnia-Herzegovina, and then Albania. Any Islamic pocket will be eliminated in your time, and you will still be alive, God willing. You will be alive, God willing, and you will regrettably see the achievement of this bad thing. We, in return, will not accept a Jewish state in the Islamic world. They eliminate pockets, and we eliminate pockets. Let it be so. What is taking place in Bosnia-Herzegovina--and what will happen to Albania, Macedonia, Kosovo, Bulgaria, and others--will take place in Palestine. We eliminate pockets, and they eliminate pockets. We will accept this. They decided that. They decided to eliminate Islamic pockets in Europe. All Christian states from Moscow to Washington decided not to allow Muslims to have a foot of land in Europe. Europe is Christian. From Moscow to Washington it is all Christian. As for you, the Arabs and Muslims, however, they want you to accept a racist Jewish state that is armed with nuclear weapons--with support from the crusading West--inside your land, and they want you to bow before it. Regrettably, even Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] said yesterday, when he spoke during the farce that took place in Cairo: We wished to be gracious to those who were being depressed in the land. You make them leaders and make them heirs. This [Koranic] verse was said about Jews. He is stressing that we have surrendered to Jews, and they have become leaders and heirs. This is the meaning. It means: I have come to you to share and to surrender, and this is a whole Arab column present with me. This is an emphasis of this verse: God was gracious to Jews and made them our leaders and heirs of Palestine and other places, and all we got was the cursed city that is called Jericho and the miserable Gaza. The fact that Abu-'Ammar opened his speech with this verse means that the latter was achieved. Jews have become leaders, and God made them heirs. What link do the Arab states that attended this ceremony in Cairo have with the ceremony and Palestine? I challenge them. The states that did not fight and that have no borders with Palestine, why do they put their nose in this dust and sand. Who has blamed them? They are weak states and should stay within their borders. They are not asked to liberate the occupied territories or participate in a liberation. Why then do they participate in this scandal? This is also a recognition of Israel. All those who attended the ceremony in Cairo have recognized Israel. Who are they kidding? This is an official recognition of Israel. Any state that attended the ceremony shook hands with Peres. What is the name of the prime minister of the enemy? Yitzhaq Rabin. They all shook hands with him, and it is an announcement of the recognition of the Jewish state by the Arab states. [passage omitted] Some people have not attended these meetings. Ghannouchi, for instance, is a member of the WIPC, which is not the Libyan leadership. He is not present now, however, and has not been able to attend. He was not even invited. The reason for this is that he fell into a dispute with the Tunisian Government. Consequently, Tunisia tells us: Brothers, it is not acceptable for somebody who is wanted over a political matter and is wanted for trial in Tunisia to come and visit Libya because, in return, it is not acceptable that somebody who is wanted in Libya is treated with deference or (?visits) Tunisia. This is logical. Consequently, he was not invited. We wished that there would not be a difference between Ghannouchi and the Tunisian Government and that he would not let himself get into a dispute to the point where he is banned from staying in Tunisia or Libya. We wish that the action would remain peaceful, democratic, and political, and hope to make people aware, which is a permitted action. Now there is an accusation that there is a coup action, however, violence that is outside legality, constitutionality, and laws. What is striking in this context is that Britain gave Ghannouchi political asylum. I have watched the development of ties between Tunisia and Britain since the latter gave Ghannouchi political asylum. Ties have improved, and recently there were delegations, aid, loans, and a development in ties between Tunisia and Britain. That is wonderful. Let us assume, however, that Libya gave Ghannouchi political asylum. What would the Tunisian Government's position be toward Libya. It would be different. It could sever ties. We did not allow him to come in peace to a session of the WIPC out of consideration for the position of our brothers in Tunisia who want to put him on trial. Why did Tunisia not cut ties with Britain? That is the problem, the problem of Arabs, of Muslims. They overlook the wrongdoing of the enemy, their interference, and humiliations. When Algeria was under Ali Kafi's rule, I said this from this position--or maybe somewhere else--that I could bring reconciliation between the Islamic Salvation Front and the Algerian Government because they were my friends. I prayed with them, knew them, and had debates with them. They could accept some talk from me on opening dialogue with the Algerian Government and setting aside the fighting. The Algerian Government under Ali Kafi issued a statement against al-Qadhdhafi. It spoke about interference and so on, whereas delegations from European countries were going to Algeria to check up on prisoners and human rights. There were no objections about them because they were coming from colonialist Christian countries. See what a system we have! How could Britain give political asylum to Ghannouchi. Ghannouchi was more entitled to being given asylum by Arab states and not Britain. Britain, in that case, took a position in opposition to the Tunisian regime. Tunisia should have severed ties with Britain and not have had ties improve. If Ghannouchi's presence in the country where he is now is not considered wrong, then the WIPC has not done its duty. It did not issue an invitation to Ghannouchi--if only to attend one day of this session of which he is a member. Britain gave him permanent residence and political asylum, and its ties with Tunisia have improved! What we are saying is in Tunisia's defense. We are saying this for Tunisia against Britain because it is clear that our brothers in Tunisia cannot tell Britain these things. We can say it on their behalf and in defense of Saudi Arabia because it cannot say these things to the Islamic world or to America. I can say them on its behalf because of my position, as head of the WIPC. If I were president of the Libyan state, I would not say them. The BBC is known to be part of the British Government. The Arabic service there is part of British intelligence. It is known that it was established during World War II to counter Berlin. [passage omitted] This radio, for example, had an interview with a Saudi named Binladin, who fled Saudi Arabia. He said his son had been detained in Saudi Arabia to pressure him to return to the kingdom. He gave an interview to this radio to attack our brothers in Saudi Arabia. Ties between Saudi Arabia and Britain were not cut. Let us assume that Binladin went to a Libyan broadcast and gave the interview. Ties between Libya and Saudi Arabia would inevitably be cut the following day. Look at our situation. Those who come from the West are as though they have come from God. We accept them. Our brothers, however, are lying in wait. During Ali Kafi's reign, no objections were raised at interference by France and the West in Algeria's internal affairs or at the sending of inspection committees. They objected to one word I said here in Algeria's interest. Binladin made statements to the BBC and nothing happened to ties. [passage omitted] We must work to ensure the presence of the WIPC at international events at the United Nations. We must make our voice heard to the whole world, and we must work for, call for, the convening of an urgent Islamic summit to tackle the Mecca situation and the road to Mecca. It does not matter that the Libyan people are being besieged, starved, even fought, and if it dies on its feet, or [this is happening to] the Iraqi people or any other people, the issue in question is that of Mecca. We are not asking our Arab brothers, whether in Egypt, Sudan, Saudi Arabia, or Jordan, to stand on our side against America so that the Libyan assets may be unfrozen, or the air embargo, the boycott, and the siege lifted. No, not at all. We are not asking them for this. We want to argue with them about the road to Mecca and the pilgrimage to Mecca, Mecca itself. The Libyan people has the right to address itself to the Islamic nation and show that it has set off on foot and by camel from Libya to Mecca. Mecca and the road to Mecca are in an intolerable situation. They allow camels in but they do not allow [Libyan] airliners because the resolution [on the embargo] made by America, Britain, and France does not mention camels and donkeys, and therefore, Libyan pilgrimages have set off by camel and donkey because the latter are not mentioned in the resolution. If they were mentioned in the resolution then the Arabs would have opposed the passage of donkeys and camels from Libya to Mecca. I am sure of this. There is on the part of Arab rulers a blind obedience to America and Britain and disobedience to God. I wish only part of the rulers' obedience to America was obedience to Almighty God! They are literally bound by America's orders, and they are not bound by a single word from the Koran. To conclude, if we want to undertake an historic deed for the Islamic nation in confronting the enemy, we should not begin with the rifle, the gun, and the bomb as they are now doing in Egypt and Algeria. This is wrong. No. We must first engage in a cultural revolution. we must return to our authenticity, our origin, our roots. So long as they do not recognize Muhammad as a prophet, then why should we use the calendar based on the history of Jesus? There is no need for Jesus. This has been abolished, dropped definitively in Libya [where a calendar based on the birth and death of the prophet is in use]. If you want a calendar based on birth, then it is Muhammad's birthday; if you want a calendar based on death, then it is the passing of Muhammad. Muhammad is more important than Jesus because he is the last prophet who, after his birth and death the direct link between heaven and earth was severed. We have not heard a single word from heaven since. [passage omitted] May God never bring about understanding between us, the Christians and the Jews until doomsday! Why should we come to an understanding? Who said that we must? Who said this? Barricades separate us from them until doomsday. This is eternal enmity. God has decided so. It is they who do not recognize our prophet, our religion, language, and existence, and it is they who said that confrontation has ended with communism and that it will begin with Islam. They have started this. Why this eagerness to have relations with them in the West, as if they were a ladder to God? If lack of relations with the West means no survival for us, then may God take away our lives; may we die in 24 hours if our life under the sun and on earth depends on relations with the West. May we die immediately, rather than have relations with the West in this shameful manner. [applause] [passage omitted] God willing, we have set off, step by step on the 1,000 mile journey toward the objective; unspecified, and the first giant step is the founding of this WIPC. Our struggle and jihad continue, and we pray for God's help. Peace and mercy of God be upon you. [applause]
