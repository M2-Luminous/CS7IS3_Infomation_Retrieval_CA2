FBIS4-9840 "drlat064_g_94016" FBIS-LAT-94-064 Daily Report 3 Apr 1994 Guatemala GAM Says Emergency Decree Will Worsen Situation GAM Says Emergency Decree Will Worsen Situation PA0404023094 Guatemala City Cadena de Emisoras Unidas in Spanish 2224 GMT 3 Apr 94 PA0404023094 Guatemala City Cadena de Emisoras Unidas Spanish BFN [Report by Julita Corrado] Text] The Mutual Support Group [GAM] has issued a communique denouncing and lamenting the assassination of Epaminondas Gonzalez, saying this crime highlights the perilous conditions under which the population is living, as well as the government's unwillingness and inability to find solutions. Although it is likely a state of emergency will be declared, GAM believes this will only worsen the situation. The assassination of the Constitutionality Court president is a harsh blow against the institutional and constitutional order that prevails in Guatemala because the Constitutionality Court is the guarantor of rights in Guatemala. The GAM pointed out that it believes militant sectors may have ordered and carried out Gonzalez's assassination, thereby employing violence and impunity in response to the recent signing of the human rights agreement to prevent the creation of the Truth Commission and to hinder the subsequent signing of a fair and democratic peace agreement. The GAM communique concludes by asking the president and security authorities to readily and resolutely investigate this unofficial execution. Such an investigation will lead us to the whereabouts and identities of the perpetrators and masterminds of this crime. These people must be prosecuted to establish a precedent of stopping impunity in the country and to prevent the Epaminondas Gonzalez case from joining the already long list of unsolved crimes.
