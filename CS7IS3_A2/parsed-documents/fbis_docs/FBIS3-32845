Edgar Batres, National Federation of State Workers Unions leader, told ACAN-EFE following a demonstration attended by approximately 1,000 employees, that beginning today partial strikes will take place at 50 percent of government offices and that by Friday the strike will be total. Meanwhile, Labor and Social Security Minister Anabella Morfin reiterated today that the government has not dismissed the possibility of filing a lawsuit against the employees who leave their jobs because the government will not tolerate the employees adopting illegal measures if they do not first exhaust the possibilities of dialogue. "If they are to be paid they must work," said Morfin, who has asked the labor leaders to reconsider. Hour-long strikes have been held every day to demand a 40 percent salary increase and they have continued despite De Leon's threats of punishment. According to Batres, 180,000 state employees will not show up for work on Friday. "We are not going to stop," said Bernardino Arriaza, a Postal Workers Union leader, who explained that the increase they are requesting is an adjustment to the inflation accumulated between 1992 and 1994. During the demonstration, labor leaders criticized President de Leon for his economic policy, which they described as neoliberal, and they demanded his resignation.
