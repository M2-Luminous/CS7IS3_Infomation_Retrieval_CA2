Cindoruk received Zarko Domljan, chairman of the Croatian Parliament Foreign Affairs Committee, and his delegation today. Cindoruk stressed at the meeting that the Serbs will not escape their destiny as the unjust party in history and in the eyes of the world. A massacre of this nature in the middle of Europe during a civilized age in history is unacceptable, he said, adding that murdering defenseless people is also a bad example for other parts of the world. The TGNA speaker asked: On the eve of the 21st century, is Europe returning to its feudal structure of the Middle Ages? Cindoruk stressed that the United Nations and NATO failed to display the required determination in the face of Serbian aggression. Unless the attacks are stopped, he said, the effectiveness of these organizations will be in doubt. The TGNA speaker also said that the Serbian attacks violate the Paris Charter and the Human Rights Declaration and strip them of their importance. He added that the agreement between the Croats and the Bosnians constitutes an important step toward the solution of the problem by peaceful means. In turn, Domljan said that the Croats have always maintained that Bosnia-Herzegovina should have its independence and territorial integrity. We are opposed to the forcible change of borders or to the occupation of territory, he said. Before meeting with Cindoruk, the Croatian parliamentary delegation visited Erdal Inonu, chairman of the TGNA Foreign Relations Committee, and Baki Tug, chairman of the TGNA National Defense Committee.
