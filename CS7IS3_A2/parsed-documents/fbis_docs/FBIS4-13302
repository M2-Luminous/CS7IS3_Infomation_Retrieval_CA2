We return to routine today, but we can all look back with pride and to the future with great hope. They were 46 hard years of struggle for a life and the building an economy and society, which led to the State of Israel's great achievements. Despite flaws, Israel is today one of the most exciting, beautiful states, a good place to live. I would like to take the opportunity of the opening of the summer session of the Knesset to congratulate the citizens on Independence Day. Members of the Knesset, this Independence Day was celebrated in the shadow of terrorist attacks, including one which took place only a short time before the Remembrance Day siren for those who fell while fighting in the country's wars. Five citizens and soldiers were killed in the explosion caused by a bomb at Hadera's central bus station. The bomb was placed by a contemptible murderer, a member of Hamas, who apparently chose to die with his innocent victims. This assembly and the entire country join to mourn with the families of the fallen. We wish to console them in their grief. This assembly and the government also wish the wounded a speedy recovery. Mr. Speaker, honorable Knesset, last September we embarked on a new path in an attempt to turn a page in the bloody history between Jews, later Israelis, and Palestinians. We decided not to settle former accounts; to forget the bloody past and the hatred; to try to create a new, better future for both peoples whose historic fate has ruled that they live on the same land. We came with a desire to make peace, and I must tell the members of the Knesset that we also found a readiness for peace by the other side, the Palestinians, who have also suffered for generations. Neither we nor the Palestinians will receive all that we want, since that is the nature of negotiations, that is the nature of compromise, that is the nature of peace. The negotiations with the Palestinians on Gaza-Jericho First continue, and in my view, we are at an advanced stage. I hope that it will be possible to conclude these negotiations within a short while. We believe that a short time after the signing of the agreement, the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] and the security forces will be able to complete their redeployment. In other words, in the wake of the Gaza-Jericho First negotiations, the attempt to create coexistence and peace with the Palestinians will be tested. I tell you that I wait for the moment that as the defense minister I will feel freer not to send IDF soldiers to patrol Greater Gaza, towns with a population of 250,000 Palestinians, the refugee camps, Khan Yunus, Rafah, Dayr al-Balah. I would like to clarify in the wake of published reports, whether true or not, that any agreement or understanding between the PLO and Hamas on continued Hamas terror with the PLO's approval will preclude any possibility of agreement between Israel and the PLO. Members of the Knesset, this government promised to make every effort for peace, and plans to continue the talks with Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon. Toward the end of April or early May the bilateral talks in Washington will resume, and Secretary of State Warren Christopher will probably arrive in the region to prepare the talks and allow us to progress toward signing peace treaties between Israel and its neighbors. In the peace talks with the Syrians, we have so far not found the appropriate level of openness and flexibility that would permit a breakthrough and facilitate a real discussion on a peace treaty. Our friends the Americans, who so much want to see peace in our region, have so far also failed in their efforts. At the same time, the government's position is known: We are making a great effort that the precedent Israel paid for peace with Egypt -- a total withdrawal and the uprooting of all signs of an Israeli presence -- will not repeat itself as a condition for peace with Syria. Simultaneously, we are preparing seriously for the negotiations and preparing for various alternatives regarding the nature of peace. These preparations include: the depth of withdrawal on the Golan Heights; security arrangements, and the phases in which peace is implemented. By doing so there will be time to evaluate the normalization process before we complete our withdrawal on the Golan Heights, and consider what will we demand from our friend the United States in the wake of the peace. If and when we reach a reasonable agreement with the Syrians, and the agreement will require a significant withdrawal, we will hold a national referendum, and the people will decide. The negotiations with Lebanon entail negotiations with the Syrians since we know that Beirut will not make a move without permission from Damascus. Nevertheless, we reiterate our proposal to the Beirut authorities. We proposed, that at the first stage, the Lebanese Army will deploy up to the northern border of the security zone, and for the next six months it must prove its ability to maintain total quiet, and total disarming of Hizballah in south Lebanon. If that is proven and if total quiet reigns along the northern border of the security zone, we will open peace negotiations with Lebanon, which I hope will last three months. We will be prepared to withdraw up to the international border between Israel and Lebanon on three conditions: full peace and normalization; adequate security arrangements; and of course, our commitment to the SLA [South Lebanese Army] and the inhabitants of south Lebanon. In other words, the incorporation of the SLA into the Lebanese Army and a guarantee that the inhabitants of south Lebanon will not be harmed. A solution is possible in the negotiations with Jordan, but to my great regret, I get the impression that it will not happen prior to an agreement with Syria, the big brother, who is keeping a watchful eye. Members of the Knesset, I want to tell the truth: For 27 years we have been dominating another people against its will. For 27 years, Palestinians in the territories, who currently number 1.7 million, get up in the morning cultivating fierce hatred against us, as Israelis and Jews. Each morning they get up to a hard life, for which we are also, but not solely, responsible. We cannot deny, the ongoing control over a foreign people who do not want us, exacts a painful price, the price of an ongoing confrontation between us and them. For six and a half years we have been witnessing the Palestinian's popular uprising, the intifadah, against our rule. They try to harm us through violence and terror, to cause us fatalities, to break our spirit. I would like to present you with some data presented to me by the IDF. Since the start of the uprising, 217 Israelis have been murdered, of whom 68 belonged to the security forces and 151 were civilians. That is a painful price. I recall the brigade I had the honor of commanding in the battle for besieged Jerusalem and the road to Jerusalem during the War of Independence. Within six months, this brigade, which was one of the 10 brigades which became the IDF, lost the same number of people. One of our distinguished IDF commanders, Knesset Member Refa'el Eytan, I am certain, remembers that. Those were the losses from one brigade, one of 10 brigades in a population of slightly more than 600,000. Nobody's spirit was broken then, nobody rejoiced over the bloodshed. The number of our wounded is 7,872, of whom 5,062 belong to the security forces, and 2,810 are civilians. Among the Palestinians, 1,045 were killed by our forces -- the IDF and the security forces -- 69 by Israeli civilians, 922 by other Palestinians, 99 for unknown reasons, 21 while handling explosives. In total, there have been 2,156 Palestinians killed. Wounded Palestinians, according to IDF data, number 18,967, while I estimate that at least 25,000 were wounded. There have been between 120,000 and 140,000 detentions and jail sentences. Those are the statistics of the confrontation during the past six and a half years. What were the alternatives facing us after 27 years of domination -- I do not want to use a different term -- over an entity different from us religiously, politically, and nationally. The first alternative was to continue the existing situation, to make proposals for which there were no other partners, and without a partner there is no arrangement. To try to perpetrate the domination of another people; to continue the path of violence and terrorism ad infinitum; and to freeze the political process, to bring about a political stalemate. All the governments of Israel, definitely all those since the Yom Kippur War, fully understood the dangers inherent in a political stalemate. That is why all the governments searched for the second alternative, which is to try to find a political solution, at first through separation of forces agreements. That was also the approach of the government of the late Menahem Begin in the peace treaty with Egypt. That was the path taken by Yitzhaq Shamir's government in agreeing to the Madrid peace conference. We have also taken that path since the Oslo deliberations and the signing ceremony in Washington. Peace now appears to be closer than ever before. There is a big opportunity to end the wars, the 100 years of terrorism and bloodshed, the 100 years of enmity. When we began the journey for peace we knew it would be impossible to wipe out 100 years of hatred with one signature. We knew it would be impossible to change concepts and what is learned from birth, we knew that the peace would have enemies, we knew there would be people and organizations whose entire reason for existence is enmity between the peoples and that they will continue to fan it as much as they can. On the Palestinian side, the opposition to peace is led by Hamas and the Islamic Jihad, the Rejectionist Front organizations. The emissaries of those organizations carried out most of the recent murders and terrorist attacks, some on suicide missions. For two or three years we have been facing a phenomenon of extremist Islamic terrorism, which recalls the Hizballah, which surfaced in Lebanon and perpetrated attacks, including suicide missions. We have been seeing it for the first time in the past two or three years among the Palestinian terrorist organizations. There is no end to the targets Hamas and the other terrorist organizations have among us. Each Israeli in the territories and inside sovereign Israel, including united Jerusalem, each bus, each home, is a target for their murderous plans. Since there is no separation between the two populations, the current situation creates endless possibilities for Hamas and the other organizations. In Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip, 40,000 vehicles, tens of thousands of civilians and soldiers travel daily, according to our estimates. IDF soldiers have the task of daily safeguarding hundreds of Israeli vehicles, mainly buses, along 1,200 km of roads. Hundreds of thousands of Jews and Arabs, and thousands of vehicles mix daily, one population lives among the other. There are also many possibilities to cross from Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip -- less from the Gaza Strip, more from Judaea and Samaria -- into Israel. Many hidden and known paths lead from the territories into Israel. It is impossible to hermetically close the territories to infiltration by individuals. We are making all efforts to bring security to the citizens of Israel, both Jews and Arabs, within Israel and in the territories of Judaea and Samaria, everywhere. I am divulging to the Knesset today that a large part of the IDF's standing army is currently on security and defense missions for Israelis everywhere. There is no restriction on the activities of the IDF except that they should act within the law. In this situation, the organizations which continue terrorism have limitless targets, and perpetrate murderous missions, with openly declared aims -- first to murder Israelis, and politically to do away with the peace talks, not to permit them to continue. At first, the murderers of Hamas and the other organizations operated mainly against Israeli citizens and the security forces in Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip. The political aims of those murderers were for Israeli settlers in Judaea, Samaria and the Gaza Strip harmed by terrorism to demonstrate and act against the Israeli Government thereby suspending the peace efforts. They apparently concluded their efforts were insufficient. We continued with the peace negotiations, so Hamas and the other organizations which oppose peace have now put most of their efforts into attacks against the Israeli population inside sovereign Israel, including united Jerusalem. Since 1 January, 1994, 23 Israelis -- both Jews and Arabs -- have been murdered. Twenty were killed inside sovereign Israel, including united Jerusalem, and three were killed in the territories of Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip. Members of the Knesset, it is no secret how sensitive we are to fatalities, and the murderers of the terrorist organizations and the Rejectionist Front are trying to break us through attacks with knives, explosives, firing during ambushes, and car bombs. They do not have a chance. We experienced knifings during the 1930's bloodshed, we experienced car bombs in the War of Independence, we experienced bloody attacks on buses in Ma'ale 'Aqrabbim, Avivim, and the coastal road, where the most murderous terrorist attack in the history of terrorism, took place in 1978 when 35 Israelis were killed. Did any of us call the Begin government a blood-tainted government for that? No way. We experienced the Ma'alot massacre, the Lod airport massacre, the attack on Tel Aviv's Savoy hotel, Kefar Yuval, Qiryat Shemona, Misgav 'Am, Naharriya. The people of Israel are not frightened off, they do not crack. It hurts, but we get back on our feet and go on. Even additional terrorist attacks will not stop the peace train. [Responding to catcalls from the right-wing opposition] Look who sows fear among the people, does not give them strength, does not explain the truth: how we faced much tougher situations. I regret to say that level of personal danger to each of us has increased in the wake of the despicable massacre perpetrated by the Jewish murderer from Hebron. Although the Arab terrorist organizations had a thousand reasons and excuses for harming us, that man came and added to them. Members of the Knesset, we found one of the foci of Hamas activity is in Jordan and not Egypt or Tunisia, and even not Syria or Lebanon. We are convinced that the Jordanian security authorities are aware of that and nevertheless permitted information and operational activity from Amman. We therefore found it necessary to warn the Jordanian authorities against continued Hamas activity from its territory. Israel expects the king and his officials to act against the Hamas murderers, who will also ultimately attempt to undermine and topple his regime and control. We also took a series of measures, including the tightening of the closure. We are aware of the hardship incurred by the inhabitants of the territories as a result of the closure, as well as to Israel's agriculture and building, but we have no choice. If we want to save lives we have to take tough measures and if the situation calls for it, we will even take even tougher measures. The IDF, Shin Bet, Israel Police, and the Border Police are conducting a war to the bitter end against all those who continue violence and terrorism. There are no restrictions on the activity of the security forces against terrorism and violence, except of course, that they operate within the framework of the law. Members of the Knesset, the Hizballah terrorist organization is also partner to the effort to strangle the chance for peace. The Lebanese war did not rid us of terrorism in Lebanon. Hizballah leads the attacks against the IDF and SLA in the security zone, and from time to time, even against targets in Israel. IDF and SLA soldiers assure normal life for the settlements and residents of the North. Members of the Knesset, I wish to send from this podium a greeting from the bottom of my heart to the IDF commanders and soldiers, the commanders and officers of the Israel Police and the Border Police, and a special greeting to the Shin Bet, which takes a large brunt of the tough war against the murderous enemies of Israel and peace. Members of the Knesset, that is the current picture. The path to peace is paved with our good intentions and the terrorist attacks of the enemies of peace. There might be difficult conditions and we might not succeed in totally preventing terrorist attacks, but peace will win.
