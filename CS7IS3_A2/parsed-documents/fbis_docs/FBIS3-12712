At the same time the northern al-'Amaliqah Brigade in the southern governorate of Abyan yesterday also continued to deploy heavily in the town of Zinjibar after storming and seizing the security command headquarters in the governorate. That northern military move came less than one hour after President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, who is also the secretary general of the General People's Congress [GPC], and his Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, who is the secretary general of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], signed an authorization giving the Joint Military Committee full powers to put an end to the military clashes between northern and southern forces. Political sources have stressed that the crisis of trust which has now spread from the political to the military sector might hamper the implementation of any agreement. According to military sources in Aden, the people of al-Dali yesterday came out to confront the forces of the (northern) 2d Armored Brigade to prevent them from moving their armor and to force them to return to the positions they held before. Military reports also said yesterday that the al-'Amaliqah Brigade was still refusing to obey any orders to return to its barracks on the outskirts of the southern town of Zinjibar. The sources said that the 5th Light Infantry Brigade loyal to former President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad was totally destroyed and that the real number of victims of the heavy bombardment of that brigade by the 1st Armored Division commanded by Colonel 'Ali Muhsin al-Ahmar was still unknown. The sources added: "The crime was not just what happened to the soldiers loyal to former President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad near Sanaa, but also the fact that those who did it are denying that there was such a barracks in that area. That is what they said to the military team which visited Harf Sufyan north of 'Umran."
