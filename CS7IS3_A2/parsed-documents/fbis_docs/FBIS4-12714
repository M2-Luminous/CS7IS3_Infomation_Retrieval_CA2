Iraqi sources have said that 'Udayy attacked the transport minister for agreeing to sign a contract with an Iraqi merchant whom he described in the BABIL newspaper as "an opposition figure living abroad." He also attacked Transport Ministry Undersecretary Jamil Ibrahim, who was following up the contract's implementation in Amman last week. The sources pointed out that 'Udayy had been hoping to win a contract to carry out the company's operations and use the land fleet he owns in carrying out all transport operations between Iraq and al-'Aqabah and vice versa. Ahmad Murtada was appointed transport minister in the latest cabinet reshuffle some nine months ago. He belongs to the group loyal to Lieutenant General Husayn Kamil al-Majid, the Iraqi president's son-in-law. He also held in the past the post of director general of the Military Industrialization Organization. As for Transport Ministry Undersecretary Jamil Ibrahim, he comes from the town of Tikrit. But he belongs to the Mukhlis family, a number of whose members were executed last year on charges of hatching a plot to topple the regime.
