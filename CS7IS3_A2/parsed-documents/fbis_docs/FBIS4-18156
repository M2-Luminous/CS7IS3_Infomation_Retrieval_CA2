This was stated by Social Democratic Party (SDP) Chairman Paavo Lipponen in Uusikaupunki and Pietasaari on Saturday [12 March]. He was evasive as to whether the SDP should participate in drafting new legislation and the appropriation bills that might be needed. [passage omitted] Lipponen repeated his proposal that the computations for farm subsidies should be determined in the same way as in the national wage talks, namely, by a group representing all interests, including the taxpayers and consumers. According to Lipponen, the EU agreement's agricultural policies correspond in central points to goals of the SDP. The SDP saw that an immediate conversion to EU producer prices would be more advantageous than a gradual price reduction (ACA [expansion unknown]) that the government was seeking. Lipponen asserted that the Center Party and Farmers Association (MTK) wanted to have a gradual reduction so that it would be possible to conceal the enormous price subsidies to the farmers and to that part of the food-processing industry owned by the farmers. "Now all this will be more transparent, and therefore the calculations regarding budget costs have shocked so many," he said.
