Kranich affirmed that he is prepared to fulfill his obligations until the Pro Patria congress. "If Mart Laar should after that continue as prime minister, I find it impossible to continue as Cabinet member," he stated. Kranich blamed the premier for having repeatedly gone against the rules in signing state guarantees for loans. "The justice chancellor has qualified his actions as violation of the Constitution. As a result, monetary obligations binding on the Republic of Estonia have been assumed," Kranich stated. The finance minister noted that Laar, denying his violations, has taken steps to remove from the government the ministers who pointed out his mistakes. Culture and Education Minister Paul-Eerik Rummo, who is also the chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party, told the RAHVA HAAL yesterday he doesn't plan to leave the government in the next few days. The ELDP council and the Liberals faction in parliament yesterday announced their decision to authorize Rummo and Kranich to continue in the government pending the outcome of the Pro Patria congress. The ELDP also proposed that all ruling coalition parties should get together to make up their minds about a candidate for new prime minister as well as other possible Cabinet reshuffles. The other ruling coalition members -- the Estonian Rural Centrist Party, the Estonian National Independence Party and the Estonian Social Democratic Party -- said last week that their ministers will not leave the government. Pro Patria member, Foreign Minister Juri Luik also told reporters yesterday he will not be stepping down until the Pro Patria congress. A meeting of the Pro Patria council yesterday decided that election of new party chairman doesn't necessarily imply nomination of new premier. The Pro Patria congress is scheduled for June 11. On the top of the agenda are election of new chairman for the party and the situation in the government and the ruling coalition. Laar said on Friday [20 May] he regards decisions of the congress as binding for himself. "If Pro Patria elects a new chairman, I'll resign," the premier promised.
