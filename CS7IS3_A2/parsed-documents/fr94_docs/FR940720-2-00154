Instead, a withdrawal charge (contingent deferred sales charge) will be assessed in some circumstances when the contract value is completely or partially withdrawn prior to the maturity date. Generally, a withdrawal charge only applies to the withdrawal of purchase payments that have been in the Contract less than seven complete years. The withdrawal charge is a percentage of the amount withdrawn which is subject to the charge, which percentage declines 6&hyph;6&hyph;5&hyph;5&hyph;4&hyph;3&hyph;2% over the first seven years that a purchase payment has been in the Contract. Withdrawals are allocated first to earnings and then to purchase payments on a first-in-first-out basis. There is no withdrawal charge with respect to withdrawals of investment earnings and certain other free withdrawal amounts. under no circumstances will the total of all withdrawal charges exceed 6% of total purchase payments made. In the case of group Contracts only, the withdrawal charge may be modified by Security Life on 60 days written notice to the group holder of the Contract, provided that the modification shall apply only to certificates issued under the Contract after the effective date of the modification. The withdrawal charge is intended to reimburse Security Life for compensation paid to cover selling concessions to broker-dealers, preparation of sales literature and other expenses relating to sales activity. Applicants will rely on Rule 6c&hyph;8 under the Act for the necessary exemptive relief to permit imposition of the withdrawal charge. 7. Security Life assumes mortality and expense risks under the Contracts. The mortality risk is the risk that annuitants may live for a longer period of time than estimated. Security Life assumes this mortality risk by virtue of annuity rates incorporated into the Contract, which for individual Contracts cannot be changed and in the case of group Contracts, cannot be changed for outstanding certificates. This assures each annuitant that his longevity will not have an adverse effect on the amount of annuity payments. Also, Security Life guarantees that if the owner dies before the maturity date, it will pay a death benefit. The expense risk assumed by Security Life is the risk that the administration fees, which fees cannot be increased for individual Contracts or outstanding certificates, may be insufficient to cover actual expenses.To compensate it for assuming these risks, Security Life will deduct from each sub-account a charge each valuation period at an effective annual rate of 1.25%, consisting of .80% for mortality risks and .45% for expense risks. 8. The rate of the mortality and expense risk charge cannot be increased for individual Contracts. The rate may be increased for group Contracts but only for certificates issued after the effective date of the Contract. Applicants acknowledge that if the mortality and expense charge is increased, further exemptive relief may be necessary. Security Life reserve the right to issue group Contracts and certificates with a lower mortality and expense risk charge where it determines that the risks of the group involved are less than for the persons for whom the Contracts and certificates were originally designed. If the mortality and expense risk charge is insufficient to cover the actual cost of the mortality and expense risk undertaking, Security Life will bear the loss. Conversely, if the charge proves more than sufficient, the excess will be profit to Security Life and will be available for any proper corporate purpose including, among other things, payment of distribution expenses. Applicants' Legal Analysis 1. Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act provides, in pertinent part, that the Commission, by order upon application, may conditionally or unconditionally exempt any persons, securities, or transactions from any provision of the 1940 Act if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act.
