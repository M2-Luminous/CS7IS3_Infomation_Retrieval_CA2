The ANC avers that it is the final press interview before the election results are released: SAPA: What are your emotions on the eve of casting a vote? NM: "It is a very exciting moment because it is a realisation of our hopes and dreams. At last, our sacrifices are bearing fruit. (But) what makes one go through a painful period is the fact that some of those, who made this day possible, are not there to enjoy the fruits of their labour. I am thinking of such eminent persons as Oliver Tambo, Chris Hani, Dr Yusuf Dadoo, Alex la Guma and others who have sacrificed tremendously to make this day possible. I wish I could wake up all of them so that together we could celebrate the victory of a struggle which lasted for more than eight decades. My feelings are a mixture of joy because this day has come, and sadness because some of our heroes will not be here to celebrate. But naturally the dominant feeling is that of joy, hope and confidence for the future." SAPA: What are the major failures of the ANC's electioneering campaign? NM: "I don't think in terms of failure...I think in terms of success and hope. But one thing is that we have not been able to get our people to realise the importance of getting identity documents. But (our success has been that) we have rallied unprecedented crowds. There is no organisation that has been able to organise, rouse such massive support from all sections of the population -- `coloureds', Indians and Africans and a substantial number of whites in this country. Despite the fact that there have been some weaknesses, the dominating factor is one of a sterling campaign which puts us in a position to win this election if we can resolve the issue of IDs and temporary voter cards." SAPA: But polling began this morning (Tuesday), how do you hope to resolve the question of IDs? NM: "I was discussing the matter of IDs with Judge (Johann) Kriegler (head of the Independent Electoral Commission) about 30 minutes ago. They are devising plans to deal with this situation. They think at least they will be able to provide IDs and voter cards for another million people. I also discussed the matter this morning with Mr de Klerk to request that the Home Affairs Department should not work as they do now, where they observe office hours. They must work 24-hours a day. He (Mr de Klerk) has undertaken to see to it that this request is accommodated." SAPA: What percentage of the 22.7 million voters received by the ANC would disappoint you? Nm: "I'm not thinking in terms of disappointment, I'm thinking in terms of hope and excitement. There are 22 million voters in this country...3.5-million whites, 2-million 'coloureds', 600,000 Indians. That makes up a total of 6-million and even assuming that de Klerk -- which I don't accept -- has the support of the majority in these groups, I think the rest of the population of South Africa is going to vote overwhelmingly for the ANC. In that I include 'coloured', Indians and a substantial section of the white community." SAPA: But if the ANC received only 51 per cent of the vote? NM: "As long as that is the result of a free and fair election. We have to accept the results of a democratic process, which we have established...I would accept that." SAPA: Which individuals across the political spectrum would you include in your cabinet of national unity? NM: "I wouldn't do that. It is for each organisation to decide who should be in a cabinet of national unity. It would be presumptious of me to identify certain people and take on to myself a task which should be addressed by the leaders of the various organisations that will get five per cent or more of the total vote cast in the election. I will be satisfied with what (the organisations) give me." SAPA: If an organisation received less than five per cent, but you wanted an individual from that party in your cabinet? NM: "Well, that is a matter we will have to discuss with the Government of National Unity. Once we have a Government of National Unity, whatever problems arise, they are the collective responsibility of the entire cabinet of national unity." SAPA: You recently spoke about the church having a constitutional role in the country. What type of role for the church do you envisage? NM: "Already, we have established what was originally called a council of state -- now it is the social and economic council -- in which various organisations, traditional leaders, religious leaders, women and student bodies and workers will be represented. The church and religious groups are going to be represented in that body. What I'm stressing is that the church is a very powerful organisation, which has played an important role in our struggle for democratic changes and it is necessary for us to recognise that role. And the church is committed to high moral values...the Involvement of the church in government will help us to raise moral standards in government -- to a new democratic government, one of whose purposes is to wipe away corruption and to ensure that government is clean. These are things in which religious organisations can play a key and pivotal role." SAPA: Will this mean religious leaders in cabinet? NM: "Now that will depend on how my organisation and colleagues welcome this idea. My own view is that we should not put in government people who have not been democratically elected. But I am concerned with the fact that they (church leaders) should have a positive contribution proportionate to the role they have played and the force they are able to wield. I don't think we can deny them the role of having an impact in government to ensure the maintenance of high moral standards." SAPA: The whole of Africa is watching...your comment? NM: "I am happy to join those countries of Africa that have sucessfully fought for their independence. We are now part of that great fraternity and it is in that spirit that we are going to look at the problems of Africa." SAPA: And Europe? NM: "The people of Europe have a lot of goodwill for us and they have long gone through the period that we are going through now. Their experience is going to be very valuable to us. We would like them to share that experience with us...also to provide us with resources so that we are able to address the problems in our country." SAPA: And the us of America? NM: "The United States of America is the leader of the democratic world and it is very good that we should remain on friendly relations with that country. They have a tradition of democratic government. They can also help us in ensuring that a democratic government in our country is entrenched."
