A statement issued by the general secretariat of the council today condemned the criminal aggression, and stressed that it expressed Israeli extremism and bigotry, and carelessness for the lives of Palestinian citizens. The statement urged the international community to bear its responsibilities in providing protection for the Palestinians in the occupied Palestinian territories, stopping the crime and bloody slaughter committed against them, and blaming the Israeli Government alone for any results of this criminal aggression. For its part, the General Secretariat of the organization of the Arab Red Crescent and Red Cross societies has condemned the regrettable incidents that took place yesterday in the al-Ibrahimi mosque in al-Khalil, and stressed that these criminal acts perpetrated by the Jewish settlers violated the freedom of the sacred places and of innocent citizens. In a statement issued today, the general secretariat called for the disarming of the settlers so that such hideous crimes may not be repeated against the innocent sons of the Palestinian people, which is struggling to gain its legitimate rights.
