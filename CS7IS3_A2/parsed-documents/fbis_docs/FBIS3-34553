[rupees] 6,297.69 crore in the first nine months of the current financial year, April-December 1993, Commerce Minister Pranab Mukherjee said, while inaugurating the regional conference of UK chartered accountants here today. He further said that the foreign exchange reserves had improved appreciably to U.S. $9.9 billion as on January 1, 1994 from the level of U.S. $1 billion obtaining in June 1991. However, he said, there was no room for complacency and India had to take all the initiative required to promote productivity, modernisation and competitiveness of Indian industries. The process of liberalisation was irreversible and needed to be pushed forward, he added. The Minister urged the Indian businessmen to upgrade the technology in manufacturing processes to achieve their competitive edge in the international market as this will help in pushing the exports at the targetted level. He said that increasing the competitiveness of our exports was the only viable alternative for long-term balance of payment problem. The Government on its part has already taken certain measures, for upgrading the technology of the economy to boost the exports, he added. The increase in exports by 20 per cent during April-Dec. 1993 over the corresponding period of the previous year and decline in imports by 1.3 per cent during the same period is result of the measures taken by the Government to step up exports. As a consequence the balance of trade has come down to U.S. $732 million during April-December 1993, compared to U.S. $3,555 million during the corresponding period of the previous year, Mr. Mukherjee said. The Minister said that the estimated balance of trade during current financial year 1993-94 may be less than U.S. $1 billion as compared to pound sterling 3.3 billion for the year 1992-93. The increase in exports and foreign direct investment (FDI) were cited as the main reasons for improvement in the balance of payment position by him. Speaking about the next phase of the reform process, the Commerce Minister called for an integrated strategy to further exports. In particular, he stressed upon reform in the commercial banking sector with regard to cost and quality of credit, bridging of information gap and adjusting policies to suit environmental concerns.
