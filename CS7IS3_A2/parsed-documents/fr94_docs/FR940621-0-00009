FR940621-0-00009 FR940621-0-00003 An accredited-free State, as defined in §77.1 of the regulations, is a State that has no findings of tuberculosis in any cattle or bison in the State for at least 5 years. The State must also comply with all the provisions of the ``Uniform Methods and Rules_Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication'' regarding accredited-free States. An accredited-free (suspended) State is defined as a State with accredited-free status in which tuberculosis has been detected in any cattle or bison in the State. A State is qualified for redesignation of accredited-free status after the herd in which tuberculosis is detected has been quarantined, an epidemiological investigation has confirmed that the disease has not spread from the herd, and all reactor cattle and bison have been destroyed. However, if tuberculosis is detected in two or more herds in the State within 48 months, the State's accredited-free status is revoked. Before publication of this interim rule, Virginia was designated in §77.1 of the regulations as an accredited-free State. However, because tuberculosis has recently been confirmed in one herd within the State, the Administrator has determined that Virginia no longer meets the criteria for designation as an accredited-free State, but instead meets the criteria for designation as an accredited-free (suspended) State. Therefore, we are amending the regulations by removing Virginia from the list of accredited-free States in §77.1 and adding it to the list of accredited-free (suspended) States in that section. Immediate Action The Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that there is good cause for publishing this interim rule without prior opportunity for public comment. Immediate action is necessary to change the regulations so that they accurately reflect the current tuberculosis status of Virginia as an accredited-free (suspended) State. This will provide prospective cattle and bison buyers with accurate and up-to-date information. Because prior notice and other public procedures with respect to this action are impracticable and contrary to the public interest under these conditions, we find good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553 to make it effective upon publication in the Federal Register . We will consider comments that are received within 60 days of publication of this rule in the Federal Register . After the comment period closes, we will publish another document in the Federal Register . It will include a discussion of any comments we receive and any amendments we are making to the rule as a result of the comments. Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act This interim rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. For this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived its review process required by Executive Order 12866. Virginia has approximately 29,000 cattle herds containing 1,710,000 cattle and bison. An estimated 90 percent of these herds are owned by small businesses. Changing the status of Virginia may affect the marketability of cattle and bison from the State, since some prospective cattle and bison buyers prefer to buy cattle and bison from accredited-free States. This may result in a small detrimental economic impact on some small entities. We anticipate that this action will not have a significant effect on marketing patterns in Virginia and will therefore not have a significant effect on those persons affected by this action. Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Executive Order 12372 This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.025 and is subject to Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. (See 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V.) Executive Order 12778 This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule: (1) Preempts all State and local laws and regulations that are in conflict with this rule; (2) has no retroactive effect; and (3) does not require administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court challenging this rule.
