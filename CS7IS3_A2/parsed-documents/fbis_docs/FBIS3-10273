"I have seen, however, that there is hope, dedication, and work among Guatemalans. That is very important, but I think 30 years of internal armed struggle is too much for a multi-ethnic nation, although I must make it clear I did not come from France to pass judgment or teach lessons. Based on her country's experience, where there was slavery and exploitation, "one never achieves a perfect democracy; one always has to move to strengthen it," and that is the role Guatemala must play, "because that commitment exists among Guatemalans, and my country, France, supports that initiative." Based on her experiences in Ixcan, Quiche, she stated the Guatemalan people's spirit is always high because they are ready to obtain a better future through work and respect for their human, economic, and social rights. "The basis for a solution to the nation's problems and the strengthening of democracy constitute the fundamental pillars to building peace for the peoples, especially for the people of Guatemala and Latin America where exploitation and poor distribution of land is almost a widespread problem. The French official added: "When I return to my country, I will report that the people of Guatemala want to have the right to work and live." Michaux-Chevry's remarks coincide with the United Nations call to the government and Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity to resume their peace talks on 3 to 7 March.
