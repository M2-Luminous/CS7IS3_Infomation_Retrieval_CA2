"While the economic situation of the country is increasingly deteriorating, and it is becoming increasingly clear that the present government is going to hand over the governance of the country to the next government in a condition worse than it was when it took power, certain government sources do not shrink from rehashing some long-forgotten bolshevik legacies, and from advertising the government's success. To assert that things are better today than they were four years ago, when facts and everyday experience indicate the opposite, amounts to uninhibited insolence," so the opposition argument goes. Accordingly, let us find out who is correct: Should we believe what the government says or what the opposition claims to be true, or should we rely on our own experience? It is not easy to give an unequivocal "yes" or "no" answer to this question, because we are in the midst of a transitional process of historic significance, the essence of which is change, the dismantling of the old system, and the building of a new system. Therefore, we do not have a fixed basis for comparison to permit a clear evaluation of the changes. Similarly, one cannot draw historical parallels, or rely on scientific grading systems, because we are in the process of an unprecedented transformation, simultaneously experienced by only a few former socialist countries. If, despite all these difficulties, we try to assess the past period, anything we say must be prefaced by a statement to the effect that no summary judgment, clearly positive or clearly negative, can be made. The overall picture shows both favorable and unfavorable trends. The exact ratio in which these trends are mixed to prove correct any given view depends on one's temper and political outlook. Such assessments, however, do not render the overall picture entirely black or entirely white: The picture still shows the situation as it actually exists. Confronting the Legacy of the Past It is not entirely futile to look behind the arguments presented by the opposition, because we should be able to present not only the negative, but also the positive aspects of the situation. In the following paragraphs we will examine arguments most frequently advanced by opposition politicians to prove the worsening of the economic situation. Opposition argument No. 1: The GDP, industrial production, agricultural production, and real income have significantly declined during the past four years, while unemployment has greatly increased. All this goes to show that the present government has not resolved the crisis inherited from socialism, in fact it has made it worse. Doubtless, it is true that production and income have greatly declined, but one should underscore the fact that a decline of at least the same proportion has already potentially existed in the system prior to 1990, except that it did not surface at the time, because the governments of those days did not dare to confront the situation, and used every means (e.g., foreign indebtedness) to postpone the real solution. The eastern market that accepted virtually limitless quantities of obsolete, inferior quality products (but made increasingly fewer payments) had not collapsed at the time. But even then it was clear that most of our products could not withstand competition, that a significant number of our enterprises constituted chronic loss operations, that they operated on the basis of obsolete technical and technological standards, and that 25-30 percent of their employees were superfluous. At that time already, it was obvious that thing could not go on the way they did before. The relatively high growth rate of the 1970s came to a halt for the first time in the early 1980's, and investments and accumulations have continuously declined ever since. The failure to renew production capacities has already predestined the subsequent decline in production. After the collapse of the eastern markets, and after the introduction of import liberalization and principles of a market economy (accounting law, financial institutions law, bankruptcy law), one had to face the harsh realities of the inherited economy, and to examine the actual state of production forces that had been "developed according to a plan." Accordingly, the great decline flows decisively from the consistent use of this new yardstick, and not from flawed economic policies applied during the past four years. A substantially smaller decline in production and employment would have indicated that we had chosen the wrong path, that we had supported the old conservationist theory instead of renewal. In order to permit a new, modern economic structure to evolve, one has to dismantle the old system, and in the initial period, the emerging new system is unable to compensate for the demise of the old system. Opposition argument No. 2: The state's external and internal indebtedness has greatly increased during the past four years. The present government has failed to implement unpopular stringency measures; like its communist predecessors, the present government wants the next generation to resolve the problems. For all these reasons, the present government leaves behind for the next government empty state coffers and heavy obligations. Factual data indicate that although the gross foreign indebtedness of the state has increased as compared to the 1990 indebtedness level, the total net volume of indebtedness has not increased during the period examined. Between 1990 and 1992 the current balance of payments was positive. In 1993, however, a significant ($3.5 billion) deficit evolved, mainly as a result of the significant decline in exports. The decline in exports may be attributed to several factors, but in the final analysis, the reason for the decline can be traced to our low level of competitiveness. Increasing our competitiveness to appropriate levels requires an extended period of time. In the meantime, however, we must not pursue isolationist policies, because this would result in losing our chance to become integrated with the global economy. Quite naturally, one could suggest that a far more effective policy to stimulate exports should have been pursued by the government under the given conditions. This is true, in essence. One must not, however, disregard the fact that a strong policy to stimulate exports would have carried the threat of softening standard trade regulations, which could have caused very grave problems in a fledgling market economy. The (internal) indebtedness of the state has, indeed, increased significantly during the past four years. Its volume has doubled during the period. But this large-scale growth conceals a far smaller growth in actual indebtedness. This is so because almost two-thirds of the state's indebtedness is comprised of the forint value of the external indebtedness, which has increased primarily as a result of several devaluations of the forint. If we considered the budget deficit only, the state's indebtedness would be substantially smaller. "Empty State Coffers"--A Rhetorical Trick Not including the initial year 1990, the state budget had a deficit in every year, and the amount of deficit has increased each year. The large budget deficit, however, did not result from an expanding state, from a growing redistribution of income, but from the collapse of the old system. This is so because the lack of balance is due to a drop in revenues, and not to increased expenditures. Tax revenues naturally decline when production and income decline (and this is true in particular when a large number of factors in the economy evade taxation), while demand for social welfare provisions increase. During the past four years the volume of production and consumption subsidies as part of the state budget has decreased significantly, while the proportion of social welfare expenditures in the budget has greatly increased. An odd situation has evolved in the grip of constraints and limitations: The budget was heavily restrained from the standpoint of production, at the same time, however, it developed a heavy deficit, thus causing a deterioration of the overall balance, while it was incapable to finance social welfare entitlement, and unable to appropriately compensate social strata that were sliding down. One can escape from this trap only by instituting a comprehensive budget reform. The government has failed to initiate such a reform, and it can be appropriately blamed for that. At the same time, however, one should also stress that the disintegration of the old production system has imposed a grave burden of such proportion on society, that even the existence of the middle strata has become threatened. Under these conditions it is questionable whether society would also have tolerated a radical reduction in the social welfare delivery systems. Beyond all this, one also has to recognize that reforming the large distribution systems of the budget would not have produced tangible budget reductions in the short term, but would have increased the burden on the populace. A fundamental budget reform can only be introduced on a gradual basis, in parallel with growing individual income. The repeated mention of empty state coffers might be a clever rherotical trick, but it has no factual basis whatsoever. At the end of 1993 our foreign exchange reserves amounted to $6.8 billion. As a matter of comparison, one should note that foreign exchange reserves amounted to $800 million when governance was transferred from the Nemeth government. The large volume of foreign exchange reserves, as well as about $6 billion in foreign investments over the past few years enable secure operations, one that provides significant latitude even for the next government. Opposition argument No. 3: The government missed opportunities, and did not (consistently) implement the transition to a market economy; it began to build a modern economic system slowly and selectively. In light of the changes made thus far, the charge that holds that the present coalition government does not want to establish a market economy, but the Horthy system of between the two world wars or some vaguely defined, fellow-traveler system based on national considerations, is totally unfounded. The governmental and legislative actions of the past four years indicate a clear commitment to a market economy. Progress in privatization, the establishment of market economy institutions, laws consistent with western market economy standards, and the increasing role of foreign capital all go to prove this. Mixed, Kadarist Reactions In reality then, all that can be said is that the development of a market economy has progressed at a slow pace. This is certainly true, especially if compared to heightened expectations. The delays and the slowness resulted from delayed actions by the government and the legislature on the one hand, and from mistakes made by the professional staff, and the lack of a social consensus, on the other. In 1990, voters authorized the present government to accomplish a slow, gradual transition, and not to apply shock therapy. (One should keep in mind the major social tensions created by even a slow-paced transition.) Lack of acceptance by society may also be blamed for the slow progress of transition to a market economy. The gravest legacy of the past socialist system can be found not in distorted material conditions, but in standards of conduct, aptitudes, and attitudes instilled in people. After the political system change, everyone expected to see a well-functioning, decent market economy, as in Germany, Switzerland, or Japan. The problem is that on a societal scale, Hungary did not have (and still does not have) a high level of work ethics, a high degree of enterprising spirit, and appropriate professional training. Short of these, even a well functioning market economy develops slowly, is filled with contradictions and many mistakes, and is accompanied by negative phenomena. The popular but mistaken belief or propaganda holds that the above-mentioned positive attributes had already evolved and had gained strength during Kadar's soft dictatorship, in the socialist economy that had been the subject of several reforms. This, however, is not true. What evolved there was a way to make a living in the shadows of socialist large enterprises: to work for these enterprises in executive positions, and, at the same time, to maintain business relations with the same enterprises in the form of a second job. Further: This situation taught people how to conduct themselves wisely in an economy in which consumers could enjoy all the advantages of a market economy, but in which producers and employers were protected against all negative effects of the market (this was the logic of the "produce for the eastern markets--buy from the Western markets" mechanism). Real market economies, however, do not function on the basis of this logic; they require some different aptitudes and forms of conduct, and Hungarian society was not (and is still not) appropriately prepared to acquire such aptitudes and to manifest such conduct. Accordingly, when it comes to progress in the development of a market economy, the slowness of the progress is not necessarily due to mistakes made by the government, but also to slow and mixed reactions by society. Let us not forget the old wisdom: "You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink."
