Those who signed the petition are Army lieutenant colonels, majors, captains, first lieutenants, lieutenants, and sublieutenants. Court sources reported that the petition was signed by 18 lieutenant colonels, six majors, 31 captains, 42 first lieutenants, 12 lieutenants, and four sublieutenants. General Staff spokesmen said that in the next few days Air Force and Navy officers will join the group who yesterday filed their petition against the law suspending their affiliation. Same Arguments We could not read the document presented in court. We learned, however, that the lawsuit is based on the same arguments used by generals and colonels in their lawsuit last week. The main arguments used by high-ranking and lower-ranking Army officers in their lawsuit is that the law affects their acquired rights, and that its effects cannot be retroactive. "Pancho" de Vargas's Threats Military circle spokesmen said that the threats aired by the Chamber of Deputies President Francisco Jose de Vargas against those who signed the lawsuit were decisive for many who signed the document. Francisco Jose de Vargas suggested he would not approve the promotion of officers supporting the challenge against the constitutionality of the law on affiliations at the end of this year.
