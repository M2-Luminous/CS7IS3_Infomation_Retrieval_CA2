Then he said: [Silajdzic] As for me, unfortunately I had to tell the ambassador about some things that do not sound very optimistic, generally speaking, and asked him to convey this to the highest authorities. What I said is that the continuation of the peace process is endangered with the latest attacks on Gorazde -- a massive offensive is under way, and many people are being killed, innocent people; with the attacks on Bihac, and the ethnic cleansing, the new wave of ethnic cleansing -- against which President Izetbegovic protested yesterday -- that is taking place in Bosnian Krajina. Today I received information from the chairman of the International Red Cross, responsible for central Bosnia and Bosnian Krajina, who said that we have to either protect the 6,000 people in Prijedor and the surrounding area or move them out. Their lives are in danger. This is very bad news. In connection with Gorazde, the international community is silent about it. A zone that has been proclaimed protected by a UN Security Council resolution is under attack. An offensive is underway, and many people have been killed. I am certain that the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] in Bosnia-Herzegovina can follow the development of the situation, they can see it on their television here in Sarajevo, and their command knows very well what is going on. The United Nations has been informed; the Security Council has been informed. However, there is no reaction. The situation is repeating itself, where the aggressor is allowed to do almost anything he wants. I will repeat, the continuation of the peace negotiations has been seriously endangered with these latest activities by the aggressor in the region of Gorazde and Bihac, and the ethnic cleansing of the remaining non-Serbian population in Bosnian Krajina. [Bosnjak] Ambassador Flynn expressed the concern and the understanding of the American people for the suffering of the people in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and spoke of the appeals and prayers of the Holy Father for the return of peace.
