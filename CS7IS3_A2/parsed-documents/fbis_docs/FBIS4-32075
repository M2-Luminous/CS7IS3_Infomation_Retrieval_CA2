The pro-Serbian leftist government coalition, which fully controls the Macedonian Assembly, has not yet proposed any legal measures to define and support Macedonia's state border with Serbia, as well as with other states, and thus respond to these activities of our northern neighbor. Because of all this, the northern state border is still being treated as an administrative border. The VMRO-DPMNE considers that the government of Branko Crvenkovski and Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov are most responsible for not resolving this situation, because so far they have not done anything to contribute to adapting the Macedonian legislation to international law on state sovereignty and the protection of territorial integrity. According to VMRO-DPMNE, there can be no justification for this leftist ruling coalition, which has not yet passed a new law on the control of the state borders, on protecting the inviolability of the entire length of the borders and thus defining a way for solving border violations and incidents, which are occuring increasingly frequently.
