The first phase of maintenance of the plant in Nuevitas will be conducted on unit No. 5, mainly in order to increase boiler efficiency. The workers at the plant, Cuba's second in generating capacity, plan to complete partial maintenance of the fifth of its six generating units in less than 25 days. Workers are preparing with minimum resources to begin an uninterrupted 24-hour schedule in what has already been described as a feat of labor. Engineer Mario Mederos, director, stressed that this experience will make it possible later to perform complex maintenance on unit No. 6, which also produces 125 megawatts per hour. The recent workers parliament meeting in the plant prompted an analysis of measures to reduce absenteeism, increase technological discipline, and promote individual incentives for work results.
