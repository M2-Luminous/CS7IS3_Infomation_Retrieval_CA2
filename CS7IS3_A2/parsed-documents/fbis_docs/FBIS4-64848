WEU foreign and defense ministers are currently holding a meeting here to discuss a new form of partnership with nations in Central and East Europe. The European Union has already chosen former Bremen mayor Hans Koschnik to be its adminstrator in Mostar and has asked the WEU, the future defense arm of the European Union, to work to guarantee the presence in the city of an efficient police force. In response to this, the WEU has already sent its own panel of experts and came up with a number of options for the European Union including that of training Muslim and Croat policemen and sending in an international police force. A decision on the matter is expected during the Dutch WEU presidency. The discussions here between WEU defense and foreign ministers on the new partnerships will also see the participation of representatives from those nations slated for the WEU partnership agreements: Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia -- the so-called Visegrad group -- Bulgaria and Romania, as well as the ex-Soviet Baltic states Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania. The partnership agreements grant recipients the status of "associated partners" with the WEU, the only European organ which deals with security matters and which is slated to become Europe's pillar in NATO as well as the future security and defense arm of the European Union. WEU sources pointed out how the new partnership agreements expanded to the area of defense the association agreements which the WEU has already reached or is currently negotiating with these countries. The WEU is currently composed of Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Portugal, Spain, Italy, Britain, the Netherlands and Greece. It is made up of all European Union members except Ireland, and all European Union members of NATO except Denmark.
