But Their Good Relations Will Help To Create an All-European Security System"] [Text] Boris Yeltsin began the second day of his official visit to the FRG by meeting with Rudolf Scharping, chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Germany. The conversation took place in the Petersberg Palace, where the Russian president was staying, and was of the nature of personal contacts between two political leaders. After this Boris Yeltsin visited the cities of Dadeyskhaym [name as transliterated] and Oggersheim and called at the private home of Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl. According to the diplomats who prepared the program of the visit, the visit to the German chancellor's home places was a response to last year's trip to Lake Baykal by Boris Yeltsin and Helmut Kohl. It is believed at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that such meetings between the leaders "deep inside the two states" help to better understand the spirit of both countries and peoples and to strengthen mutual trust. But even having left the capital, the leaders did not, I believe, stop the dialogue begun in the previous day's official talks. Although a great deal had already been done on Wednesday. One of the most delicate tasks was safely resolved -- that of the venue for the ceremony marking the final withdrawal of the Russian troops from German territory: It will take place in Berlin 31 August, as Moscow had been insisting, and not in Weimar, as proposed by Bonn. "The war ended in Berlin, so what question can there be of Weimar?" Colonel General Matvey Burlakov, commander in chief of the Western Group of Forces, explained our position. "Since it is a question of eliminating the consequences of the war, the ceremony must be held in Berlin." The Germans, as we see, have conceded. "My aim," Helmut Kohl declared for his part, "is to ensure that the Russian servicemen's send-off is worthy and respectful and is conducted in a spirit of friendship." Despite its complexity, the subject of the Russian troops' send-off did not dominate the talks which the Russian Federation president had with the German leaders. A very wide range of questions of interaction and cooperation between Russia and the FRG was discussed during the conversation with President Richard von Weizsaecker, in the confidential conversations with Helmut Kohl, and in the enlarged meetings of the two delegations (the Russian Federation president was accompanied by Vice Premier Aleksandr Shokhin, Ministers Andrey Kozyrev, Pavel Grachev, and Yevgeniy Sidorov, and also Vladislav Terekhov, Russian Federation ambassador to Bonn). As soon as the Russian president's aircraft arrived at Bonn/Cologne Airport from Moscow Wednesday morning, Boris Yeltsin made it clear that the visit was of a "planned nature." He said that 38 major joint projects have been prepared during the two years since his previous visit to Bonn. "The time has come to audit the way they are being implemented and also to discuss some 20 future joint projects," he remarked. Boris Yeltsin and Helmut Kohl confirmed yet again that Russia and Germany regard each other as equal partners, on the state of whose relations the fate of European and world politics largely depends. At the same time the Russian Federation president emphasized that the ensuring of peace throughout the European continent depends not only on bilateral relations between the FRG and Russia. But the fact that the two greatest states on the continent can reach agreement on complex problems attests that it will also be easier to work with other countries in order to have a unified security system in Europe. One element of it could be Russia's joining the "Partnership for Peace" program. To judge from Boris Yeltsin's statement, Moscow agrees with this NATO initiative in principle. But Russia cannot sign this document without a special protocol. "There must be one more document, which would stipulate specific questions concerning Russia's special features, including, for example, the fact that we have an army of 3 million men," he said. This position is obviously shared by Bonn also. Moreover, acknowledging Russia's status as a great power, the FRG is sincerely interested in the success of the democratic and market reforms being implemented by its leadership and is prepared to continue giving it what support it can to surmount the present difficulties, as well as for further integration into the international community. Chancellor Kohl welcomed, in particular, the idea of turning the "G-7" into the "G-8" by means of including Russia. This question will be discussed, he said, in Naples at the meeting of the heads of the seven most developed industrial countries scheduled for July, and Germany will promote Russia's integration into international organizations in every possible way. "Any other development would be disastrous," Helmut Kohl emphasized. Another complex topic of the dialogue in Bonn was the problem of the return of cultural assets lost by both countries as a result of World War II. The work of the commission set up by the two countries' Ministries of Culture has not yet produced results. An accord has now been reached that in the future this commission will work to a rigid schedule approved personally by the leaders of both countries. But we do not intend to interfere in the commission's work. Let professionals make the decisions, Boris Yeltsin remarked. Today is the final day of the visit. Boris Yeltsin will spend it in Stuttgart, one of Germany's major industrial and cultural centers.
