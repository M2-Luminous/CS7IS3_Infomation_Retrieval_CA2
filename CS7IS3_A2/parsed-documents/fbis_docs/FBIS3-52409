Can the agreement lead to a Palestinian state? [Musa] The agreement was one of the major events of 1993. It does not involve only Gaza and Jericho. It is a declaration of principles between the two sides and an introduction to other developments, starting with the transfer of power to the Palestinians and moving on to autonomy and self-determination--which means the establishment of a Palestinian state. The development, undoubtedly, is important for Palestinian-Israeli relations and the Arab-Israeli conflict. We are currently in the implementation stage. [Al-Sa'id] But the implementation is faltering. [Musa] Arab-Israeli negotiations are not an easy matter. Given the long history of the conflict and the opposing interests and demands, obstacles are always expected. But with the determination of the negotiators and the help of other parties, the obstacles can be removed and the agreement can be implemented. The gap between the two sides, no doubt, is a result of the great hopes of the Palestinians and the great reservations of the Israelis. It is only through negotiations, the implementation of the agreement, and the demonstration of good faith that the gap can be bridged. This requires some relaxation, such as the release of prisoners. We must not continue to live under the same old standards. The rationale for the conflict is over, and we must benefit from the new world climate. [Al-Sa'id] The issue of the border crossings is still the main obstacle. [Musa] This concerns the two sides; we will not interfere in this issue. Ultimately, however, we do not differ from the Palestinians' view. [Al-Sa'id] Some saw the delay in the implementation of the agreement, which was due to begin on 13 December, as a sign that the peace talks have failed. [Musa] Moves toward peace have not failed. Both sides are eager to see that the negotiations do not fail. They agree on the importance of reaching an agreement. The delay in implementation does not mean that the process is over or that it has failed or gone backward. The region has indeed entered the first stage of settlement. The Palestinian-Israeli agreement is important, but it is the beginning, not the end. It has opened the door for other steps on the Syrian-Israeli, Lebanese-Israeli, and Jordanian-Israeli negotiating tracks. But all this needs care, patience, and determination. This is what we are doing. The goal is to achieve a comprehensive solution that addresses the issues of land, rights, and security. The Palestinian-Israeli agreement is an extremely important step, not a trick or a tactic to buy time. This is a psychological change. Anyway, the agreement will be judged soon through its honest implementation. The agreement is important. It means the recognition of the Palestinian people, the PLO, and the Palestinian land. If it succeeds, the two sides will live as neighbors, and fears and caution will disappear. However, this requires precise implementation. [Al-Sa'id] But Israel objects to the establishment of a Palestinian state. [Musa] No, this is not true. There is no objection to the existence of a Palestinian state. The agreement can lead to a state, and it will not be annulled by the establishment of a state. The PLO cannot be besieged and asked not to think of the great Palestinian hope--a state. [Al-Sa'id] Which is more important now, the Palestinian-Israeli or the Syrian-Israeli negotiating tracks? [Musa] At this stage, we are actively following both tracks. We are doing all that we can to stimulate the peace process and make progress on all fronts. This is a process that should lead to a full peace based on a complete Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories. It is up to the concerned parties to decide on a specific agreement with Israel based on all the land for total peace. [Al-Sa'id] But do you feel that the general climate has actually changed and the region can now formulate new relations with Israel? [Musa] The general psychological climate is obviously changing. All the parties are engaged in contacts and cooperation. We hope the talks between the Palestinians and Israel will end in an agreement that preserves Palestinian rights. We also hope that the resumption of the bilateral talks in Washington will lead to a peace agreement among all the sides. Peace in the region, with its political and economic implications, is a source of great interest to us. We are talking about laying the foundations for future cooperation. We feel a great responsibility. Things must proceed in the right way so that we do not go back to our previous state of affairs. [Al-Sa'id] What about the Syrian track? [Musa] We hope the next talks will produce positive results and enable the two sides to move closer to an agreement. The United States is playing a major role, and we are trying to advance the Syrian track because if there is no peace on this track, there can be no comprehensive peace. We support Syria's right to regain its territory. Syria cannot accept, and we cannot accept, any other kind of withdrawal. The implementation of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement and Israel's withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories will mean an end to all theories of expansion. [Al-Sa'id] What do you mean by withdrawal? Are the Israeli settlements included? [Musa] We mean complete civilian and military withdrawal. The settlements are part of this withdrawal. [Al-Sa'id] How do you evaluate U.S. policy in the region? Some believe it upsets the balance with the Arab countries in favor of Israel. They say Israel is being supported so that it will dominate the Arab world. [Musa] We cannot proceed from this assumption. This is in harmony with the language of today. The United States is a friendly country, and it is in our interest to be friends with it. It is not true that the United States is supporting Israel so that the latter will control the Arab world. On the contrary, the U.S. role in the Egyptian-Israeli agreement, for instance, is known by all. Under that agreement, Sinai was restored, and there was no Israeli domination. Such domination was not a price we had to pay in advance. It is not in the interest of the United States to let a certain state control the region. We are talking about balance and reconciliation, not pressure and coercion. [Al-Sa'id] But the United States still adopts a policy that is essentially based on maintaining a strong Israel. It has recently supplied Israel with F-15 and F-16 aircraft and reaffirmed its commitment to qualitative Israeli superiority over the entire Arab world. [Musa] This inclination is indeed reflected in some aspects. We are discussing this, and we view U.S. eagerness for qualitative Israeli superiority as serious. At this stage of peace, we must be interested in the theories of balance, not those of superiority. The region needs balance because this is what will boost security. Superiority, on the other hand, pushes the region toward an arms race, which is in no one's interest. [Al-Sa'id] While Warren Christopher was touring the region in November, U.S. Assistant Defense Secretary Frank Wisner visited Egypt, Israel, Jordan, and the Gulf states. In his statements, he appeared to install Israel as a nuclear deterrent that will defend the interests of the United States and its allies in the region. [Musa] Our position is very well known. We will not waver or retreat. Question marks and tension over disarmament will continue in the region as long as there is no balance. Peace cannot be maintained without balance. In order for this balance to be achieved, no side should be given privileges over the others. If the principle of preference continues, with only one party possessing deterrent weapons in the region, things will remain unresolved. Balance is needed for the interests of all sides. [Al-Sa'id] On the other hand, a U.S. senator said during a recent visit to Pakistan that Egypt was pressured by the United States to abandon the idea of producing a nuclear bomb? [Musa] I responded to him at the time, and I repeat that Egypt was not under any pressure to abandon the idea of producing a nuclear bomb. Egypt simply had no intention of producing such a bomb. On the contrary, Egypt has called and is calling for the establishment of a nuclear-free zone in the Middle East. This is a principled position based on established Egyptian policy and has nothing to do with the U.S. position or the position of any other state. [Al-Sa'id] But some people have the impression that the United States is pressuring Egypt to adopt certain positions toward some states and issues in the area? [Musa] There are no pressures on Egypt from this or any other party. We follow and uphold the policy that we think is consistent with our interests. This applies to our position on chemical and nuclear weapons. Our positions are known and established, and there is nothing called U.S. pressure. Our policy does not stem from this or that country. [Al-Sa'id] There are some who say that Egyptian policy is occasionally guided by U.S. signals that dictate the adoption of certain positions toward some states in the region. I mention as an example Egypt's position toward Iran and Sudan. Egypt has accused them of supporting terrorism and refused to improve its relations with them? [Musa] This is nonsense. It is totally untrue and unfounded. No one is applying pressure on us regarding any policy we have adopted. We make our own decisions, and no one dictates any specific course to us. Generally speaking, it is not strange to hear accusations from here and there. Such accusations are made by a few insignificant voices. When a certain state--and I do not want to mention names--attacks Egypt and I respond, does this take place because of U.S. pressure? This is something strange and illogical. In our policy, we are always seeking the Egyptian and Arab interest. There are numerous examples, including our position on the peace process. But we might occasionally adopt a position that agrees with the positions of other states, such as the United States or the European states. There is nothing wrong with this. We are not bothered by such senseless remarks made by people who live in the past. We are not ashamed that our views are sometimes consistent with the views of the United States, the European states, or any other state, because these are issues of policy and not personal issues. Our policy, as I have said, basically seeks to represent the Egyptian and Arab interest. [Al-Sa'id] Mentioning Sudan and Iran, some ask what basis we have to accuse them from time to time of supporting and exporting terrorism? Has their actual involvement in terrorism been proved? [Musa] If an accusation was leveled, there must be proof. No accusation can be made without basis. But this does not mean that I am leveling a specific accusation against this or that state. [Al-Sa'id] In your recent remarks about relations with Sudan, you said Egypt's intention is to achieve stability and not inflame emotions. What about Egypt's sheltering of the Sudanese opposition, and is this consistent with Egypt's eagerness not to inflame emotions? [Musa] Egypt has always been a repository for Arabs with differing views. We have a large Sudanese community, a large Somali community, and brothers from all the Arab countries here. This is a very old Egyptian tradition. [Al-Sa'id] Who is threatening Egypt's national security today, especially since Egyptian officials have said that the border with Israel is a safe border; the borders with Libya are the second safest; and the borders with Sudan are third safest? [Musa] We are not in the process of selecting enemies, naming countries, and (?so on). [Al-Sa'id] What is the current status of Egypt's ties with Sudan? [Musa] They are not as they should be, but any issue can be resolved through dialogue. No matter what the relations are like, our stand will continue to call for preserving Sudan's territorial integrity. Sudan's control over all its territories is an important and vital point. [Al-Sa'id] What about Iran? [Musa] There are long-standing relations between Egypt and Iran, and the present tension can be attributed to political reasons related to the situation in the Arab and Islamic worlds. We believe in the need to create a suitable climate to improve the relationship, but we are still hoping that Iran's inclinations will shift away from issues that cause such tensions in the Arab world and parts of the Islamic world. [Al-Sa'id] If 1994 results in a new form of Arab-Israeli relations, it is appropriate that we are hoping that this year will also see serious Arab reconciliation. [Musa] Arab reconciliation is truly required and the Arab world must move toward solidarity and calmness. President Husni Mubarak is clear in this respect as he calls for solidarity and calm. There are moves under way, and we are trying to create a fertile groundwork to build sound inter-Arab relations. Iraq's clear recognition of Kuwait's sovereignty and independence would begin to clear the atmosphere. [Al-Sa'id] What about lifting the blockade on Iraq? Could this happen in 1994? [Musa] We hope so. We also hope that all the factors exist to achieve at least the Iraqi nation's interest. Iraq is a fraternal Arab nation, and we hope it will emerge from its current dilemma. [Al-Sa'id] What can be done for Somalia at present, especially in light of the United States' decision to withdraw its forces in March? [Musa] We have demanded a clear-cut plan in Somalia. The cease-fire must be backed; the factions should be disarmed, and then a national reconciliation must be reached with the agreement of all parties. These parties should meet according to the Addis Ababa agreement, and the settlement should be in the interest of all the parties, not just in one party's interest. Since the U.S. decided to pull out from Somalia in March, we must act quickly to resolve this issue in the coming weeks. As a state, Egypt is very interested in the situation in the Horn of Africa, which affects Egypt's national security because it is part of the security of the Middle East, the Indian Ocean, and the Red Sea. Therefore, we must have a say in it. The Ethiopian president has a mandate to follow the situation in Somalia, and we are confident that things will turn out the way Somali people want.
