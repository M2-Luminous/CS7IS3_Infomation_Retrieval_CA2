China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), which oversees the country's onshore oil exploration and development, is expected to pump 1 million tons of oil in the shallow waters along the country's coastline in 1994. Reports say exploration in offshore areas where the water is no deeper than 5 metres has made considerable progress. In China, exploration and development in offshore areas where the waters are deeper than 5 metres are conducted by another oil firm -- China National Offshore Oil Corporation. Three large onshore oilfields, whose oil deposits stretch into the continental shelf, have been explored for two years. However, development of oil there had not begun until recently when a platform passed state appraisal at Shengli Oil Field, the country's second-largest oil field. The platform, named Development No 1, passed the appraisals after 16 months' trial operation. This marked the official beginning of oil development in the continental shelf, according to oil industry officials. The platform, which can be moved by a vessel or be seated on muddy or sandy seabeds, has the structure and necessary facilities to resist earthquakes, strong winds, and tidal waves. The first one of its kind in China, the design of the platform was one of the key technological projects listed in the Eighth Five- Year Plan that ends in 1995. With it, Shengli Oil Field has developed three oil wells and produced more than 8,000 tons of oil. Before that, Shengli Oil Field had explored areas in the shallow waters for about two years. A news release from CNPC last week revealed another movable platform for oil development in shallow waters was ready for use at Shengli. The platform, named Development No 2, which was completed at the end of November, will be used in areas where water is 1.5 to 9 metres deep. The platform, equipped with facilities to generate electricity and treat oil-contaminated water, can be used to develop three oil wells at one time. It can also gather and transmit data on winds and sea waves. The release says the platform, now in trial use, is to be ready for state appraisal within months. Development in the shallow waters is important for old oil fields, where stable production in onshore areas has become difficult after decades of exploitation. Another two oil fields at Liaohe and Dagang are also being studied to find ways to develop oil deposits in shallow waters. The official from CNPC revealed that the corporation will seek preferential policies from the government to encourage oil fields to develop the continental shelf. When the policies are applied oil fields will be allowed to sell oil developed in the shallow waters at market prices. Chinese onshore oil fields produce some 138 million tons of oil a year but most of the oil is priced low and distributed by the government.
