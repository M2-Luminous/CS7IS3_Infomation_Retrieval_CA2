FBIS4-23706 "drafr114_c_94016" FBIS-AFR-94-114 Daily Report 10 Jun 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Modise Explains Action Against WEEKLY MAIL Modise Explains Action Against WEEKLY MAIL MB1006191094 Johannesburg SAPA in English 1609 GMT 10 Jun 94 MB1006191094 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [Text] Pretoria June 10 SAPA -- Minister of Defence Joe Modise on Friday [10 June] backtracked from further action against the WEEKLY MAIL newspaper, saying he would decide on future steps about a possible report by the publication after he had studied all aspects. The tabloid was served papers on Thursday informing it of Mr Modise's intention to seek an interdict to restrain it from publishing further stories on the South African Defence Force's former Directorate of Covert Collection (DCC). The story, published for the first time last week, deals with 23 former members of the directorate who were dismissed by former State President F W de Klerk in 1992. Responding to the furore over the legal action, Mr Modise said he was approached on Thursday by SANDF [South African National Defense Force] head Gen Georg Meiring for permission to serve an interdict on the paper. "I granted this permission because I did not wish to read in newspapers about covert matters pertaining to my department about which I had not yet been briefed. The reason for this decision was so I could call for reports, both from the Defence Force and the respondents. Only when I have all the relevant information laid before me will I be in a position to decide what steps I will take," he said in a statement from Pretoria. Earlier on Friday, the African National Congress criticised the minister for launching legal action against the WEEKLY MAIL. "ANC policy is unequivocally for full disclosure of past covert action and exposure of dirty tricks against the democratic movement," the organisation said in a statement on Friday. "We have conducted our struggle to achieve a democratic and open society. South Africans voted for a fully transparent process of government. We are, therefore, concerned that this principle is being compromised by the minister of defence's attempt to interdict the WEEKLY MAIL & GUARDIAN," the statement said. Urging the ministry to withdraw the interdict and drop the case in the Pretoria Supreme Court "without delay", it said no further action should be taken using the defence of freedom of information acts until the acts had been re-evaluated.
