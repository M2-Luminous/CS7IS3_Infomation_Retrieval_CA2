The same report says that the Georgian side shelled Abkhaz positions for 30 minutes. This information was deliberately spread by the Abkhaz separatists, in order to blame the Georgian side for violating the agreement on a peaceful settlement of the conflict in Abkhazia and to block the return of refugees to Gali Rayon. In this connection, the press center of the Georgian Defense Ministry has stated the Georgian Armed Forces strictly adhere to the Geneva agreement and have not been engaged in any hostilities. As for the loss of 60 people in Okumi [village in Gali Rayon], this information does not correspond to reality either.
