However, he admitted in a conversation with journalists on Friday that 200 Russian servicemen are ready to be dispatched to former Yugoslavia. Grachev is convinced that currently there can be no talk about replacing Russian peacekeepers in "hot spots" across CIS with UN "blue helmets". Firstly, he explained, the UN has no money to send peacekeepers to the CIS. Secondly, one is not likely to find troops willing to be in volatile CIS areas. Thirdly, CIS heads of state want to see only Russian troops and UN observers in Commonwealth trouble spots.
