The 14th Army took steps to find out who were the people who had voted in the parliamentary elections and the referendum,. The employees of the Ministry of Interior of the Republic of Moldova did not have the right to vote in the referendum, just as the they did not have the right to vote in the parliamentary elections either. As far as the results of the referendum are concerned, all the international observers announced that there was a much reduced presence at the polls in case of the referendum polls than in the parliamentary elections, and the government-backed television of the republic announced a presence of over 70 percent at the polls. Just as it has always been the case so far, the population was used to explain the prosoviet policy promoted by President Snegur.
