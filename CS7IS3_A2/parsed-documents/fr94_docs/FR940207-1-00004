FR940207-1-00004 FR940207-1-00001 8 CFR 214.2(s)(7) requires that NATO dependents must pay taxes and Social Security on their earnings, and clarifies that they have no criminal, civil, or administrative immunities regarding matters arising from their employment. 8 CFR 214.2(s)(8) clarifies that there is no appeal from a denial of employment authorization. 8 CFR 214.2(s)(9) discusses unauthorized employment and resultant penalties. 8 CFR 214.2(s)(10) discusses NATO&hyph;7 dependents. Since this rule parallels the regulations governing ``A'' nonimmigrants which preclude employment by A&hyph;3 dependents, and since A&hyph;3 and NATO&hyph;7 classifications are comparable, this rule eliminates future grants of employment authorization for NATA&hyph;7 dependents, but allows those NATA&hyph;7 dependents currently with employment authorization to continue until the expiration of such authorization. Finally, this rule amends 8 CFR 274a.12(c)(7) by eliminating future grants of employment authorization for NATA&hyph;7 dependents. In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service certifies that this rule will not have a significant adverse economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule is not a major rule within the meaning of section 1(b) of E.O. 12291, nor does this rule have Federalism implications warranting the preparation of a Federalism Assessment in accordance with E.O. 12612. The information collection requirement contained in this regulation has been submitted to the Office of Budget and Management (OMB) under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act, for review and clearance.
