FBIS4-36743 "drnes113_v_94001" FBIS-NES-94-113 Daily Report 10 Jun 1994 Pakistan Text of Minister's 1994-95 Budget Speech Text of Minister's 1994-95 Budget Speech BK1006111394 Islamabad THE NATION in English 10 Jun 94 p 5 BK1006111394 Islamabad THE NATION English BFN [Text of the 1994-95 budget speech by Makhdum Shahabuddin, minister of state for economic affairs and finance, at the National Assembly in Islamabad on 9 June] [Text] Mr Speaker: This day brings me great honours as I have the privilege of presenting the Annual Budget 1994-95 before the nation. The people of Pakistan blessed with this beloved motherland. Sir: The annual budget represents the aspirations of a nation and a society. It holds the key to the realisation of its dreams for a new future. Budget is like a prism, like a crystal ball which shows to a discerning eye the mystiques of the past and present. Sir: I can confidently say that his budget is truly reflective of realities, I can only pray for those who do not accept this truth. This representatives House which has come into existence after a very transparent, just and fair election, has a special place in the history of democracy to forward and the democracy of the country since it enabled democracy to forward and the democratic process has gained greater credibility in the public. [sentence as published] The complete neutrality of the Armed Forces of Pakistan during the general elections have strengthened the public confidence in their non-political role and support for democracy in addition to their defence responsibilities. The nation by electing a Lady as Head of the government has also proved that we are also in the process of building a modern Islamic social system based on tolerance, justice, moderation, open mindedness and liberalism. During the current year besides domestic factors our economy has been affected by external factors. Due to International recession, our exports have been somewhat lower. Besides this some lasting changes have taken place. A new International Trade Agency (WTO) [World Trade Organization] will make rules for world trade replacing the international trade order managed by GATT. This new world trade system will include additional components concerning the agricultural commodities, intellectual property rights, services and investments. There is talk of doing away with multifibre agreement. One the other hand new trade Blocks are developing. Amongst these, the latest in NAFTA. This will reduce the access of developing countries to the world Market. During 1993 there have been extra-ordinary developments within the country which mainly relate to domestic politics. The government which had come into existence after a controversial elections was replaced by a Care Taker Government. This Care Taker Government undertook a number of important reforms for the recovery of deteriorating economy and held elections leading to the transfer of power to the present Government. Election of a Prime Minister nominated by the successful party and election of the President have brought about a new era of political stability which had made it possible for the Government to devote itself whole-heartedly to improve the economic situation. Mr Speaker: These political developments did not remain confined to politics but their pernicious influence also affected the economy. Economic indiscretion and irresponsibility of the previous Government was unparalleled. National resources were carelessly wasted and projects like yellow taxes and motor way were implemented which heavily damaged the economy and deeply affected the banking system. Consequently we inherited inflation and recession. Mr Speaker: GDP growth rate which during last 40 years maintained an average of 6 per cent had fallen to 2.28 per cent in 1992-93. In other words this was less than the population growth rate. Consequently in real terms the per capita income fell by 0.8 per cent. Agriculture Sector which is the back bone of the national economy and provides direct or indirect employment to 70 per cent of the rural population registered a fall of 5.3 per cent. Virus attack on cotton crop 1992-93 led to a record fall in cotton crop 1992-93 led to a record fall in cotton crop. [sentence as published] The then Government did not give it any attention. Cotton crop 1993-94 was again attacked by virus which caused tremendous loss to the farmers. This affected export and Textile industry faced a serious crisis. Stock market went into a recession. Foreign investment fell. Monetary and fiscal policies were being operated without any coordination. During 1990-93 rate of monetary expansion went beyond 20 per cent per annum, whereas GDP increased by 5.2 per cent per annum. Generation of resources was in serious difficulties while the taxation system was stagnant. Government Receipts as percentage of GDP were far less than the public expenditure. Overall fiscal deficit had risen to 7.9 per cent of GDP during 1992-93. To finance the budgetary deficit, Rs [rupees] 62.58 billion which was 4.7 billion had already been borrowed from the banks to finance the budget in the preceding year. [sentence as published] Foreign exchange reserves had fallen to an alarming level. On 20th October, 1993, they stood at dollars 326.3 million which were not enough for two weeks imports. Balance of payment deficits had increased to dollars 3 billion. Economy had destabilised and major economic indicators, for instance Fiscal deficits, monetary expansion, trade deficit and inflation, were providing evidence of this instability. During 1990-93, inflation rate had gone beyond 10 per cent which had badly affected the purchasing powers of the general public. In the Energy Sector the gap between demand and supply had increased. No meaningful plan was initiated to increase the availability of power and thus we inherited long duration load- shedding schedules. No meaningful progress was made in the Social Sector, literacy remained low and the rural population continued to be denied the basic amenities. Mr Speaker: Controlling the worsening economic situation and restoring the economy to growth path constituted a great challenge for us. Our manifesto contained a clear strategy to solve these problems. The corner stone of our manifesto is the well being of the people of Pakistan. We want to introduce a just social order in the country where by exploitation is replaced by a strong and stable system which is naturally beneficial for employee and employer and provides for increased productivity. We are taking steps to project the rights of farmers, women and minorities and by increasing the pace of industrial growth we want to make Pakistan a modern industrial centre of Asia so that poverty is eliminated from the country and every citizen is provides basic necessities of life. For this purpose we want to increase the pace of economic growth so that Pakistan can as quickly as possible enter an era of prosperity. We promise to eliminate economic disparities from the country by an equitable distribution of national income. A new tariff structure is being introduced which is based on justice and which will increase the government income and reduce the budget deficit. Increased allocations will be provided for the growth of social sectors. Further more, to encourage private investment unnecessary controls and regulations are being removed from the economy. Immediately on assumption of power and seeking guidance from Peoples Party's manifesto, the present Government started implementation of a strategy for recovery of the country's economy which should help in solving all the problems. Instead to seeking cheap popularity, the Government wants the country to move into 21st century honourably through revolutionary, political social and economic reforms. Economic policy of the present Government is based on the following principles: (a) Macro-economic stability and reduction in inflation. (b) consistent increase in the GDP. (c) Development of social sector, human resource development, increase in productivity, and elimination of un-employment. (d) Growth of energy and physical sectors. (e) Establishment of free and open economy and defining of a new public and private sector partnership. (a) Economic Stability: For macro-economic stability, it is absolutely essential that budget deficit should be reduced to a level which should be consistent with the target of low inflation and ability to service debt. Consequently monetary expansion should be in line with the targets for growth rate of GDP and price stability. The third element which is no less in importance relates to international balance of payments. This should be kept at appropriate level which should not adversely affect the desirable level of foreign exchange reserves. In other words we want to establish such a balance for monetary fiscal and foreign trade politics which could help in the growth domestic production, control inflation and provide a balance between the two components of the economy viz. domestic and external. (b) Increasing growth in GDP: An increase in the gross domestic product is un-avoidably for improving the standard of living. Fundamental objective of our policy is to ensure a minimum 7 per cent per annum growth of GDP in the future. It is possible only if both agriculture and industry grow adequately. Therefore, we are proposing a pricing policy along with monetary structure which should make it possible to improve performance of these sectors and provide for significant increase in productivity. (c) Development of Social Sectors and Elimination of Unemployment: Compared to other developing countries, our literacy rate is very low. Due to in-adequate health facilities the average age longevity is also low. Pakistan has achieved significant GDP growth rates but in the human resource development indicators it stands at 120th position amongst the countries of world. Unless we make significant improvement in this, we cannot ensure continuous and durable progress for the people. Therefore, an important element of our strategy is to remove economic and social disparities as quickly as possible. Besides our Manifesto the history and character of the People's party demands this of us. (d) development of Energy and Physical Infrastructure: 11. [number as published] In view of low priority given to these sectors in development plans their present growth rate is far less than the requirement. Growth of agriculture and industrial sectors is dependent on the provision of these basic facilities. A proper pricing policy and proper Fiscal and Monetary investments are necessary for the growth of these sectors. (e) Establishment of open and free economy and defining of a new public and private partnership: 12. Our government believes in a free and open economy. We want to encourage free market policies. We are against control and regulations. We emphasise dis-investment and privatisation of public sectors since we originally introduced this policy. Corner stone of our policy is to encourage domestic and foreign investors. We have introduced a new concept of public and private partnership. Under this the private sector in partnership with the Government has to play a more effective role in social sector and establishing labour intensive small industries. It is also our policy that private sector has to devise such economic policies which should provide guidance and encouragement to the private sector. Basically public sector has to provide national defence and ensure law and order. 13. During eight months of the present government much has been achieved. - By 31st March, 1994 bank borrowing for budget deficit has been contained to only Rs 10.34 billion. During the same period last year the bank borrowing was Rs 61.87 billion. - Domestic credit expansion was kept at 5.3 per cent as against 19.6 per cent during the previous year. 14. A new policy has been introduced for Agriculture Sector under which support prices for major crops have been adequately increased. Recent increase in the support price of wheat is a part of this policy. To increase the pace of foreign investment and industrial growth an Investment Board under the Prime Minister has been established. National Investment Council, Pakistan Investment Board and Investment Promotion Bureau have been merged into this new Board. A Data Bank will be established under this board which will Provide basic information for investment to the domestic and foreign investors. A new Privatisation Policy has been formulated and its process has been made more transparent and quicker. Thirty one industrial units have been identified for privatisation and some have already been sold. 15. Declining trend in production has been contained. There has been a record production of Rice and Sugarcane. Similarly Sugar and Nitrogenous Fertilizer Industries have achieved record production levels. However, with fall in Cotton production and its negative impact on Textile Industry, and the fall in Wheat production due to drought have affected the growth rate of GDP to some extent. During the current financial year considerable increase has been achieved in the production capacity of some important industries, like Textile, Chemical Fertilizer, cement and Sugar. Nevertheless GDP has grown by 4 per cent during the current year as against 2.3 per cent achieved during the preceding year. Increase in agriculture production in estimated at 2.6 per cent whereas it had recorded a fall of 5.3 per cent during the preceding year. Overall industrial growth has increased by 5.6 per cent which is higher than the preceding year. Trade Deficit in the balance of payments has been reduced by 35.3 per cent up to April, 1994. This was made possible by lower imports as compared to exports. 16. During the period July-December in the current financial year disbursement of industrial credit increased by 17 per cent. Foreign investment up to 30th March, 1994 stood at $417.2 million which is 58.1 per cent higher than $263.9 million for the same period during the preceding year. 17. During the first four months there as tremendous pressure on consumer prices on account of expansionary monetary and fiscal policies of the past, increase in taxes in the Budget 1993-94, increase in Petroleum and Cement and Gas prices and depreciation of the Rupee. Price Index for 20 consumer items increased by 5.5 per cent during July-October. The present Government introduced discipline in monetary and fiscal polices. Import duties were adjusted to keep the domestic supply of essential commodities at an appropriate level. Network of Utility Stores was made more effective and Utility During Stores were established. We expect the prices to stabilise as a result of Fiscal and Monetary stability. 18. Comparatively low growth in our social sectors has been caused by low literacy rate and falling educational standards. Our Government has decided to increase the allocation for education from 2.4 per cent of GDP to 3 per cent of GDP within the next ten years. In addition an Advisory Council has been established to introduce reforms in the Education Sector. Steps are in hand to provide incentives to the private sector in the Education Sector. A fifteen months' training programme for 10,000 un-trained and un-employed female teachers has been started from February, 1994. This will cost Rs 25 million. 19. An integrated and large Social Action Programme [SAP] was implemented in 1992-93. We have expanded this programme. Under this, expansion will be undertaken of all facilities in the rural areas, for female education, primary education, basic health, nutrition levels, population welfare, clean drinking water supply and drainage. Under The Social Action Programme - Training of 10,000 Primary Teachers will be organised. - 33000 Female Health workers will be trained to that birth and infant mortality rates can be reduced. - Facilities of technical training of 50,000 persons will be provided. - 600,000 persons have been provided employment during 1993-94. 20. For the development of general health services 102 Basic Health Units [BHU's] and 21 Rural Health Centres [RHC's] were established during the current financial year while 2206 beds were added in the Hospitals. In the Health Sector, Additional 3426 Doctors, beds were added in the Hospital. [sentence as published] In the Health Sector, additional 3426 Doctors, 250 Dental Doctors, 1890 Nurses, 6800 TBAs [expansion unknown] and 4900 Paramedics were trained. 21. We are giving special attention to the welfare of Women. Our last government established the First Women Bank. Now we have started a programme for separate police stations for Women. Women have been appointed judges during the current year. Ministry of Women Development have provided Rs 48 million to First Women Bank so that women can be provided loans for income generating projects at 10 per cent mark-up. 22. A new policy at a cost of Rs 700 billion has been announced for increased availability of energy. Besides the public sector, private sector particularly Overseas Pakistanis will be asked to assist in this effort. The present Government have started many major projects. Most important project amongst them is Ghazi Brotha Hydel Project. This project has a production capacity of 1425 MW [megawatts] and will be completed by the year 2000. This project has already been approved. The second major project is the Hub Power Project. This project is in the Thermal Power sector and the entire investment is being provided by the private sector. This project will be completed in 1996 at a cost of $1820 million. Its production capacity is 1292 MW. Besides this a new policy package for the private sector participation in the Electric Power Sector was announced in March, 1994. Import elements of this policy package include product purchase price at internationally competitive rates, soft terms for credit in the local currency and simplification of procedures. It has also been decided that in future the Government will only invest in Hydel Power Sector and Thermal Power Sector will be fully reserved for private investment. In this connection domestic and foreign investors including Overseas Pakistanis investors will be provided same incentives. 23. We have provided full legal and operational autonomy to the State Bank of Pakistan. Credit system and mark up structure is being reformed to encourage savings. New financial institutions for special purpose like Kisan Banking Windows in public sector and Kisan Bank Scheme in private sector, are being established. I am happy to announce that Kisan Bank Scheme will be introduced from 1st July, 1994 and Kisan Banking Windows will be open for business in the entire country. Lending procedure will be appropriately devised to enable us to move forward to meet the requirements of small farmers. This will lead to growth in the agriculture sector. Separate allocation will be made for Kisan Banking Windows. 24. Reform of taxation system is absolutely essential. Without this objective of economic stability cannot be achieved. For this purpose measures will be taken which will bring about appropriate elasticity in the taxes. Taxes will be reduced on production and investment and transferred to consumption. I will be elaborating this later on. 25. Capital market has not fully developed in our country. We are intruding reforms to improve its performance. Foreign nationals and overseas Pakistanis have already been permitted to invest on a repatriable basis in corporate debt instruments. As a further step, trust money and employers provident funds are now being allowed to be invested in all listed securities as well as bonds, redeemable capital and instruments issued by the Water and Power Development Authority [WAPDA]. The Companies Ordinance and the Trust Act are being amended accordingly for this purpose through the Finance Bill. Moreover, Foreign Exchange Bonds will be floated in the International Market and our Stock Exchanges will be linked with major Stock Exchanges of the world. 26. We have devised an integrated and clear strategy to enable us to begin the new year with fresh determination and hopes. While increasing the pace of growth we will also rectify our weakness and mistakes which have destabilised our economy. Important requirements of our strategy are as follows: (i) To re-invigorate the pace of economic growth and increase the rate of GDP growth from 4 per cent to 6.9 per cent. Major contribution for this growth will be provided by Agriculture and Industries Sector with a growth rates of 8 per cent and 7 per cent respectively for which necessary policies are being formulated. (ii) The second element of our strategy is the establishment of Fiscal and Monetary stability. We are reducing overall fiscal deficit to less than 6 per cent in 1993-94 as compared to 7.9 per cent in 1992-93. This will be further reduced during the next year. I will be giving the details later on. Monetary expansion which had reached 18 per cent in 1992-93 has been reduced to 14.1 per cent in 1993-94 and will be further reduced to 11.8 per cent next year. This will not only have a positive impact on inflation but also bring about fiscal stability. We will maintain the current year's rising trend in Foreign Exchange Reserves and further strengthen it by a 19 per cent increase in Exports. (iii) Rate of growth of infrastructure has been less than increasing demand. Consequently we are facing loadshedding and other problems. A fast increase in energy, water, communications and other infrastructure is important component of our strategy. Higher allocations have been made for these sectors in the PSDP [Public Sector Development Program] for the next year. Private sector is also being provided incentives and facilities so that they can invest in these sectors. (iv) Social Sectors have suffered from lack of attention and increase in population has made the matters worse. In this connection many actions have been taken which will be further strengthened during the next year. 27. In addition, on the direction of the Prime Minister, a programme to provide 33000 Village Health Workers has been started who will help in providing better health services to women and children in rural areas. These Female workers come from the areas where the Basic Health Units are located. Mr Speaker: 28. The size of budgeted PSDP for the next financial year has been fixed at Rs 90 billion which is 20 per cent higher than last year. Our Government had wished to increase it further but due to resource constraints and requirement of fiscal discipline it was not possible. Our effort is that this development programme may be further strengthened for which public sector agencies like WAPDA, PAO [expansion unknown], PTC [Pakistan Television Corporation], and OGRC [expansion unknown] may further invest with their own resources to carry our development activities in their respective field. Important feature of the PSDP are as follows: (i) Allocations for educational training has been increased by 45.2 per cent. (ii) Funds for health sector has been increased by 191.3 per cent. (iii) Rs 10 billion have been allocated to the Provinces for SAP which is an increase of Rs 1.2 billion over the last year. Besides this, Federal agencies are being provided Rs 2 billion of this programme. (iv) Development budget for science and technology has been increased by 97.9 per cent. (v) 64.5 per cent increase has been provided to the allocations for Women's Development. (vi) Adequate allocations have been made to different development schemes including Chashma Nuclear Project, Water Resource Projects, Anti-Waterlogging and Salinity Projects, Sainkdak Copper Project and Water Supply Schemes. (vii) Rs 3 billion have been provided for Peoples Programme. (viii) Allocation for Tameer-e-Sindh Programme have been raised from Rs 1.5 billion to Rs 2.5 billion. (ix) Rs 3.6 billion have been provided for LBOD [expansion unknown] and Rs 0.5 billion for RBOD [expansion unknown]. 29. Irrigation water supply which was 127 MAF [expansion unknown] in 1993-94 will be increased to 130 MAF in 1994-95. Out of this 81 MAF in be provided from be On-going Irrigation Schemes including Canal Rehabilitation Scheme and the remaining 49 MAF will be provided by new tube wells from the ground water resource by SCARP [Salinity Control and Reclamation Project] and private sector. - Approximately one hundred thousand hectare affected land will be saved from water logging and salinity by installing 804 SCARP tube wells and more than 6000 private sector tube wells. Left and right bank outfall Drains, Punjnad, Abbasia, Ford Wah Sadiqua, Swabi SCARP and many other projects are included in this programme. - First two phases of Chashma Canal Bank Project have been completed and the third phase will be expedited. - Pat Feeder Canal Project which is under implementation satisfactorily has been provided large allocation. - A number of Irrigation System Rehabilitation Schemes will be completed in the next year. This includes renovation of 3435 water channels, land levelling of 19486 hectare and establishment of Demonstration Centres. The expenditure on these schemes is estimated at Rs 1068.5 million. 30. In the Power Sector 6097 villages will be provided power during the next financial year. 570,000 new electric connections will be made available. Ghazi Brotha Project will also be started next year. It is expected the crude oil production will be 56000 barrel per day whereas natural gas production will rise to 1954 million cft [expansion unknown] per day. Forty five (45) new oil and gas wells will be dug in the public and private sectors and gas supply will be extended to additional 41 towns. 31. Work for modernization of Railways will be continued. Eighteen (18) new Engines will be purchased while 46 Diesel Electric Engines will be recommissioned. Better facilities will be provided for passengers. 32. In the Communications Sector, two hundred thousand telephone lines will be laid. The old Gateway Exchange at Karachi will be replaced with a new exchange and Islamabad will be provided with another Gateway Exchange. Eighty five thousands (85000) old EMS [expansion unknown] lines will be changed into digital exchanges. Stations will be established at 85 different places for consumers and 36 new cities and towns will be linked with NWD [expansion unknown] facilities. 33. To overcome the water scarcity in Islamabad, it has been decided to increase to pace of work on Khanpur Dam to Islamabad Water Supply Pipelines by providing Government resources. Water supply to Islamabad from Simly Dam will also be continued. Moreover, a project for installing new tube wells has also been approved. 34. Provision of basic health services will be continued in the Health Sector particularly disease prevention and control measures and nutritional scheme will be continued in the rural areas. Twenty four (24) new Basic Health Units and 6 new Rural Health Centres will be established while 557 BHUs and 81 RHCs will be upgraded. Ninety one (91) new Urban Rural Centres will be established. In addition 3460 Doctors, 250 Dentists, 3600 Nurses, 9700 paramedics, 33000 Village Health Workers, 3740 TBAs will be employed by the Health Department after completing training. 35. 3.92 million infant children cover will be provided under the EPI [expansion unknown] during the next financial year. The Prime Minister in this respect has inaugurated a new campaign on 27th April, 94. 36. Special allocations have been made for population control measures. Besides this a Population Day will be organised on 11th July, 1994 to highlight the different aspects of the problems and people may be encouraged for Population Welfare. Socio-Economic Package for Karachi 37. Karachi is the nerve centre of industrial and commercial activities in the country and it makes as sizeable contribution to the overall economic growth. The development of civic amenities has not received proper attention in the past. In order to improve the situation, the Government has announced a comprehensive package for the socio-economic improvement of the city. This package will cost Rupees 121 billion and it will primarily address problems on account of the shortage of electrical power, water and mass transit. In the energy sector, the power availability in Karahci would be enhanced from 1700 MW to 4000 MW at a total Cost of Rs 88 billion. In addition, the rehabilitation of KESC's [Karachi Electric Supply Corporation] transmission and distribution system will also be undertaken at a cost of Rs 6.2 billion. Further, a desalination plant will be set up which would provide an additional 10 million gallon of potable water per day at a projected cost of US $1.2 billion with foreign funding. For better transportation, the project for providing mass transit system for Karachi would be undertaken on priority basis. Eighth Five Year Plan Mr Speaker: 38. From next year, macro-economic targets at the major elements of our integrated medium term plan. Our Government has recently approved the Eighth Five Year Plan in the light of our priorities and manifesto. Total outlay of this plan in 1992-93 prices is Rs 1701 billion which is 48 per cent higher than 7th Five Year Plan. Rs 752 billion have been provided for the public sector and Rs 949 billion have been kept for private sector. Under the plan, target for GDP growth is 7 per cent consisting of 4.9 per cent for agriculture, 9.9 per cent industry and 6.7 per cent for services. The Plan gives priority to social sectors, physical infrastructure and development of energy and water resources. Attainment of macro-economic stability has been emphasised. Accordingly, fiscal deficit will be reduced from 7.9 per cent of GDP to 4 per cent of GDP. Current account deficit in the balance of payment will be reduced from 7 per cent of GDP to 2.4 per cent of GDP. Furthermore the Plan aims at limiting the long-term foreign debt to 36 per cent of the GDP and monetary expansion has been kept at below nominal growth rate in current prices of GDP so that inflation can be reduced from 10.6 per cent to 6 per cent. National savings will be increased from 15.8 per cent to 19.9 per cent of national income. Under the Plan 6.2 million new employment opportunities will be created besides that domestic debt will be reduced. As stated earlier legislation will be undertaken to limit the budgetary deficit. Special programmes for Social Welfare 39. Rs 50 million were provided for the welfare of minorities, reconstruction and development of their religious places and the needy under the Minorities Affairs Division. Another Rs 50 million are provided in the next year. Moreover, the Minority Members of the Assembly were provided Rs 5 million for educational scholarships for the students of minority community. Another Rs 5 million have been provided for this purpose during the next financial year. 4886 widows benefited from the loan remission policy for HBFC [House Building Finance Corporation] loans. In the new budget Rs 20 million under this policy have been kept for HBFC. Zakat and Ushr 40. The Government has taken many steps to improve the working of Zakat and Ushr [Islamic Tithe and Agricultural Tax System] system so that their operations are transparent and accountability of administration for indiscipline can be made certain. During the current financial year approximately 1.1 million widows, orphans and handicapped persons were provided Rs 1440 million. In addition Rs 960 million were provided for scholarships, medical treatment, technical and religious education through schools, hospitals, religious maddrassas [schools] and social welfare organisations. Mustehikeen [those eligible to receive Zakat and Ushr assistance] of Northern Areas are also being provided assistance. A target of Rs 2.5 billion has been kept for assistance from the Central Zakat Fund for the next financial year. Improved collection system under Ushr will provide additional resources. The Government has provided Rs 1 billion during the next financial year for new agricultural loans and interest free agricultural loans for Haris of Kacha lands in Sindh. These loans will be provided through Agricultural Development Bank, Federal Bank for Cooperatives and Commercial Banks. 41. The former Government had kept no provision for Baitul Mal [public welfare fund] in the Budget. We have provided Rs 1.02 billion in the next financial year for Baitul Mal Fund for assistance to the poor and needy. This is a reflection of the Prime Minister's deep concern for the welfare of the needy persons of the society. Debt Burden 42. The Peoples Government wishes to take the nation into confidence about our alarming debt burden. Past Government's particularly that of Nawaz League did not meet their expenditure by raising adequate revenues. They did not keep a balance between income and expenditure. 43. They borrowed more in three years that all governments from Quaid-e-Azam to the last Peoples Government. They chose to borrow, and borrow heavily, and borrow expensively. This unforgivable mismanagement sin increased our debt to such a high level that Government's expenditure on payment of interest on this debt is threatening the whole fiscal system. This problem can be better viewed in a historical perspective. 44. When the first PPP [Pakistan People's Party] Government of Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto took over debt servicing was 3 per cent of GDP. The PPP Government brought it down by 1976-77 to 2.7 per cent of the GDP. Then came the Zia years. By the time the second PPP Government was sworn, in debt servicing had risen to 6 per cent of the GDP. Then came Nawaz League. By 1993-94 the estimate was 8.15 per cent GDP. This alarming growth of debt cannot continue. If it does, the government will have to tax people heavily every year only to meet its obligations towards debt servicing. The choice before us is either adhocism or long-term solution. We can borrow heavily to pay our debts and thus compound the problem for the future. Or we can raise enough revenues to meet expenditure. We are thinking of the future. The future of our children. Of our coming generations. Therefore, we have chosen the second course, because we do not believe in cheap popularity. We believe in lasting recognition and redemption in the eyes of those who voted us in -- the poor and oppressed, the middle classes and working classes whose standard of living has continued to deteriorate. Today, we adopt policies for long-term stability of the economy so that Pakistan grows strong. Mr Speaker Sir: 45. I will now take up the Budget Estimates. Revenue receipts were initially estimated at Rs 217 billion in the Budget Estimates for the current financial year. The Revised Estimates stand at Rs 211 billion. This reduction is due to 12 per cent fall in the imports. The initial estimates for current expenditure were Rs 258 billion. The Revised Estimates now stand at Rs 272 billion. The increase is due to ad-hoc Relief for Government servants and debt servicing. 46. Net capital receipts were estimated at Rs 40 billion. This estimate is being maintained. 47. Overall fiscal deficit was estimated at Rs 85 billion which was to be financed by Rs 23 billion from external resources, Rs 49 billion from non-bank borrowing and Rs 13 billion from bank borrowing. According to revised estimates overall fiscal deficit will be Rs 91 billion while bank borrowing will be limited to Rs 20 billion. 48. National Economic Council has fixed 4 per cent as the target for overall fiscal deficit. The limit for bank borrowing for the budget had been fixed at Rs 15 billion. In view of these targets receipt and expenditure estimates for the next financial year are proposed as follows: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |(i) Revenue Receipts |Rs 238 Billion | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |(ii) Current Expenditure |Rs 295 Billion | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |(iii) Public Sector Development Progr-|Rs 90 Billion | |am | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |(iv) Self-Generation |Rs 10 Billion | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |(v) Overall Fiscal Deficit (at 4 per |Rs 72 Billion | |cent of GDP) | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |(vi) Net External Resources |Rs 31 Billion | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |(vii) Non-Bank Borrowing |Rs 26 Billion | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |(viii) Bank Borrowing |Rs 15 Billion | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |(ix) Resource Gap |Rs 30 Billion | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
