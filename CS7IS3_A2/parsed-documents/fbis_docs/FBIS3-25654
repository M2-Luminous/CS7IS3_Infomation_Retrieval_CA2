Police spokesman Maj Bala Naidoo confirmed one man had been arrested and two were being questioned in connection with Saturday morning's attack on a group preparing for a voter education workshop. One was due to appear in Ixopo Magistrate's Court on Thursday afternoon, police said. In a statement, the IFP condemned "the arrest of three prominent IFP leaders", describing the police action as a "transparent attempt to placate the African National Congress leadership". The arrests were a "cynical political ploy by the South African Police's [SAP] Gen Johan Meintjies (Natal's CID [Criminal Investigation Division] chief) to appease the ANC and take the pressure off the SAP". "This token action by the SAP not only poses a grave threat to the IFP in the region but also has important political implications given other actions by the SAP in this area against the IFP and its leadership," it said. The three leaders had repeatedly been harassed by an SAP unit based in Port Shepstone, the IFP claimed. "The IFP calls for the release or charging of its leaders and the immediate replacement of the head of the investigation team responsible for this absurd action." ANC Midlands Secretary Sifiso Nkabinde said he was pleased with the arrests: "The whole world is now going to see who is behind these massacres." Police spokesman Maj Bala Naidoo said the matter now lay with the court.
