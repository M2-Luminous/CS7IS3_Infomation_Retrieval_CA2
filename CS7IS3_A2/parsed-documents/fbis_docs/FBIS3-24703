The victims were shot as they tried to disarm the police, who were firing in the air to scare away the mob. According to the police commander in Iganga, over 800 stick-wielding and stone-throwing taxpayers converged on Nambale Police post to demolish it and get hold of the subcounty chief of Nambale, whom they thought had taken refuge there. They accused him the chief of overassessing them. Meanwhile 77 rioters who were arrested from the subcounties of Nabitende, Nambale and (Namungabe) have appeared in the court, charged with inciting people against payment of tax. Twenty of them pleaded guilty and were sentenced to 12 months imprisonment. Those who denied the charge were remanded. Agitation against payment of the graduated tax started last Monday [24 January] in Nabitende Subcounty and later spread to Nambale, (Namungabe), and later to (Ivukwa) and Bulange in Busika County, also Bukoma in Luka County and (Namulemba) in Bugweri County.
