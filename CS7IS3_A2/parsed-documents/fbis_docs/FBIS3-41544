The sources said all 106 cities and counties of the province have met their afforestation tasks two years ahead of the official completion date. In the past eight years since the launch of a ten-year afforestation program, the province has set up thousands of fruit, bamboo and tea plantations, plus large areas of timber forests. In 1987, Guangdong had accumulated more timber reserves than it had to consume. Successful afforestation work has also brought a boom in industrial development in many fields. The official said the province's annual income from fruit and other forest products exceeds 400 million U.S. dollars.
