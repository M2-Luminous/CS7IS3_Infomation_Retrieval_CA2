This is the first Moscow visit of an Israeli premier. Yitzhaq Rabin noted the role of the Soviet Union in creation of the Israeli state, including military support without which, in the words of Rabin, Israel would hardly complete the war for independence with a success. Then, there was 40-years-long absence of any relations between the two states. Rabin said the current Russian policy aims to achieve peace in the Middle East and other world regions. Russia, same as the United States, may play a positive encouraging role in making Arabs and Israelis to put an end to violence, terror and war, said Rabin. At the same time, neither co-sponsor can substitute parties to the conflict or stop the conflict and bring peace to the region on its own. Speaking of the Russian-Israeli relations, the prime minister said the Moscow negotiations resulted in signing of six agreements. On Wednesday the sides are expected to sign the most important document -- on the free trade zone. These documents will be a good basis for the development of bilateral cooperation in agriculture, science, tourism and other spheres, stressed the official. The Moscow negotiations also discussed a possibility to establish broader relations and more close contact between the two defence systems. He said the sides will work for positive changes in relations of giant Russia and small, but proud and independent Israel. This will be a new start for the development of good relations between the two states. Yitzhaq Rabin thinks these relations will be even better under new conditions. The Israeli Government head stressed he does not agree with the idea to convene the 2nd Madrid conference and thinks bilateral negotiations of Israel and its Arab opponents would do better. He hopes that the Cairo negotiations with Palestinians will result in an agreement to be implemented in a short period. This will create a new reality and enable Palestinians to regulate their life themselves. It is not a complete autonomy, but the one without any damage to Israel, said Rabin. Speaking of the reasons for delayed implementation of the Gaza-Jericho agreement, the official said they are unforeseen circumstances. The dates were changed because a corresponding agreement was not achieved, he said. The Israeli prime minister sharply criticized the fundamentalist radical groups of Hamas and al-Jihad al-Islam which orient at "Khomeynism without Khomeyni". Their aim is to torpedo the peace process, stressed the Israeli official. The only possible response is boosted negotiations and achievement of a viable agreement with due account of the sides' interests. Rabin called against the deployment of international forces from the U.S. And Russia in the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area. He said the co-sponsors should not risk the life of their citizens at this stage. In the opinion of Yitzhaq Rabin, peace in the Middle East can be achieved on condition of peace between Arabs and Israel and control over actions of Iran, which is striving to blast the regional situation. Speaking of the Russian relations with Arab states, the prime minister stressed they should be considered from the point of view of their influence on the peace process. Rabin reaffirmed the Israeli readiness to withdraw troops from Syrian Golan Heights, that is the most painful compromises in exchange for peace. At the same time, geographic scale of the withdrawal will depend on how profound the peace agreements would be, he said. Rabin denied Israel and Lebanon have a territorial dispute. When the Lebanese Government provide for security of the Israeli northern borders from encroachments of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah group, Israel will be ready to liquidate this safety zone on the south of the neighbouring state, he said. Tomorrow morning the prime minister will complete the official part of his visit and leave for St. Petersburg.
