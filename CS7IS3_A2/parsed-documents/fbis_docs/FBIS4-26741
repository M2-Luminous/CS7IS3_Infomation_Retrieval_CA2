With the enforcement of the "Company Law," the direction of China's enterprise reform will shift from a mere granting of more power to enterprises to that of a systematic change, or to establishing a modern enterprise system. Straightening out property rights relationships and defining the corporate property rights of enterprises are at the center of this system. The corporate system will be adopted as the major form of promoting the system. To achieve that end, the company registration system will make a break with the former ownership registration system; instead it will emphasize enterprise property. For instance, registered capital (fund provider uses this to undertake company's limited liability) will replace registered funds (no stipulation on undertaking what kind of responsibility toward the company) to reflect in a timely manner corporate property rights. The new system will merge operational methods and scopes into one and term them operational scope to realize the granting of autonomous operation rights to enterprises. Starting from the day of the implementation of the "Company Law," and excluding stipulations provided for separately in the state laws and administrative regulations, the fund provider shall directly apply for registration with the administrative organs for industry and commerce; thus scrapping the examination and approval by competent administrative departments. Local laws and provisions, administrative rules, and other documents relating to trade and commerce management departments' special examination and approval will cease to be the prerequisite conditions for registration. Cao Tiandian said the State Council will soon promulgate "Regulations on Management of Enterprise Registration of the People's Republic of China." The "regulations," he said, will provide specific stipulations to the principles set down in the "Company Law." He added that the pace of drafting a number of documents to complement the "Company Law" has been accelerated.
