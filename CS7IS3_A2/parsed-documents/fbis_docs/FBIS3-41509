According to Roch Marc Christian Kabore, minister of state in charge of finance and planning, the aim of the meeting was to exchange views with partners on the environmental action plan as well as to improve consultations and coordination with cooperation partners for better implementation of the plan. He said the meeting was also intended to make the international community aware of government efforts to establish and implement the national action plan. However, the major objective of the meeting was to mobilize funds for the plan and to serve as a reminder that natural resources are exhaustible and therefore need protection.
