Approximately 500 jobs will disappear at the level of administrative staff and management. The total staff cuts affecting 1,900 jobs are necessary because the company's aircraft production is being reduced from 56 to 40 machines. The measure is a result of the lingering, worldwide recession in the aviation sector. According to the company's acting CEO [chief executive officer], R.J. van Duinen, the manufacturer probably will have to make even deeper cuts next year if the current rate of production is maintained. "Fokker is doing relatively well, because our market share is growing. However, the self-same market has almost totally collapsed," said van Duinen, in an attempt to explain the measures. Yesterday morning the staff reacted indignantly, and yet stoically, to the announcement that further rationalization is in the pipeline. "First of all we want to see what Fokker's restructuring plan is based on, and how the management intends to limit the number of forced job losses," said P. van Bers and G. van den Heuvel, of the trade unions FNV [Netherlands Trade Unions Federation] and CNV [National Federation of Christian Workers]. G. Melchers, the secretary of the COR [Central Enterprise Council], reacted with shock: "We knew that something was in the cards, but we had not counted on such a high number." According to the financial expert on the board of directors, R.F. Hendriksen, the company anticipates a turnaround that will drag it out of the red occurring only in 1996. However, this is by no means certain, he wisely let it be known. Development According to van Duinen, the future for Fokker as a "self-creating aircraft industry" is not in danger. "The restructuring will have a tremendous draining effect. However, we shall be proceeding at full speed with product developments -- like the new Fokker 70 -- that we have already set in motion. Our excellent products have a future. That is why we are doing better than our competitors. However, the fact remains that, for a company of this size, we are not making enough sales."
