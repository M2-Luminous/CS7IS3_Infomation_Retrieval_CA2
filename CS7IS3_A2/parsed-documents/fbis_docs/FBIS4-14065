Is that the reason, and are there no ideological and political dimensions to this conflict? [Gailani] Actually the main reason for this war is the power struggle. The Hezb-e Eslami led by Hekmatyar says that it wants a democratic government based on direct free elections, and that it is opposed to the regime of President Borhanoddin Rabbani, because the latter is seeking to monopolize power for himself, his party, and allies by military force. For our part, we wanted a democratic system based on free elections and the establishment of a democratic parliament whose task is to elect the head of state. But regrettably, the idea of referring to influential people, announced by Rabbani initially, began to be stripped of its content, hence illegal, and undemocratic practices began to take place. This is why we refused to recognize this reality or to participate in the shura council which was formed by unsound means. What we are seeking is to hold elections under the supervision of the United Nations and the Islamic Conference Organization, in order to elect a legal council that really represents the Afghan people. [passage omitted] [Qallab] Rabbani says he is prepared to hold a dialogue with Hekmatyar or any other faction but cannot hold a dialogue with Abdol Rashid Dostam and Babrak Karmal, who is now in Mazar-e Sharif, because they represent a communist front. What is your opinion? [Gailani] We are against communism, and we have fought it. But there is a unanimous decision to accept General Abdol Rashid Dostam among mojahedin ranks and to consider him a mojahed, as he rebelled against the communist regime. It is wrong now to say that he is a communist and thus no dialogue cannot be held with him. [Qallab] But Dostam is allied with Babrak Karmal and the other leaders of the communist regime. [Gailani] That is what Rabbani says, but it is absolutely untrue. [passage omitted] [Qallab] If Rabbani's term ends without achieving a solution acceptable to most parties, a vacuum will occur and the country will be plunged into chaos and destruction. Do you have any alternatives? [Gailani] We want to hold general elections on the basis of which to form a new legislative council and new government before the end of Rabbani's term. [Qallab] These are your aspirations, but the reality on the ground is different. There are numerous armies and states. [Gailani] All these armies could be merged into one national army. [Qallab] Do you not believe that a disagreement would emerge over the allocation of posts? [Gailani] No, they would not disagree at all, especially if a neutral government is elected. I point out here that Rabbani has expressed willingness to comply if a neutral government is elected. [passage omitted] [Qallab] Do you agree with the view that some Islamic and Arab states do not want an Islamic state in Afghanistan for fear that such a state could become a seat of world tension in the future? [Gailani] No, I do not agree with that view. I say that we want a moderate government, willing to coexist with neighboring states and all world states. [Qallab] But Rabbani, to whom you are opposed now, is the most moderate person, compared with Hekmatyar. [Gailani] The two are from the same school; there is no difference between them at all. [Qallab] The Arab region, especially Egypt and Algeria, has suffered from the "Afghan Arabs" phenomenon. Which factions support them? [Gailani] There are "Afghan Arabs" and there are organizations offering them camps and support. There are also Arab states guiding them against other Arab states. But we as Afghans reject that and want a moderate government that cooperates with all. [Qallab] We heard some people say that the solution in Afghanistan lies in the return of the monarchy and King Zahir Shah. What is your opinion? [Gailani] I respect King Zahir Shah. But I want any decision to be made by the Afghan people, whether with regard to the return of the monarchy or anything else. [passage omitted]
