Experience from wars indicates that a military situation cannot be decided solely by air power. Especially not when the military operation is limited to one or two bombs that happen to be dropped a day. We also know from Hungarian history that a bit of bombing like this only helps the bombed side find an excuse to do something that it had not dared do before; however, it is not suitable for changing the existing intentions. The still unclear bombing [in 1942] of Kassa [Kosice, now in Slovakia] was an excellent opportunity for the Hungarian Government to declare war on the Soviet Union. One year later, when the British destroyed the Zilahy house on the Rose Hill [district in Budapest] with bombs, one thought that Budapest would quit the war -- perhaps this was not the goal of the Brits anyway. In addition to this, precisely at this time, the Germans were marching an apparent irresistible force across the Russian steppe. However, the English bombing was very good for creating an Anglo-Saxon enemy image in Hungary. When the United Nations, in the shape of NATO, began the aerial attacks on the Serbian artillery and tanks besieging the Bosnian towns, it was exactly two years late. A spectacular and shocking aerial attack would only have made sense, perhaps, at the very beginning of the Bosnian war. At that time, it might have been able to deter those who were eager to fight from the accidental unleashing of a war that many people had expected with absolute certainty. However, at that time, no UN resolutions or NATO preparations existed. It is also questionable whether the current aerial attacks have any military purpose. The liberation of Gorazde and the other "protected areas," and that the Serbs suspend the military maneuvers aimed at occupying these areas, could be such a goal. This has little chance. If this is known in Budapest, it is obviously known in Brussels, New York, Aviano, and in the field. In that case, why are they bombing? We can risk saying that there are many reasons, but that none of them have much to do with establishing peace in Bosnia. Teaching Karadzic and his followers a lesson may be a goal, because they have become far too "insolent." They had the audacity to launch an all-out attack on Gorazde when, after the decision on the Bosnian-Croatian federation in Bosnia and the confederation in Zagreb, it seemed that a prescription might be found for a peace system in the whole former Yugoslavia. Retaliation was needed for the disappointment. Perhaps it was also among the assumed that an effect would be that that the Serbs in Belgrade would give up their solidarity with their brethren in Bosnia. This did not happen. It is also possible that they also wanted to roast Moscow a little bit. Although its unrequested involvement in the ultimatum situation in Sarajevo indeed helped progress, since then, Kozyrev and Co. have been saying a trifle too often that Russia continues to be a superpower, a major power, that it cannot be excluded, and so on. Perhaps, it had to be shown that the earth can continue to move without it. Finally, the fact that the bombing at Gorazde was again a CNN spectacular cannot be ignored. The U.S. public recently again began to demand, more emphatically, that "we should at last do something definite" in Bosnia. On the morning of 10 April, the pictures of the determined action arrived in U.S. homes.
