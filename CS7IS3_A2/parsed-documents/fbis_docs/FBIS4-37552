We have a certain number of questions interesting those taking part in the forum and I would like to ask them. The first question concerns regional tensions centered around Iran. What will be the policy of the Islamic Republic toward the territories occupied by Kurdish people in Iraq and Turkey? Second, what do you think about the development of ethnic conflicts in the republics of the former Soviet Union, and what is the Islamic Republic's attitude concerning these conflicts? This is the first question summing up the various interventions from the participants to the forum. [Unidentified moderator] Your Excellency, Mr. President. My first question is regarding relations between Iran and its neighbors, in particular the territories in Iraq and Turkey inhabited by Kurds. The second question is on the policy of the Islamic Republic of Iran toward differences in the states of the former Soviet Union? [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] On Iran's neighbors. Our principled policy is to have peaceful and friendly cooperation with them. And should issues occur, the principle is to solve them through negotiation and debate. Regarding Iraq and Kordestan, naturally our declared policy is to respect Iraq's territorial integrity. Territorial integrity must be maintained. The Kurds in Turkey and Iraq will be members of these countries. However, it is of course possible in these countries to give them rights, as a nationality, with their own consent. Regarding the states which have separated from the former Soviet Union. Unfortunately, difference have occurred in some places. Our policy is to help them solve the differences. Our advice to others, even Russia, is not to interfere in these countries. In a country where people have been liberated after 70 years, it is natural to have various forms of demands and for differences to occur. Others should help solve the problems properly, not interfere, and not weaken the independence of the country. [Dumas] Thank you, Mr. President. If I may, I will ask two other questions -- one about an issue of great concerns to Europeans, namely Bosnia. As we all know, there are armed Muslims opposing Serbs in several regiosn of Bosnia, there is a war. How do you see Iran's role? What role can Iran play in this situation? Is it a purely diplomatic role? Could it be a support for these combatants taking the form of arms supplies? Or coudl we envisage a direct intervention? What is your country's position on this worrying Bosnian conflict? [Moderator] Your Excellency Mr. President. Thank you for the answers, and now I must ask another question. My first question is about Bosnia. As you know, a group of Muslims live in this country and are in conflict with the Serbs. What is the policy of the Islamic Republic of Iran regarding these Muslims? Does Iran have a purely political role or a role in providing arms to the Muslims? Are the other means of aid provided by the Islamic Republic a form of direct interference, or do they come under the category of ordinary aid? [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] Regarding Bosnia. Unfortunately, there has been a tragic situation there. The hands of the majority of the people of this country have been tied, but a minority, the Serbs, have been allowed to commit aggression. That is, they can have a direct link with the former Yugoslavia, which supports them. Our policy is to end the war, with the help of the United Nations and you, the powerful European countries and neighbors, and through peaceful ways and negotiations. If the war is to continue, despite the intentions and wishes of all sincere individuals, the present situation will have to change. If you, the United Nations and others, feel unable to end the war, you should allow the innocent party to have defensive capabilities. Of course, we have until now acted according to the UN policy. Our aid has been very clear. It was financial, fuel, and humanitarian. We proposed to send a peacekeeping force, because it has been said that the peacekeeping force there is weak. In the future we shall try to progress with the UN policy. But we firmly ask everyone to have a just policy. Do not allow the violation of a peoples' right. This would create a center of aggravation and disease in the Balkan region, and this would be difficult to cure in the future. [Moderator] Thank you, Mr. President for your reply. One of the gentlemen at the session wishes to ask you a question. [J.P. Carteron, not further identified, in French] Mr. President, I would like to ask you a very important question for us here. Iran's relations with France and Switzerland are not good. Serious court cases provoking a violent dispute are currently under way. Your deputy foreign Minister, Mahmoud Va'ezi, was recently received by French President Francois Mitterrand. This is obviously a gesture by both sides. Does this represent a coming together? At last, Mr. President, I would like you to tell us, how do you see the means to improve your relations with France and Switzerland on a very specific plan? [Moderator] Mr. President, my question is considered very important here. My question concerns France's and Switzerland's relations with Iran, which are not at all good. Recently Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister Va'ezi was in France, where he met Francois Mitterrand, and apparently some measures were taken. In your excellency's opinion, what are the significant factors contributing to the improvement of Iran's relations with France and Switzerland, and what suggestions can you make in that respect? [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] Very well. It is possible to speak in length about that, but our time is short here. I think if our friends in France try not to be influenced by the false propaganda which is waged against Iranian policies, then we can quite easily expand our cooperation. The political intent toward further cooperation exists in Iran. [passage omitted] [Dumas] Thank you, Mr. President. Could I ask you now a question about a worrying issue -- Algeria? As you know, the Islamic Salvation Front, the FIS, is openly fighting the authorities in Algeria. What attitude does Iran want and what attitude can it adopt concerning this situation? I sum up: Can Iran be a mere observer, a mediator, or is it actively supporting the FIS? [Moderator] Thank you, Your Excellency Mr. President. My other question is regarding Algeria. As you know, fundamentalist Muslims, the FIS [Islamic Salvation Front], are virtually at war with the Algerian Government. I would like to know, what is the policy of the Islamic Republic here? Has there only been advice or has there been help by the Islamic Republic for these groups? [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] The Algerian issue must be important for you, as well. An unfortunate event occurred in Algeria and the vote of a nation's majority was not respected. I think it must be one of the most bitter problems for the champions of democracy. We think the solution in Algeria lies in respect for people's vote. I think we have been blamed because we spoke our views frankly and without hesitation. There has been no other interference on our behalf in the Algerian issue. Our advice to you, as well as the people and Government of Algeria, is that we should come out of this. There is no other way except respect for people's vote. We are not at all happy with the destruction and the killings in this Muslim country. We are surprised that you, the champions of democracy, fail to see this very clear situation. I wish you would also answer this question of mine. [passage omitted]
