The minister denied that a guerrilla movement in response to the country's situation. He said the Americo Silva Guerrilla Front was the last rebel organization of its kind to exist in Venezuela since the sixties. The minister also expressed his satisfaction with the Front's decision to adopt a legal, democratic coexistence. Regarding the student disturbances of the past few days, Escobar Salom called on the protesters to reflect and to advocate change without disrupting peace and by preserving tranquillity. [Begin Escovar recording] I want to impress upon the various social sectors that violence is not going to improve this or any other problem. The government, therefore, while it favors this democratic dialogue, wants to emphasize to Venezuelan society the necessity of peaceful coexistence. That is the government's purpose, and it is also the government's purpose to strongly and firmly confront, as it is doing now, the disturbances, aggressions, and attacks on citizens' rights. The government must defend the rights of all citizens and cannot allow minority groups to attack the social peace and rights of others: the right to have property and the right to own or rent a vehicle, bus, or truck, as is the right of Venezuelan workers, so they can circulate freely and peacefully on the streets, avenues, or highways. [end recording] Minister Escovar Salom said the situation is totally under control and emphatically affirmed that the government will deal harshly and unhesitatingly to control these incidents, which in his opinion do not compromise the country's political or institutional stability. The truth of the matter is that the famous sinister force which Minister Escobar Salom accuses of being the main motor of the student disturbances has thus far not appeared and its whereabouts are unknown.
