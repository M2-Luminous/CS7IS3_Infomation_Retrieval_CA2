FR940325-2-00070 FR940325-2-00039 F. Grantee Share of Project Grantees must provide at least twenty (20) percent of the total approved cost of the project. The total approved cost of the project is the sum of the ACF share and the non-Federal share. The non-Federal share may be met by cash or in-kind contributions, although applicants are encouraged to meet their match requirements through cash contributions. The non-Federal share may include funds distributed to a tribe, including interest, by the Federal government: •Pursuant to the satisfaction of a claim made under Federal law; •From funds collected and administered on behalf of such tribe or its constituent members; or •For general tribal administration or tribal development under a formula or subject to a tribal budgeting priority system, such as, but not limited to, funds involved in the settlement of land or other judgment claims, severance or other royalty payments, or payments under the Indian Self-Determination Act (25 U.S.C. 450f et seq.) or tribal budget priority system. Therefore, a project requesting $300,000 in ACF funds (based on an award of $100,000 per budget period), must include a match of at least $75,000 (20% total project cost). An itemized budget detailing the applicant's non-Federal share, and its source, must be included in an application. Applications submitted as a partnership arrangement with a school, college, or university, may use contributions from the ``partner'' organization(s) to meet the non-Federal share, as appropriate. Applications originating from American Samoa, Guam, Palau, or the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands are covered under section 501(d) of Public Law 95&hyph;134, as amended (48 U.S.C. 1469a) under which HHS waives any requirement for local matching funds under $200,000 (including in-kind contributions).
