Also, the following saying by Yaritsu Sozai, a Mongolian premier in the 1200's, may teach us something: "You have to remove one harmful thing to gain an advantage. You have to stop doing one thing to start doing another thing." The present guidelines have the most serious defects in situation assessment and strategic ideas. Although they should be flexible and be adapted to circumstances, there are only fixed assessment and strategic ideas in Japan because of a rule that defense matters should be decided on by the cabinet. From the beginning, the situation assessment and strategic ideas have been merely nominal. A U.S. military expert once said: "Japan's defense program guidelines do not mention any strategies placing military importance on the north. Has Japan reviewed the guidelines?" Without answering the question, Japan steadily built a system to defend the northern part of Japan. By the mideighties, it gained confidence that it could repel foreign aggression in cooperation with the United States. At that time, no one paid attention to the idea demonstrated in the guidelines that Japan should repel an aggression on its own at the initial stage, and wait for U.S. help. Instead, an operational plan was formulated on the assumption that Japan and the United States jointly defend the nation against an attack by the Soviet Union. A clause in the guidelines says that Japan should maintain basic defense power in peacetime and should expand it when necessary. In actuality, however, nobody expects that the defense power will be expanded in accordance with this clause. Working-level officials all know that the thinking that there should be enough time to compile a new defense budget even when a crisis is imminent is far from realistic. They know that because this is the time all the world is seeking peace, it is impossible for Japan to expand its military power based on the defense program guidelines even if a crisis is imminent. In fact, the guidelines do not explain when the expansion is possible and what the procedures are. Also, both Japanese and U.S. Government defense officials are thinking only of defending Japan with the existing military strength. In this context, ideas demonstrated in the defense program guidelines are merely words. However, this has not caused actual harm. The only harm is the rule saying that the Cabinet should decide defense matters. This rule prevents the development of strategic ideas. Because there are not many strategists in Japan, this nation has to depend on working-level Defense Agency officials for defense ideas. However, the adoption of their ideas is limited because of the aforementioned rule, and this has caused incalculable harm. Although we Japanese waged the Pacific war, we did not learn strategies from it. We also failed to learn strategic ideas from the Cold War, although we fought it throughout. From now on, the government should try to avoid deciding on situation assessment and strategic ideas at the cabinet level. It is desirable that it allow changes in defense ideas and show the changes in annual defense white papers as other industrialized nations do. If the government needs to continue deciding on defense matters at the cabinet level, it should adopt realistic defense policies (as other countries do) in line with the Japanese-U.S. alliance, or it should adopt slogan-like policies which cite ideas in Article 9 of the Constitution and can be flexibly interpreted. Revising the table attached to the guidelines is the centerpiece of the review of the defense program guidelines. When the government revises the table, it should seek the counsel of experts, especially of working-level officers in the Self Defense Forces [SDF]. This is the most important. In that instance, the government, with high political judgment, should take two things into consideration. One is that after making sure the SDF officers' advice is not made based on the interests of each force, the government should come up with an all-around judgment for the nation and the security of the Japanese people. The other is that it should consider avoiding a situation in which Japan falls behind the progress in military technology and changes in defensive tactics as a result of its adherence to conventional ideas, such as a big-battleship-and-cannon-ism this nation once advocated. Since the Gulf war, military authorities in the world have opened their eyes wide to the power of advanced technology. Some countries have drastically reviewed their defense systems. Taking this into consideration, the SDF should also actively introduce advanced technology in their defense plans. They should not be satisfied with their already-high-level technology. Based on this idea, the government should calculate entire defense expenditures. It should not intend to cut the defense budget from the beginning. The argument that the defense budget should be cut "because the world is moving toward arms reduction" rests on slender authority. The military balance surrounding Japan, which influences the security of this nation, is changing. Other Asian nations are expanding their armaments, and the military power of the Russian Army in the Far East has greatly been enhanced over the past 10 years. It is meaningless to compare Japan's defense budget with those of the United States and Europe, where the threat of Warsaw Pact forces composed of more than 100 divisions has gone and the threat of Russia has diminished. The Far East region is facing many issues seen in a transitional period. They include those concerning the DPRK's alleged nuclear arms development, who will succeed President Kim Il-song, North-South unification, who will succeed Chinese paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, long-range plans to strengthen military power, Taiwan-related matters, and the fluid political situation in Russia. It will take at least 10 years to know how these issues will be settled. The most important thing in a transitional period is not to launch policies that will prevent flexible defense plans for many years. As Yaritsu Sozai says, Japan has to remove one harmful thing (to eliminate meaningless ideas from the present defense program guidelines) to gain one advantage.
