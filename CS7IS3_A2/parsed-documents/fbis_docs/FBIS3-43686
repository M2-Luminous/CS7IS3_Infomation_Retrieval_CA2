The government plans to adopt protective measures to prevent indiscriminate price increases. The government is also planning to launch a sensitization and explanation campaign. Here is the report on the cabinet meeting deliberations presented by the government spokesman, Theodore Holo: [Begin recording] [Passage omitted] The cabinet took note of the decision of the heads of state and government of the 14 member states of the franc zone in Dakar, Senegal, on 11 January relating to the 50 percent devaluation of the CFA franc. After examining the report presented by the minister of trade and tourism on the foreseeable consequences, the cabinet envisaged a number of measures whose implementation can only be effective after the government has held discussions with its social partners and the business community. In the meantime, preventive measures will be adopted to avoid any indiscriminate price increases throughout the national territory, and in order to stem the baneful effects of the devaluation on our economy and on the purchasing power of our hardworking people. A mass sensitization and explanation campaign will also be organized to enable our people in general and the business community in particular, to understand correctly the phenomenon of devaluation which, unfortunately, is being wrongly interpreted today. Consequently, the cabinet calls on all national as well as foreign businessmen to refrain from any restless action that could seriously jeopardize our young recovering economy. Finally, the minister of public works and transport reported to the cabinet on the situation at Cotonou Airport where personnel of the Agency for Air Navigation Safety in Africa and Madagascar [ASECNA] embarked on an indefinite strike as of 11 January. From the report presented by the minister of public works and transport, it was observed that some ASECNA staff, who were individually requisitioned, in conformity with the prevailing laws, to perform minimum duties at the airport, simply reported to their work place but did not work, thus paralyzing air traffic at Cotonou Airport totally. While recognizing that ASECNA staff have the right to strike under conditions defined by the law, the cabinet strongly condemned their refusal to perform minimum work. However, faithful to the spirit of dialogue and concertation which the government of democratic renewal has always demonstrated vis a vis its various social partners, the cabinet set up a ministerial delegation in charge of meeting ASECNA personnel today in order to examine with them the ways and means of reconciling their interests with those of their employers and our national economy.
