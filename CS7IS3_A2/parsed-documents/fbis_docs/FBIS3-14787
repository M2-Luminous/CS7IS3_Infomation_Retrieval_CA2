In a statement published on Sunday Dzoblayev said that the State Duma's resolution on granting amnesty to participants in last October's riots poses "an act of absolute disrespect for the law, unprecedented in political practice." According to him, as a result of it "the confrontation between the various political forces and branches of power will inevitably grow, and the consolidation of power institutions which began to take shape when the new Constitution was adopted will collapse". As Dzoblayev said, Sergey Shakhray must share the responsibility for this with the "communist obscurantists". "His further being in charge of the ethnic policy department is absurd," the statement says.
