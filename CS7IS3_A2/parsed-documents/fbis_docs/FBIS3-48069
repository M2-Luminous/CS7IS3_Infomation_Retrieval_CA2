The message is as follows: 1. The cancerous disease in my body has been gradually cured. The cancer that remains in my spinal cord is being cured, but slowly. This is because my prominent Chinese doctors dare not use medicine too strong in the treatment considering my age and other illnesses, such as my veins and arteries which have hardened due to [words indistinct] and my heart disease. Using drugs that are too strong in this kind of medical treatment might affect my heart and so forth. A number of the most prominent PRC doctors, the very kind brothers, recently met and discussed new methods to more effectively eliminate the cancer in my spinal cord. My cancer is a very serious illness. This is why I need many more months to complete the treatment, despite the effective and very thorough care given my these most prominent doctors. Although I am not yet cured 100 percent, I will certainly return to our motherland in April 1994 to meet and join all beloved and respected compatriots in celebrating our traditional new year. 2. I would like to zealously appeal to my Khmer Rouge [KR] children from the Party of Democratic Kampuchea to please stop planting mines in our country and to stop destroying our nation's roads and bridges. The grenades and mines planted inside our territory have caused and are causing miserable harm to our compatriots, civilian, old and young, and male and female alike. Every month, victims, male and female alike, die or become cripples for the rest of their lives. Our country is known to have more disabled persons, amputees due to grenades and mines, than any country in the world. This is the [words indistinct]. I would like once again to appeal to the children who plant mines to completely stop all these crimes against our people. All roads and bridges are vitally important to our innocent people and our motherland. Those roads and bridges do not serve Vietnam. They serve only the interests of our society and the economy of our Cambodian people and motherland. At present, our Cambodian motherland has been classified as one of the poorest and most underdeveloped countries in the world. This is a great shame to our motherland, our nation, and every Cambodian. Those children who have planted mines, destroyed houses, villages, and the property of our people as well as ruined our nation' roads and bridges -- if you really are patriots, you should completely and permanently stop from now on all acts to destroy the people and your own country. 3. I would like to insistently appeal to all children who have chosen the wrong way of living by becoming robbers; thieves; and bandits, who mercilessly killing both their own fellow Cambodians and foreigners, to permanently end all of your crimes. These vicious activities degrade your honor as well as the prestige of our nation and race and our Cambodian motherland. I know that a large number of you have become thieves, robbers, and bandits, who kill people, after you have experienced great misery in your families. Most of you have chosen these vicious and criminal activities after you have felt despair. I will ask our Royal Cambodian Government [RCG] to grant you complete pardon if you agree to come out to see Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh and H.E. Hun Sen, the two prime minister of our RCG; pledge to stop robbing, plundering, and killing people; and agree to come out to lead a life like all other ordinary citizen and render yourselves worthy of being the sons of independent Cambodia and our Angkor motherland. The RCG will not forget all of you who [words indistinct] and will seek honest jobs for you. In conclusion, I would like to extend best wishes to the two supreme patriarchs, Patriarchs Khousananda, Pouthiveang, and Mongkoktepeacha; all venerable monks; wisemen; nuns; brothers; sisters; children; grandchildren; great grandchildren; and all beloved and respected compatriots. May you enjoy Lord Buddha's five blessings -- longevity, social prestige, happiness, strength, and enlightenment.
