One senior official at the North Korean Mission to the United Nations in New York said Tuesday that the original agreements reached between North Korea and the United States and North Korea and the IAEA called for a comprehensive IAEA inspection of only five of the seven sites. As for the other two facilities -- a 5-megawatt reactor and a radiochemical laboratory -- North Korea had agreed to accept IAEA inspections that are necessary only to maintain continuity in nuclear safeguards, the official claimed. The question of permitting comprehensive IAEA inspections of all seven facilities in North Korea, a member of the nuclear non- proliferation treaty (NPT), must be resolved at the third round of high-level talks between Pyongyang and Washington, he said. The official, who declined to be identified by name, said the United States is reportedly planning to raise the question of special checks of the two facilities at the talks. The U.S. position mirrors that of a hostile country demanding that the other side publicly disclose its military technology, the official said. He thus ruled out the possibility that the IAEA may conduct special inspections. The official also demanded that the United States not attach any preconditions to further dialogue. "The United States has to give up the idea that U.S.-North Korean talks are some kind of present (to Pyongyang)," he said. "In fact, we do not feel an urgent need for dialogue with the United States." The official's comments confirm widely held suspicions that much time and effort are needed to resolve the issue since South Korea, the United States and their allies are demanding that North Korea permit IAEA inspections immediately while Pyongyang is seeking further talks with Washington first.
