FR941021-0-00015 FR941021-0-00001 (iii) Humidity and condensation. Test panels shall be placed in an environmental chamber and subjected to 1,008 hours (42 cycles) of exposure per ASTM D 2247&hyph;92. One cycle consists of 24 hours of 100% humidity (with condensation on the panels) at a cabinet temperature of 38 # 1 ○C (100 # 2 ○F) and an ambient temperature of 25 # 1 ○C (77 # 2 ○F) without heat input. Upon completion of cycling, the test panels shall be subjected to an 11 newton-meter (N-m) (100 pound-inches (lb-in.)) impact test using the Gardner-Impact Tester or equivalent. Test panels shall show no substrate or coating cracking or loss of coating adhesion on either side. (iv) Weatherability. Three test panels shall be tested for weatherability in accordance with the appropriate procedures of either ASTM D 822&hyph;89 or ASTM G 23&hyph;90. Total exposure time shall be a minimum of 800 hours. Failure is defined as fading, cracking, blistering, or delamination on any of the three test panels. (v) Low temperature durability. Low temperature durability shall be proven by exposing the three test panels from (e)(3)(iv) of this section to at least 25 continuous cycles of the following test sequence: (A) To insure complete saturation of the three test panels, soak them for 96 hours in a container of distilled water 22 # 2 ○C (71.6 # 4 ○F); (B) Lower the temperature of the water and the immersed test panels to ^28 # 2 ○C (^18.4 # 4 ○F) and stabilize for 24 hours; (C) Thaw the water with the samples to 22 # 2 ○C (71.6 # 4 ○F) and stabilize for 24 hours; (D) Repeat the procedure 24 times. Any cracking, crazing, deforming, or delaminating on any of the three test panels shall be considered a failure; and (E) Remove the samples from the water and impact test the three panels by delivering a force of 11.3 N-m (100 lb-in.) using a Gardner-Impact Tester to each specimen at 71, 22, and ^28 # 2 ○C (159.8, 71.6, and ^18.4 # 4 ○F), after stabilizing them at those temperatures for at least two hours. Visual inspection shall reveal no deformation or perforations on any of the test panels. (vi) Corrosion resistance. Corrosivity shall be tested in accordance with the requirements of ASTM B 117&hyph;90. Both scribed and unscribed panels shall be evaluated following the procedures of ASTM D 1654&hyph;92. Scribed panels shall have a rating of at least six, following 500 hours of exposure to salt fog, and the unscribed panels shall have a rating no lower than 10, after 1,000 hours exposure. Visual rust inspection shall confirm no more than 0.03% rusting (rust grade 9) of the surface area of the test sample when evaluated in accordance with ASTM D 610&hyph;85(1989). The unscribed samples shall be impacted with an 11.3 N-m (100 lb-in.) force, using a Gardner-Impact Tester or equivalent. Visual inspection of the impacted samples shall reveal no loss of adhesion between the base material and the coating or cracking at the finish on the test panels. (vii) Fungi resistance. Fungi resistance of nonmetallic housing materials shall be tested according to the procedures of ASTM G 21&hyph;90. Any rating greater than one shall be considered a failure. (viii) Stress crack resistance. The stress cracking characteristics of nonmetallic housing components shall be tested in accordance with ASTM D 1693&hyph;70 (Reapproved 1988). The tests shall be performed at 49 # 21/2 C (120 # 41/2 F) for 14 days and exposed to the following materials: (A) Industry recognized filling compounds; (B) Isopar M; (C) Industry recognized solvents; (D) Industry recognized encapsulants; and (E) Commonly used insect, pest, and weed control products and agricultural fertilizers. (ix) Chemical resistance. (A) Chemical resistance shall be determined by immersing representative nonmetallic material samples in each of the following solutions for 72 hours at 22 # 2 ○C (71.6 # 4 ○F): ( 1 ) 3% sulfuric acid; ( 2 ) 100 parts per million (ppm) trichloroethane in water; ( 3 ) 0.2 N sodium hydroxide; and ( 4 ) Unleaded high octane gasoline. (B) There shall be no swelling, deformation, or softening of the material samples or any discoloration of the solution. (x) Ultraviolet resistance. Test panels of metallic and nonmetallic outer housing materials shall be subjected to 700 hours exposure per ASTM D 2565&hyph;92 using the type BH apparatus. The panels shall not exhibit fading, blistering, checking, or delamination. (xi) Weathertightness. The housing shall be mounted in its typical field installation position and sprayed with water. The temperature of the water shall be adjusted to be equal to or warmer than the temperature of the cabinet interior to avoid the possibility of condensation. A water spray head shall be used to direct water at the housing so that the water stream will strike the assembly at a downward angle of 45 degrees. The flow of the water shall be 3.8 liters per minute (one gallon per minute), with 276 kilopascals (40 pounds per square inch) head of pressure. The spray head shall be held 1.8 meters (m) (6 feet (ft)) from the test cabinet. The spray head shall be adjusted so that water impinges uniformly over the housing surface. The duration of the test shall be five minutes. All vertical cabinet surfaces shall be tested by this procedure. The exterior of the cabinet shall be thoroughly dried with towels (no heat drying) prior to examination of the housing interior. The interior of the housing shall be checked for presence of water. Wetting of over-lapping surfaces is permitted. There shall be no presence of water inside the housing. (xii) Wind Resistance. (A)( 1 ) Stub pole or wall mounted SAI and large pair count splice housings shall be subjected to a load (F) as shown in Figure 4 and the following table to simulate the turning moment equivalent to a uniform wind load of 161 kilometers per hour (km/h) (100 miles per hour (mi/h)) perpendicular to the largest surface area.
