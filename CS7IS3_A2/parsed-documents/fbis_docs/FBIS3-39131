In a joint communique, Defense Minister Francois Leotard and Economics Minister Edmond Alphandery explained their decision citing their "confidence in a company with great potential which has acquired in each of its products lines a leading global position" and which, "as is the case with most aircraft manufacturers has been affected by the situation of airline companies and the reduction of military purchases." The two ministers, noting the efforts the company has made to adapt since 1992, estimate that this sum, part of the 1993 budget, "will allow Aerospatiale to benefit fully from the progressive recovery of its markets." The group, whose activities include defense (missiles), civilian aircraft, (Airbus, ATR, Eurocopter), and space (Ariane), seems satisfied with the allocated funds. "It is a breath of air which will guarantee existing programs and those to come," employees were saying acknowledging that in view of French economic difficulties, the effort by the government could not be more important. Few Hopes for 1994 The company is currently considering new programs with its European partners including launching a military transport plane (FLA) derived from the Airbus (A330 and A340) and from ATR (ATR52 and ATR82); the development of a second generation of supersonic jet and a superjumbo jet; and the renewing of the classic and ballistic missiles line. At the partnership level, Aerospatiale, which has subsidiarized its helicopter business by merging with Deutsche Aerospace within Eurocopter, must now do the same, with the same partner, in its missiles and satellites business. Prior to the state allocation the group, which lost 2.38 billion French francs [Fr] in 1992 on sales of Fr52.3 billion, only had Fr6 billion in shareholders equity with a debt of Frl3 billion. Yet its debt had been reduced Fr3 billion in two years thanks to reducing expenses (12 percent) such as reduced expenses for operating costs, for certain leasing operations, and selling stakes in some companies (Sextant, SEP). After having reported a loss of Fr870 million in the first half of 1993, Aerospatiale is assured of having reduced its losses "in a substantial manner" for that year and has announced it expects to break even "at the latest in 1995." SNECMA, which has already received Fr750 billion; and GIAT Industries, that is to say SNPE, should be the next to benefit from the money earned from privatizations this year and from some possible financial consequences of Defense Ministry negotiations over the next military program law, which leaves Aerospatiale little hope of receiving the remaining billion it wanted. If a return to the private sector is not the order of the day for 1994 and 1995, Aerospatiale President-Director General Louis Gallois has suggested recently "a partial opening of capital" to minority shareholders, which could happen more rapidly since the state would keep 51 percent of the shares.
