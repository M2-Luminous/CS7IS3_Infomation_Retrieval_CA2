The group announced after its meeting Monday that the Russian draft agreement on military transit should be discussed only when the parliament adopts a law on transportation of military and dangerous cargos through Lithuanian territory. Commenting on the Russian draft, Bulovas said Lithuanian experts suggest to allow only transit by rail. In his words, transit by road is completely unacceptable to Lithuania, while transit by air can be carried out only in accordance with international regulations and requires separate permission of the Lithuanian Foreign Ministry. In Bulovas' opinion, Lithuania cannot create any specific regulations for Russian military transit. "The rules will be universal to all, be it Russia or NATO." The negotiator said his group is now working on regulations of transporting dangerous cargos by rail through Lithuania. Bulovas noted that Lithuania does not have two borders with Russia, therefore it will be necessary either to sign a trilateral agreement between Lithuania, Russia and Belarus, or to conclude three separate bilateral agreements. Bulovas said Russia has lately begun intensive transit by sea. In his words, the process is evident because the amount of transit by rail is considerably smaller than planned.
