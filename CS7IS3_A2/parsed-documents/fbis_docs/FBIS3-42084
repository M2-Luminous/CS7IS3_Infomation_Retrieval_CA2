"The Russians have expressed their inability to extend the transfer of technology. That is a fact. We are now re-negotiating and seeing what can be done on that," he said. Rao was speaking to the Press following the inauguration of the Karnataka Hybrid Micro Devices Limited (KHMD), an enterprise set up under he ISRO entrepreneur development programme. Asked to verify Moscow-based reports that the Russians were willing to supply an increased number of cryogenic engines in lieu of the technology transfer, Rao said in diplomacy several methods are used by negotiators, one of which includes the issuing of all kinds of statements. "Some people will express their perceptions of the situation, however, we will announce something only if we are satisfied." Asked whether the US embargo on ISRO will be lifted in view of the jettisoned cryogenic deal, Rao said now the Americans ought to lift the embargo as the facts of the deal falling through had received wide publicity. However, ISRO would not approach the Americans and ask them to lift the embargo. "I don't care what they (the Americans) do. They are the ones who imposed the embargo. It is up to them to lift it," he said. Rao agreed that embargoes were a nuisance but pointed out that ISRO had enough past experience with them. Many dual-use technologies were not available to ISRO and even mundane items such as the wheels for the mobile rocket-launching tower were not given to ISRO in the past. "We had to make it ourselves," he said. "Fundamentally a sovereign country like India has to develop its own capability in high technology. We cannot become a global competitor if we cannot stand on its own two feet." Pointing out that any country with any high technology held on to it, preventing other countries from acquiring it, he said: "We must develop our own technologies because the market is right here. We must take advantage of it." Rao related the apocryphal story of an aspirin manufacturer who said that if every Indian and every Chinese took one aspirin a day, then he would not have to worry about the rest of the world. Rao reiterated that India's own cryogenic engine would be ready in four years. "Nothing will stop us from making it by 1998. I say this with the biggest confidence because of the kind of people we have working in the Space Department." Rao said ISRO already had its fuel manufacturing facilities at Mahendragiri and testing facilities are being developed speedily. ISRO had built a one-tonne cryogenic engine which had been tested extensively. "Most of the problems in building a bigger engine we will be able to tackle. We do not foresee any major technical-problems," he said. Rao pointed out that the Russian contract had been entered into after ISRO had decided to go into indigenous manufacture of cryogenic engines. "We did not go to anybody for the engines. They came to us," he said. First it was General Dynamics of the US, then Ariane of France and finally Glavkosmos. Rao said, while ISRO had refused the earlier offers, it had accepted the Russian offer as it was cheap and it was felt it would cut down the time needed to develop an indigenous engine. However, now that renegotiations are on, Rao said whatever was agreed to, ISRO would not accept an increase in price. The original contract stated a price of Rs [rupees] 235 crore in Indian rupees. "We will not pay more than this," he said.
