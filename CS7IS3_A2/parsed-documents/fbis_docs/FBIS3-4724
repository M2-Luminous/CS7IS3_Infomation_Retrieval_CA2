FBIS3-4724 "dreas040_d_94024" FBIS-EAS-94-040 Document Type:Daily Report 1 Mar 1994 South Korea * Article Examines Future of Democratic Party 942C0057A Seoul MAL in Korean Dec 93 pp 36-43 942C0057A Seoul MAL Language: Korean Article Type:CSO [By reporter An Yong-pae] [Text] The controversy over Party President [PP] Yi's "New Line" gives advance notice that, after the regular session of the National Assembly, the Democratic Party [DP] will be plunged into a "hot battle" over the questions of an "early party national convention" and future party direction. Will the DP be victorious in its political agenda linking local-government [Chijaje], general and presidential elections? Will it succeed in taking office? We did a concentrated analysis of this question through interviews with the DP's next seven leaders: Yi Ki-taek, Kim Sang-hyon, Kim Won-ki, No Mu-hyon, Yi Pu-yong, Yi Chol and Chong Tae-chol. Has DP president Yi Ki-taek actually begun full-scale mobilization in preparation the 15th presidential election? There has been no time since the last party national conference in which PP Yi has so captured the interest of the media and public. If one visits the PP Yi camp, one can feel an air of bustling activity somehow different than in the past. As expected, "public relations" concerning PP Yi's image are being carried out more actively than before and the level of the offensive against anti-Yi Ki-taek forces has gone up considerably. This began with Yi's talk with reports on 28 September and his speech before the National Assembly on 27 October. Out of these sessions came statements the media has named the so-called "New Line." It was about this time that he started to organize his own faction, the "Tongil Sanha Hoe." There has been no consistency in the series of statements and actions he has shown. This makes possible the analysis that behind it lies a calculated political foreshadowing in connection with his political agenda. The spectrum of evaluations of the "New Line" is as varied as the number of factions within the DP. First to attack PP Yi's line, DP Co-President [Choego Uiwon] [CP] Yi Pu-yong asserts: "If it were only the opinion of another co-president that might be okay, but for the party president to elucidate a new line and announce a party direction, the decision should pass through a process of debate in which many within the party participate. A party president must to collect the opinions of people disagreeing with him. If he makes a decision after listening to the opinions of only a few secretaries, can this be said to be an opinion representative of the party? I don't know. Apart from official meetings as party president with the party leadership or with lawmakers, he might have held one meeting to debate party line and policy. In a situation like this, he suddenly comes out calling this the new line. It's difficult to understand." Some are drawing attention by presenting their opinion that "joint responsibility" for this lies with the media also. CP No Mu-hyon interprets, "It doesn't appear that the new line was decided upon after systematic study. It is essentially an exaggerated expression used of a speech and a few statements by PP Yi. (The media) created this name because it is material for new articles." The sentiments of non-mainstream lawmaker Kim Sang-hyon are more cynical. "I don't know what the New Line of PP Yi is. His line is constantly changing. It may be more accurate to say he has no policy line. The expression that the old line was the liquidation of the past and the new line is heading toward the future is not even worth debate. Can there be a future-directed blueprint without a settlement of past issues?" On the other hand, PP Yi's defense is not easily refuted. "In their speeches, successive political party presidents have stressed politics, economics, security, and society, in that order. In my speech, however, I gave more time to, and put greater stress on economic issues, rather than political ones. They seem to have given it the name `New Line' because they think it a different perspective than in the past. I'm proud that the party set up this future-oriented policy line one step ahead of the government and ruling party. For example, after I finished my address to the National Assembly, many of my close friends said: The 21st century and the future are the exclusive property of the government and ruling party. What are they going to do if you occupy them first? But this doesn't mean I'm going to be lax about settling the problems of the past. It's my philosophy that, without it, there can be no reform either. I'm merely suggesting that in our agenda, we work on them both simultaneously." That there cannot but be sharp differences in "interpretation" over one policy line clearly shows us one aspect of the DP's problems. Anyway, whether the "controversy" caused by PP Yi is a clever move resulting from a changed heart or a bad move made after a long time spent in thought, it appears that judgment on it will be made after the regular session of the National Assembly with the evaluation of the DP's parliamentary activities. The "New Line" controversy and questions about PP Yi Ki-taek's leadership ability are related to each other, like two sides of a coin. The give and take is functioning to elevate the whole controversy, dragging this question of leadership into the arena of full-scale criticism. Most questioned PP Yi aggressively. "There is a lot of criticism that, as the party president, he is only able to exercise one-ninth of the leadership." PP Yi's answer was also unexpectedly aggressive. "The talk that I'm only exercising one-ninth of the leadership is correct. That's the way the party constitution sets things up. According to the party constitutional system, I represent the party as one of nine representatives. I've lead the various meetings smoothly in these circumstances, without breaking any dishes. Does it make any sense to say that I have no leadership ability? I'm leading the way both in reform and in settling the issues of the past. In the struggle against the ruling party too I'm doing as much as anyone else. Is there any other opposition figure who severely criticizes the Kim Yong-sam government, both in public and in private, as much as I do? Personally, I don't think it's right for me, the party president, to stand out so vehemently. It bothers me that I'm leading like this. Shouldn't the co-presidents of the party leadership aggressively lead for me? Shouldn't the party president be the last card played?" There are many holding the opposite opinion. "I don't believe this is a result of the group leadership system," said Rep. Yi Chol, diagnosing the problem, "It's because most of those in the leadership are hastily taking care of their own interests." CP Yi Pu-yong's attitude is a little more serious. "I think the limits of PP Yi's leadership ability were seen a lot in the regular session of the National Assembly. I figured that if his leadership was displayed in the regular session of the National Assembly, the most important item on the political agenda, then he would have no problem for the remainder of his term. Recently, however, it is my honest feeling to doubt whether during the regular session of the National Assembly we can effectively make it through the complex political situations with PP Yi's leadership ability." There are also those holding reserved positions. Rep. Chong Tae-chol thinks, "For an evaluation of his leadership ability, we need to give him a one-year grace period." However, "There do seem to be problems with the nine-man group leadership system and with PP Yi's leadership ability, such as the loss of timing for a decision on party policy because party policy is being changed all the time," he added cautiously. Some insist that consideration must be given for the historical nature of the DP. "Some of what is being said is not entirely unfair. Criticism is deserved on things such has the reshuffling of party officials and his inability to return the party to normal after the national convention," says CP Kim Won-ki, acknowledging a leadership problem. He added, however, that "there is one thing to be considered: in the past, there was the charismatic authority of former party president Kim Tae-chung, in which all power was concentrated. When he suddenly retired, this changed into a system of group leadership. Side effects are occurring in a situation in which this system has been unable to become fully established." Regardless of whether questions are raised concerning PP Yi's leadership, most feel that there must be change in the present leadership system. Opinions differ, however, on whether it should be a group leadership system or a system of sole leadership by one man. CP No Mu-hyon: "We have to go to a single leadership system. The transitional period is now past. If we get a single leadership system, the number of co-presidents won't be important." He insists that if the group leadership system is maintained, its number must not be reduced below the seven members stipulated by the party constitution. This is because he believes that if it is changed to have five members, even only three of them could form against the others, so if the desire is there it would be easier to achieve illicit alliances. CP Chong Tae-chol thinks, "Even a single leadership system is okay." Only, in this event, "the party president definitely must have the capacity to assemble the party's divided, complex and diverse factions." There are also many who prefer a group leadership system somewhat different from the present one. CP Yi Pu-yong: "Since we have to go through several elections, a single leadership system with group characteristics is desirable, giving more authority to the party president while reducing the number of those in the supreme, decision-making structure." "Because the system is too diffuse and complex, the number of co-presidents needs to be reduced," says CP Kim Won-ki, "But, as yet, a group leadership system is still desirable." It is only that the party president must demonstrate more leadership, he says. Rep. Kim Sang-hyon also prefers a group leadership system. "Although a single leadership system has its strong points, without leadership ability it will be just the same. If the party moves in a uniform, undemocratic way, it could actually become inflexible. In the case of a single leadership system, because of the practice of appointing a vice president in particular, in the event the president has no leadership ability, there is a high probability that he would only appoint someone from his own faction, causing even greater problems. In that case, the party could even be broken up." PP Yi Ki-taek and Rep. Yi Chol hold reserved positions, saying that the two systems both have good and bad points. There are presently various issues disputed within the DP, but the "hot potato" into which all confrontation is condensed is, as expected, when the next party national convention will be held. The national convention is the place where all factions within the party stake their survival, hoping to provide a candidate for the next presidential election or hoping to make use of the opportunity to increase their influence. The question of when it will be held cannot help but be fluid because it is linked to the local-government agenda and other events scheduled to be implemented next year. Because the "calculations" of each faction change according to the time of the convention, they are conducting unseen preparations for a secret struggle over the selection of the time. Of interest here is the fact that the non-mainstream group challenging the party presidency is actually less interested in an early national convention. Defeated by a narrow margin in this challenge for the party presidency during the last national convention, Rep. Kim Sang-hyon says, "I have no intention to demand that the national convention be convened early. If in the election-law negotiation process we come to an agreement, so that local government can be implemented after May, 1995, there won't be any big problems. I bring up the problem of Yi's leadership ability, but this is a call to amend the party line. I'm not saying that we must immediately change the 2-year term party president. I think it would be best to hold the party national convention normally, in 1995." However, that does not mean that he is unconditionally opposed to an early national convention. It is undesirable to go beyond reason in opposing it, he says. CP Chong Tae-chol opposes this as a general rule. However, "If all agree to the need to prevent a situation in which we would be faced with local-government elections with an ill-equipped party, actually divided since it hasn't been long since the last national convention, we could hold an early national convention unrelated to the issue of the party leadership," he says. "I understand the situation within the party, but I don't agree with an immediate opening of an early convention due to interests limited to internal party problems," says CP Kim Won-ki. Because the public must be convinced that "those actions are appropriate, given the circumstances," "It seems that we'll have to pass the first half of next year to know what we're going to do about the question of an early national convention," he adds. On the other hand, controlling the party leadership, PP Yi actually shows a relaxed attitude. "Originally, the next party national convention is, because of my term of office, supposed to open in May, 1995. To effectively prepare for the local-government elections, we must put the party organization in order at least five to six months beforehand. There is talk in the government and ruling party that the local-government elections will be held in January or February of 1995, but, anyway, if it's of help to the party, there is no need to withhold support for proposals to hold the national convention during the latter half of next year. Just before next year's regular session of the National Assembly would be good too." CP Yi Pu-yong hopes more aggressively for an early national convention. "Objective conditions are driving this, unrelated to anyone's intentions. There is no way we can carry out local-government elections with this sort of leadership system. Interlocked with the Democratic Liberal Party's [DLP] next national convention, local-government elections, etc., I feel that the question of reorganizing the party leadership after the regular session of the National Assembly is unavoidable." CP No Mu-hyon explains the situation within the party, thus: "Because it is not a question of only dynamic relationships within the party, we must be careful about an early opening of the national convention. This is because we must do an integrated study of the issue, including changes in the ruling party, the economic situation and the DP's public image. At least, a feeling held in common by both mainstream and non-mainstream groups is that we must not do anything that might ruin the party's image or might cause the party damage because of its leadership." Many aspects of this consensus, however, are due to non-mainstream efforts to prudently avoid exposure to accusations of just carrying on an in-house fight to gain the party presidency. If the DP is going to go for an early national convention, then it will have to be held before or after next year's regular session of the National Assembly. Regardless, it will have no choice but to enter into a national-convention phase next year. In connection with this, it is as yet difficult to predict what form will be taken by the complex alliances for or against the main group. "What's important in the party national convention is influence and popularity. Unlike the DLP, in which President Kim Yong-sam controls the territory held by each faction, in the DP the indiscriminate acquisition of influence is more important that anything else," according to the analysis of one young lawmaker. "Presently, the KT (PP Yi Ki-taek) and DJ (Kim Tae-chung) alliance makes up over 40 percent of the party, securing close to 50 percent of the `influence.' For now, the mid-liners and non-mainstreamers may make up over 50 percent, but if the KT-DJ alliance can draw in only a part of these, the competition is over. For example, all that remains is the question of partnership: Will the mainstream alliance get CP Kim Won-ki's camp or will it get the reform group? The posture of the mainstream is reserved, however, because there is no need for it to decide on a partner now, making many enemies early. The various factions within the party are adopting wait-and-see postures, still not drawing clear battle lines, because they know too well the fact that if they fail here, they will experience great difficulty in securing a share of influence within the party." This analysis is convincing only if one accepts the premise that the alliance between PP Yi and Tonggyo-tong [Kim Tae-chung's group] will continue in the future. Let us listen to more of what he has to say. "The KT-DJ alliance is in effect because of joint interests in maintaining the status quo. If this alliance falls apart, there is a high probability it will lead to great confusion and could even end in the party breaking up. Furthermore, if they go with an early national convention, it will naturally be held before next September, because they cannot hold a party national convention while the regular session of the National Assembly is being held. Then, it will immediately follow the close of this session of the National Assembly. Another partnership is unlikely to be achieved during that period of time." However, there are many who view the alliance between the Yi camp and Tonggyo-tong as a temporary structure, soon to be cleared away. Having a particularly close relationship since the previous generation with former party president Kim Tae-chung, CP Chong Tae-chol says, "I personally heard it directly, on several occasions," that, "[Kim Tae-chung's] relationship with PP Yi is his keeping a promise to help him for about a year," and, "Concerning the party candidate for the next presidential election, his thought is that the most capable person will win." CPs No Mu-hyon and Kim Won-ki have similar thoughts on this. "This is because his apparent backing of PP Yi does not mean that his relationship with those he previously supported has suddenly become shallow," according to the interpretation of CP Kim Won-ki. Also, "To interpret with fixed concepts each action of those [Kim Tae-chung] had normally been close to, saying that they do what they do because a button was pressed in Tonggyo-tong, is too much of an exaggeration," he points out. If their views are correct, then we cannot hastily judge the balance power within the party in a fixed way. Also, then, the situation is inevitably fluid. Concerning yet another variable, rumors of a return to politics by former party president Kim Tae-chung, responses are generally negative, although there are differences in nuance. The words of Yi Ki-taek: "Shouldn't we believe the words of Kim Tae-chung himself? Aren't we in a third-person position? Believing is a virtue." CP No Mu-hyon: "I believe this taking someone who said they were quitting politics and, without any grounds to do so, calling him a liar and making up various things about him is no more and no less than a plot by people trying to make the DP appear to be a regional party with no life of its own." One lawmaker close to PP Yi asserts, "As for this talk about DJ returning to the front lines of politics, an attempt at making the image stick that the DP is still DJ's party, although the party president is now KT, leaves one with the strong impression that it is for preventing the desertion of DLP supporters, particularly the middle class, and those from the Taegu and North Kyongsang Province regions." Concerning the opposition's chances of taking office during the 15th presidential election, many stress that most external factors provide considerably good conditions for this. It will not be easy for the Kim Yong-sam administration to resolve the economic crisis and the presidential-candidate "cards" capable of being played by the DLP are not too powerful, it is judged. Many argue, however, that to make the most of this good opportunity, there must first be "radical reform" within the DP. "We must have no more people, as at present, with declining public support and who, too concerned over the shape of things in the party, abandon their own districts. We must no longer put out ridiculous candidates in some districts, because of factional interests, who then loose, as in the recent special election. For the overall development of the party, we need fundamental reform and a reshuffling of personnel," says Rep. Yi Chol. One co-president even confessed, "A full-scale reshuffling of the chairmen of district chapters is needed for the reform of the DP. But because if this were elucidated, it would mean the end of vote management in the party national convention, it's difficult to openly talk about it." It is safe to say that the next local-government elections, general election, and presidential election are all one political agenda. This is because the results of each election are predicted to have a large, in some cases decisive influence on the next election. Rep. Chong Tae-chol gives this prescription. "Beginning now, we need to select candidates in preparation for the election of local-government leaders [tanchejang songo] and through competition to highlight the public images of at least the candidates for leader of large-area local governments [kwangyok chachidanchejang]. The painful experience of the last election, for which we had no good candidates, must not be repeated. Together with the Honam region, we must win at least in Seoul, Kyonggi Province and Inchon, be evenly matched in Chungchong Province and Taejon, and publicize in Kangwon Province, North Kyongsang Province and Taegu, if we are going win in the general and presidential elections." The runners to take part in the relay race, the grand finale to take place in 1997 are now catching their breath. It is still uncertain who will run the base line as a representative contestant for the DP. Only in the first heat, the next party national convention will his profile slowly begin to appear. After the close of the regular session of the National Assembly, each team will be looking to those around them and will enter on an all-out quest for candidate competitors to participate in the preliminaries, a competition surpassing that of the college entrance exams. One thing is clear, however. The circumstances have now changed. Just as the conglomerates are shouting management reform in order to survive, the DP must be successful in its reform of opposition political culture in order to enjoy the thrill of gaining the pennant of victory in the end. The DP on the night before the big meet. As if to forecast the arrival of a storm, the waves are gradually beginning to rise on its quite waters. Yi Ki-taek Interview Criticism for Lack of Leadership Ability Ridiculous [Interviewer] Many questions are being asked about your leadership ability both inside and outside the party. [Yi] People are too often saying I lack leadership ability. I can't accept this. There are no perfect politicians. I too have faults. About this, however, I think it is a problem of the whole party rather than my own problem. To be blunt, if I had no leadership ability, how could I have been student committee chairman in high school and college during my school days? Selected as a member of the National Assembly at 29, how could I have become secretary general at 39, even though there capable seniors above me, and vice president of the party at 42? In politics, you have to watch your timing. Just as you can accelerate if needed, you've got to have flexibility in dealing with things. It's ridiculous to say you lack leadership ability because you are a little late. [Interviewer] They say you have no general principles in your management of the party. [Yi] I made three promises as I became party president. I said that I would make the DP a democratic party, a science party and a policy party. The DP has been so democratically managed that lawmakers directly selected the floor leader, a field-army commander. We made the party scientific by, for example, managing it according to budget accounting principles. During the last parliamentary inspections, in our handling of policy inspections we so established our position as a policy party that there are no dissenting opinions on this. A party president must take responsibility for bad results, but shouldn't the credit for these desirable changes also be given to him? They only question my leadership ability with no mention of this. I have no choice but to view this as a coin toss, an argument just for argument's sake, because I'm leading the way with no other political defects. [Interviewer] It is said that former party president Kim Tae-chung's influence on the DP is still too great and that one of your greatest bases of support is the Tonggyo-tong faction. [Yi] It is a fact that in actuality, former PP Kim Tae-chung plays the role of a fence of the DP and has enormous influence in the party. They ask whether the DP isn't too dependent on him. Since he is to me a senior opposition politician and a political leader whose influence is acknowledged worldwide, isn't it natural that I respect and not neglect his opinions? And I think former PP Kim's position is neutral. I have a good relationship with the Tonggyo-tong faction because I have had deep ties with CP's Kwon No-kap, Han Kwang-ok and others, because we are close and have worked together for a long time and because we achieve easy harmony on problems of running the party and National Assembly. No Mu-hyon Interview Advocating Leadership by "Next Generation of Runners" [Interviewer] You introduced the "Next Generation Runner Debate." [No] It's saying that it would be desirable for CPs Chong Tae-chol, Yi Pu-yong and the others, with PP Yi, to hold a competitive selection in the great battle to take place during the party national convention. The only large group within the party capable of taking PP Yi is the Honam faction. The DP must first of all come up with a plan capable of overcoming the idea that it is a "Honam party." Also, to create the image of a party capable of producing a candidate much more novel than Rep. Pak Chan-jong, regardless of people's positions for or against the party leadership, discussion of the next generation of leaders cannot help but come up in the next party national convention. In the battle between PP Yi and the next-generation candidates, the public will begin to see a new DP image. A "color confrontation, rather than regional confrontation" will been see as a fresh image by the public. We must carry out the local-government, general and presidential elections in this context if we are to have a chance of winning. [Interviewer] Concretely, who do you support? [No] I'm helping CP Yi Pu-yong. [Interviewer] What will be your role in the future political agenda? [No] If there is competitive selection in the party national convention, no middle way will exist. Some talk about roles divided among three persons. I don't have a role. You can't call supporting someone else a role, right? I have work to do, but no position. [Interviewer] In connection with CP Cho Se-hyong becoming director of the Local Government Working-Level Research Center [Chibang Chachi Silmu Yonguso], many understand this to be not unrelated to the future political composition. [No] This was done out of an intention to improve the image of the research center and get actual help, while excluding the tendency to view research centers as means for individual political maneuvering. It has nothing to do with political preparations. Yi Pu-yong Interview DP in Need of Reform Groups [Interviewer] You are openly putting the brakes on PP Yi's policy line. [Yi] Taking the long view, we must gain tangible results in, for example, changing or abolishing immoral laws, for there to be less of a burden on the DP. How will we handle public criticism of the DP if we end up only playing the best man in this? Even though we get some criticism from the conservative media right away, we need to highlight disputed points of the National Security Law, Agency for National Security Planning Law, Communications Secrecy Protection Law, etc. PP Yi's new line avoids the formation of issues to dispute. We need to highlight points of dispute and secure these, if for nothing else than as important assets for gaining support for the DP and for preparing for the local-government elections. A clear, strong tone in the DP would also for the benefit of PP Yi himself. This is because, rather than coming undone at accusations of insubstantial leadership, to gain tangible results for securing democratization, liberalization and a foundation for unification would be to take on the form of a genuine, 21st-century leader. [Interviewer] There are also those who view with misgivings the image of reform groups within the party. [Yi] I have determined not to hold dual membership in another faction while belonging to a reform group. I plan to participate in a more organized way in party-line-related discussion groups in the future. This must not happen, and probably won't, but even people who ridicule and are unhappy with reform groups will need them in the DP to get themselves elected in the next elections. Isn't it difficult to imagine a DP without reform groups? Yi Chol Interview Make All Party Management Public [Interviewer] What is your reason for saying the party has no principles? [Yi] Official meetings such as the party executive committee and party general meetings have almost become nominal. There are even times when, in the case of the executive committee, meetings are not held because of the party president's personal schedule. The party platform has to be decided in the party executive committee. But only the co-presidents' council [choegouiwon hoeui] is held; conflicting opinions are processed and spit out without being made into conclusions. In the selection of party officials, etc., they are only concerned with dividing the spoils in the next convention, thus exposing the chaos of the party. As a result, among party lawmakers and party members, there is almost no consent to party decisions or mood of confidence in the future. [Interviewer] Could you point out some concrete problems which have appeared? [Yi] A representative example would be the selection of party officials after the party national convention. This should have been done fairly, but after being put off for five or six months and selection principles being reversed several times, it ended in an unprecedented dividing of the spoils contrary to the party constitution and regulations and even the rules of the personnel selection committee. Completely unknown figures whose past it is impossible to know suddenly occupied important positions. There was even a case in which body guards were placed in positions requiring special expertise. When I protested this, PP Yi responded, "Doesn't someone have to guard documents and protect offices?" While implementing the budget, some of the leadership pay not a cent in party fees. Also, with personal interests involved, important districts and the position of standing committee chairman go to totally unqualified people. In short, things are happening which go beyond common sense. In the future, all aspects of party management will have to be made public: financial problems, the party-platform decision process, the deliberation process of the Chogang [no Chinese characters were provided in the text so I was unable to determine the correct English translation] special committee, etc. Chong Tae-chol Interview More To Gain Than Lose From an "Opposition Merger" [Interviewer] There is strong opposition to an "opposition merger." [Chong] The opposition must band together in an anit-Kim Yong-sam line. Absorption merger, Hosokawa-style merger, whatever its form, it would be better to unite, than not to unite. This is to say that in order to win in our political agenda headed toward the presidential election, our fundamental principle is that we must unite, to include everyone from the opposition lawmakers to those out of office. If this is done on the premise of mutual concession, substantial compromise is possible. I know that there is opposition to this composition within the party, but it will be difficult to take office in the next presidential election if we cannot overcome the confusion in setting up an opposition candidate. I also meet personally with Pak Chan-chong, Kim Tong-kil, Yi Chong-chan and others. Although some won't tell their position on this, basically, they want to join the DP. [Interviewer] Some insist that it would be best to quickly select a candidate to run in the presidential election. [Chong] There is a greater probability that making our candidate visible now will have adverse effects. It's desirable that he come to the fore on his own through the competitive process after the party national convention. [Interviewer] Are you thinking of running in the next election? [Chong] There as been no change in my intention to take a shot at the presidential election. But for this, you have to be chosen by the people and by heaven, and there has to be a possibility of winning. To be honest, who comes out of the DLP is also important. [Interviewer] How do you view the idea of separating the party presidency and presidential candidacy? [Chong] As a general rule, the party presidency and presidential candidacy must go together for their strength to be amplified. This is a natural phenomenon, but, there's nothing wrong with dividing roles if it is warranted by conditions at that time. Kim Wong-ki Interview Little Possibility of Reform in Political Sector [Interviewer] What do you think of the "Three-Way Role-Division Debate"? [Kim] It seems to begin in the critical mindset that there has to be new leadership. With only one (of either established politicians or those out of office), we are unlikely to gain public support. To go in a reformist direction, but pursue stability in keeping with the current of the times, we have to acquire the support of those with whom we are friendly. I am mentioned along with CPs No Mu-hyon and Yi Pu-yong because, while an established politician, due to my duties I have often played the role of mediator in my contact and cooperation with politicians not in office and been involved in a lot of dialog. What is important here, however, is not who is being discussed, but our strategy for getting in office and the issue of party direction for forging ahead without stagnating. [Interviewer] How do you view the issue of reorganizing the political sector, about which there has only been a great deal of talk so far. [Kim] Only looking on the outside, the fact that we cannot go on like this is felt by all in the DLP as well. Just judging from the DLP lawmakers I have contact with, few in the DLP think of it as "my party." Just because President Kim Yong-sam says he wants to create a new situation, as though the prominent behavior of lawmakers is problematic, doesn't mean that it all works out 100 percent as he wants. For example, if the number of active lawmakers were small, it would be difficult for them to execute policy as they should. But it is difficult at present to follow his formula closely. Because politics are variable, an attempt at change will be made, whether it is temporary or gradual. Given the present circumstances, the probability of a reorganization of the political sector with the DP as a partner is not very high. In a government-led reorganization of the political sector, if DLP lawmakers consider possible gains and losses when it has gone in the ruling party's direction, few of them will judge there to be much actually to be gained from it. Kim Sang-hyon Interview Someone Should Run in Kim Yong-sam's District [Interviewer] What political culture must the DP improve? [Kim] To prevent the weakening of district chapters and open a way for fresh personalities to participate, passing through a vote in which over 300 representatives participate, the total number of members of the National Assembly and candidates for local government must gradually increase. Things are difficult with the present regulations calling for over 50 persons. Also, the list of representatives must be made public at least ten days ahead of time and candidates must be given an opportunity to contact them. Taking as an example the experience of the last party national convention, representatives came up unknown to even the deputy chairmen and head officials and several hundred letters sent out to representatives were returned, even the district chapters did not know their addresses. [Interviewer] Is the "Shared Roles Debate" still in effect? [Kim] Inasmuch as no opposition party has ever gained office through a direct election, democratic forces must take office in the next election at all costs. This idea suggests that the Honam faction play the role of kingmaker. The Honam faction takes control of party leadership and a non-Honam faction provides the presidential candidate. Anyway, I'm saying that I won't break up things in order to become president. We can also put forward fresh a personality as presidential candidate. If I become party president, I have a strategy and plan for winning in the next presidential election. For example, the party president chosen in the next national convention would run in President Kim Yong-sam's Pusan district. Whether or not he wins, he must get publicity. Because we must win in the local-government and general elections to be victorious in the presidential election, the party president must lead the way, bearing the cross and showing the public a responsible posture. Even if the party president, one man, looses, it could be a good opportunity for stirring up a DP wind. [Interviewer] Who do you think of as possible next-generation leaders? [Kim] We can count on Chong Tae-chol, Yi Pu-yong, and Yi Chol.
