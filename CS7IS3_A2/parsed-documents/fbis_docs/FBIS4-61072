As became known today from informed sources within the office of the chairman of the Italian Council of Ministers, the Russian president had sent a message to Carlo Azeglio Ciampi in which he noted the head of the Italian Government's great contribution to attaining agreement on Russian participation in examining political issues of international security and in preparing the meeting's final political document. This decision, the message notes, creates good prerequisites for the Naples meeting to become an important new milestone in relations between Russia and the G-7. As is known, in late April, C.A. Ciampi told B. Yeltsin about a preliminary timetable and the form of Russian participation in the forthcoming summit. The head of government of Italy, the country that currently holds the G-7 presidency, made considerable efforts to ensure that the Naples summit be held as "seven plus one." It is noteworthy that Russia will not only take part in discussing political problems, but will also be directly involved in preparations for the Naples conference. B. Yeltsin's letter says that he has instructed the Russian Federation Government to join most actively in preparations for the summit.
