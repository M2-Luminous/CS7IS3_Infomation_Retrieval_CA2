The co-administrators will take responsibility for any legal matters applicable to the former state president, executive council or ministers of state or parliamentary members. Dr van der Walt and Mr Mokgoro's functions will include re- establishment of good government in Bophuthatswana, the restoration of essential services, suspension of the constitution and promotion of free political activity to facilitate the holding of free and fair elections. They will have the power to make laws for peace, order and good government and may amend, substitute or repeal any such law. The Independent Electoral Commission Act, the Transitional Executive Council Act, the Independent Broadcasting Authority Act and the Electoral Act of the Republic of South Africa will apply in Bophuthatswana. The joint administrators will take responsibility for all liabilities and obligations incurred by the Bophuthatswana government before March 12. They will also be liable for any legal action against the former homeland before the decree. Public property in possession of anyone who held office under the former government will be recovered.
