The agreement was reached at a high-level party-government meeting presided over by DLP Chairman Kim Chong-pil on Tuesday morning, called to hear the government report on the rupture of inter-Korean talks on exchanging special envoys and the threat made by North Korea's chief delegate, DLP spokesman Ha Sun-pong said. Deputy Prime Minister and National Unification Minister Yi Yung- tug said the North was balking to obtain more concessions from Washington in future talks and to strengthen its grip on the North Korean people in the event of possible U.N. sanctions. North Korea will continue to antagonize the South, while laying the blame for the failed inter-Korean talks on Seoul and stepping up propaganda against the South Korean Government, he predicted. "The government will pursue a North Korea policy aimed at co- existence and co-prosperity on the basis of harmony between international cooperation and national efforts," he said. "The door of dialogue remains open but the government is in no hurry to resume dialogue." Yi said the basic goal of Seoul's North Korea policy is to maintain peace, adding that the government has the power and will to do so. Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu discussed measures the government will take to solve the problem including increased pressure on Pyongyang through international cooperation, developing management power to prevent the situation from abruptly worsening, and establishing a defense system capable of responding to any unexpected crisis. The door of dialogue was left open so that North Korea may be persuaded to give up its isolationist and confrontational policy and open up to the world, Han said. Efforts to resume inter-Korean dialogue will be made in parallel with an increase in international pressure on Pyongyang, he added. He warned that a hard-line policy toward North Korea now could stymie international attempts to deal with the communist state. Under the basic strategy of preventing war on the Korean peninsula and deterring Pyongyang from developing nuclear weapons, the government will step up multilateral and bilateral cooperation with the United Nations, the United States, China and other countries, he said. On U.S.-North Korea talks, Han said dialogue channels between Washington and Pyongyang must remain open in spite of the ruptured inter-Korean dialogue, because such channels are essential to North Korea's acceptance of nuclear inspections and in curbing the North's destructive acts. Noting that China is playing a greater role in the U.N. Security Council, Han said President Kim Yong-sam would ask Beijing to help resolve the problem during his visit there next week. He said China's abstention in a vote on a North Korean resolution at the International Atomic Energy Agency's board of governors meeting on Monday was not unexpected considering its policy calling for a solution through dialogue.
