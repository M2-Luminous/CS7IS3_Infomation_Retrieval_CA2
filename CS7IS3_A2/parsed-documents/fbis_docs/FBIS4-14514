Showing that the previous deadline was 1 January 1994, then postponed "to avoid trouble before the 27 February elections," the paper writes: "The poll is gone, and its returns known: The agrarians hold the majority in the legislative and together with the socialists (former communists and also Russian-speakers of the `Edinstvo-Unity' movement) they hold two-thirds of all deputy seats. Is this why the deadline for the examination is still uncertain?" -- the daily wonders. "As a matter of fact, the majority's stand is known. The socialists and Russian-speakers made a big fuss, while electioneering, about the enforcement of the state language law. But they circumvented the content of the law. For, the law-makers meant that the examination to be passed only by the executives of the state enterprises and institutions and the functionaries (of the same state institutions) who get into direct touch with the public. It was only they who ought to have acquired the least knowledge of Romanian language inside six years. "But, in order to be more convincing, to infuriate their own electorate, the Russian-speaking leaders threatened that the whole population having a different mother-tongue would be fired unless it complied with the above-mentioned provision. Too preposterous to need further comment. But it is just as true that a number of Russians, which is not at all inconsequential, hold leading offices with state institutions and they have not learned Romanian, hoping for a return to the old rules. For, that is what the respective leaders want: The Russian to become a state language once more, along with the language of the majority population, which they call "`Moldovan.'"
