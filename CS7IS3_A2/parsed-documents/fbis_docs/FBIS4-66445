(Tokyo Electric), has developed a simple, convenient technology for converting the ozone- layer-destroying specific freon into harmless substances on the spot, wherever the freon was recovered from refrigerators or automobile air-conditioners. In FY94, Tokyo Electric plans to produce a test machine to do the conversion for performance evaluation purposes. The technology is based on the photolysis of freon by ultraviolet light from a mercury lamp and the separation of unreacted freon from chlorine gas by a gas separating membrane. Thus far, Tokyo Electric has been able to demonstrate the treatment capacity of 50 g in eight hours for an experimental device. The device will be scaled up with improved efficiency in the test machine for future commercialization. This device -- involving photolysis with ultraviolet light at normal temperature and under normal pressure -- is so simple and convenient with its on-the-spot conversion of freon from refrigerators and automobile air-conditions that it is expected to be implemented soon. One of the specified types of freon, CFC12, is the coolant that is almost exclusively used for refrigerators and auto air-conditioners. In all likelihood, requirements in the near future will specify that CFC12 must be recovered from these cooling devices prior to their disposal and must be converted into safe substances at places where used refrigerators are collected and at automobile factories. The basic segment of the new, UV-light-using freon-decomposition device, developed jointly by Tokyo Electric and Kansai New Technology Research Institute, consists simply of ultraviolet lamps and a gas separation membrane. Noting that the chlorine atoms of freon are detached by ultraviolet rays in the stratosphere, the joint team devised a device that separates chlorine atoms from freon by irradiating ultraviolet rays in a reaction vessel and that recovers chlorine gas by means of the gas separation membrane. Ultraviolet rays sever the carbon-chlorine bonds in a freon molecule. Carbon and fluorine, which remain combined, are recovered as powdery fluoro-polymers. Thus far, the joint team has been able to confirm the decomposition of five different types of specified freon and has demonstrated that any freon mixture with lubricating oil can be handled by the device, if the oil can be separated from freon by taking advantage of the difference in the boiling points prior to the photolytic decomposition. Today, the device, which uses two 32-watt low-pressure mercury lamps, can be continuously operated to process 50 g of freon in eight hours. The basic technology of the device has been essentially proven to be satisfactory, and the prospect is bright for increasing the processing capacity by combining a number of reactors. Tokyo Electric plans to build a pilot model with improved capacity through modifications that include improving the efficiency of ultraviolet-ray utilization by surrounding the reactor with reflective boards. The model is expected to be tested for its performances by the end of FY94 prior to production of a commercial-scale device. In 1992, Tokyo Electric, in cooperation with the Agency of Industrial Science and Technology, had developed a mass concentration-type device that could decompose freon with 10,000�C heat from a plasma torch. However, the new, more compact device, with smaller capacity, is expected to be commercialized soon because it can be conveniently handled right at the places of recovery for used refrigerators and car air-conditioners. The joint team has thus far spent only approximately ¥40 million for the development of this device, which has such bright prospects for commercialization, by taking full advantage of computer chemistry for clarifying the reaction mechanisms.
