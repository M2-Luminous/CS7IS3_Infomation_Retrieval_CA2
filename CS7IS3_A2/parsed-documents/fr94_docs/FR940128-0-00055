FR940128-0-00055 FR940128-0-00022 For the reasons set out in the preamble, 50 CFR part 675 is amended as follows: PART 675_GROUNDFISH FISHERY OF THE BERING SEA AND ALEUTIAN ISLANDS AREA 1. The authority citation for 50 CFR part 675 continues to read as follows: Authority: 16 U.S.C. 1801, et seq. 2. In §675.20, paragraphs (a)(2)(iv), (a)(2)(v), and (a)(3)(iv) are added to read as follows: §675.20 General limitations. (a) *␣*␣* (2) *␣*␣* (iv) Applicable through December 31, 1996. (A) The TAC of Pacific cod, after subtraction of reserves, will be allocated 2 percent to vessels using jig gear, 44 percent to vessels using hook-and-line or pot gear, and 54 percent to vessels using trawl gear. The Regional Director may establish separate directed fishing allowances and prohibitions authorized under paragraphs (a)(8) and (a)(9) of this section for vessels harvesting Pacific cod using jig gear, hook-and-line or pot gear, or trawl gear. (B) If during a fishing year the Regional Director determines that vessels using trawl gear or hook-and-line or pot gear will not be able to harvest the entire amount of Pacific cod allocated to those vessels under paragraph (a)(2)(iv) of this section, then NMFS may reallocate the projected unused amount of Pacific cod to vessels harvesting Pacific cod using the other gear type(s) through publication in the Federal Register . (C) On or about September 1 of each year, the Regional Director will reallocate 45 percent of any unused amount of Pacific cod allocated to vessels using jig gear to vessels using hook-and-line or pot gear and 55 percent of any unused amount of Pacific cod allocated to vessels using jig gear to vessels using trawl gear through publication in the Federal Register . (v) Applicable through December 31, 1996. In the publications of proposed and final harvest limit specifications required under §675.20(a) of this part, the Secretary, after consultation with the Council, may seasonally apportion the amount of Pacific cod TAC allocated to vessels using hook-and-line or pot gear under paragraph (a)(2)(iv) of this section among the following three periods: January 1 through April 30; May 1 through August 31; and September 1 through December 31. The Secretary will base any seasonal apportionment of the Pacific cod allocation for vessels using hook-and-line or pot gear on the following information: (A) Seasonal distribution of Pacific cod relative to prohibited species distribution; (B) Expected variations in prohibited species bycatch rates experienced in the Pacific cod fisheries throughout the fishing year; and (C) Economic effects of any seasonal apportionment of Pacific cod on the hook-and-line and pot-gear fisheries. (3) *␣*␣* (iv) Applicable through December 31, 1996. Any amounts of the nonspecific reserve that are apportioned to Pacific cod as provided by paragraph (b) of this section must be apportioned between vessels using jig, hook-and-line or pot, and trawl gear in the same proportion specified in paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(A) of this section, unless the Regional Director determines under paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(B) of this section or paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(C) of this section that vessels using a certain gear type will not be able to harvest the additional amount of Pacific cod. In this case, the nonspecific reserve will be apportioned to vessels using the other gear type(s). * * * * * [FR Doc. 94&hyph;1871 Filed 1&hyph;25&hyph;94; 2:15 pm] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;22&hyph;P
