Will the closure imposed on the territories be lifted? [Peres] If the knives are set aside, the closure will be lifted. This time, however, they -- not just we -- will have an interest in removing the knives. They will be in charge of the well-being of the people. They will be in charge of their income, their security, and they will have to maintain relations with Israel that enable them to resume work in Israel. Previously, a Palestinian interest that focused on opposite goals was created. This time they have an interest in running their self-government. [Sukenik] For example, do you foresee the possibility that Shaykh Ahmad Yasin, the founder of Hamas, will be released from prison? [Peres] If Ahmad Yasin announces he is for peace and against violence -- and not that he opposes violence only within the territories, as he previously said -- I am for releasing him. He is an old man with paralyzed legs. All that he has left is a mouth and a head. If he calls on his people to stop terrorism and embark on the path of negotiations, we will sit with him.
