Today, work is already under way to form a new government. According to Forza Italia leader Silvio Berlusconi it will be ready by the end of the month. Outgoing Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi has sent a cable to former speakers Giovanni Spadolini and Giorgio Napolitano to thank them on behalf of the government for their complete impartiality and for their deep understanding of the state -- Ciampi wrote -- with which they have ensured that parliamentary work has made good progress. He also stressed the correctness of the constitutional relationship between the government and the parties of the opposition. [passage omitted] President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro will start to hold consultations to form a government on Thursday 21 April. The new prime minister is almost certain to be appointed after 25 April. [passage omitted] In the Senate the problem of a too slender majority remains for Berlusconi. It is a problem of numbers, but above all it is a political problem. For this reason Berlusconi has adopted a strategy of focusing on the center. He has denied buying votes [in yesterday's parliamentary speakers elections]: Our majority has shown that it is concrete, but needs to be widened. The message was aimed at the PPI [Italian People's Party]. Nicola Mancino, [outgoing interior minister and newly appointed PPI spokesperson in the Chamber of Deputies, [PPI deputy Rosy] Bindi, and [PPI chairperson] Jervolino have said that he will never get their votes, but Berlusconi knows that other members of the PPI are less extreme and he is waiting.
