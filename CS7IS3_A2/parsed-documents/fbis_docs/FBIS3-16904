Haldre will be charged with the waste of state funds. The State Inspection Office accused the radio management in paying excessive wages and meeting questionable travel expenses. The situation is complicated by a legal inadequacy since there is no legal procedure for dismissing the head of the radio. The national broadcasting statute stipulates that the radio is subordinated to the "Presidium of the Supreme Soviet", a body that no longer exists, while no document determines the relations of the radio director and the Riigikogu. Chairman of the parliamentary culture commission Sulev Alajde explained that the commission may recommend the Riigikogu to approve a new law on broadcasting and to keep Haldre in office for the time being. Haldre is currently abroad and the Estonian Radio is headed by Paul Himma.
