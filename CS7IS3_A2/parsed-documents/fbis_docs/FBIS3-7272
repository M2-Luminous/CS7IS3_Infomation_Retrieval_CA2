Standing in a street in the town that had been Khmer Rouge headquarters in northwest Cambodia, the general referred to allegations -- disputed by Bangkok -- of Thai military assistance to the guerrilla faction. "I think the capture of Pailin may signal the end of the close, lucrative relations between the Thai military, Thai businessmen and the Khmer Rouge," General Kieng Sokun said. The Khmer Rouge financed their guerrilla organization by selling gem-mining and logging concessions to primarily Thai businesses, many of which were allegedly controlled by or had links with the Thai military. Government officers earlier charged the Thai military had transported fresh guerrillas along the border to help in the recent counter-attack at Anlung Veng, another major Khmer Rouge base that the government captured and then lost. Signs of Thai presence were everywhere in Pailin. Road signs in both Khmer and Thai languages reminded drivers to "keep right" -- Thais drive on the left side of the road -- and logs throughout the area bore signs in Thai indicating the quality of the wood. Large craters left by the search for gems scarred the area. One general said 85 Khmer Rouge guerrillas had been killed since soldiers reached the area March 19, and troops had seized more than 100 tons of ammunition, several hundred tons of rice and 1,021 weapons and one T-54 tank. General Pol Saroeun, deputy chief of the general staff who had arrived by helicopter to move his command post into Pailin, said government casualties were light but gave no figures. Mines, malaria and water poisoned by the guerrillas were the main problems, he said. Unusually heavy rains hampered the troops' progress but also provided safe drinking water. General Pol Saroeun said it was premature to think the guerrillas were defeated. "Even though the Khmer Rouge will not be able to make new money from gems, rubies or selling logs in this area, I think the money they have earned already could still help them buy new weapons to counterattack us," he said. But another general said the government forces had dealt the radical Khmer Rouge a major blow and vowed to hold the resource-rich region forever. "If we cannot hold this place forever, we do not deserve to be called the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces," General Kieng Sokun said as he stood in Pailin's main street outside a luxurious, three-story building believed to be a hotel where important visitors had been housed. Opposite the hotel was a garden with manicured lawns, bouganvilla and assorted ornamental flowers. Down the road was a cinema hall and a newly built hospital. There were only several hundred troops in Pailin, but General Pol Saroeun said there were about 4,000 men around the rebel base and the hills along the Thai border to the west. An AFP reporter could hear only sporadic shelling in the hills behind Pailin. There was occasional gunfire in the town from soldiers shooting in the air in celebration. Soldiers also rode bicycles left by fleeing guerrilla families and collected booty from abandoned houses. One group leaving the city had a cow in tow, and live chickens and ducks were tied by their feet to the soldiers' AK-47 assault rifles.
