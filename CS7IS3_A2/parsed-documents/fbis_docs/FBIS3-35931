On 28 January 1994, under the mediation of Russia and with the participation of representatives of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, talks were held at the Russian Foreign Ministry between the Georgian and Abkhaz sides. The talks lasted from 0900 till midnight but, unfortunately, ended without result. The four-party agreement on the voluntary repatriation of refugees and displaced persons was not implemented. Many hours of exhausting work and searching for agreement and compromise produced a document. However, the Abkhaz side demanded from participants in the talks that persons wishing to return to permanent places of residence who had taken part in combat operations should not be covered by security guarantees. The Georgian side categorically refuses to discriminate between refugees on the grounds of their participation or non-participation in hostilities. Almost all the population, including Georgians, Abkhazians, and other nationalities living in Abkhazia, was involved in the conflict. To punish people who took up arms to defend themselves and their relatives is a serious violation of human rights and an infringement of presumption of innocence. By blaming only the Georgian population, Gudauta makes another attempt to legitimize ethnic cleansing and disguise its desire to prevent a peaceful settlement.
