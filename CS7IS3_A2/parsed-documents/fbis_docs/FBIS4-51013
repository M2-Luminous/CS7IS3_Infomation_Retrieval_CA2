Aiming To Support the Independence of Tibet, Taiwan The Report quotes a 1943 British diplomatic document, saying: "The British Government has always been willing to recognize China's suzerainty over Tibet; however, such recognition must be based on an understanding of Tibet's autonomy"; at the same time, the document maintained that Tibet should be allowed "fuller autonomy" when necessary, and proposed that the British Government "hold discussions on the issue of Tibet's right to self-determination" with its Chinese counterpart. Those who have a knowledge of politics see clearly that suzerainty and sovereignty are two entirely different concepts; the nationality-defined autonomous region within a sovereign country and the relations between a metropolis and its vassal are basically different. The so-called recognition of China's "suzerainty" and Tibet's "fuller autonomy" referred to in the document is precisely meant to violate China's sovereignty, so that Tibet would leave the Chinese Government's jurisdiction and realize its independence in disguise under the pretext of "autonomy." The reason why the British Parliament shows such extraordinary concern over Tibet lies -- just as the report says -- in "the historical ties between Britain and Tibet." Such "ties" actually stem from the shameful history of Britain's invasion of China's Tibet and its intervention in Tibetan affairs. Regrettably, the British have the guts to glorify themselves with that incident. Back in 1888 and 1903, when Britain met with strong resistance in its invasion of Tibet, Britain changed its strategy and took the goal of separating Tibet from China. In 1907, when imperial Russia signed the "Treaty on the British-Russian Alliance," which aimed to contend for Central Asia, it had -- for the first time in history -- misrepresented China's sovereignty over Tibet and changed it into "suzerainty." At the Simla Conference in 1913, with participation of British and Tibetan delegates, the British Government required the Chinese Government to recognize the "autonomy of outer Tibet (including Tibet and western Sikang)," and "refrain from intervening in its internal affairs," with the effect of changing China's sovereignty over Tibet into suzerainty. Thanks to the strong opposition of the Chinese Government, the British attempt to sever Tibet from China was never successful. This shows that the British Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Select Committee is actually playing the same old tune and Britain has never given up its effort to separate Tibet from China. The so-called "violation of human rights in Tibet and threats to Tibetan cultural and religious characteristics" are nothing but pretexts. The report asserts, "a satisfactory solution to anxieties over the former (human rights violations) will be possible only by making progress in the latter (the Tibetan right to self-determination); this statement reveals the aforementioned British effort. If we examine Tibet's actual conditions, in the 43 years since its peaceful liberation, it has thoroughly abolished the extremely backward feudal serfdom, and, consequently, a million former serfs have taken the bright road of modernization. There is a world of difference between the present human rights conditions and those under the previous rule of slave owners in Tibet. The so-called "human rights violations" are obviously a deliberate exaggeration, and even a fabrication at that. According to the report's own words, "signs of a thaw" in the "rigid" relations between the British Government and Taiwan have surfaced in recent years. In 1992, Britain appointed a diplomat to the general executive office of the Committee for British-Taiwan Trade (which was later changed into the British Office for Trade and Culture.) For the first time, the British Minister of Trade paid Taipei an official visit in 1993. Since Chris Patten's arrival in Hong Kong, the British Hong Kong Government has kept one eye shut, given silent consent, and tolerated the Taiwan Authorities when they conduct activities in a governmental capacity as well as the high-sounding activities of Taiwan governmental organizations in Hong Kong. While expressing admiration for such tendencies, the report says, "it is suggested that the Government should reassess the status of the Taiwan office in Britain," "relax related restrictions," and even "propose closer ties between Westminster and Taiwan's Legislative Yuan." Furthermore, it expresses the hope that the international community "will help Taiwan pursue its goal of obtaining official status in the world." In actual fact, this aims to maintain and expand the separation of Taiwan and mainland China, tolerating and supporting Taiwan independence, and thus directly violating the position and commitment the British Government has openly taken on the "Taiwan issue." British Strategy of Disintegration The report links its position on the issues of Tibet, Taiwan, and Hong Kong, and it is not difficult to see that the truth behind all this can be summed up with but one word: "independence." Specifically, by supporting the independence of Tibet, Taiwan, and Hong Kong, Britain seeks to secure "Britain's essential interests" and protect and expand its influence. There are several differences: In Tibet, the British want to recover their lost influence; in Taiwan they want to expand their influence; and in Hong Kong, they want to protect and maintain their special vested interests. The British have bet their largest stake on Hong Kong. Because 1997 is approaching, Britain knows pretty well that its influence in Hong Kong is continuously dwindling. That being the case, it is simultaneously playing the "Tibet card" and the "Taiwan card" so as to more powerfully contain mainland China. At the same time, it is attempting to join hands with the EC and the United States to jointly deal with mainland China. Thus, the report calls on "the world to concern itself with the Tibet issue" and is pinning high hope on international public opinion toward the Hong Kong issue. In addition, the report has done its best to sow discord between China and its neighboring countries and has brazenly alleged that "other countries, especially China's northern and western neighboring countries, will show increasingly greater interest in how China is treating other minority nationalities," in an attempt to tempt those countries to work for Britain. What are some British politicians really after? After some further analysis of the report, we find that some British politicians have become psychologically imbalanced when faced with the rapid growth of China's national strength and its increasingly elevated position in the world. They do not want to see a powerful China and are being unable to forget their dreams of splitting and weakening China and making China return to the state of disintegration of the 1940's. Beyond a shadow of a doubt, that is the general goal of the British politicians' proposal for a policy toward China. The report supports Hong Kong, Tibet, and Taiwan to pursue independence in disguise, and calls Macao China's "neighboring country." It instigates foreign intervention in China's minority nationality issues, along with the creation of public opinion on disharmony between the central and local governments in China. All this is being done in pursuit of "disintegration" and represent important steps in their general policy toward China. Out of the need to maintain its rule over Hong Kong in the past, Britain was not in the position to openly intervene in Taiwan affairs, nor dared it be excessively aggressive over the Tibet issue. Now, the British seem to have no misgivings whatsoever; in addition to the tremendous changes in the world situation in the late 1980's, Britain has eventually changed its entire policy toward China, including its policies toward Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Tibet. Regarding the British strategy of disintegration, a report written by British International Strategy Society early this year contained a relatively detailed discussion of the plan, and may serve as a footnote to the British Parliament report. China Is Able To Face Any Challenges The Chinese Government has repeatedly reiterated that the Tibet and Taiwan issues and Hong Kong affairs after its return to China in 1997 are purely China's internal affairs, and no foreign forces have the right to intervene. It is absurd that the report should link opposing intervention in another country's internal affairs to "restricting the freedom of speech of the citizen of another country." Just as was indicated by Hong Kong media, should the Chinese discuss the issue of Northern Ireland, it is believed that Britain would not tolerate it. Especially considering that the issues of Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Tibet have a bearing on China's national security and stability. Facing such major issues of principle, there is no leeway for the Chinese Government. Furthermore, in recent years, China has enjoyed a stable political situation, social solidarity, and sustained rapid economic growth. Facts have shown that China has sufficient confidence and strength to face challenges from any international forces. At the same time, China's relations with peripheral countries have been consolidated and developed, and some Western countries are showing their friendliness one after another. The current world situation is favorable to China as well. In contrast, British domestic issues are piling up, and the Major government can do nothing to improve the situation. The Conservatives are suffering from a confidence crisis which grows increasingly serious with every passing day. In recent British local parliamentary elections, the Conservatives have been reduced to a third party. At the international level, British influence within the EC has all along been insignificant, and its relations with the United States are far from what they used to be. With increasingly greater importance being attached to economic factors, the British attempt to join hands with international forces to deal with China is undoubtedly wishful thinking. In the final analysis, all factors have decided that any evil plots to split China will be in vain.
