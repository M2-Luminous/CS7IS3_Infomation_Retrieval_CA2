FBIS4-2532 "drchi070_n_94006" FBIS-CHI-94-070 Daily Report 12 Apr 1994 Economic & Agricultural First `Investment Fund' Listed in Shenzhen First `Investment Fund' Listed in Shenzhen HK1104002494 Beijing CHINA DAILY (BUSINESS WEEKLY) in English 10-16 Apr 94 p 6 HK1104002494 Beijing CHINA DAILY (BUSINESS WEEKLY) English BFN [By staff reporter: "Investment Fund Listed in Shenzhen"] [Text] The first standardized investment fund, the Tianji Fund, has recently been listed on the Shenzhen Securities Exchange. The Tianji Fund was established in January 1993 by Fund Management Co of China Shenzhen Investment Fund Management Co Ltd (SIFM). A total of 581.47 million yuan's ($66.8 million) worth of fund units were issued, at a price of 1.03 yuan (11.8 cents) apiece. Tianji Fund's organizational framework, internal operations and management are based on international standards. The responsibilities of the manager and trustee are clearly separated to ensure that the trustee effectively supervises the manager. Tianji Fund is designed to increase assets while spreading risks through diversified investments, as well as to service small and medium investors. Its portfolio includes securities, real estate, money markets and share rights. As the first fund management company, SIFM is cultivating foreign partners to develop overseas business. According to officials of Tianji, China's emerging securities market has more individual and fewer institutional investors. It is widely recognized that the lack of institutional investors is the main cause of the stock market's persistent sluggishness. An investment fund is necessary to stabilize the market and stimulate the development of capital markets the Tianji officials say. The listing of the Tianji Fund marks a new stage in institutional investment in securities, fund officials say. However, many problems stand in the way of the development of such funds in China, such as the absence of effective laws. Few funds in China are based on international regulations, and China itself has only one document governing investment funds -- the Contemporary Regulations on Investment Fund Management, issued by the Shenzhen municipal government. Comprehensive laws are urgently needed to ensure that funds can operate properly and orderly, Tianji officials say. In this respect, China can learn from other countries in building its own system.
