I want to express my opinion that this visit has been extremely successful. It has demonstrated once again that we must indeed be partners and must deepen that partnership. We must indeed live together on this small planet and try to ensure peace and security, not only in our two countries but throughout the world. I thank you, Mr. President, for taking advantage of the opportunity and for getting to know the people of Russia, the people of Moscow--in the streets, in shops, at Ostankino, and in other places--and for seeing for yourself that the people want reform and for seeing that the people want freedom and democracy. I think that you have obtained a better knowledge of the people of Russia during the visit, and the people of Russia now have a better idea of the President of the United States of America. I want to wish you bon voyage on your return journey, happiness to your families, and prosperity to America and the American people.
