Good evening, Mr. Scharping. [Scharping] Good evening, Mr. Wickert. [Wickert] Is it not necessary for a party leader to be authoritarian occasionally? [Scharping] In any case, he should know what he wants, what his goals are, and how they can be realized together with the party. [Wickert] What do you want? [Scharping] A policy that ensures social justice and that takes the people in Germany seriously, that fights against unemployment, and that guarantees inner peace in this country on the basis of completely solid finances. [Wickert] Well, this is what everybody wants. However, where are you leading your party as far as the program is concerned? [Scharping] We confirmed again today that economic growth, entrepreneurial initiatives, competitive jobs, and ecological progress are indivisibly linked. We suggested a number of individual measures in this respect, including very specific proposals for families with small children -- uniform family allowances, a tax exemption for the subsistence minimum, and other measures, for example. [Wickert] Let me ask you how you have led the party here? [Scharping] I hope that I have ensured that the SPD concentrates on these important issues and adopts a clear profile. [Wickert] What are your guidelines as far as contents are concerned? [Scharping] I tell everybody my view. If I hear better arguments, I am glad because one should never rule out that one can learn something. I was negligent in the tax debate in that I forgot to add the word taxable in connection with income limits. If somebody points out such a mistake, this is a necessary and important correction. By the way, my style is leadership through arguments and teamwork, clear decisions, and the joint implementation of decisions. [Wickert] This is not really authoritarian. You have also been accused of failing to present an unclear program. [Scharping] I consider both accusations wrong. Actually, both of them are new to me. I have never been accused of being authoritarian before. I have the impression that certain people are overreacting. Assertiveness is certainly a good quality in a party chairman. One must also have clear goals. Yet one cannot issue orders. One cannot lead a party like the SPD, which has about 900,000 members, like a military unit. [Wickert] Well, nobody is demanding that. However, a firm hand is needed sometimes. Do you have a firm hand? [Scharping] I think so, if it is required. This has become clear during various debates in the past -- at our party conference, and before and after that. I only hope that there will not be too many situations in which one must not only lead, but show a firm hand. That is not my style. However, if it is necessary, I will be able to cope with it. [Wickert] Has Mr. Zoepel's resignation prompted the large extent of agreement today? [Scharping] No. It existed before that event. We specified -- improved, I believe -- the government program in numerous areas today. The debate was worthwhile. After all, we are the only party that discusses its government program with committed and well-informed citizens at 200 public events. This is a sign of open and living democracy. This is our policy. [Wickert] Well, this is the way you present your party to the public. Yet what happens within the party is also important, whether there will be quarrels. [Scharping] We will have to wait and see. However, I am convinced that the SPD will continue to be what it has always been and what it is: A reform-oriented people's party that holds discussions, that defines its policy, and on which one can rely. [Wickert] Thank you very much, Mr. Scharping.
