Talbott was named to replace Clifton Wharton, Clinton's highest-ranking black official, who resigned on November 8 last year under pressure after eight months of intense criticism of Clinton's foreign policy team for the handling of the Bosnia, Somalia and Haiti issues. The vote to confirm Talbott was 66-31. After the confirmation, Talbott will enter a key policy-making circle at the U.S. State department, responsible for overall management of the department. An expert on Russia and a longtime friend of President Clinton, Talbott was named last April as an ambassador-at-large to the former Soviet Union. Talbott, a native of Dayton, Ohio state of mid-west U.S., graduated from Yale University in 1968, and began his journalist career in 1971 when he was assigned to Eastern Europe as a correspondent for the U.S. "TIME" magazine. Among the most famous works he has done is the translation and editing of the three-volume memoir of the late Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev.
