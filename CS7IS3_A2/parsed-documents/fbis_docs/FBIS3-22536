The immediate objectives of the control programme, among others include the reduction and prevention of mortality and foetal wastage in pregnant woman by 70 percent, mortality in infants and children by 60 percent, morbidity due to malaria in pregnant women, infants and school children by 60 percent, all in five years. For the same period of five years, the control programme is expected to reduce fatality rate due to malaria by 80 percent in all health institutions in the Central Region and to reduce malaria transmission by 50 percent. According to the Malaria Action Plan for the Central Region 1993-1997, a copy of which is available to the GRAPHIC, the campaign will make anti-malaria drugs available and affordable to the general population and promote their rational use. The programme will also ensure proper treatment of pregnant women as early as possible and make early diagnoses, prompt and adequate treatment of malaria cases at all health centres. ``The control programme shall increase the awareness of the general population about the risk of malaria so as to promote community participation in malaria control activities in the context of Primary Health Care (PHC),'' states the action plan. As part of the programme, the use of impregnated bed nets will be introduced to all second cycle boarding institutions in the region in 1994. The first phase of the programme will last for five years and the second segment will start after the first phase. The control activities will start in all the 12 districts of the region simultaneously and each district will have an inter-sectoral committee to supervise the control programme. The action plan prepared by Dr. Richard Y. Osei, Regional Director of Medical Services, therefore, expressed the hope that all communities will co-operate with the eradication team to achieve success. In 1992, Cape Coast District recorded the highest malaria cases of 24,484 patients representing 23.10 percent of the total regional recording of 102,025 malaria cases. Awutu-Effutu-Senya district recorded the least cases of 3,010 or 2.1 percent of the regional recording.
