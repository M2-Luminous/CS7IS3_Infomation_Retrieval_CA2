They themselves are handing out rifles and drugs to the criminal elements who have set up shop in the Rio shantytowns. These figures are the target of an extensive investigation by the Federal Police (PF) that has already produced a dossier with about 50 names. Checking into the circumstances that led to the arrest of Detective Luiz Eduardo Sato and police informant Luiz Alexandre Ferreira, who were picked up on 4 February when they were carrying 22 kg of cocaine paste and ammunition for heavy weapons to the Andarai hillside, could help dismantle the connection between criminals dressed up as police and a branch of the international drug traffic. This hope was expressed by Lieutenant Governor and Secretary of the Civil Police Nilo Batista himself, speaking on the same day when the two were arrested. "If Detective Sato cooperates, the scheme used by traffickers from other countries to work in Brazil might be unveiled," Batista suggested. The problem is that, as one might expect, neither of the two prisoners seems willing to cooperate with the investigations. Sato, who has already been called to answer two administrative inquiries and has been separated from police work for two years now, said in his deposition at the Drug Enforcement Division (DRE) of the Civil Police that he had been told that traffickers from Andarai had received a shipment of drugs and so had decided to go up to the hill with the informant and seize the material. That was what he did. Using a car from the 37th Police Precinct on Governor's Island, he cleared the barricades set up by the bandits, went up the hill without being bothered, picked up the cocaine and the ammunition, and came back down. Not even Rambo could have done as well. The detective's explanation, however, is demolished when one remembers that policemen who have been separated from the service cannot carry out any kind of official operation. Furthermore, no one believes that a police car would find it so easy to reach the headquarters of the traffickers unless it had the consent of the hoodlums. "If two men acting alone can accomplish that kind of feat, I should start thinking about firing the troops from the Drug Enforcement Division, which has never done anything of the sort," commented Chief Walter Oliveira, who is in charge of the DRE. It was the ease with which Sato and Ferreira's car drove around the Andarai hillside that attracted the attention of the military police, who ended up arresting the two. The episode of the arrest, by the way, shows that there are many other interests behind Sato and Ferreira. The military police who stopped the two met with resistance from agents on duty at the 20th Police Precinct in Grajau, who refused to record the event on the police blotter. This was not done until after newspaper and magazine reporters arrived, having been mobilized by the MP's themselves. Furthermore, the detective and informant gave no convincing explanations as to why they were driving a police car without being authorized to do official work, and there are suspicions that agents from the Governor's Island precinct had cooperated with Sato. The head of the 37th precinct, Chief Jorge Barros, who could not explain this either, was relieved of his duties. Even if they do not provide any good leads for the Civil Police investigation, Sato and Ferreira are important pieces of the puzzle that the Federal Police are putting together. They are thought to be part of a gang that, according to police, is headed by Otto Gomes de Miranda, a black-market dealer in dollars who distributes cocaine, weapons, and ammunition on the hills of Rio de Janeiro. Miranda was arrested in Miami in April 1991 because he had been caught trying to return to Brazil with 13 AR-15 rifles and 55 machine guns and pistols. This dollar-trader and trafficker is at liberty in Rio since the police have not gathered enough evidence to arrest him. Although the investigations are only halfway completed, the arrest of Detective Sato and informant Ferreira has already had the effect of transforming an uncomfortable suspicion into a dramatic certainty: some Rio police are now sharing with the criminals the dirty work of the drug traffic. So, a reversal of roles that has been in the works for a long time has become a reality. It contributes to a situation where, with every passing day, the people of Rio de Janeiro become more afraid -- of both the bandits and those who are supposed to be enforcing the laws.
