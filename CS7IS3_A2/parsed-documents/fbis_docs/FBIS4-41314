The partnership relations which are taking shape between Moscow and Washington have had a positive effect on trade dialogue. In 1993 trade turnover between Russia and the United States increased 20 percent compared with 1992 and was $4.3 billion (in 1992 it was about $3.6 billion). There has been an almost threefold increase in exports -- from $639.9 million to $1.997 billion, which has made it possible in practice to reduce to a minimum the traditional deficit in reciprocal trade: In 1992 Russian exports were a little more than four times less than imports from the United States. Unfortunately the structure of trade turnover remains the same -- reciprocal deliveries are based on raw material and agricultural goods. At a time when machine building articles make up only 2 percent of Russian exports to the United States. An analysis conducted by experts on the eve of the Washington session showed that it is not so much the uncompetitive nature of many Russian goods which remain a serious obstacle in mutual trade as U.S. barriers on the path of high-technology items made in Russia and the tough antidumping legislation. That is why, when he set off across the ocean to take part in the intergovernment commission, Viktor Chernomyrdin was pursuing two more attendant aims. The first was to persuade legislators to repeal the notorious Jackson-Vanik amendments to the trade law which makes granting partners most-favored nation status dependent on freedom to leave those countries, while the second aim was to get the U.S. Administration to recognize Russia's status as a country with a transitional market economy. Viktor Chernomyrdin's meeting yesterday with President Bill Clinton and the talk the day before in the U.S. Congress seems to have advanced matters from a standstill. Viktor Stepanovich said that he "succeeded in persuading the U.S. Administration to grant Russia the status of a country with a transitional market economy" and Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy commented as follows on Moscow's request: "I think that restrictions on trade with Russia should be repealed and will be repealed. That will require a certain amount of work. But many restrictions are left from the cold war and they do not apply to the present day."
