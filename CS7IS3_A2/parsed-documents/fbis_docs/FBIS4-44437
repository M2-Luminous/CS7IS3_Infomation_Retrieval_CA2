They said there is no econmic development without unity. There is no stability without unity. Unity is the top concern of each of our national minorities. The Uighur people's congress representative, mayor of Kashen City Ablat Mehmetjou, said that Xinjiang's development is inexplicably tied to the assistance of the Han nationality and other national minorities. The facts of Kashen's economic and cultural development fully prove the veracity of "two inseparables." Without the help of the Han nationality, there could not have been Kashen's present prosperity and flourishing state. From a historical perspective, the development of national minorities is inseparable from the help of the Han nationality; we especially need the aid of the Han in science and technology. Today in economic development work, we need the Han nationality's help even more. We hope and welcome even more Han comrades to come and work in Kashen. Representatives of the Hasake nationality, Hadir, deputy secretary of the Aqintai area, and Kabul, chairman of the agriculture and animal husbandry committee of the Xinjiang autonomous region people's congress standing committee, should love and protect unity just as they love and protect their sight. Our national minorities' economic and cultural development can only be promoted if there is unity. For many years now the Aqintai area consistently has put unity work in first place. Our six counties and one city have become advanced model units of national minority unity, thus the entire area's economy and culture have swiftly developed and the people's livelihood has been rather greatly improved. Maizuremu Yusupu [6314 4371 3583 2606 3768 4790 3940], people's congress representative of the Uzbek nationality, and Kamil Kurmaif, people's congress representative of the Tatar nationality, said that the key to improving the quality of the national minorities lies in improving their cultural education work. Considering our minorities, we fully appreciate cultural education. Many Uzbek and Tatar national minorities hope to engage in education work and thus the proportion of college students exceeds that of other minorities. We hope the government will energetically stress national minority general education work. Xinjiang's economic growth will have a solid foundation only if Xinjiang's various minorities are well educated. Imam Haiguoen [3189 0948 1869], of Dayou village, Jimusaer [0679 2606 5646 1422] county mosque, a Muslim people's congress representative, said religious people must take the lead in being models of national minority unity. They should actively coordinate with the Party and the government to do a good job of nationality unity. Unity is a large framework that none can destroy. National minorities can truly attain development only in unity. I believe that Imam played an important role in national minority unity work.
