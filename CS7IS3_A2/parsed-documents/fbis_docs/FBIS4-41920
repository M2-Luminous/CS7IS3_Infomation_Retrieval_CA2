FBIS4-41920 "drsov125_g_94002" FBIS-SOV-94-125 Daily Report 28 Jun 1994 WESTERN REGION Belarus Lukashenka Claims Guards Blocked Entrance Lukashenka Claims Guards Blocked Entrance WS2806143494 Minsk Radio Minsk Network in Belarusian 1200 GMT 28 Jun 94 WS2806143494 Minsk Radio Minsk Network Belarusian BFN [Interview with presidential candidate Alyaksandr Lukashenka by Mikhail Rudkowski on 28 June; place not given -- recorded, in Russian] [Text] [Lukashenka] Today, escorted by official bodyguards provided to me by the Internal Affairs Ministry and accompanied by a motorcade, I went to my office at the House of Government. At the entrance, I was met by a colonel and lieutenant colonel. Having introduced themselves, they informed me that Internal Affairs Minister Danko had left orders that I not be allowed into the House of Government and my office. This was a scandalous violation of the Constitution and our nation's laws, [words indistinct] the law on the status of people's deputy. I told them about this. Escorted by the group of bodyguards officially assigned to me, as well as one unofficial bodyguard, I entered the House of Government. At the first guard post in the right wing, I was met by a group of militia officers; at least they were in uniforms, and there were eight of them. They tried to prevent me from entering the Council of Ministers building. True, they did not touch me at this point; they only formed a human wall to prevent my entering. Of course, I went past them and approached People's Deputy Leonid Sinitsyn, head of my staff. They grabbed him by the arm, but he managed to break free. Professor [name indistinct], a member of our group and architect of our program, who became indignant over the entire incident, was also grabbed by the collar; they started to push him out of the House of Government, regardless of the fact that he had all the necessary official documents. The bodyguards lagged behind me, but, nevertheless, we went past the guards and up to the second floor and room 241, where my office is located. There were two militia guards standing there, while six others were running after me and shouting that Danko had forbidden me to be in the building -- there were four guards, plus the colonel and lieutenant colonel. I do not remember their names now, but they are identified in my complaint. Four of them seized me by the hands outside the office, one kicked me, and another tore my jacket. They scratched and hurt my hands. Well, naturally, I was forced to open the door with the help of [name indistinct] and Sinitsyn. We opened the door and entered the office. I do not know where they went after that. Still, all the necessary documentation to begin criminal proceedings against the men has been submitted to [Prosecutor General] Shaladonaw. In fact, I think that they have already instigated criminal proceedings and an examination by the Prosecutor's Office is under way. Doctors were already here and documented the injuries, as it should be, to avoid an incident similar to what happened at Lyozna [where shots were allegedly fired at a car carrying Lukashenka]. [Rudkowski] What would you like to say to your supporters? [Lukashenka] I would like them to participate in the second round of elections. This is the only thing I ask of them -- they should not waver. Later on, we will examine all the facts and nuances. These people will have to explain their deeds. I think there is no place for them to emigrate. Or, maybe, there is some place. At any rate, this is a general [Danko] who wants to get Lukashenka out of the way. That will not happen. The people have seen a real chance these days, and they will not lose this opportunity. I am very sure of that. I am supported [by the people] today. I believe that there will be 300,000 people who will support me, and we will bring order to the Republic of Belarus. Namely, constitutional order, legal order, (?where) law will reign.
