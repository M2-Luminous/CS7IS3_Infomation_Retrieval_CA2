The style is like the man, it seems, not only insofar as his handwriting is concerned, but also news conferences. Balzac is easy to recognize in his novels and Nicolae Vacaroiu in his news conferences. The way he appears in front of journalists betrays the style he has adopted in his position of prime minister. What could be noted, especially in his answers to the questions, was the incoherence characteristic of Nicolae Vacaroiu's activity as prime minister. To listen to a Nicolae Vacaroiu speech is a hard task for an intelligent person who is used to thinking on the basis of Aristotelian logic. Vacaroiu has the talent to contradict himself without batting an eyelid. Here is an example. The whole exercise on Monday, 14 March, was designed to present himself as a genuine reformist. At one point, however, he made an affirmation that clearly contradicted this: "Thus, as long as I hold this position, the economy has to function, come out of the crisis, and proceed to the restructuring and privatization process..." Thus Romania's prime minister views the period of his governance divided into two stages: First, he takes the economy out of the crisis, makes it function, and second, he restructures and privatizes it. As is known, the two elements of the reform -- privatization and restructuring -- have been thought out by economists of greater caliber than Nicolae Vacaroiu and not as a purpose in itself, but as a means to take the economy out of the crisis caused by the centralized communist system. And this for a simple reason: Only privatization and restructuring -- typical elements of market relations -- may make the economy function within maximum parameters! Communism collapsed precisely because it failed at the economic level. The Romanian prime minister, however, thinks that we may make the economy function before privatization and restructuring. What is to be understood from this? That Nicolae Vacaroiu continues to believe in the efficiency of communist means at the economic level. Thus he betrays his centralist thinking. Without wanting to, he also betrays that he is a convinced antireformist. Thus he declared in front of the entire press and, through it, in front of the entire nation, that the means used by his government so far have been those of communist centralism. Understandably, this is harshly at variance with his emphasis throughout the news conference of being a convinced reformist. The incoherence typical of the Nicolae Vacaroiu government was also obvious during the news conference in the prime minister's talent to jump several times from one subject to another within the same sentence. He begins, for example, by referring to the machine-building industry only to find himself talking how to cultivate field flowers at the end of the sentence. The same news conference revealed another trait of the political style practiced by Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu. This is what one could call aggressive bragging. Normally, braggarts earn sympathy. Nicolae Vacaroiu, however, is a braggart who gets on your nerves. When he says that the decline in material production has stopped, that the GNP and labor productivity per employee have increased, and that exports have considerably grown, Nicolae Vacaroiu simply does not brag. Actually, he polemizes with all those who hold that things are not going well. That is so with all Romanians. Had this been Stalin's time, Nicolae Vacaroiu would have sent everyone who did not utter praise of the way he governs to jail. Living in a democracy, he has to be content to brag. The aggressiveness behind his bragging betrays how he suffers that it is not Stalin's time. At first sight, Nicolae Vacaroiu seems a modest man minding his own business. If you study him closely, you will find that he is a man who has an unusually positive opinion about himself. The tone of both his introductory statement and his answers during the news conference was characterized by an irritating arrogance. On the basis of the fact that he is the prime minister, Nicolae Vacaroiu has decided that he is unquestionably superior to absolutely everything that moves in this country, especially since he believes that everything that moves stands on one side exchanging opinions, while he, Nicolae Vacaroiu, is working hard to govern the country.
