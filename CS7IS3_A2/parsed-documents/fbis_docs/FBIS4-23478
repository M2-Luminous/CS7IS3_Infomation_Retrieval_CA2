He denied the report in a telephone interview with Radio Mozambique on his return to Maputo from Zambezia. [Begin recording] [Dique] It is true that I was in Mocubela. On my return to Maputo via Beira I was surprised by reports appearing in the media. In Beira, there are reports that I am dead, and here in Maputo, there are reports that I was beaten and so on. That is not true. It is true that I left for Beira aboard a UN Operations in Mozambique [Unomoz] plane on 1 June. From Beira, I left for Mocubela by helicopter. There was a small agitation by Renamo troops there. The reason for this was that a Unomoz monitor stationed at the assembly area told the troops waiting to be demobilized that they would receive a subsidy of 75,000 meticals for six months instead of 35,000 meticals for three months. When the demobilization team went to Mocubela and began paying 35,000 meticals for three months for a simple soldier, the troops were infuriated because the Unomoz monitor had always told them that they would receive 75,000 meticals for six months. They asked for clarification and they rioted against the demobilization team. When I received the information, I went there and clarified the matter. I told them that the monitor was wrong and that the truth was that they should receive 35,000 meticals for three months. [Unidentified correspondent] But we received information that you were assaulted. Is that true? [Dique] I was not assaulted. I am in very good shape. I wish the people in the media could see me physically. I was not beaten. The truth is that when the troops became infuriated they surrounded their commander and people thought that he was being assaulted. That is not true. I can present myself to the media at any time and you will see that I am in good shape, without any wounds or bruises. [end recording]
