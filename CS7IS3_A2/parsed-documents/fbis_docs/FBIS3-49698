FBIS3-49698 "dreeu010__a94019" FBIS-EEU-94-010-A Document Type:Daily Report 14 January 1994 ANNEX Czech Republic Editor Resigns Over Newspaper's Independence AU1401072794 Prague CTK in English 2110 GMT 13 Jan 94 AU1401072794 Prague CTK Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Prague, Jan 13 (CTK) -- Jaromir Stetina, former editor-in-chief of the independent daily LIDOVE NOVINY, expressed concern about the future independence of the paper today. Stetina, who resigned on Wednesday [12 January], told CTK that he believed that most of the staff shared his fear, being shocked by the latest developments in the paper. "I never knew that it was so easy to violate documents in force," he said. LIDOVE NOVINY was founded in 1893 as a liberal daily. Banned by the communist regime after it seized power, it started reappearing in 1988 as a dissident publication. Last November the Swiss press company Ringier purchased a majority stake in the paper, whose circulation is around 100,000 copies. Stetina justified his resignation by the fact that the new internal rules and procedures, accepted by the Board of Directors of the LIDOVE NOVINY joint stock company recently, violates two essential documents -- the Editorial Statute and the agreement on the editor-in-chief -- which guarantee the independence of the paper. "The internal rules and procedures circumvent the editor's right to appoint leading workers of the staff.... As long as they are in force it will be quite easy to replace one-third of the leading workers who give their judgment on a new editor-in-chief," Stetina said. The Board of Directors said on Wednesday that it "did not see any discrepancy between the internal rules and the status of the staff."
