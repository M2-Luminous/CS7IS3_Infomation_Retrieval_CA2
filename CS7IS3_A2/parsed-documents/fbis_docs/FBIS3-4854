The National Pension Council made the recommendations in a report to Health and Welfare Minister Keigo Ouchi, the officials said. The council suggested that the age at which employees qualify for the welfare pension be gradually raised to 65 from the year 2001. The ministry plans to submit bills on revision of the pension system to the current regular Diet session in mid-March for approval, they said. One in four people in Japan will be 65 or over by early next century. A government survey found that nearly 70 percent of people want to work beyond the age of 60.
