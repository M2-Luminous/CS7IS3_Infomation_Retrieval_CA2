To keep the lead that we took in the United Nations in co-ordinating that effort, and to continue our policies, I think it is the appropriate time to respond to the (sic) General Rose's request for more troops. ``As you have observed on your recent visits to the United States there might be some change of policy by the United States and some other European countries which disagree with our policies to help to (sic) the Serbs. ``So I am beginning a new effort to persuade the United States Administration on (sic) our objectives and to ensure the others that we are trying to secure the long-term interests of Europe. ``I believe much has been achieved, and there is a lot to be done. ``Yours sincerely, ``Douglas Hurd.''
