The Union Defence Ministry, in a recent report sent to Punjab Police, has stated that not only were the immigration and custom authorities at Attari and Bombay careless in their duties, but frequently accepted bribes. On the basis of the interrogation of the arrested smugglers and spies the Ministry was able to tell the exact dates on which such lapses occurred during the past two years. Among those interrogated was a Pak spy, Mohammed Sharief, who was apprehended in Delhi in June. The MOD [Ministry of Defence] report states that on one occasion, two Pak smugglers got past the immigration authorities at Attari by paying Rs [rupees] 200 to the staff at lower level. On another occasion, two smugglers were allowed to carry 40 kg of paan (betel leaves) to Pakistan by paying Rs 500 to an immigration official. Another official gave them the go ahead when they obliged him with a walkman. On two other occasions, they managed to get past the immigration authorities with fake documents and by paying Rs 1000 each to two officials, who also asked for their leather jackets. Similarly, in Bombay they were able to enter and leave the country on fake documents without any difficulty. On one occasion, a Punjab militant, Manjit Singh. also traveled with them to Bombay on fake documents. They had procured forged passports and visa for Rs 2000 each in Delhi. The report by R.K. Singh, Director in the Ministry of Defence, mentions the names of guest houses in Delhi, Bombay and Aligarh, which were frequented by Pak contacts. The report has underlined the need for proper vetting of immigration and custom staff. A senior Punjab Police officer told INDIAN EXPRESS, "We are trying to trace the policemen mentioned in the report, who will face stringent action." Meanwhile, the Union Finance Ministry has also taken up the issue of lack of security at the two vital check points which could have serious implications on national security. M. R. Sivaraman, Secretary Department of Revenue in Ministry of Finance, has written to the Punjab Government last month urging it to bring the immigration control at Attari railway station under the overall supervision of a young motivated, gazetted officer. The Bombay blasts have confirmed that ISI [Inter-services Intelligence] was trying to create disturbances in India and this required strengthening of units at all vital points of entry and exit, he added. Sivaraman has pointed out that the Chandigarh office of the Collector of Customs and Central Excise had reported that immigration checks were not being carried out with full vigour due to acute shortage of staff.
