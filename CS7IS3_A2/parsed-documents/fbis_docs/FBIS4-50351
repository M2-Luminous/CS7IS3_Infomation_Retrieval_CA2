The remarks were made by the State Department spokesman, Michael McCurry, in a statement released on Monday [16 May]. He said, "It is long-standing U.S. policy that Tibet is part of China. Neither the U.S. nor any other state regards Tibet as a sovereign nation. The U.S. does not recognize a Tibetan government- in-exile." In a bid to clarify some provisions contained in the "Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1994 and 1995" adopted by the U.S. Congress and signed into law by President Clinton in late April, McCurry also made it clear that "as both a practical and legal matter, it would not be possible for the U.S. to establish offices or conduct programs (in Tibet) without the permission of the Chinese Government." The spokesman continued that the United States will continue to follow a "one-China" policy. "The language in the act referring to official visits, including cabinet-level exchanges with Taiwan are 'sense of the Congress' and not binding," he said in the statement. His statement also described the wording of the authorization act that the Taiwan Relations Act takes precedence over the 1982 communique as "equivalent to a `sense of the Congress' and not binding." "We continue to honor our commitment to the August 17, 1982 communique with respect to arms sales to Taiwan and regard it as one of the three pillars supporting our bilateral relationship. Nothing in the Foreign Relations Authorization Act will interfere with our continuing to honor this commitment," he said. The United States remains, he stated, "fully committed to the three joint communiques between the PRC and the U.S. as the framework of our China policy. Nothing in the Foreign Relations Authorization Act changes this." The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman has expressed appreciation of the above-mentioned statement and hoped that the U.S. Government will honor its commitment in real earnest.
