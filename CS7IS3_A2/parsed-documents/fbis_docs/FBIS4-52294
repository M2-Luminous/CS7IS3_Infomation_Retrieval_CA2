This frantic war exercise was staged on a large scale, which was waged in the air over the sea off Kangnung from around 1900 to around 2200, using pursuit-assault planes and vertical takeoff and landing assault plane squadrons from U.S. Pacific area bases; and fighter bombers, assault planes, and observation planes of the U.S. Air Force in South Korea. E-3 early warning planes serving as an aerial flight command post, which had flown into U.S. occupation Air Force bases in South Korea prior to this war exercise, directed a comprehensive command of the aircraft mobilized for aerial surprise strike exercises over the sea, flying around in the air over the operational area on that night. This war exercise was like playing with fire aimed at increasing the capabilities for actual warfare for nocturnal aerial surprise strikes over the sea for a Northward invasion under the command of E-3 early warning planes. In the meantime, two KC-135 refueling planes from an overseas base were mobilized in the air over the sea off Kunsan that night for a double flight over Anma Island and Woeyon Island, conducting midair refueling for several tens of fighter bombers, assault planes, and observation planes mobilized for the nocturnal aerial war exercise. This war maneuver fully reveals that the U.S. imperialists are recklessly running amok to realize their attempt to launch a surprise aerial preemptive strike against the Northern part of the Republic.
