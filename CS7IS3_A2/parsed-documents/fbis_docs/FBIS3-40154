Most catastrophic is the destruction it has wrought on China's fine tradition, more accurately, the best things in human tradition: Sound moral values and a robust ability to distinguish truth from falsehood. What makes it worse is that these statements apply not only to the masses, but also to intellectuals, and not just conservative intellectuals, but so-called advanced and radical intellectuals as well. Communist rule totally stripped almost two entire generations of intellectuals of a moral sense of honor and disgrace. This is precisely why the sins of the party remain unforgivable even after a thousand years. As far as the mainland intellectual is concerned, upon re-entering the world following the political thaw, his foremost mission is to do some self-examination, regain his ability to think properly, and return to the right starting point. However, the developments in the past decade have not been totally satisfactory. What really accounts for this state of affairs? In my opinion, the most important reason is that people have lost their spirit of honest self-examination. The overwhelming majority of mainland intellectuals have grown accustomed to the dogmatic self-righteous Marxist way of criticizing the world. We cannot expect Chinese intellectuals to regain on their own the self-doubting spirit of the modern theory of knowledge overnight. Moreover, the mainland having been isolated for years, not only was there a lack of communication with the outside world, but the two generations of intellectuals have completely lost their foreign linguistic abilities. In the early days of openness, therefore, the mainland was a society with an extremely limited capacity for interacting with the rest of the world. Having said that, China is a vast country with much living space for the above-mentioned intellectuals. Moreover, eventually the world must wake up to China's existence. In a sense, therefore, international exchange had a negative result in that it encourages parochial arrogance, complacency, and conservatism among Chinese intellectuals. Third, because they speak the same language and with their capacity for healthy change that comes from being part of the world, Chinese intellectuals in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and overseas should have been a powerful driving force and catalyst for change in the intellectual world on the mainland during this brief transitional period. That, however, has turned out to be wishful thinking. Instead, it is Hong Kong and Taiwan which are being engulfed in a wave of "mainland fever." Only a handful of insightful scholars have pointed out, politely, the errors of mainland intellectuals. But even they fail to understand why mainland intellectuals could have made such obvious mistakes. In reality, "mainland fever" points up some of the problems in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the overseas Chinese community. "Mainland fever" has directly contributed to the apathy and arrogance of some mainland intellectuals. Even as the diehard faction of the CPC forced them out with guns following the collapse of the democracy movement in 1989, they still have not done any soul-searching or established any serious contacts with Hong Kong, Taiwan, and overseas Chinese scholars during their visits to Taiwan and other countries in order to find out how the latter approach or research an issue. They remain engrossed in expansive specious arguments about the masculine principle and other stuff. Compare them to the human rights movement in Eastern Europe, to intellectuals like Havel and you see a most striking difference. Ma Yueran [7456 1878 3544], a Swedish Sinologist, told Taiwan LIAN HE PAO reporters in October 1986 that no Chinese has ever won a Nobel Prize for literature primarily because of a translation problem. Ever since then, the confidence of mainland writers has been on the rise on a daily basis. Just about everyone believes he is world-class. How pertinent are Ma Yueran's comments? Or do they merely show that he still lacks a genuine feel for the Chinese language, that as a Sinologist he is on shaky ground as soon as he starts talking about poetry and literature? Be that as it may, because of his unique standing, his remarks had a big impact on the literary community in mainland China. What he said also raises such questions as: How should we look at mainland literature today? How should we interpret literature? I would like to discuss these questions by comparing contemporary Chinese literature to that of Eastern Europe because the new generation of writers and poets on the mainland that I know well, represented by TODAY, as well as myself have been deeply influenced by the thaw literature of Eastern Europe, especially the Soviet Union, as we were growing up in the early 1970's. Relying on nothing more than the translations of a handful of Eastern and Western European works that were supposedly for internal reference only, they slowly completed a major change in life, becoming in the process a more healthy force of the mainland intelligentsia in the 1980's. If literature embodies the pursuit of man, great literature can come about even under centralized communist rule. This kind of literature also sheds light on the pursuit of eternity. It reveals for all to see the conflicts between man and society in this environment, the tragedy of human nature, and the price man pays for his conscience and ideals. Certainly, it takes courage and resolve to produce this kind of literature. The writer must be able to withstand the many forms of oppression, corrosion, and enslavement by the communist ideology, to the extent of sacrificing his own well-being and perhaps even his life. This is precisely the attribute of the current generation of Soviet writers. Without their suffering, their indomitable will, their efforts on behalf of the preservation of humanity, the Soviet Union could never have produced thaw literature, a great literature that transcends time and space. The glory of thaw literature is that it keeps alive and continues a great literary tradition and preserves the true pursuit of man. It has profoundly influenced not only contemporary Soviet society but also Soviet literature in the 1970's and 1980's, as well as the pursuit of human rights, democracy, and ideals by the Soviet people. Face to face with such literature, how can we not overflow with respect? How can we not examine our conscience? To defend our timidity in front of such literature only proves our own insignificance. The Thawing of Chinese Literature Yet the same communist system, the same Marxist ideology has produced a very different literature and art on mainland China vis-a-vis that of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. Instead of ignoring it, we should think long and hard about this distinction. The foremost distinction between the mainland, on the one hand, and the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, on the other, is that there has simply been no genuinely creative art and literature on the mainland since 1949. Set aside our sentimental ties to modern writers and survey the scene from a historical perspective level-headedly, and we can see that just about all literary works of this era are the mark of shame of their creators, the very proof of their servility, the aid they have given to the tyrant to do evil, and their ignorance. Even those so-called artists who were denounced and persecuted because of infighting within the CPC could not hide this kind of shame. Since 1949 everything on the mainland--literature, painting, music, movies--has been thoroughly ideologized. Just about every work became a form of propaganda publicizing the dogmatic principles of the communist ideology. The "theme first" rule did nothing more than give pride of place to a bunch of dogmatic principles. All human impulses were suppressed and stifled. An artist or writer might change his method of creation, choosing between realism and romanticism, but he must subordinate himself to the dogma. In the course of subordinating himself to the dogma, romanticism was looked upon less favorably than realism. Yet modernist art has never successfully found a foothold for itself in any communist nation because its core conflicts with the dogmatic principles. Not that the dogma is immutable, of course. In the 1950's, it was the Great Leap Forward and "socialism is good." In the 1960's, it was the anti-right tendency and class struggle. In the 1970's, it was "criticize Lin Biao [2651 1735] and Confucius" and the "Cultural Revolution is good." In the 1980's, it was reform and the open policy. While some principles are mutually contradictory, it does not mean that they are not ideologized works. Highly representative in this aspect are Zhang Yinliang [1728 6343 0081], the so-called famous mainland writer, and Xie Jin [6200 2516], the film director. Neither scar literature nor a majority of works of the 1980's which advocated reform and opening up basically broke free from this mold. Existing side by side with this kind of propaganda were the subservience and shameless obsequiousness of writers and artists to the CPC and a handful of CPC leaders. Their ingratiation pervaded almost all their so-called artistic works, their humanity and dignity utterly lost. They sang the praise of Mao Zedong and CPC in the 1950's and added Lin Biao and the Cultural Revolution to the list in the 1960's. In the 1970's they lauded Zhou Enlai and, in the 1980's, Deng Xiaoping and the reform faction. From writers who rode high such as Guo Meiruo [6753 3106 5387], Mao Dun [5403 4163], and Cao Yu [2580 4417] to those who were persecuted to death like Ding Ling [0002 3781], Tian Han [3944 3352] and Lao She [5071 5287], they all behaved in a revolting manner. To explain this phenomenon, we need to do more than compare the relative brutality of different communist parties. This is because it is hard to prove who was more brutal, Stalin, Mao Zedong, or Deng Xiaoping. When good rises one foot, evil rises ten feet. Others say, when evil rises one foot, good rises ten feet. There are uniquely Chinese factors behind this phenomenon. I think the foremost reason is that the Chinese literary tradition is still highly fragile. Although it has produced a number of writers of a high caliber since the 1920's and 1930's, in overall qualitative and quantitative terms Chinese literature is no match for its Soviet and Eastern European counterparts. Judging from the way they deal with the pursuit of man at a deeper level from a modern angle, only a tiny handful of Chinese writers such as Lu Xun [7627 3065] are in the same league as great Russian writers with a pioneering spirit. The pain and impulses of the majority of writers are still not intense or profound enough. In a certain sense, the very fact that many intellectuals sided in the 1930's and 1940's points up their weak foundation. All this explains why the artistic and literary community utterly failed to stand up to bad Stalinist literature after 1949. Another important reason the literary and artistic thought of Stalin, Zhdanov, and Mao Zedong managed to march straight into China and ride roughshod over it is that the older generation of intellectuals did not have a firm philosophy of life or moral values. Besides the writers mentioned above, also guilty were Zang Kejia [5258 0344 1367], Feng Xuefeng [7458 7185 1496] and even Wang Meng [3769 5536]. A tiniest handful of writers with the least bit of conscience either stopped writing or did some translation, there being no other choice. Even then they were criticized and persecuted to death. One example was Mr. Fu Lei [0265 7191]. The ideologization off literature on the mainland went totally unchallenged and true literature and the true pursuit of man almost vanished without a trace. One of the most insidious consequences of the ideologization of literature is that it rendered almost two generations essentially ignorant of true literature. For three full decades, art and literature on the mainland were fully ideologized, people lost their ability to distinguish between truth and falsehood, good and evil, and all human impulses and pursuits were ideologized. Herein lies one reason why human nature on the mainland has been distorted, something which many people have found it hard to understand. A much-discussed topic in recent years is the "impotence" of mainland intellectuals. In reality the problem with the current generation of writers and artists is "castration," not just "impotence." And this brings us to the second major distinction between the mainland and Eastern Europe: While the thawing of literature has produced a great thaw literature in Eastern Europe, the thawing of literature on the mainland only means that literature is being removed from politics and ideology and enters a transition to true literature. The break from the intra-party line struggle and the pursuit of the liberation of man first began on the Democracy Wall at Xidan in Beijing in 1979. A handful of young literary and artistic workers represented by TODAY and the "Xingxing" art show introduced a breath of fresh air into China's literary world. A break was made with the past three decades and a new exploration was on. This process can be traced all the way to the early 1970's. At that time the CPC was playing tricks left and right with no attempt at all to cover up its deception. For their part, the writers were in the midst of their transition from adolescence, having gone through the frustration of being sent to work in the countryside and mountain areas. It was in that culturally barren era that they stumbled upon a host of translated works intended for internal criticism, the so-called "yellow books" and "grey books." (The covers of these titles were either yellow, in the case of works on art and literature, or grey, in the case of books on politics, economics, history, and philosophy.) Among them were modern Western classics by such writers as Sartre and Jia Miu [0502 6208] along with a large collection of so-called revisionist writings and other works of thaw literature from Eastern Europe. As they read and copied the new literature, the writers gradually found a new direction. It is undeniable of course that three decades of CPC education had left a deep scar and created many shortcomings that cannot be corrected. Inherent Weaknesses Of Mainland Writers Energized by the new literature, the world of letters on the mainland showed a trace of life in the early 1980's. However, except for a handful of works by some writers typified by TODAY, the so-called introspection writings remained ideologized. The only thing that had changed was the title. In sharp contrast to the thaw literature of the Soviet Union, which demonstrated an individualism, personal rebellion and the pursuit of the liberation of man, most works limited themselves to criticizing so-called bad elements in the party and waxed nostalgic for the other ideology of the CPC. This is true of many works celebrated in literary circles both at home and abroad, for example, "Mid-Life Crisis" by Chen Rong [6186 1369] and "Man, O Man" by Dai Houying [2071 0624 5391]. Mr. Bai Yang [2672 2799] praised Chen Rong's "Mid-Life Crisis" but a Polish writer read it and made this pertinent comment, "It is the communist party. Chen Rong wrote his novel the way he did to execute the CPC's current party policy on intellectuals." (Bai Yang, "Dueling Words," Linbai Chubanshe, Taiwan, 1990, p 185) Another good example is Mr. Liu Binyan [0491 6333 7159]. Maybe we should say Mr. Liu Binyan is a better representative of this generation of writers. Let us just cite one instance to illustrate this generation's misunderstanding of literature. In the mid-1980's, Mr. Liu Binyan more than once criticized the pursuit by young writers of pure art, denouncing the anti-political tendency among young people and their literature-for-literature's-sake attitude and urging them to orient themselves to reality and society. His criticisms, we must say, were way off the mark. Literature for the sake of literature was precisely a sign of the loathing for and resistance to the politicization and ideologization of literature by the CPC. As such it presented progress. There is an essential difference between socially concerned writers, on the one hand, and politicians, propagandists, and agitators, on the other. Writers are interested in human concerns, in the human spirit and soul, at a deeper level. When the new literary tradition takes shape and finds its place into our hearts, every faction of the CPC would lose its appeal and every form of dictatorship and every kind of enslavement of humanity would run into stiff resistance. The bias of Liu Binyan and other writers of the older generation precisely reflect how the CPC has distorted the human spirit. What is said about Liu Binyan can be applied to Liu Zaifu [0491 0375 1788], the other well-known literary critic on the mainland. Despite his sharp verbal exchanges with conservative literary theorists and despite some new terminology, he had yet to make a clean break with the Marxist ideology, judging from his cooperative style of writing, his writing techniques, his line of reasoning, and his methods of verifying an argument. Be that as it may, we were overwhelmed with respect for them because they gave their heart and soul to the struggle with the conservatives. It was this internal vehement resistance, along with the open policy, that gradually gave rise to new true literary works. Through the cracks of intra-party struggles a new literature and true humanity slowly matured. The literary and artistic front, we should say, is the most promising territory for the mainland intelligentsia. In the late 1980's a healthy literary trend gradually took shape on the mainland. Nevertheless, because of the generation gap created by CPC rule and the inherent weaknesses of several generations, the new literature may not achieve overnight success. The eagerness for quick success and instant gains and the craving for the grandiose and pompous derived from a shallow foundation and parochial arrogance and self-righteousness, both the byproducts of CPC-imposed cultural isolation, continue to make themselves felt often, preventing people from facing the world honestly and examining themselves truly and deeply. Even as the mainland began its pursuit of true art and literature starting in the mid-1980's, non-literary and non-artistic tendencies could be found everywhere. Imitation was omnipresent, from literary genre to the way a writer carried himself. There was no individuality, no real depth. You may say imitation is quite harmless; coupled with arrogance, however, it becomes downright dangerous. This phenomenon pervaded the world of letters on the mainland in the 1980's. Zhang Zhengzhi [1728 2110 1807], for instance, imitated Aitematov but fell short. As for writers in the Wang Shuo [3769 2592] mold, the Soviet Union produced Akeksiaonov over 20 years ago. Those Chinese writers searching for their roots were imitating black American writers. "The person who writes expansively," a fashionable term used by Bai Hua [4101 2901] and others, was lifted from a line in the poem "Man" by the Soviet poet Meierlatelumu [phonetic], translated from Russian in the 1960's and published for internal circulation. Everybody was quietly influenced by it, even the style of the illustrations in the "Stepping Into the Future" series, but China could offer nothing that matches its profundity. As for people like Zhang Yinliang, they are still mired in ideology and formulism, still a long way from producing anything that resembles true literature. Whatever the mainland produces, we can say, others have produced a long time ago and of a higher quality too. Mr. Li Oufan [2621 2962 2753] hit the nail on the head when he said in late 1988, "We have yet to produce truly moving works. Look what happened elsewhere. The way Kundera, the exiled Czech writer, described the party and revolution in his fiction, the reportages by Normal Mailer, the American writer, during the Vietnam War... That sort of thing is still a no-no in China today. I have always argued that China does not lack the materials for great works. What it does lack is writers of insight, courage, conscience, and artistic talents. It all boils down to a question of vision and language. The long years from the anti-right struggle to the Cultural Revolution and the shadow upon shadow it cast on the psychology of the Chinese people have left behind scars and, underneath them, guilt. The foibles and blemishes of the Chinese national character were fully revealed. Why hasn't a single writer so far laid bare this big scar thoroughly and mercilessly? Following the Holocaust, Jews produced countess literary works. Just about everyone of them both chronicled historical facts and delved into human feelings. In their soul-searching, the Chinese have not made their way back to the Cultural Revolution, instead just talking loosely about "feudal residues." To me that is escaping one's responsibility. China's traditional culture has its convoluted and dark aspects, but the new psychological residues created in the 30 years after liberation should not be allowed to take shelter behind something sweepingly called "feudalism and tradition." (JIUSHI NIANDAI, No 12, 1986, p 81) These non-literary and non-artistic tendencies also exhibited themselves in music and movies. Since 1980, the musical world on the mainland has become increasingly interested in and even obsessed with their rankings in a variety of international musical competitions, both vocal and instrumental. In 1988 they even took out a whole-page ad on the back cover of the Chinese-language magazine ZHISHI FENZI published in the United States. In the ad they characterized a coming concert in the United States featuring mainland musicians as a challenge by Chinese music to the West. This tendency worried none other than the great violinist, Yehudi Menuhin, who wrote to his Chinese friends, "The danger lies in trying too hard to develop top-notch musical talent of an international caliber too quickly. They want their musicians to excel the way their athletes overpower their opponents at international sporting events. But great musical performances are not like athletic competitions. Music is unique, individual. It cannot be quantified in terms of distance, speed, force, or weight. There can be no Olympic champion in music. Our goal is not to defeat others in world competitions, but to wholeheartedly demonstrate the art we have learned." Indeed, if music is not just a hobby but an echo of our pursuit of life, if we still remember great maestros such as Beethoven, then slogans like Chinese music is challenging the West is musical blasphemy. Something similar is happening in the movie industry. From the beginning, the younger generation of directors such as Zhang Yimou [1728 5669 6180] has been driven precisely by a desire to win awards in international competitions. To the extent that this involves a departure from and resistance to past formulism and ideologization, it is not a bad thing; at a minimum it represents a big improvement upon those who stick to old ways and refuse to change. But in terms of art for art's sake, we think the spirit of an artist is missing from this generation of directors. So in just about every literary and artistic arena countless people are desperately searching for or resorting to new formats. Others make much of China's national conditions and customs, things not found elsewhere. But in philosophical and emotional intensity and scope, they still are a far cry from art and literature in Eastern Europe. We now have decent works and even prize-winning works, but we have yet to produce writers and works that really have depth. This is a fact of life today. There is a mix of reasons why we have thus far failed to produce works and writers that have real depth. The foremost explanation is that we lack individuals who have an artist's spirit. In real life it is difficult to really hide oneself totally. Compare the works of mainland writers to those of their Eastern European counterparts like Havel and Kundera and the former always comes up short, whether we are looking at their portrayal of daily life, description of political turmoil, or their sheer powerfulness. Another important reason why the mainland has not produced some truly profound works and writers is that Chinese writers have inherent weaknesses. The old educational system and cultural environment on the mainland predetermine their narrowness of vision and inadequate literary training. They lack a knowledge of history, a sense of history. They either have trouble understanding original philosophical texts or simply have never read them. They lack linguistic skills, whether Chinese or foreign, relying solely on translated works, which severely limits their access to other literary works and the nurturing derived therefrom. Given these circumstances, they could not but find it hard to transcend their environment. This is another reason why the current generation of writers is no match for the generation of poets and writers represented by Xu Zhimo [1776 1807 2302], Dai Wangshu [2071 2598 5289], Shen Congwen [3088 1783 2429], and Lu Xun. In the era of the thaw literature, current Chinese writers perhaps need to go back to the 1930's to obtain a true understanding of the history of Chinese literature and art. We have no justifiable excuses but we do have shameful facts. We must start from ground zero in earnest.
