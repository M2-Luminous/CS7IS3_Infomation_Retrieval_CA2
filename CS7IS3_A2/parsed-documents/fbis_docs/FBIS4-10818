Following the withdrawal of Senator Jose Andrade Vieira's candidacy, the PTB is joining the coalition sponsored by the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party], which aims to promote Cardoso's election. In addition to the PTB, with which an agreement was concluded yesterday, the PSDB is already counting in practice on the support of the PFL [Liberal Front Party] and the PP [Popular Party]. The consolidation of this big front will require, however, further political negotiations. Andrade Vieira was offered the Labor Ministry, but he has not yet accepted. PP President Alvaro Dias said that the PP "will support Cardoso only if the alliance does not collide with the interests of PP candidates for state governors." The PSDB is facing a growing internal opposition to an alliance with the PFL. Senator Mario Covas, PSDB candidate for governor of Sao Paulo State, has again criticized the proposal to nominate a PFL member as Cardoso's running mate. Some PSDB mayors -- such as Lidice da Mata of Salvador and Paulo Hartung of Vitoria, among others -- have conveyed their heightened opposition to the PSDB leaders themselves by bringing into focus some regional political problems they characterize as insurmountable.
