Several brother ministers and officials attended. After reviewing the decisions it made during its previous session, as well as the extent of their implementation, the Council discussed the topics listed on its agenda. The conferees also debated the discussions held between brother Presidential Council Chairman Lt. Gen. 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Lakhdar Ibrahimi, envoy of the UN secretary general who was sent to Yemen on a fact-finding mission. The brother president briefed the conferees on the talks he had held with the speaker of the House of Representatives, staff members of the House Speakership Office, members of parliamentary blocs, the acting prime minister, cabinet ministers, the leaders of various political parties and organizations, the leaders of popular organizations, as well as social, intellectual, and political figures in the homeland. The conferees laid special emphasis on the efforts under way to implement UN Security Council Resolution 924, which concerns the situation in our country, in light of the government's appreciation of the aforementioned resolution and its declared commitment to handle it in a positive spirit, and to implement it in an integrated manner -- commitment that reflected the eagerness of the Republic of Yemen to achieve security and stability throughout its territory --, heedful that the UN Charter guarantees all members of the world body inalienable legitimate rights. The conferees also debated the recent gesture made by the political leadership to reactivate the work of the Joint Military Committee so it may establish a cease-fire. The Council discussed several important reports pertaining to developments in our country in the military, political, economic, and social fields. It also debated the executive programs endorsed to address the impact of the rebellion and violation of constitutional legitimacy, which have caused untold hardships in the country. For the country is currently experiencing a military mutiny and a bloody national sedition that have been courageously, heroically, and firmly confronted by our people and their valiant Armed Forces. The Council has made several decisions and issued various directives to promote the victories achieved to safeguard unity and constitutional legitimacy, and nurture the solidarity and cohesion existing between the people and official agencies, which must be manifested through supporting the Armed Forces and security troops in their efforts to carry out their sacred national duties. These decisions and directives also addressed the connection between political action and the national objectives of our Yemeni people, the objectives of shielding the unity of their homeland, protecting democracy, and safeguarding all the national and constitutional gains made by the Republic of Yemen.
