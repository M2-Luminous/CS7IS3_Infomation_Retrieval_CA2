This was announced to INTERFAX by Georgian Defense Minister Lieutenant-General Varden Nadibaidze today. The Georgian-Abkhazian agreement signed in Moscow on 14 May says that international observers and a CIS peace-keeping contingent mostly composed from the Russian forces will come to this security zone after the conflicting parties withdraw their troops 12 km away from the Inguri River. There will be 2,500 or 3,000 servicemen in the CIS peace-keeping forces. Nadibaidze stated that the Georgian Army would carry out all orders received from the commander-in-chief and Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze. However, Chief of the Russian Transcaucasian Troops Group press center, Colonel Gennadiy Dolgachev, said in an interview with INTERFAX that the peace-keeping contingent was likely to be formed from the Russian Transcaucasian troops.
