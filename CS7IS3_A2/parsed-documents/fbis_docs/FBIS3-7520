This demand is not new. In previous working-level talks held in Seoul in early March, the United States also demanded that the ROK call off its differential tariff and tax rate system as well as lower tariff rates to promote imports of large U.S. cars. However, we are particularly concerned with the upcoming talks because the United States has implicitly warned that "it may invoke the Super 301 provision unless the ROK opens its auto market." The U.S. Government announced in March that it will revive the Super 301 provision in two years. It intends to spot by 30 September "countries that are unfairly controlling imports of U.S. goods" as "target countries for priority negotiations" and demand that they call off or adjust their "unfair import controls." The United States also intends to take retaliatory procedures against them unless these countries meet demands. U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor insists that the revival of the Super 301 provision coincides with the principle of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade [GATT] and it is not aimed at a specific country. Countries interpret his insistence differently. Japan, is particularly opposed to this, saying that it will file a lawsuit to the GATT if the United States imposes trade retaliation according to the Super 301 clause. Our government also criticized the clause for clearly contradicting the spirit of the Uruguay Round [UR] negotiations. In the GATT Board of Governors meeting held last week, major member nations of the Board of Governors denounced the Super 301 provision as a means for unilateral trade retaliation and criticized it for threatening the inauguration of the multilateral UR trade system. The United States is searching for excuses in saying that it intends not to close U.S. markets, but to expand free trade by opening other countries' markets wider. The U.S. intends to remove trade barriers to open the market of each of its trade partners, through multilateral agreements whenever possible, and through bilateral negotiations, when neccessary. The United States sees the Super 301 clause as coinciding with UR principles since it considers the conclusion of UR negotiations a step towards market opening. The U.S. insistence, however, must be based on an objective and universal view for the treaty to be proved fair and just. The UR negotiations have been concluded for this purpose. As the Super 301 clause unilaterally insisted upon by the U.S. as aiming only to open the markets of its trade partners does not exclude trade retaliation, it is hardly convincing to the international community. In addition, one cannot help but point out that the GATT has a tendency of attaching more importance to results in free trade than on principles and procedures for expanding free trade since it is based on principles of pragmatism. We should, in particular, take notice of the clear fact that, although the United States denies it, the Super 301 clause targets certain countries. While the United States seems to consider Japan as its main target, the ROK is not exempt from being a target, either.
