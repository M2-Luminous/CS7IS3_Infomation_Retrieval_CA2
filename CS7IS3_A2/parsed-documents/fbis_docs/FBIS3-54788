The main reason for this, in the view of the Social Democrats, is the considerable deterioration in the people's standard of living, the Russian-speaking citizens' increasing loss of confidence that they will be given social protection, and their worry for their children's future. Given this, the SDP has called upon the presidents of Russia and Kyrgyzstan to ensure that industrial enterprises of the two countries that have mutual economic ties are granted most favored status, in order to avoid bankruptcy and mass unrest among the people; to draw up and adopt a law on immigration based upon international norms and rights; and to guarantee that Russian-speaking citizens in Kyrgyzstan may receive education in the Russian language; and finally to conclude an inter-governmental agreement on recognizing dual citizenship in Russia and Kyrgyzstan.
