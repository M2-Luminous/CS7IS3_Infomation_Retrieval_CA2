He was referring to the criticism of Poland's position during the vote on Chinese motion on March 9 in Geneva not to adopt a resolution on human rights observance in China. Poland abstained. Jan Woroniecki from the ministry said that Polish vote was not a decisive one as the Chinese motion was accepted by 20 votes with 16 votes against. According to Woroniecki, the situation in China is "very complex and remote from Poland." He added that China is a big country and any perturbations would mean different implications for international security. He also admitted that most probably China will not look upon the Polish abstention unfavourably. The resolution on human rights observance in China was prepared by the European Union countries and aimed to stress the inadequate protection of religion, culture and ethnic identity of Tibetans and other minorities. Woroniecki recalled that last year when China lodged the similar motion, Poland voted against it. Poland stressed then that it can see changes in China and hopes they will continue.
