Station commentator (Mikhail Gretov) writes as follows: The most tragic day in Korea's national history is 25 June. The Korean war broke out 44 years ago on this day. The South and North were dragged into a severe war. This war, which continued for three years, took over 10 million lives. Millions of people were handicapped and cities and villages were destroyed. The economies of the South and North were paralyzed. Throughout the world there are continuous disputes over who started the war. Probing into the cause of the war is necessary so that such a tragedy will not be repeated. We must not forget the fact, however, that the armed conflict between the South and North was the first example of confrontation of the cold war era. Using the name of the United Nations, the United States supported the Seoul side. On the other hand, the Chinese Volunteers supported the Pyongyang side and appeared at the battle yard. Also, the old Soviet Union armed the DPRK in all means. Thus, this war grew into the greatest international conflict. The bloodshed war ended with the signing of the Armistice Agreement, but there is still no peace on the Korean land today after 40 years. The divided two states of the unitary nation continue artificial confrontation. The Korean nation has been appealing for the country's reunification for the past 40 years, but it seems that reunification will not be achieved easily. This is because the political and economic systems of South and North Korea are too different. Elements of outside forces that instigated confrontation between Seoul and Pyongyang are gradually disappearing. For example, these days the North Korean leadership proclaimed that it is willing to freeze its nuclear program and come forth to the third round of talks with Washington. A sincere and equal principle must be found in the talks to completely resolve the nuclear issue and improve mutual relations between the United States and the DPRK. Preparatory work for the first South-North summit talks is being carried out actively. Extensive issues must be discussed at the summit that are directly related to the fate of the Korean nation. Such a summit will ultimately provide a favorable basis to make the situation on the Korean peninsula sound. Also, it will support resolving the task of achieving Korea's reunification.
