FR940314-2-00104 FR940314-2-00058 Since individuals engaged in self-employment activities will normally be disqualified if certain eligibility provisions for State UC are followed, section 3306(t)(2), FUTA, provides that these provisions of State law shall not be followed. Specifically, the following provisions shall not apply: (1) State requirements relating to availability for work, active search for work, and refusal to accept work. (2) State requirements relating to disqualifying income are not applicable to income earned from self-employment by individuals claiming SEA allowances. In addition, individuals in the SEA program will be considered to be ``unemployed'' for purposes of both Federal and State UC laws provided the individuals meet provisions of State law subject to the above equal treatment provision and four additional eligibility provisions for SEA allowances discussed immediately below. (The effect of this requirement on Federal law is discussed below in item 4.f.) Section 3306(t)(3), FUTA, contains the four additional eligibility provisions which individuals must meet to receive SEA allowances: (1) They must be eligible to receive regular UC under the State law (or they would be eligible but for the requirements suspended by the SEA provisions at section 3306(t)(2), FUTA, as discussed above). This is basically a restatement of the ``equal treatment'' requirement of section 3306(t)(1), FUTA, and includes monetary as well as initial and continuing nonmonetary eligibility. For purposes of determining SEA eligibility, ``regular compensation'' includes UC for ex-servicemembers (UCX) and former Federal employees (UCFE). (See item 4.g below.) Since the SEA allowance is ``in lieu of'' regular UC, the total amount of SEA allowances that individuals may receive is equal to their maximum benefit amount of regular UC less any regular UC previously received. Similarly, the weekly SEA allowance amount must equal the weekly benefit amount for regular UC. Also, SEA allowances and regular UC may not be paid for the same period. The term ``regular compensation'' is defined in section 205(2), EUCA, as ``compensation payable to an individual under any State unemployment compensation law (including compensation payable pursuant to 5 U.S.C. chapter 85), other than extended compensation and additional compensation.'' Thus, individuals who have exhausted regular UC are ineligible for SEA allowances. Individuals may not receive SEA allowances in lieu of Federal-State extended benefits (EB), additional benefits (AB) entirely financed by the State, any wholly funded Federal extension of UC, or other types of compensation not meeting the definition of regular UC. Individuals who are terminated from or voluntarily leave the SEA program may collect regular UC with respect to the benefit year (if otherwise eligible) until the total amount of regular UC paid and SEA paid equals the maximum benefit amount. Such individuals may be paid EB if otherwise eligible. This is because, under 20 CFR 615.5(a)(1), these individuals are ``exhaustees'' for EB purposes because they have received ``all of the regular compensation that was payable under the applicable State law *␣*␣*.'' Similarly, individuals who exhaust the maximum benefit amount as SEA program participants may also receive EB if otherwise eligible. Whether any of the individuals discussed in this paragraph are eligible for other Federal extensions will depend on the law creating the extension. Whether individuals are eligible for AB will be determined by State law. (2) The individuals must be identified pursuant to a State worker profiling system as likely to exhaust regular UC. For further discussion of SEA profiling requirements, refer to items 4.d and 4.j of this UIPL. (3) The individuals are participating in self-employment assistance activities which are approved by the State agency. State agency is defined in Section 3306(e), FUTA, as the authority ``designated under a State law to administer the unemployment fund in such State.'' The activities which must be offered the individuals are entrepreneurial training, business counseling, and technical assistance. (Information concerning these activities may be found in UI Occasional Paper 92&hyph;2, which describes services provided to claimants participating in the self-employment demonstration programs in Washington and Massachusetts.) If these activities are not available, an individual pursuing self-employment will not be eligible for SEA allowances; determination of eligibility for regular UC for such individuals will be made under State law provisions relating to self-employment. The activities may be offered by either private or public entities.
