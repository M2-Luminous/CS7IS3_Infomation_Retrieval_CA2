The Israeli prime minister's visit to Washington comes on the heels of the Zionist government's decision yesterday to outlaw the activities of the racist, extremist Kakh and Kahana Hay groups. Political observers view Rabin's reported agreement to allow nonmilitary international observers in the occupied territories merely as a cosmetic measure to remedy the current crisis in Arab-Israeli negotiations. Meanwhile the UN Security Council continues its discussions on a prospective resolution condemning the two-week-old Zionist criminal massacre of Palestinians in Hebron. Indications show that the United States is seeking a resolution that will not adversely affect the peace process and, at the same time, refrain from accusing or condemning the Zionist entity to the extent it deserves. It was clear from the start that Washington and Tel Aviv were trying hard to suggest that the Hebron crime was an act by an individual act to relieve Tel Aviv of responsibility for it. Although the U.S. President showed some sensitivity about the slaughter of Palestinians in Hebron and condemned the crime, he still believes that the Arab-Israeli peace process is a much more important issue. According to political experts, his insistence on resuming the Arab and Palestinian talks with Israel stems from the widespread anxiety that opposition to this bargaining is growing throughout the region. In light of the Zionist entity's character, this question becomes necessary: Will resuming the peace process remedy the Palestinian security problem in the occupied territories? Judging by the Zionist entity's acts, its settlement-building policy, and its arming of Jewish immigrants, the answer cannot be yes. This is particularly true because these inhuman activities enjoy blatant U.S. support.
