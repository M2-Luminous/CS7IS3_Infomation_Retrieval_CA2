The reason is an article published in EXPRESS KHRONIKA No. 45 regarding some actions of the Tiraspol authorities last October, including the voyage of commandos to Moscow to defend the White House. Although many Moscow publications proved that Tiraspol was involved in the bloodshed, it is the first time when Tiraspol authorities deny the accreditation of a Russian journalist.
