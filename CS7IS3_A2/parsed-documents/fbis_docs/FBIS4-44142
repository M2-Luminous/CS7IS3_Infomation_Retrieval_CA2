No, it does not. On the contrary, that approach harms its interests. The dissolution of the Democracy Party and the removal of its deputies from the parliament has come at an unfavorable time. While the Government moved to persecute the struggle it has waged against the Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK], it created the impression internally and abroad that Turkey may deny "the reality of Kurds" at the first opportunity. That impression has to be corrected. The countries that we have persuaded to describe the PKK as a terrorist organization and to outlaw it must not feel that they have been deceived. We should keep in mind the following: Turkey is a democratic country. Seeking rights through the use of arms cannot be explained. Each and every trend of thought must be represented in parliament, provided that legal boundaries are not exceeded. That approach persuaded several foreign countries that had had a skeptical attitude toward Turkey in the past to agree that a legitimate struggle is waged being against the PKK. However, the action that has been taken against the Democracy Party and its deputies will endanger the support Turkey has received from those countries. Meanwhile, foreign pressure will be intensified. The U.S. House of Representatives recently moved to make U.S. military aid to Turkey conditional. That was a warning. The promise that the U.S. Senate will rectify this state of affairs does not seem to be realistic, because a Senate subcommittee has adopted a draft resolution which is even worse. It says that Turkey must not use the arms and military equipment it acquires from the United States for internal security purposes. The Senate will approve it next week. Obviously, another critical stage will emerge in U.S.- Turkey relations. It is not difficult to predict a storm in Western Europe judging by this gust of wind from the other side of the Atlantic Ocean. However, an opportunity exists to resolve the Kurdish problem without harming Turkey's unity and territorial integrity. Our Kurdish citizens only want to have their ethnic identity recognized and to live as citizens of Turkey. An effort is currently being made to establish a new party, which will be known as the People's Democracy Party. It will replace the Democracy Party. Serafettin Elci is working to have it established. Meanwhile, former People's Toil Party Deputy Ibrahim Aksoy is also trying to establish a new party. The founders of the two parties wish to secure the support of the masses. They have concluded from their research that the grassroots of their parties will not support the establishment of a separate state. Continuing the military success that has been achieved against the PKK is only possible if the terrorists and the people are regarded separately. That is how the PKK can be crushed. In view of that, political tolerance and democratic freedoms must be broadened as Turkey draws closer to achieving a military victory against the PKK. Otherwise, it will not be difficult to predict what may happen. The state and administration will cause indignation in the people. Consequently, they will react by supporting the Prosperity Party. In fact, they have already begun to do so. That state of affairs exists not only in southeastern Turkey but also in the other parts of the country, including Istanbul. The people are using the Prosperity Party against the system and the administration, which are reluctant to replace inefficient and unsuccessful politicians. However, no one seems to realize that. Have we taken opium?
