On 10 June, Port-au-Prince Mayor-elect Evans Paul asked General Raoul Cedras, head of the Haitian Army, to resign to avoid the application of the new sanctions announced on the same day by U.S. President Bill Clinton. The basis of the solution to avoid those new sanctions, which are very hard and very painful and which hit all Haitians, remains the implementation of the Governors Island agreement, Paul pointed out. Gen. Cedras must understand the necessity to respect his commitment, he added. President Clinton announced among other things the interdiction of commercial flights between the United States and Haiti as of 25 June and the suspension of private financial transactions with Haiti.
