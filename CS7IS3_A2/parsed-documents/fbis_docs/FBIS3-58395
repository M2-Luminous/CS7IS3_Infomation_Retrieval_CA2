NATO is considering air strikes unless Serb forces stop blocking United Nations peacekeeping operations. NATO is asking the United Nations to draw up contingency plans for this purpose. The warning in the summit's final communique comes after the Allies resolved differences among themselves. Canada had said the threat might put the lives of its peacekeepers in the eastern Bosnian town of Srebrenica at risk. Jason Moskovitz reports from Brussels. [Moskovitz] In less than 24 hours the Canadian position on air strikes has shifted significantly. Andre Ouellet, the foreign minister, was unequivocal yesterday against. He said air strikes could endanger the lives of Canadian peacekeepers. [Ouellet] [recording begins mid-sentence] ....believe that our soldiers that are there could be in serious danger if there is bombing. In fact it could kill soldiers. [Moskovitz] Today Prime Minister Jean Chretien says the Serbs must let Canadian soldiers be replaced in Srebrenica or face possible air strikes. [Chretien] They cannot move. It so happens at this moment that the Canadians cannot be replaced in Srebrenica by the Dutch soldiers, and we are telling them that the time has come to allow their replacement. [Moskovitz] Should there be air strikes, the prime minister was asked what measures would be taken to protect Canadian soldiers. [Chretien] If my grandmother had wheels, she would have been a bus, as Mr. Trudeau used to say. So I, you know, if, I am telling you madame [addressing news conference] clearly that the condition for air strikes does not exist today [sentence as heard]. They might exist eventually, but they do not exist today. [Moskovitz] Canadian officials appeared caught off guard with the tough language of the final communique. In regard to the Canadian position, yesterday was yesterday, today is today.
