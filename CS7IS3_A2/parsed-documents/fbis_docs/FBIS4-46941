Maksimychev: "A Bad Start: First Crisis in Russian-German Relations Becomes Fact"] [Text] Without a doubt, the end of the Russian troop withdrawal from FRG territory will begin a fundamentally new stage in relations between Russia and Germany. It will now, perhaps, be justifiable to speak of the beginning of these relations in pure form even, without the factors attendant upon the presence of our soldiers in a country that never invited them; factors not altogether insignificant, as is sometimes perceived from afar. For instance, the presence of Russian troops in and around Berlin served for a long time as grounds for delaying the transfer of the government to the German capital. The petty thievery concentrated around Russian garrisons created a constant threat of provocation. Also, throughout the duration of the withdrawal, the temptation remained for certain political circles in both countries to use the incomplete status of the withdrawal to serve their own political goals. From now on Russian-German relations will be built on the bona fide national interests of each side, without gifts or compensation being given for what must be done anyway. This sound approach will be not only for Russian-German relations. An approach of this kind will also be predominant in FRG's other lines of foreign policy with regard to the departure of other foreign troops from Germany. There is nothing reprehensible about it. Taking realities into account is entirely normal in the course of mutual relations between independent and sovereign states. Reminiscences of the age of the victors and the vanquished belong to the past. He who has tried to make policy on the basis of the latter will invariably lose. Becoming accustomed to the new style of conducting affairs will not be altogether easy. There is, however, no alternative. At the same time, it would be a mistake to think that relations will be built in a vacuum between the new Germany and the new Russia. No matter how hard one tries to erase from history the writings of former generations, they will clearly surface in the texts that replace them. One cannot view Russian-German relations strictly from 1991 on, as many Russian politicians would like, or from 1945, as official Bonn does now with the support of the oppositional Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD]. Nor can a consideration of Russian-German relations begin from 1941, as is dreamed by the many with a phobia of Germany, or even from 1914, when an age of Russian-German cooperation was ended by the catastrophe of the First World War. Unfortunately, personal, party, and pre-election interests frequently overshadow needs common to all of mankind, even at this critical juncture when the foundation for tomorrow's world is largely being laid. One can only regret that Russian-German relations are no exception in this regard. The main question, and not only for them -whether Russia will be a participant with equal rights in constructing a Greater Europe, or whether the West will once again try to quarantine Russia as a second-rate European power - is being determined on the basis of the past, not the future. And this is namely how Russian society is perceiving the now symbolic finale to the Russian troop withdrawal from German soil at the end of August this year, although the Russian side has formally assented. In the final analysis it is not important whether there will be a parade of departing troops, or whether it is held in Weimar or Berlin, or even whom the departing soldiers will salute on the honorary platform. What was and remains paramount is whether an element of commonality is created at the final farewell ceremony; a commonality that is, logically, five-fold; i.e., which includes both the participation of the four powers which have, for almost a half century, born overall responsibility for Germany, plus Germany, which henceforth will assume sole responsibility for itself. Or, will this element of commonality be absent? In other words, are Europeans finally ready to draw the line on the period of confrontation, or will they carry on the loathsome and fruitless bloc mind set, the tyrannical division between the pure and unpure, and the new, even more painful move to dismantle a continent? The way the final farewell in Berlin is being planned for troops of the four powers would sooner indicate a negative response. The September 8, 1994 official state act at the Brandenburg Gates, which will finalize the withdrawal of foreign troops from Berlin, remains an exclusive event that will involve the three Western powers and Germany. In spite of all of Bonn's assurances of the high priority of German-Russian relations, Russia is being demonstrably excluded from the ranks of those taking part in the summit meeting. "Friends remain friends;" under this motto residents of the Berlin region of Shteglits recently bid farewell to the American battalion under their patronage. There is apparently a different logic regarding the Russians. This marks the onset of a crisis in Russian-German relations, virtually even before relations have had a chance to get started on a new basis. The Russians' understandably wounded self-esteem will hardly permit them to quickly forget the completely undeserved disregard shown toward them. If they are being incriminated for the actions of the Soviet Union during the Cold War period, then it must not be forgotten that it was namely the Soviet Union's policy of Perestroika that not only created the necessary conditions for overcoming the division of Germany, to which the entire world had long become accustomed, but also ensured the peaceful and nonviolent reunification of Germany; including within the framework of the "two plus four" process. As far as Russia is concerned, the nation scrupulously fulfilled ahead of time all of its inherited obligations regarding the withdrawal of troops, although technically speaking, this operation was, on a technical, organizational and ethical level, one of the most complex in the history of armed forces. One must point out the ineptitude demonstrated in the given situation by diplomatic departments in both countries in their failure to foresee society's reaction to the development of events, to obtain timely solutions to the problems which arose, and to avert the negative effects which could have been altogether avoided. On the road to the historic reconciliation between Russians and Germans, which Europe needs, yet another obstacle has arisen. One can only hope that the corresponding lessons will be learned from this essentially mirthless episode, and that both sides will realize the importance of showing consideration for one's partner and his sensitivities.
