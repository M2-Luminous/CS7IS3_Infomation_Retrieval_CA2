Recently there have been some new developments in this story. Albert Gore received one of Schneerson's books from the Lenin Library depository, and Bill Clinton was given seven of them. They say that the question of the return of the Lubavitch collection to the Hasidim has been settled. Rabbi Baruch Kunin is full of energy and vitality at the age of 50, but he is not certain that he will live to see the day when all of the books are returned to Rabbi Schneerson. Yosif took a large cardboard box, which had once held packages of rice (part of the humanitarian aid his father, Rabbi Baruch Kunin, sends to Moscow from California), and carefully wrote the following inscription on the box in Russian: "Please return our books." He put on a black Russian sheepskin coat and set off for the Lenin Library. The Hasidim Go to the Library Yosif and his friends decided that it was time for the books of the Lubavitch rabbis to be returned, now that parliament is not keeping the Russian president and government from doing good deeds. During the October standoff, the Hasidim had helped the Russian democrats as much as they could by delivering kosher sausages and apple juice to the Moscow Soviet, where a huge crowd had gathered in response to Gaydar's appeals. This year the Hasidim celebrated Hanukkah with the slogan "The Freedom of the Schneerson Library and the Genuine Freedom of Russia Are Indivisible," and Rabbi Schneerson said: "Kindness will prevail in Russia, and the sacred books will be returned with a smile." The Hasidim have extremely ambivalent feelings about the Lenin Library. They are grateful to it: The books have been kept safe there since 1916. The Hasidim have also experienced many distressing moments on its steps, however, when they were driven away from the door and were not allowed anywhere near their sacred writings. Once again, Yosif was getting ready to go to the library with a heavy heart. This time, however, the inaccessible books were not the only reason. The 20-year-old rabbi was certain that the books would be returned to their owners sooner or later, but he felt sorry for the people who were committing such a grave sin by keeping them in the dusty dungeon. "Woe to those who do not return the books to us," said Rabbi Schneerson, the head of the present generation of Hasidim. The rabbi had never been mistaken! Yosif felt so sorry for Gorbachev: He had made many promises but had not kept his word. He felt sorry for Gubenko: They say he is a talented man, but now he is facing one problem after another. And what about the Russian parliament, which had rescinded the governmental and judicial decisions to return the books to the Hasidim? Is it possible that people do not understand why all of this happened? The new heads of the Ministry of Culture were also responding in peculiar ways to the requests of the rabbis and senators. They offered copies..., but the Hasidim needed the sacred objects that had been handled by seven generations of Lubavitch rabbis. If the Russian library wants Hasidic books, it can have them, but not the ones that had been handled by the rabbis. It can also have much more: for example, the possibility of on-the-job training for its staffers in libraries in the United States and Israel. Rabbi Yitzhak Kogan was getting ready to go to the library with Yosif. His requests to leave Russia had been denied for 15 years. When he arrived finally in the Holy Land, he heard the rabbis' decision: "Go back to Russia. You are needed there." Yitzhak Kogan is busy with synagogue affairs 24 hours a day: humanitarian aid, prayer, the study of the Torah, and the thousands of minor and major requests and questions people address to their rabbi. In addition, of course, there are the books, which he does not forget for an instant. Kogan had prepared a whole file of recent articles and older documents for his trip to the library. They included Rabbi Yosif Yitzhak Schneerson's letter of November 1922 to the director of the Rumyantsev Library: "In 1921 the Science Library Department of the People's Commissariat of Education issued a decree on the return of the books.... I am renewing my petition for the return of my books." There were also contemporary case documents. Here is an excerpt from a report by Lenin Library Deputy Director V.M. Grigorov to the Ministry of Culture: "There are still more than 10,000 books from the collection in the Lenin Library depository in Khimki. They are stacked in piles and are not being stored in the most desirable conditions. The delays in the processing of this collection are due to the fact that the Lenin Library has only one specialist who reads Hebrew--S.A. Goldenberg. He is a pensioner and is suffering from cataracts." "I feel that Rabbi Schneerson's manuscripts and books in the Lenin Library should be returned to their legal owner, the seventh Lubavitch rabbi, because they are of no scientific value in the development of Hebrew studies. Academician D. Likhachev." Here is an excerpt from a letter the Ministry of Culture received from A.L. Khasroyev, the head of the library of the Oriental Studies Institute of the Academy of Sciences: "Given the present shortage of Oriental and Hebrew scholars in the libraries and the shortage of storage space and of funds for the restoration and processing of private collections, and in view of the absence of legal grounds for the inclusion of this collection among the assets of the Lenin Library, the continued storage of these books seems absolutely pointless and can only destroy the collection." In addition, there were new petitions from scholars, politicians, Jewish Heroes of the Soviet Union.... Rabbi Kogan also took around 10 books with him to the Lenin Library as substitutes in case Yosif's cardboard box did not remain empty. These books were later returned to the synagogue and the box was thrown out with the trash. The Hasidim did notice some changes, however, in the attitude of library personnel: They were given a copy of the catalogue, and a few days later they were allowed to enter the depository and hold the old rabbi's books in their hands. They found two interesting documents in the archives: "I hereby verify that library staffer Lapin delivered 35 crates, 5 of which were damaged, of Jewish books from Warehouse No. 19 on 28 June this year and that the crates were stored in the depository (formerly a church). Report by Lebedev, 20 June 1924." "Act No. 186, 28 June 1924. According to Jewish library storage invoices, 411 poods and 4 pounds of books...were turned over to the Public Library imeni Lenin...." "Our sacred objects have already been listed in terms of weight in other times and other places," Y. Kogan said. "In 1242, 18 wagonloads of volumes of the Talmud in manuscripts from all of the provinces in France were delivered to Paris.... They were burned in the square in front of the Cathedral of Notre Dame. I think they suffered a better fate than the eternal prisoners of the Lenin Library. The Talmud has this to say about burned books: 'The parchment burns, but the letters rise to the heavens.' The sacred letters locked in the storehouses of the Lenin Library, on the other hand, have been invisible to the heavens and the human eye for seven decades now." Contacts on the Highest Level The Hasidim had great hopes for the Russian visit by American Vice-President Albert Gore, who had been actively involved in the Schneerson cause when he was a senator. These hopes were largely justified. He went to the Lenin Library and saw the collection of books and manuscripts. He was shown a dozen unique publications, including volumes printed in Poland in 1594, in Amsterdam in 1659, and in Constantinople in 1502 and a prayer book printed in 1541, but the main thing was that Gore left the library holding a copy of the "Taniya"--a leather-bound and gold-embossed book published in Russia in 1902. This was the main philosophical work of the Habad Lubavitch movement. It was written almost 200 years ago by Rabbi Schneur Zaman, who was then the spiritual leader of the group. The book was to be presented to the 92-year-old Rabbi Schneerson. Rabbi B. Kunin and his sons, Rabbi Y. Kogan, and Maimonides Academy Director V. Irina flew to Brooklyn with the precious relic as soon as they had received it from A. Gore. The rabbi has been gravely ill for a long time and is confined to a wheelchair. He has difficulty speaking. The Hasidim were certain that the book would be the best medicine for him. "This is a sign of goodwill and a step in the right direction," said Minister of Culture Yevgeniy Sidorov. "We applaud this gesture wholeheartedly. The problem of the collection now stored in the Lenin Library is close to resolution," A. Gore said. Rabbi Baruch Kunin added that "receiving this book is only the start of a long journey, but it is a phenomenal beginning." In some respects, however, the situation became even more complicated. In the past everything was clear: The Hasidim insisted on the unconditional return of the books, and their opponents were firmly convinced that the books belonged in the Lenin Library. Now, however, the Ministry of Culture suggested that the collection should remain in Moscow, in a special building next to another building for religious ceremonies. This option was acceptable to many, even the president of Russia, who had approved this plan back in November 1993. This turn of events did not please the Hasidim, however, because they saw it as a treacherous maneuver. Now they had to pin their hopes on the American President's arrival in Moscow. Thomas Pickering, the U.S. ambassador in Russia, was of tremendous help to the Hasidim. I had a chance to speak with him on the first day of the presidential visit in Moscow, when we met by accident in the conservatory and were greeted by Grand Hall Director Svetlana Gorbacheva. The ambassador already knew all of the details of the case of the Lubavitch collection. Pickering's diplomatic artistry produced results: Clinton was given seven books and was promised, in the words of some of those who accompanied the American President, that almost the whole collection would be loaded onto his plane, but there was not enough time for this. The Associated Press and Radio Israel reported that the issue of the return of the collection had been resolved completely, citing sources in the American administration, but Rabbi Kunin, who has devoted the last few years to the fight for the books, believes that this is not the end and that the speculation over the Lubavitch collection will continue. The only certainty is that the summit-level meetings added eight books to the library in Brooklyn. Once again the future is indeterminate. The Hasidic books are a tougher nut to crack than the nuclear weapons in Ukraine, the Partnership for Peace program, the credits to save Russian democracy, and the transmission of KGB secrets connected with the Kennedy assassination. All of these matters have been cleared up, but how much more time and effort can our high-level statesmen waste on the resolution of a matter that is certainly not of primary importance to Russia?! The whole Lenin Library and all of the liberal arts in Russia are dying, and this is arousing less concern and anxiety than a few crates of books no one can read. How much longer can this misapplication of authority and manipulation of the law be tolerated? How can even one book be returned if this is against the law? And if the law requires that the whole collection be returned to its owner, why has this not been done? Did we grace Clinton with a generous gift, or did we put him in an ambiguous position by presenting him with something that does not belong to us? America is particularly scrupulous in matters of property rights and, in contrast to us, draws strict distinctions between church, state, and private or personal property. How Can We Live Together as Friends in the Future? Russia is the birthplace of the Lubavitch movement, and although Rabbi Kogan said that "our history in Russia is coming to an end," this genetic link cannot be broken even in the event of a total exodus, like the one from Egypt. A special center devoted to the history of the Lubavitch movement might be established here, and the Hasidim are prepared to supply it with all of the necessary literature. A Russian translation of the "Taniya" is already being prepared for publication in an edition of 10,000 copies. Religious Jews are not the only people with an interest in Hasidic literature. I saw a large collection of works by Martin Buber--the greatest religious philosopher on the metaphysics and history of Hasidism--in Paris in the home of Valeriy Afanasyev, the famous contemporary pianist and novelist. Valeriy is particularly interested in the Cabala and the mystical aspects of this philosophy. Habad, of course, is not on the same level as Blavatskaya. Here, for example, is what the Lubavitch rabbi told his congregation on Hanukkah about the difference between the two worlds--Jewish and Hellenistic: "On the one hand there is a special way of life, based on pure monotheism, in which the prevailing idea is that daily life is sacrosanct in all of its details, even the most minor ones; on the other there is the hellenistic culture with its polytheistic and materialistic ideas." The readers of this message, mostly craftsmen, small businessmen, merchants, and kibbutz farmers, are completely conversant with this discussion. The educated Hasid is usually well-versed in the works of Maimonides and esoteric and mystical theories that even a philosopher with a degree may not understand. The Hasidim themselves should want others to know more about their life and ideas. After all, many of their contemporaries see them as borderline fanatics, and even those who sympathize with them often equate them with the aborigines of Australia and Argentina, but the Hasidim are primarily scholars, who are steeped in idealistic dialectic from infancy. New approaches can and must be found by the Hasidim and by their Russian partners, but Schneerson's books are Schneerson's books. Their fate should be decided by the rabbi and the people he authorized to do this. The Hasidim would consent to keeping the Schneerson collection in a building of its own in Russia only as a necessary transitional measure. I have to say that I do not think the books should be turned over to the synagogue on Bronnaya Street, to the Maimonides Academy, as the Hasidim insisted at one time: Conditions there are not suitable for this. Other options are certainly possible, but the search for the best of these options will require respect for the law, for property rights, and for religious values. When Many Are Erudite But Few Are Wise The legislative aspect of this matter warrants special discussion. If legal standards were more precise, these disgraceful cases would be much fewer in number. After all, the problem is not confined to the Schneerson collection. During the ceremonies marking the restoration of the Kazan Cathedral on Red Square, the president of Russia announced a decision to move sacred Orthodox icons--the Vladimir icon of the Blessed Mother and Rublev's "Trinity"--from the Tretyakov Gallery to the church. The decision aroused the anger of museum personnel, and now a long and troublesome series of judicial hearings is anticipated. A scandal with no precedent in our cultural history broke out in connection with the contract Ostankino signed with U.S. Art Group Inc., an American corporation. General Director Yuriy Kornilov of the State Television and Radio Program Library was arrested for taking bribes from corporate executive Tristan Dell, which were paid...with the knowledge of the Russian special services. Pianist Nikolay Petrov testified in court against the transaction, and his property was impounded. Now the case is moving up the judicial ladder, but this was actually a case involving national property: unique tapes including performances by Chaliapin, Oistrakh, Kogan, Sofronitskiy, and Rostropovich. While the country was preoccupied with the Schneerson rarities, which no one really understands, the deal of the century was being concluded in the Ostankino offices without any excess publicity, and even without the consent or knowledge of the minister of culture! Germany, Holland, Italy, Austria, and other countries have serious claims to some of the cultural treasures that remained in Russia after the war. These include the greatest artistic treasures, but the methods of quiet diplomacy have prevailed, and there has been almost no mention of this in the press. The experience of the guileless Hasidim, who go to the Lenin Library with their empty boxes, taught many people a lesson. Many issues which cannot be settled on the presidential level can be resolved in confidential talks with the officials who hold the keys to storage rooms and official seals. This will continue as long as there are no precise legal standards on the use of the country's cultural property. This will continue as long as the people responsible for this property act as its managers and owners instead of as its custodians. According to a Hasidic parable, the world once had many wise men of integrity. They met regularly to make decisions, guided by the spirit of the Torah. They could even move the Sabbath to a different day. In time, however, there were more erudite men than wise men of integrity, and erudite men are not necessarily wise or honest, and this is why they can substantiate and justify anything that is advantageous or convenient for them. Then the commandments of the Torah were supplemented by the specific standards of daily life, which defined what could and could not be done. There were particularly detailed standards regulating the ownership of the eternal sources of discord. These strict laws allowed society to survive instead of being destroyed by conflicts and clashes of interests and beliefs. I do not know any Hasidim or people close to their community who agree on even the most minor issues. They argue their own point of view without listening to others and they can be extremely competitive and arrogant, but the law tells them that there is one serious matter, one constant--the Torah. This is where all debates come to an end. This is what allowed the Jews to endure and survive the difficult millennia of their history. This is what helped them in their fight with the Soviet bureaucracy for Schneerson's books. After all, they have already accomplished so much: The books have been released from captivity and are being handled by individuals who regard them as the most sacred objects on earth. The road to further advancement has been cleared.
