Without plans, after all, we cannot make our way through the thickets of the market, and regardless of how allergic a certain segment of our population might be to the very word "plan," the facts are these: No enterprise or industry in the West can even consider its future existence without forecasts. In addition, there is also short-term, medium-term, and strategic planning--for 10-20 years in advance. Today in our country, God himself has commanded us to shape up, as the saying goes. Let us take a look at the chemical complex, for example. No branch of the national economy can develop without the use of modern chemical products. Incidentally, for the sake of comparison, their share of the total industrial product is 12 percent in Germany and 9 percent in the United States, but in our country the figure decreased by 20 percent in the last four years and now amounts to 5.1 percent. The present structure of the Ukrainian chemical industry as a whole does not meet modern requirements and cannot satisfy the country's needs. The reasons are well-known: Just a few years ago our chemical complex was part of the union complex, with quite intense cooperation by enterprises. Today we are disentangling ourselves from this interdependence, but we do not have the raw materials for the production of several important commodities (we receive 80 percent of them from Russia), and we are not producing some of the main basic resources--rubber, styrene, aniline, and others. We are also feeling the effects of disparate technological goals, the low percentage of state-of-the-art technologies and production units, the considerable depreciation of fixed assets (up to 60 percent), and the obsolete technology. That is why structural changes in the chemical complex have to be considered now. What will the Ukrainian chemical industry look like in the near future? The editors asked Ukrainian First Deputy Minister of Industry V.S. Novitskyy to answer this question and several others. [Svichkolap] Vladimir Stanislavovich, now that actual events are surpassing all expectations, and now that any kind of reform can be expected at any time, I think that one of the things we have to do is express our appreciation for the courage of the people who are deciding the development strategy for the chemical complex. Please tell us how this massive task began. [Novitskyy] There is no question that we are living in a difficult time, but you will agree that any system has to make plans and predictions and evaluate its own performance before it can develop. A complex as huge as the chemical industry naturally requires the best possible development model and a corresponding program of action. We began by analyzing the degree to which our industry can meet our country's need for chemical products. We learned that we are satisfying some of the national economy's requirements--for nitrogen fertilizer, for example. On the other hand, we are not producing some extremely necessary products. Our analysis indicated gaps in technological chains: We have the raw materials and the final products, but the semimanufactured products are in other CIS countries. We calculated how much of each of these products we need and where the gaps in the chains have to be repaired and now we will start building the kind of structure that will satisfy all of our country's needs. We are certain that the chemical complex will recover all foreign currency investments. [Svichkolap] That is a bold prediction in view of today's deficit in the balance of exports and imports. [Novitskyy] Yes, but one of our primary objectives is a positive balance, and one of the main ways of achieving this will entail energy conservation. We are lagging far behind the Western countries in this respect. [Svichkolap] There are so many different methods of industrial restructuring in world experience, some of which have gone so far as to suspend the operations of selected facilities and eliminate whole industries. Which method have you chosen? [Novitskyy] Our plans for the development of the chemical complex include fundamental strategic guidelines, and we have drawn up a program of action on this basis. It stipulates the main stages of the process, the cost of carrying out each stage, and the deadlines for the completion of the work. This, however, does not mean that we will not be making adjustments as time goes on. We can expect changes in the economy, in our approaches, and in the prices of energy resources and many types of raw materials. We can adjust to all of these circumstances. The process of restructuring in the Western countries occurred back in the 1960s when there was an abundant supply of chemical products. We, on the other hand, are experiencing shortages of almost everything. This is why we are taking a different approach: Although the whole chemical complex is slated for dynamic development, we will make a more intense effort in some areas. The operations of whole production units could have been halted in those areas, but we do not need this, even though we might have some excess capacities for the production of ammonia and nitrogen fertilizers today. These are among Ukraine's main exports. It is true that the current prices of natural gas virtually preclude the profitable, and even lucrative, export of products. for this reason, one of our main objectives today is the reduction of the energy and material requirements of our production units. We drew up a program for this purpose, and it is already being implemented. Ammonia production units, for example, are being modernized, and this project will do much to reduce proportional expenditures of natural gas and other resources and thereby lower the overhead costs of production. The program envisages the extraction and processing of four to five times as much potassium ore, the development of phosphorite deposits, the stabilization of the sulfur output, and the development of new lime deposits. For the time being, however, Ukraine's need for phosphorus fertilizers can be satisfied only with the use of phosphorus raw materials from Russia. [Svichkolap] Yes, but for several well-known reasons our relations with Russia are regrettably "thorny." We live in a dynamic world, however, and if we are having difficulty acquiring raw materials from Russia, why not buy them from, for instance, the countries of Northwest Africa? [Novitskyy] At this time the shipments of apatite from the Kola Peninsula are the most preferable option from the economic standpoint. The African phosphorites are inferior in quality and are not any cheaper. Even this option has been considered, however, and can be employed at any time. Now we have begun producing phosphorus fertilizers. We will need around 600,000 tonnes of apatite by the spring sowing season to satisfy the needs of agriculture. If our enterprises work constantly, without any interruptions, we expect to satisfy minimum agricultural requirements. A big conference of the heads of oblast organizations of the Ministry of Agriculture and the managers of Ministry of Industry enterprises was held a few days ago. We reached an agreement on the whole group of issues connected with fertilizer supplies. [Svichkolap] Vladimir Stanislavovich, at the last meeting of the Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, the director complained that Ukrainian enterprises are selling materials and products at prices exceeding world prices within our country and at one-third to one-fourth the cost abroad. Does this apply to the chemical complex as well? [Novitskyy] I have to admit that I do not know exactly what he was talking about. We do have problems of competitiveness with some of the products of the chemical industry. In other words, our expenditures are sometimes higher than the world prices of these products. We are essentially selling carbamide and ammonia at a zero profit margin, for example, but only at the present exchange rate of the dollar. The official exchange rate of the dollar to the karbovanets today is not an accurate reflection of their value and is a problem throughout industry. The exchange rate is obviously too low for the exporter. Here is the situation: It is best for the exporter to have the highest possible exchange rate, but the importer who buys raw materials would prefer the opposite--a lower exchange rate. We need a comprehensive assessment of this situation, and we certainly need the regulation of the rate, even if the state has to become involved in this. The rate has to change in response to changes in the economic and financial situation. Otherwise, we run the risk of misalignment. An exchange rate that is too low discourages exports, and the consequences can be quite severe: We will lose the market. If our products are not there, the vacuum will be filled quickly by another supplier, and then it will be extremely difficult to break into the market again. This calls for a balanced and reasonable approach, so that we do not put too much pressure on our own exporters or on the producers using imported raw materials. This is done in the stock exchange in every other country, but our situation is more complex. That is why we cannot get along without government regulation. [Svichkolap] Any plan can be implemented when enterprises are operating and science is making progress, but our country is in a pitiful state. How will it be possible to act on even the best intentions when everyone here is insolvent? [Novitskyy] You are right. This is a difficult situation. Science has suffered most of all. The cost of maintaining project planning and research institutes and design bureaus has risen, but the need for scientific and products (however paradoxical this might sound) has decreased. There is not enough working capital to pay for contracted projects. We are trying to find a solution. We set up innovation and economic regulation funds. They are being used to finance the scientific and technical programs of institutes. These funds are understandably inadequate. The institutes are working directly with enterprises, but even these possibilities are limited because the enterprises are also suffering from a shortage of funds. As far as the general situation in the chemical complex is concerned, it was always difficult even in the past. It became critical, however, in the first months of this year. The abrupt rise in energy prices literally drove the enterprises to their knees, and this was followed by a period of sharp cuts in gas shipments, when we had to suspend continuous production processes. Now they are being started up again. Officials in Moscow have agreed to continue shipping gas to us in the same quantities as before until 11 April and to make up for 80 percent of the gas shipments we are not getting from Turkmenistan. We are still racking our brains, however, over the two main shortages--of working capital and hard currency. The shortage of hard currency could be alleviated by increasing exports and reducing imports, but the reduction of imports would presuppose the production of the same goods in our country or the reduced consumption of some imports. This would call for efforts in many different areas. As far as working capital is concerned, we have calculated that the shortage of working capital at enterprises of the Ministry of Industry exceeds 10 trillion karbovantsy. Under these conditions, even successful enterprises will be bankrupted by the next rise in prices. It is understandable, therefore, that the problem of supplementing our working capital must be solved on the governmental level, perhaps not in its entirety, but at least for 70 percent of the total amount required. Otherwise, the shortage of working capital will result in the instability of all industry. [Svichkolap] Do you believe that structural changes in the chemical complex can make a difference even in this "overheated" economy? [Novitskyy] I am certain that Ukraine is not suffering from a terminal illness. We have enough intelligent minds, working hands, undeveloped mineral deposits, and the wish to make our country rich. We have the potential to satisfy light industry's need for chemical fibers and filaments and to develop the aniline dye industry. The program envisages a considerable increase in the output of plastic and synthetic resins (steps have already been taken to remodel some production units and build some new ones). We plan to modernize and augment our capacities for the production of household chemicals, the active base of medications, and superpure substances for radioelectronics. Our plans also assign special priority to the environment. In conclusion, I want to say that the work on the program will achieve the restructuring of the chemical complex, fill the market with new chemical products, secure the steady work of enterprises, minimize the dependence of this work on shipments of raw materials and semimanufactured products from the CIS countries and distant foreign countries, reduce energy consumption considerably, and result in a positive export-import balance by the year 2000.
