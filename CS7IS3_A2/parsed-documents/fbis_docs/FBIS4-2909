He also praised the son for his continued efforts to further the relations between the two countries.

Konishi, who used to be the chief secretary to Tatsunosuke Takasaki, told Rong that to develop the friendship in a sustained way, many famous entrepreneurs and politicians were accompanying them on the visit.

The Japanese guests arrived here Wednesday at the invitation of the Beijing municipal government. During their stay here they have acquainted themselves with Beijing's investment environment, and discussed new co-operative projects with departments concerned, such as the Beijing general agriculture, industry and commerce corporation.
