Ihab Tawfiq Barakat was hit by a bullet in the head during a demonstration in Rafah which followed Monday's death in the border town of a wanted member of the Red Eagles, the armed wing of George Habash's Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. Another Palestinian was wounded in the shooting as troops riposted to stone-throwing and injured two Palestinians in the Dayr al-Balah refugee camp and another in Gaza City. The latest death brought to 1,177 the number of Palestinians killed by Israeli bullets since the intifada or uprising began in December 1987, according to an AFP toll. Meanwhile, a young Palestinian from Gaza wounded a Russian-Israeli immigrant with an axe at Ashdod on Tuesday morning, police said. On the West Bank, the army closed a mosque near Ramallah saying it had been a propaganda centre for 'Izz-al-din al-Qassam, the armed wing of the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas). 'Izz-al-din announced Tuesday that it was carrying out a "Ramadan plan" for the Moslem fasting month to avenge the killing of Palestinian militants by Israeli soldiers. "Vengeance will be taken anywhere. The blood of our militants will not flow unpunished and the Ramadan plan has begun," the armed wing said in a statement sent to AFP. Hamas claimed responsibility for murdering an Israeli secret service agent and wounding two more near Ramallah on Sunday. A Palestinian double agent, who had collaborated with the authorities, led the Israelis into a trap, military officials said.
