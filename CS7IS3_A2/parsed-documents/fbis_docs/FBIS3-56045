There have been hundreds of announcements by private farms in the Far East and Russia's south that they are ceasing their activities. However, it would be a mistake to regard these facts as evidence that private farming in Russia has no future, as supporters of collective farming were quick to do. If you look more carefully at the statistics, you can see that even in regions where the reduction in the numbers of private farmers is most significant, reaching 3-4 percent, there is at the same time an increase in the area of land used by private farmers. Private peasant farms are being enlarged, land is being redistributed, and economic management of private farms is being optimized. This process is absolutely natural and to be expected. More than a year ago Agriculture Minister Viktor Khlystun forecast in this newspaper an imminent slowdown in what was at that time rapid growth of private farming as the potential for such growth is limited, and forecast the optimization of private farming's share in the rural economy for a protracted period. On the other hand, the development of private farming through the reform of collective farms, turning them into joint-stock and cooperative farms, as is happening at present, should have proceeded much more intensively. But individual, family farms in the hands of private farmers are also proving their viability. They have approximately a 5-percent share of agricultural land today. But according to what are for the moment preliminary figures for last year's results, private farmers' production of basic types of agricultural output was significantly higher than 5 percent. Private farmers sold more than 2 million tonnes of grain alone to state resources while the state purchased in all about 26 million tonnes. Nevertheless, problems in the private farming sector have gotten more acute recently, as, incidentally, they have in the agricultural sector as a whole. This is first and foremost linked to the financial situation. In the opinion of Vladimir Bashmachnikov, chairman of the Association of Russian Peasant (Private) Farms and Agricultural Cooperatives [AKKOR], the fairly massive exodus of peasants from private farming is due to the fact that a "financial bottleneck" arose at the end of last year: The state dragged its feet paying for output which had already been delivered, and the banks harshly demanded the return of credits. Many peasant farms found themselves on the verge of bankruptcy and ruin. According to Bashmachnikov, the situation has changed today. Some of the state debts have been paid off and credits have been extended, although at high interest rates. A search is under way to find sensible types of relations between private farmers and banking structures.
