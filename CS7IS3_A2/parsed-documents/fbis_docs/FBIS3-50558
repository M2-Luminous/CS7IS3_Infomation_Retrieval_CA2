Jose Luis Gonzalez Aguilera, coordinator of the Permanent Agrarian Congress, has said that the problems of the Indian groups will not be resolved with weapons but admitted that the violence that prevails in Chiapas is the product of increased poverty and, often, the systematic repression that these social groups have had to endure. Gonzalez did not disregard the possibility of the Zapata National Liberation Army being led by Guatemalan guerrillas. Meanwhile, Jose Luis Hernandez, a peasant leader from the Independent Central Organization of Agricultural Workers and Peasants [CIOAC], has said that the problem can be resolved by establishing a truce between the government and the armed group. [Begin Hernandez recording] We completely reject an Army intervention to give this matter any kind of military or police treatment, because this is not what this is about. These people are not criminals committing a crime; they are human beings demanding justice. [end recording] Meanwhile, Alvaro Lopez, a leader of the National Union of Agricultural Workers [UNTA], and Ignacio Iris Salomon, of (Coduc) [not further identified] has called on the parties to resolve the armed conflict as soon as possible, because it represents a threat to the country's social stability on the eve of the August 1994 federal elections.
