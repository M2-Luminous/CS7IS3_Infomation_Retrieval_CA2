He was commenting in an interview with ITAR-TASS on the statement of the quadrilateral commission for the return of refugees and displaced persons to Abkhazia, which was signed in Sochi on April 9. "We must make people understand that the process will be long. It may take several years," said Lakerbaya. He expressed confidence that it would do no good to try and artificially accelerate the process, which could only provoke new clashes and a new exacerbation of the situation. More, it is not ruled out that the introduction of peacekeeping forces can extend in time, leaving all decisions of the return of refugees "suspended in midair". "There is no need to out the cart before the horse. Let documents be prepared thoroughly, so that they are fully ready by the time the U.N. Security Council passes the required resolution", Leonid Lakerbaya said.
