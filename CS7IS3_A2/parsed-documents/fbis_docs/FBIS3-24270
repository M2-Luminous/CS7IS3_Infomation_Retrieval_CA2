Our MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS correspondents learned this as soon as they pulled out their cameras. Among those who vacation here are not only staff officers of state security but also members of the covert staff and illegal agents who, quite obviously, do not want their photos taken even for such a widely read newspaper as MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS. For the same reason, the resort is located in a quiet corner of Moscow Oblast and is surrounded by a good fence--no strangers are permitted on its territory. "Moskvich" is one of MB's [Ministry of Security] recreation facilities, which are now under the jurisdiction of the Military-Medical Administration of the Federal Counterintelligence Service [FSK]. It was built quite recently, in 1989. It can accommodate 810 guests and serves the FSK, the SVR [Foreign Intelligence Service], the GUO [Main Protection Directorate], the FAPSI [Federal Agency for Government Communications and Information], and the border troops--every agency that has emerged in Russia in place of the KGB since the reforms of 1991-1993. "Why did the agencies that emerged during the reform of the special services decide not to divide the KGB sanitariums and resorts but instead left everything under the FSK umbrella?" our MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS correspondent asked Major General Nikolay Mikheyev, chief of the FSK Military-Medical Administration. [Mikheyev] Take the Imeni Dzerzhinskogo sanitarium in Sochi--how do you divide it? And the only hospital? All the services--the FAPSI, the main directorate for protection of president, intelligence, the border troops, and so on--supported the idea of keeping the medical services together as a whole. [MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS] Is there a lot to divide? [Mikheyev] Four and a half thousand accommodations. There are seven sanitariums and eight resorts--in the North Caucasus, at Caucasus mineral waters (Kislovodsk, Mineralnyye Vody), and the central belt of the European part of Russia. [MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS] Did you lose a lot after the disintegration of the USSR? [Mikheyev] About 50 percent of available capacity. Since 1991, 15 health facilities--eight sanitariums, four resorts, and three pioneer camps--have been transferred to the jurisdiction of independent states. In Ukraine--in Crimea, near Kiev, and in Odessa. Three health facilities were left in Georgia and one in the Baltics. Our children mainly spent their vacations in Ukraine. Since the disintegration of the USSR we do not have any children's camps on the Black Sea shore. By presidential edict a pioneer camp in Anapa, which previously belonged to Ukrainian enterprises, has been transferred to us. [MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS] How did the nationalization of KGB property proceed in the republics? [Mikheyev] We were simply informed. That is all. For instance, in Georgia: the Samshitovaya Roshcha sanitarium in Pitsunda for 850 accommodations, absolutely new--built just two years ago. Now the property of the information and intelligence service of Georgia. The future of the sanitarium is unknown. We have to enter into agreements with the independent states: With Ukraine, we swap vouchers. [MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS] How much does it cost to vacation in a security organ sanitarium? [Mikheyev] Because of inflation, prices keep going up. In 1991 a voucher cost 400 rubles [R]. Now it is on average R140,000-160,000. For 21-24 days, room and board included. By law, members of special services, as military personnel, have allowances. The wife gets the voucher at 50 percent of the cost, the officer--25 percent. That is, he pays R40,000. [MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS] Do all officers vacation in equal accommodations? Are there not some privileged sanitariums for higher-ranking personnel or state-owned dacha complexes? [Mikheyev] The Military-Medical Administration does not have dacha complexes. Everybody vacations in the same manner, eats in the same cafeteria. There are resorts that have been built recently. They are better--they have rooms for two. Those built before the war as a rule have four persons per room. There are upgraded accommodations--two-room suites, but for an extra cost. [MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS] Where do the top people in your agency like to vacation? [Mikheyev] In the summer many of those who had vacations went to Sochi, to the Imeni Dzerzhinskogo sanitarium. In the past, they liked Yalta very much. Kislovodsk is popular--for some reason, they prefer the old building there, built in the park zone in 1932, although there is now also a new one, with more conveniences. [MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS] And the last question. How are vouchers divided between the agencies? [Mikheyev] In proportion to personnel numbers. Everybody has equal conditions. We regularly exchange opinions on this subject. There is no problem with this. There is a different kind of a problem. For instance, we do not have any sanitariums or resorts in the Asian part. One is only now under construction in Vladivostok. Meanwhile, people from those regions do not come here--travel costs are too high. We have to make arrangements with the Ministry of Defense and the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs]. They accommodate our requests. In exchange, we give them vouchers here, in the European part. [end Mikheyev] Small buildings hide among pine trees. Cozy rooms--"three-star"--are furnished with custom-made furniture. The sports complex has a large year-round swimming pool (still functions). Among recent guests here were Americans who came from the International Sports Association to award belts to our officers--karate specialists: special services staff train and take exams here, at the resort. There are two ways to vacation in "Moskvich." To apply to the FSK and pay the full cost--about R14,000 a day. Or get recruited as, for instance, a covert agent and vacation for 25 percent of the cost. Your choice.
