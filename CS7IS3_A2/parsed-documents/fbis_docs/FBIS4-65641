Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said the relevant Turkish deputy foreign minister summoned the Greek ambassador in Ankara and lodged a demarche, claiming that PKK members are being trained on Greek territory. The spokesman stressed: Statements and demarches by Turkey that cause artificial tension have no meaning; Greece will not become an accomplice in creating an artificial climate of tension. Venizelos said: Greece condemns every act of violence and terrorism. There is no official representation of the PKK in our country. Greece is a pluralist state of law, with a legal order; whoever violates that legal order is punished. And he also noted that there is no reason for Turkey to attempt to export its domestic problems.
