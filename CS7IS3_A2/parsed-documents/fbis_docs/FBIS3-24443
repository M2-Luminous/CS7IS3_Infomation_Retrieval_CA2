The average rates of monthly inflation came to 17 percent during this period while in February they fell below 10 percent for the first time since the liberalization of the economy. Most likely Shumeyko was shaken by data concerning the drop in industrial production in February 1994 by 24.1 percent in comparison with the analogous period of last year, as a result of which the proposal to quickly change something in the management of the economy has been born. But if the speaker of the Council of the Federation would have had a bit of time free from important state meetings then he would have, first, paid attention to the regular January "collapses" in industrial production constantly repeating in recent years. Without regard to the causes of the fatal dislike of industry for the first month of the year (and they, of course, are not in the large number of New Year celebrations, since the average-daily January indicators also demonstrate the same tendency to fall) precisely January exerts a decisive influence on the entire annual dynamics of the gross indicators. All the remaining months are characterized by an absence of jumps in production and, based on the year's results, the gross economic indicators produce a picture differing insignificantly from that of January. So that Mr. Shumeyko needed to propose emergency measures in the economy a month earlier. Now his initiative looks economically somewhat strange, especially based on the fact that in February the volume of industrial production... grew by 2.3 percent in comparison with January. Well, if one is to be quite precise, then proposals about introducing emergency measures in the economy were more appropriate after the January drop of a year ago. Then there also was another speaker, and the deputies acted differently towards the possibility of abrupt movements in the economy. Legislative support of emergency measures in the economy would have been unquestioning. How poorly does the speaker of the Council of the Federation reflect economic reality, so well does he relay the lobbyist moods of the masses--there cannot be another reason for discussions about emergency measures in the economy. To the typical deputy-dilettante, cries about the growth of non-payments and the drop in production seem to be the most favorable occasion for demonstrating concern about the domestic economy. It is unimportant that non-payments are the ordinary situation of the lack of effective demand (and there exist rather simple and well known methods for clearing up the finances of bankrupt enterprises) and that the size of the drop, not even touching upon the inadequacies of this aggregated indicator, demonstrates the absolute need for structural changes in the economy (this refers primarily to the military-industrial complex), et cetera, et cetera. For the deputy-dilettante, the chief thing is to declare threateningly about his feelings about approaching catastrophe and to "offer proposals." Since the deputy-dilettante knows no other "proposals" except emergency measures in the economy, the formidable weapon in his opinion--the words "emergency," "urgent," and "freeze"--is extracted from his vocabulary. The lack of the habit of analysis does not permit such a deputy to understand that, in initiating the introduction of emergency measures in the economy, he not only condemns the country to economic chaos but also digs his own political grave. You see, the executive power (a government, president or simply a dictator), having received the okay for emergency measures has no more need for legislators and legislative supervision. It is not to be ruled out that Mr. Shumeyko also will be able to carry out in such a situation the third in his life parliamentary-governmental game of musical chairs. But it is hardly worth doubting that from the moment emergency measures in the economy are introduced the remaining deputies will have to seek new work.
