[Correspondent] They told us about such a case recently in the State Trade Inspectorate: a store obtained ham from a local meat combine at 4,500 per kilogram each and, passing it off as imported, sold it quite openly and quite uninhibitedly at 18,000 rubles each. Consumers are now being robbed everywhere and on a mass basis. In protecting their interests, they are compelled to unite in associations and parties. But what is the state undertaking for the protection of the rights of consumers? [Bochin] Public organizations of consumers have begun to work really actively in some regions, but for the most part their organization is still only going on. The territorial administrations of the Antimonopoly Committee support this process in every way possible. However, the principal role in protecting the rights of consumers still belongs to state organs. Basing itself on the Law "On Protection of the Rights of Consumers," the Antimonopoly Committee alone has investigated 16,000 citizen's appeals during the past year. As a result goods have been replaced, operations have been corrected and penalties paid, and moral and material losses to consumers amounting to hundreds of millions of rubles reimbursed. More than 600 administrative actions have been brought. Representatives of the Antimonopoly Committee are active in the legal defense of consumers or assist them in the preparation of suits in court. We do this free of charge. I can cite a lot of cases when people who have found themselves in a desparate plight have obtained justice with our help. For example, a person's Zhiguli was stolen from the paid parking lot of the oblast car-owners' council in Kursk last summer. No one wants to be answerable for this; the parking lot owner is not accepting claims. There was a vehicle--and it was gone. Then the victim appealed for help to the territorial administration of the Antimonopoly Committee. A trial took place. As a result a VAZ-21063 motor vehicle and a further R3,200,000 in compensation were recovered from the Kursk oblast council of the car owners' society to pay off the losses. There are many such examples. However, I want to say that much depends on the consumers themselves. They should know that the law has given them significant rights which are protected by the state. [Correspondent] Russia has been turned into a dump where they cart low-quality goods from all over the world. What is the Antimonopoly Committee doing to stop this flow? [Bochin] Indeed, state monitoring of the implementation of the contracts of Russian firms with foreign suppliers is rather weak. Our merchants buy up a low-grade good at dumping prices, they carry it to Russia and don't encounter any particular obstacles. Deserving of censure, for example, is just one incident with Argentinian chickens which were brought into Russia through the Maritime Kray customs house. The chickens were slaughtered as far back as 1986-87 and had lain around a long time, since they hadn't sold because of low quality. And then the Russian merchants, who don't care a rap about their own people, turned up. They bought this trash and delivered it to the Far East without certificates of fitness. And no one has been able to stop this outrage. But such a fine should have been exacted from the firm that it would have forever lost the desire to import refuse quality products into Russia. It is time to take measures on the state level about liability for trading in low quality goods. The Antimonopoly Committee has prepared its own proposals to the government about bringing the system for monitoring the safety of imported products into conformity with the legislation of Russia and international agreements. [Correspondent] We had expected that the denationalization of trade would lead to the development of competition and this, in turn, would improve trade service and eliminate standing in line. But in the matter of trade, the producers of goods and services have remained monopolists who literally rob us. Dirt, lines, and rudeness everywhere. When will there be an end to this? [Bochin] There is no longer monopolism in trade. During the last two years of the implementation of the program of small-scale privatization and of the demonopolization program one has succeeded in creating a competitive environment in retail trade. Some 32,000 stores and about 9,000 public catering enterprises have now been privatized in Russia. This constitutes 65 and 61 percent of the total number respectively. That the level of trade service, the number of stores, and even the number of those employed in trade as before does not correspond to the norms of developed countries is another matter. And I think that one should not expect fundamental changes too quickly. It needs to be taken into account that the same personnel and leadership have remained in the majority of stores. The majority of these people never will become civilized merchants. They trade as they are able to. However, even they will have to take the competition which has arisen into account. In particular, the emergence of unorganized street trade has forced the stores to expand assortment, to stick to acceptable prices, and even to improve somewhat in the organization of trade. Matters are worse in wholesale trade, since here the creation of parallel structures is connected with the development of warehouses and transport support, and all this requires time and lots of money. [Correspondent] What is the Antimonopoly Committee doing to develop competition on the consumer market? [Bochin] Within the framework of the powers granted us we are bringing about the break up of the former trade organizations, trusts, and supply and sales structures into smaller units. We are providing support to small and medium-sized business through the creation of the approriate funds. In order for new monopolists not to arise in place of the former ones, we are keeping an eye on the creation, mergings, additions, and liquidations of economic subjects. Sometimes the activity of local organs of power and administration directed to the restriction of competition has to be stopped. We are monitoring enterprises and firms which occupy a dominating position in the market. If they begin to dictate conditions to consumers we have to intervene. [Correspondent] Has the Antimonopoly Committee itself been endowed with sufficient rights so as to effectively protect the rights of the consumers? [Bochin] Our rights and powers are defined by the Law "On Protection of the Rights of Consumers." However, I am convinced that effective practical work in resolving this problem is possible only with the interaction of all the interested organs of state power and surveillance. For this purpose we have developed an agreement which nine interested departments have signed. It is called "On Concerted Action for Ensuring State Protection of the Rights of Consumers of Goods, Work, and Services." Joint measures are outlined in this document, the results of which, I think, the citizens of Russia will soon be able to perceive.
