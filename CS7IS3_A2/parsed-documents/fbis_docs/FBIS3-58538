[Herzog] Good evening, Mr. Wickert. [Wickert] Mr. Herzog, you have now been nominated as presidential candidate by the Presidium of the Christian Democratic Union [CDU]. Will you remain president of the Constitutional Court during the election campaign? [Herzog] There is no other way. Originally, I believed that I might apply for a suspension from my office, but it is not possible for legal reasons. I understand that, because the legislator is interested in the efficiency of the court, and because the basic right to recourse to the Constitutional Court must be ensured. I could either relinquish the office totally, which I am not willing to do and for which I see no reason, or I could take the required steps if the question arises whether a judge can participate in certain procedures or not, according to Section 19 of the Law on the Constitutional Court. I will choose the second option, and it is now up to the First Senate of the Constitutional Court to make a decision as to what I am supposed to do during my candidacy. [Wickert] Mr. Herzog, you raised the question of the majority situation at the closed session of the CDU Presidium this morning. What was the answer? [Herzog] What I wanted to do was to avoid this difficult procedure, which is also a burden for my colleagues at the Constitutional Court, if it is clear from the outset that my candidacy for the presidential office does not stand any chance of success. Thus, unanimous approval by the CDU and Christian Social Union [CSU] had to be ensured. I raised this question, and it was discussed. The result of a secret vote in the CDU Executive Committee was completely satisfactory for me. [Wickert] There was one opposing vote and one abstention. These votes may have been cast by East German members. Mr. Heitmann, your predecessor as presidential candidate, stated that he would have liked a different candidate instead of Mr. Herzog because he believes that a candidate from the east would be better. [Herzog] One can have different opinions on this issue. I understand Mr. Heitmann's position very well. Yet, I ask you to take into consideration that I have not competed against any other candidate. I have no influence on this situation. [Wickert] You stated that you do not want to be elected with the votes of extremist parties. You were both referring to right-wing parties and the Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS]. [Herzog] Yes, exactly. The danger that the PDS might vote for me is probably relatively small. [Wickert] Acting President von Weizsaecker has moved his office to Berlin. He gave the New Year reception for the diplomatic corps in Berlin. Will you also move to Berlin? [Herzog] Naturally I must point out that I am not the final candidate of the CDU/CSU at this point, and I have not yet been elected president. However, one thing is absolutely clear: I began my career in Berlin, and it would be a great honor for me to end it in Berlin. [Wickert] Do you believe that direct election of the federal president might be useful? [Herzog] Mr. Wickert, I have a problem here. I once expressed my view on this issue, and I was publicly rebuked for it. I was accused of having overstepped my powers as president of the Constitutional Court. Therefore, I will only say that direct election makes sense if far-reaching powers are linked with the president's office. One should discuss more than just the election procedure. [Wickert] You, yourself, said that the federal president cannot do very much, that he can only talk a great deal. The acting president occasionally used his speeches to sharply criticize the parties. Will you continue this tradition? [Herzog] I do not want to tell you now what topics I would address as president. But I do not believe that giving speeches is the only thing a president can do. Richard von Weizsaecker and his predecessors have made that clear. However, there is no doubt that delivering speeches is one of the president's main tasks. Just think of the need to explain the state and our constitution to the citizens time and again in a simple but emphatic way. [Wickert] Mr, Herzog, thank you very much. [Herzog] You are welcome.
