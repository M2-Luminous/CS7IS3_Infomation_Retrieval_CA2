The revival of demand for exports, which initially started in the United States, Asia, and parts of Latin America, is obviously spreading to the European countries, while domestic demand remains weak. Necker fears an unpredictable avalanche of costs, involving billions of German marks, associated with the introduction of nursing-care insurance. The BDI president said at the Economic Press Club in Munich on Wednesday evening [16 March] that he will not run for office again: "I will be available only until the end of 1994." Necker does not expect any short-term improvement concerning the high unemployment, the "number one political and social issue." The reduction of jobs in industry, which was 8 percent in the old laender in 1993 and 45 percent in the new laender, will continue in 1994, though not so fast. "Part-time work is not a panacea," the BDI president said. However, it does alleviate the overall problem. He sees an enormous opportunity in expanding services. "Concerning labor costs we must restrain ourselves," Necker demanded. Otherwise, more shares in the world market will be lost. Concerning the 1994 wage negotiations he said that "a zero to 2-percent round is a partial correction -- but that alone will not be enough." He criticized the current fleshing out of the social plans as a new form of creating capital, in which people laid off get severance pay even though they have long since found another job. Necker said that the compromise on nursing care insurance is completely wrong. It is absolutely incomprehensible that there will be no material examination of the actual need for nursing care and that, in the future, too, those who are well off get the same as anybody else. As the example of the Netherlands shows, an explosion of costs is to be feared. "As soon as it has made the rounds that one gets money for one's grandmother, and that even tax-free, grandmother will become a case for nursing care and it will no longer possible to finance this insurance."
