"The two economies complement each other quite well. Many Venezuelan products -- for example, oil, iron, steel, and aluminum -- are needed in the PRC, while some of our light industry products could find a good market in Venezuela," Liu has said. In an effort to strengthen bilateral trade, both governments are seeking ways to sign new economic cooperation agreements that establish a legal framework for an economic exchange. Within the framework of the consultation mechanism, the two parties have discussed issues of bilateral interest to strengthen Beijing-Caracas ties. They have also talked about the internal situation in both nations and mutual support at international organizations. The meeting was attended by Deputy Foreign Minister Roy Chaderton, International Policies Director Demetrio Boersner, Vicente Vallenilla, international economy and cooperation director, as well as other high-ranking Foreign Ministry officials. The PRC delegation was led by Vice Foreign Minister Liu, Liu Guo Xing, director of Latin American Affairs at the PRC Foreign Ministry; and Huang Zhiliang, PRC ambassador to Caracas. Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli received Liu at the Yellow House following the meeting.
