Ambrozic: "President Tudjman Is Ignoring the Istrian Reality"] [Text] Pula -- "It is good that the main celebration to mark the Day of Antifascism in Croatia was held in Istria, for that proved the importance of the Istrian peninsula in this country," said Ivan Jakovcic, president of the IDS [Istrian Democratic Congress], at a news conference yesterday. He emphasized that antifascism made it possible for Istria to be joined to its native country. Jakovcic said that President Tudjman could not have said a part of his speech delivered in Pazin on Wednesday anywhere else but in Istria, and that the speech was an attempt to restore the Croatian reputation in the world, which has been seriously tarnished. Jakovcic said that in Pazin President Tudjman had proved himself consistent in denying everything that Istria had achieved on its own. So it turned out, Jakovcic said, that Istrian fighters could not have managed anything without the help of fighters from other parts of Croatia, and that Istria had not done anything in the past 50 years. Furthermore, Jakovcic said that President Tudjman's speech implies that, in the future, Istria would only be able to achieve anything under the reign of the HDZ. The IDS president is particularly worried that Franjo Tudjman is negating the election results in Istria, for he criticized the commitment of Istrian voters to regionalism, coexistence, and tolerance. Jakovcic added that when the president of the Republic, who also happens to be a historian, uses false information and says that the Italians in Istria mostly supported Italian fascism, then that is a blatant lie. Jakovcic also said that some people in Istria did indeed support fascism, but they were in the minority, and that there was an overwhelming number of freedom-loving, democratically oriented people. "Ignoring the fact that Istria and its civic, i.e. municipal councils want to introduce bilingualism in their region, President Tudjman displayed a complete lack of tolerance toward Istria and the wishes of its inhabitants," Jakovcic said, commenting on the president's speech in Istria. In Jakovcic's opinion, Mr. Tudjman used a national holiday to promote the political views of a party, which is quite improper. Jakovcic also commented on the formation yesterday of a presidential Council for Istria on the island of Brijuni and said that this was, for a change, a new, somewhat more subtle attempt to push through the HDZ vision of Istria and the HDZ program. Jakovcic added that this attempt was indeed based on the Constitution, but shows that the president is aware that the HDZ is not able to win the trust of Istria with its program and political views. Jakovcic considers the founding of the presidential Council for Istria hypocritical, while Emil Soldatic, IDS secretary, said that the masks have fallen, and the Council advocates the HDZ Motovun program. Soldatic also claims that it is now obvious that the "Dom" Society in Pazin is nothing but a branch office, or transmission of the HDZ. Furthermore, he wondered whether the HDZ and "Dom" are offering Istria a civic society like Glavas's fief in Osijek, a town with a similar destiny to Split's. Jakovcic said that not a single member of the IDS, HSLS [Croatian Social Liberal Party], SDP [Party of Democratic Changes], and HSNZ [Croatian Party of Natural Law], was invited to lunch with the president at Bijela Vila [White Villa] on Brijuni, and that this gesture proved that the people in Istria who voted at the latest elections were being ignored. The IDS supports principled views of Istrian mayors and representatives of the County of Istria who spurned the invitation. Emil Soldatic said that the fact that former IDS member Ivan Herak was present when the Council was formed, showed that Herak "had come where he belonged," and that this move of Herak's is interesting, since HSLS President Drazen Budisa told him Herak would not go to Brijuni. "If that decision was made by the HSLS after all, then one can say the party is the HDZ in sheep's clothing and that the HDZ program is beginning to be realized in Istria," said Soldatic. Denis Jelenkovic, IDS member appointed to the Council for Istria, was not on Brijuni, and Jakovcic repeated that the County Assembly decided it would not send their members to the Council, and if someone were to go against this decision, the party would not ignore it. Jakovcic said that he was aware Jelenkovic was trying to benefit Istria, but that it should not be done through para-state institutions. Asked to comment on the presence of the defense minister and police at the constituent assembly of the Council for Istria, Jakovcic replied that this could be explained by the view of some HDZ members who hold that the problem of Istria can also be solved with the army and police. The IDS president also commented on the latest developments in the Croatian Parliament and the negotiations between the opposition and the ruling party, and concluded that the HDZ had accepted a new proposition of the opposition, but that it was obvious that the negotiating team of the ruling party was not capable of implementing it as it had been agreed.
