This follows a series of consultations and meetings with numerous parties, associations, and organizations. In this context, the NDC held a news conference at the El Mithak building in Algiers today. Over to Abdelmoumen Dekkar with this telephone dispatch: [Dekkar] The meeting held between NDC rapporteur Abdelkader Bensalah and representatives of the national media this afternoon was aimed at assessing the dialogue process in its last stage which culminated in a series of multilateral meetings. These meetings are due to be concluded today with a meeting with professional and youth organizations. The end of the multilateral meetings does not mean that the door of the El Mithak building [NDC headquarters] will now be shut. On the contrary, consultations will continue between the NDC and its partners in the dialogue. Bensalah said that regarding the subject of clearing the air and holding contacts with Islamic trends, the commission has received from the authorities concerned definite guarantees that a first batch of people will be released from detention centers in the south in the next few days. He added that the commission has received similar guarantees that house arrest orders will be lifted on all those to whom the decision applied. The NDC rapporteur went on to say that these measures have been taken with a view to clearing the air, restoring people's peace of mind, and thus providing the best conditions to ensure the success of the national dialogue conference and achieve national consensus. He added that the commission hopes that this will be a major turning point toward the restoration of tranquillity and the gradual return of civil peace. Talking about the pilot study undertaken in connection with the platform of dialogue and the reactions of some parties to this study, Bensalah indicated that the commission based its draft on the declaration of 1 November [1954], the 1989 Constitution, and the positions expressed by the parties to the dialogue either in writing or verbally during numerous meetings with the commission. He said that the document adopts the views repeated by most members and added that it was impossible to adopt the views of all sides at the same time and include them in a single document. The NDC rapporteur stated that this document is only, as its title indicates, a pilot study; all parts of it are open to enrichment, amendment, and revision, he asserted. Regarding the position of the Socialist Forces Front, which has decided to boycott the national conference, Bensalah said that the commission heard of the front's position the same way everyone did and that it had not been notified officially. However, the rapporteur added, the commission stresses its desire to involve everyone and not to dismiss anyone. At this crucial period of its history, Algeria needs the effort, sacrifice, and magnanimity of all its children, particularly those who made huge sacrifices to enable Algeria to recover its sovereignty and dignity, he stated. We will try to give you further details on the meeting between the NDC rapporteur and representatives of the national media in our subsequent news bulletins.
