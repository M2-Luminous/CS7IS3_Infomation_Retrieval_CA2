"The argument for the new, improved detention law is that it is a temporary expedient, designed to protect the transition to democracy and to last only until the Bill of Rights is enacted when a new government is installed in April. The situation is different now, supporters of the law contend: what is being protected is a process approved by the majority, not a tyrannical oligarchy. But to accept these arguments is to endorse the maxim that the end justifies the means. As nuanced as the situation is, it is not a maxim that liberal democrats can embrace. These defensive arguments take no account of the crucial point that a law providing for detention without trial, even on a limited basis, provides an inauspicious foundation for a new democratic South Africa." BUSINESS DAY ANC Intimidation of NP, DP Supporters -- "It does not take much political savvy to realise that it is crucial" for the National Party (NP) and the Democratic Party (DP) to recruit black people if they are to make any electoral breakthroughs in black communities, contends Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 23 February in a page-16 editorial. "While there is no suggestion that the ANC is officially countering this trend through intimidation and murder, it is not beyond the realms of possibility that some of its over- enthusiastic supporters are." "The ANC [African National Congress] leadership has often raised the issue of political tolerance. It now has a duty to spread a message that this specific kind of intimidation is unacceptable." SOWETAN Atrocious Socio-Economic Conditions Spawning Violence -- Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 23 February in a page-12 editorial views the "outbreak of violence in Bekkersdal," saying it demands that "political organisations in Bekkersdal come together as a gesture of solidarity for peace and the defence of their families and property." SOWETAN believes the violence is "spawned by atrocious socio-economic conditions. Those who kill and burn have no hope for the future and have nothing to lose. It is perhaps time that all involved, including the Government, inject some hope into these areas."
