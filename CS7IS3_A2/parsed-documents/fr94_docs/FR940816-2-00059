FR940816-2-00059 FR940816-2-00044 D. Third Party Agreements: Project activities which are approved for contracting pursuant to the prior approval provisions shall be formalized in a written agreement that clearly establishes the relationship between the grantee and the third party. The written agreement shall at a minimum: 1. State or incorporate by reference all applicable requirements imposed on the contractors under the grant by the terms of the grant, including requirements concerning peer review and technical review as required by ATSDR, release of data, ownership of data and the arrangement for copyright when publications, data or other copyrightable works are developed under or in the course of work under a PHS grant supported project or activity. 2. State that any copyrighted or copyrightable works shall be subject to a royalty-free, nonexclusive, and irrevocable license to the government to reproduce, publish, or otherwise use them, and to authorize others to do so for Federal government purposes. 3. State that whenever any work subject to this copyright policy may be developed in the course of a grant by a contractor under a grant, the written agreement (contract) must require the contractor to comply with these requirements and can in no way diminish the government's right in that work. 4. State the activities to be performed, the time schedule for those activities, the policies and procedures to be followed in carrying out the agreement, and the maximum amount of money for which the grantee may become liable to the third party under the agreement. 5. State that the contractor must comply with all peer review and technical review requirements. The written agreement required shall not relieve the grantee of any part of its responsibility or accountability to PHS under the grant. The agreement shall, therefore, retain sufficient rights and control to the grantee to enable it to fulfill this responsibility.
