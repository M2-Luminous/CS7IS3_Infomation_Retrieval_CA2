Dominguez said Haitians who are in the national territory after 26 June--the date on which the suspension of commercial flights to Haiti begins--"will not be classified as political refugees" because they entered the country as tourists. Dominguez asserted that among other mechanisms the Immigration Directorate may implement regarding the Haitians, "it is scheduling a charter flight to return the Haitians to Haiti" if the crisis in that former French colony is not resolved. The Immigration Department director revealed that "Haitians wishing to enter Panama must have an authorized visa, which has been suspended for citizens of that Caribbean nation." According to Dominguez, "visas are only being given to Haitians who reside in the United States to come to Panama for three days to purchase merchandise." Finally, Immigration Director Antonio Dominguez remarked "this situation will affect Panamanian companies which do business with Haitians."
