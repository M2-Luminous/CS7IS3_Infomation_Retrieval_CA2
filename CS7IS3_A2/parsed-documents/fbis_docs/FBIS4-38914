Kannik mentioned that Laar had been incorrect when denying having signed any documents about defense cooperation with Israel. The former minister quoted Laar's May 17 letter to the commander in chief of the country's defense forces, Major General Aleksander Einseln, in which the premier said the government had signed no agreement with Israeli General Dan Shomron. But a protocol of a Feb. 8 meeting between Laar and Shomron states that "the guests and Mr. Laar agreed that cooperation between Estonia and Israel can be divided into three main categories," Kannik said today, adding that one of these three had been setting up a joint work group to review Estonia's defense concept both from the military as well as from security aspects. The work group was to be formed under the Estonian Interior Ministry. Laar before the Feb. 8 meeting suggested the work group to be subjected to the Defense Ministry, but that proposal was turned down, Kannik said in the interview with BNS. Estonia's POSTIMEES daily newspaper in its May 30 edition reported that Commander in Chief Aleksander Einseln was seeking clarity over allegations that the prime minister had bypassed him in steps toward a defense cooperation plan with Israel. Einseln said his suspicions were raised after an aide to Leonid Apananski, considered a key figure behind the country's major arms purchase deal from Israel, in a confidential letter informed a Central Staff officer about a May 10-12 visit to Tallinn of an Israeli delegation. The visit had been to discuss a cooperation project, started by Mart Laar and Israeli General Dan Shamron, the letter alleged.
