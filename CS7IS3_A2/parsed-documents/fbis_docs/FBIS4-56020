Prime Minister Lyuben Berov met in the parliament with Zhan Videnov, leader of the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP], and Ahmed Dogan, leader of the Movement for Rights and Freedoms [DPS]. After the meeting Dogan said that the DPS will support the framework agreement proposed by the government, if it is supported by at least four parliamentary factions. Dogan did not specify what factions precisely should support the agreement, but he does not exclude a situation in which the cabinet will have to resign. According to Zhan Videnov, procedural issues were discussed at the meeting with Prime Minister Berov on consultations between the prime minister and the parliamentary factions. Nora Ananieva said that real consultations are yet to be held, and it appears that precisely this is taking place at present at the National Assembly's West Hall, where the prime minister is meeting with BSP representatives and two representatives of the New Alliance for Democracy [NSD]. Mr. Oktay of the DPS entered the hall, saw what is happening there, left the hall, and refused to make any statements. Dr. Yordan Todorov of the NSD said that he is attending the meeting as a representative of his faction, but the NSD will nevertheless insist on holding separate talks with the prime minister. Deputy Ivan Pushkarov has not been offered the post of deputy prime minister. If signing an agreement is on the agenda, Pushkarov's people will not sign. It is not the business of the prime minister to make such moves, Pushkarov said. Several seconds ago Yunal Lyutfi of the DPS joined the meeting that is taking place at the National Assembly's West Hall.
