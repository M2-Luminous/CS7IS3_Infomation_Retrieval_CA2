Zak refused to divulge details of Monday's debates by Solidarity's national section for the metallurgical industry, which were held in Lodz. He reported that there would a session of the National Commission of NSZZ Solidarity in Lodz on 9 March. "We have presented our areas of negotiation to the government, and we intend to talk exclusively about specific matters--for example, about how the profamily tax system is to be introduced and about the price increases by energy carriers," Zak told a PAP journalist. The National Commission spokesman said: "The union is examining the possibility of making life difficult for those governing the country." Solidarity wants social disruption caused by the strike to be as limited as possible. It is for that reason, for example, that Solidarity's national section for the power industry plans first to cut electricity in public offices and among those industrial customers who owe the industry money. Zak said that payments from the Solidarity strike fund would also be received by those taking part in the Solidarity strike who were not union members and who were members of other trade union federations.
