"It will be advancing towards spans of over 1,000 meters sooner or later," Lin Yuanpei, general designer of the Yangpu bridge -- the world's longest -- told over 200 foreign specialists at a recent international symposium in this city. He said that within a period of less than 20 years, China has proceeded to become one of the pioneers of the world in this field. In the mid-1970s, China had only one cable-stayed bridge with a 76-meter span. In the 1990s, two huge bridges were set up across the Huangpu river in shanghai. Nanpu bridge, built in 1991, boasts a span of 423 meters, and the Yangpu bridge, which was completed last year, is 602 meters in length. So far, the country has 40-odd stay cables. Lin also said that a third stay cable for Shanghai is on the drawing board and is expected to be finished in 1996. The four-day symposium received over 90 theses on the latest developments in the field. Some well-known experts took part in the meeting, including Li Guohao, honorary president of Tongji University.
