The news conference was devoted to the results of the delegation's participation in the session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg. The Belarusian delegation, Mechyslaw Hryb said, proposed to discuss issues concerning mutual relations with European countries and prospects for cooperation in various spheres of life. The talks followed this direction. I have understood, Mechyslaw Hryb said, that we are moving toward the European Union, toward the European Parliament, very slowly. We should have been there long ago, because people in Europe have scarcely heard of us -- they believe that we are still living under totalitarianism without any changes. However, during our talks at the European Parliament, they were convinced that this is not the case any longer. After leaving Strasbourg, our delegation arrived in Bucharest, where it participated in the Transmontana forum devoted to various political and economic issues facing European countries.
