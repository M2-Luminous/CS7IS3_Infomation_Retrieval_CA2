"Mr. Hata's role will be over once he passes the budget through the Diet," Yoshiro Mori, secretary general of the main opposition party, told a news conference. Mori blamed the cabinet of former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa for the long delay in the Diet budget debate, saying it put off the formulation of the budget from the usual year-end till this year to give top priority to political reform. "At the time, Mr. Hata was deputy prime minister," he said, indicating Hata should also be blamed for the delay in passage of the state budget, which is six weeks overdue. Mori also said the LDP and the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [SDPJ], a member of Hosokawa's ruling coalition that collapsed in April, share a perception that Hata's minority government does not reflect the will of the Japanese people. The SDPJ also sees the Hata cabinet as one to only handle the budget, Mori added. The SDPJ walked out of the coalition shortly after Hata was elected premier in late April, in protest against the formation by other coalition partners of a new parliamentary group excluding the SDPJ. After the withdrawal of the SDPJ from the coalition, the LDP and the SDPJ, archrivals for decades, have moved to cooperate to put pressure on the Hata administration.
