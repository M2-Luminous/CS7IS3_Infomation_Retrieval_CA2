FR941212-1-00061 FR941212-1-00016 The cactus ferruginous pygmy-owl (hereafter ``pygmy-owl,'' unless otherwise noted) was described by van Rossem (1937), based on specimens from Arizona and Sonora. It is distinguished from G. b. ridgwayi and G. b. brasilianum by its shorter wings and longer tail, and by generally lighter coloration (van Rossem 1937, Phillips et al. 1964). G. b. cactorum occurs in several color morphs, with distinct differences between regional populations (Sprunt 1955, Burton 1973, Tyler and Phillips 1978, Johnsgard 1988). Some investigators ( e.g. van Rossem 1937, Tewes 1992) have suggested that further taxonomic investigation is needed, primarily to determine whether the current G. b. cactorum comprises more than one subspecies. G. b. cactorum is widely recognized as a valid subspecies (e.g. Friedmann et al. 1950, Blake 1953, Sprunt 1955, Phillips et al. 1964, Monson and Phillips 1981, Millsap and Johnson 1988, Binford 1989). The American Ornithologists' Union (AOU) recognized G. b. cactorum in its 1957 Checklist of North American Birds (AOU 1957), but subsequent lists did not include subspecies (AOU 1983). Based on these authorities, the Service accepted G. b. cactorum as a subspecies in 1991 (56 FR 58804), and again in 1993 (58 FR 13045). The pygmy-owl nests in a cavity in a tree or large columnar cactus. Cavities may be naturally formed (e.g. knotholes) or excavated by woodpeckers. No nest lining material is used. The pygmy-owl has also nested in fabricated nest boxes (S. Beasom, Texas Arts and Industries University, in litt. ). Three, four, or sometimes five eggs are laid (Bent 1938, Heintzelman 1979) and incubated for approximately 28 days. The young fledge about 28 days after hatching. The pygmy-owl begins nesting activity in late winter to early spring. It is nonmigratory throughout its range (Bendire 1888, Griscom and Crosby 1926, Oberholser 1974, Johnson et al. 1979). The pygmy-owl's diverse diet includes birds, lizards, insects, small mammals (Bendire 1888, Sutton 1951, Sprunt 1955, Earhart and Johnson 1970, Oberholser 1974), and even frogs and earthworms (S. Beasom, in litt. ). The pygmy-owl occurs in a variety of subtropical scrub and woodland communities, including riverbottom woodlands, woody thickets (``bosques''), coastal plain oak associations, thornscrub, and desertscrub. Unifying habitat characteristics among these communities are fairly dense woody thickets or woodlands, with trees and/or cacti large enough to provide nesting cavities. Throughout its range, the pygmy-owl occurs at low elevations, generally below 1,200 meters (m) or 4,000 feet (ft) (Swarth 1914, Karalus and Eckert 1974, Monson and Phillips 1981, Johnsgard 1988, Enriquez-Rocha et al. 1993). In southern Texas, the pygmy-owl's habitat includes coastal plain oak associations, and the Tamaulipan Thornscrub of the lower Rio Grande valley region, which is comprised of mesquite ( Prosopis glandulosa ), hackberry ( Celtis spp. ), oak ( Quercus spp. ), and Texas ebony ( Pithecellobium ebano ) (Griscom and Crosby 1926, Bent 1938, Oberholser 1974, Tewes 1992, Wauer et al. 1993). In northeastern Mexico, it occurs in lowland thickets, thornscrub communities, riparian woodlands, and second-growth forest (van Rossem 1945, AOU 1983, Tewes 1992, Enriquez-Rocha et al. 1993). In central and southern Arizona, the pygmy-owl's primary habitats are riparian cottonwood ( Populus spp. ) forests and mesquite bosques. Also in central and southern Arizona, the pygmy-owl occurs in Sonoran Desertscrub associations of paloverde ( Cercidium spp. ), bursage ( Ambrosia spp. ), ironwood ( Olneya tesota ), mesquite ( Prosopis juliflora ), acacia ( Acacia spp. ), and giant cacti like the saguaro ( Cereus giganteus ), and organpipe ( Cereus thurberi ) (Gilman 1909, Bent 1938, van Rossem 1945, Phillips et al. 1964, Monson and Phillips 1981, Johnson-Duncan et al. 1988, Millsap and Johnson 1988). Farther south in northwestern Mexico, the pygmy-owl occurs in Sonoran Desertscrub, Sinaloan Thornscrub, and Sinaloan Deciduous Forest as well as riverbottom woodlands, cactus forests and thornforest (Enriquez-Rocha et al. 1993, G. Monson in prep. ). The available information indicates that distinct eastern and western populations of the pygmy-owl may be defined (Figure 1.). The pygmy-owl occurs along the lower Rio Grande River and the coastal plain of southern Texas and northeastern Mexico. It also occurs in lowland areas of northwestern Mexico and southern Arizona. The pygmy-owl's elevational distribution, the distribution of habitat, and recorded locations indicate that these eastern and western ranges of the pygmy-owl are geographically isolated from one another and are ecologically distinct. In the U.S., the eastern and western portions of the pygmy-owl's range are separated by the basin-and-range mountains and intervening Chihuahuan Desert basins of southeastern Arizona, southern New Mexico, and western Texas. Although Grossman and Hamlet (1964) suggested that the pygmy-owl's range included this U.S.-Mexico border region, the pygmy-owl has never been recorded in this 500-mile (mi) wide area (Bailey 1928, Phillips et al. 1964, Oberholser 1974, S.O. Williams, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish, in litt. ). In Mexico, the eastern and western populations are separated by the highlands of the Sierra Madre Oriental and Occidental, and the Mexican Plateau. The pygmy-owl is considered rare on the Mexican Plateau and/or above elevations of 1,200 m (4,000 ft) on the west, and above 330 m (1,000 ft) on the east (Friedman et al. 1950). Some sources describe the eastern and western ranges as contiguous at the southern end of its range, near the southern end of the Mexican Plateau in central Mexico (Johnsgard 1988). Other sources (e.g., Burton 1973) describe these two ranges as being disjunct. In his description of the subspecies, van Rossem (1937) found that Texas specimens exhibited characteristics of both G. b. cactorum and G. b. ridgwayi. Ultimately, he did not assign Texas ferruginous pygmy-owls to G. b. cactorum, noted that Ridgway (1914, in van Rossem 1937) considered them distinct from G. b. ridgwayi, and left the taxonomy of Texas G. brasilianum open. Most authors have subsequently considered Texas pygmy-owls to be G. b. cactorum (e.g., Oberholser 1974, Millsap and Johnson 1988).
