The bureaucracy is attracting attention because of its connection to various problems plaguing the Japanese Government. At the height of disarray, Japan's Government has fallen short of producing adequate policies to bring Japan out of its current recession, nor has it dealt satisfactorily with problems in its relationship with other countries. 2. A new way of looking at the bureaucracy is to see it particularly as a negative force preventing politicians from assuming leadership and as an obstacle to the "liberalization" and deregulation of the marketplace. These are also factors which may negatively affect attempts to strengthen Japan's democratic government. 3. These concerns are far removed from the view of bureaucrats as the formulators and implementers of public policy, or as those who hold the national interest in their grasp, or as a force driving economic development forward. The author explores to what degree and in which way such perspectives are valid and useful. Broad Discretionary Authority Within Small Government The original blueprint for Japan's present-day bureaucracy came out of the Tokugawa period [1603-1867] han system, which developed during Japan's transition from medieval to early modern times. One of the characteristics of this system was that [in each han, or daimyo domain] the leading role in formulating and implementing policy fell to a select group of bureaucrats. Second, within the framework of "small government," this group was given broad discretionary authority in administering han affairs. A third characteristic was that these bureaucrats had a strong sense of mission and responsibility, taking full advantage of their physical strength as well as the power of their group to sustain itself over time. It was natural that those who took the lead in formulating and implementing policy were members of the military ruling class. A class of officials like the "politicians" who emerged throughout the world during the 17th and 18th centuries, and particularly from the 19th century on, did not exist in Japan. Even when stripped of their weapons, Japan's samurai-bureaucrats retained their leadership role. Using local village leaders as intermediaries, they were to see that supervision was carried out at the grassroots level, that taxes were collected, and that improvements were made in the social infrastructure and were to encourage agriculture, commercem and industry. The preliminary work of creating Japan's modern bureaucracy was undertaken from the mid-1800's, with the first stage of development completed around the beginning of the 20th century. Unlike this early modern bureaucratic system, which drew its members from the hereditary samurai class, the modern bureaucracy is based on nationwide competitive recruitment. Still, even in the 1920's, half of Japan's bureaucrats were from the former samurai class. Although a parliamentary form of government was formed from around the end of the 19th century, thus bringing politicians and political parties into government, the bureaucratic system was largely unaffected and the bureaucracy still retained its leadership character. During these early years, politicians tended to be branded as special interest, factious, and corrupt. For, even though the Meiji Restoration government was steadily pursing its goal of forming a parliamentary democracy, in policy matters, the bureaucracy was still one of the pillars of the new government's enlightened, authoritarian rule. The Meiji Restoration government, like the earlier han government units, also pursued "small government." One of the reasons was the new government's weakened revenue base. Another important reason was that it lacked the ideology that would enable it to create "big government." This is a characteristic that has been carried over from the early modern period and only once did this tradition lapse. This was during the early half of the 1940's, when there was a temporary expansion of government powers in order for Japan to successfully wage war. In the postwar period, the bureaucracy has also basically carried out "small government." If "big government" is characteristic of Western Europe, then "small government" has been realized by Japan and the United States. That is not to say that an administration that seeks to contain government is a weak administration. On the books, Japan's bureaucracy may not necessarily have been given much explicit authority. However, it exercises considerable influence and discretionary authority, the result of its skillful manipulation of the "give and take" relationship between government and industry as well as past precedents and practices, including a tradition that produces ambiguously drafted regulations and flexibly interpretable laws. Thirdly, like enlightened, absolute monarchs, Japan's bureaucracy is characterized by a strong sense of responsibility and mission, and tends to see itself being called upon most particularly during periods of political upheaval and economic stagnation. This is understandable, given the bureaucrat's early connections to Japan's warrior class, and even in modern times, the bureaucracy, at least on this point, hasn't changed too greatly. In time, bureaucrats no longer came from the same homogenous class background. At the same time, they were developing a sense of solidarity, which came from graduating from the same schools, etc., that proved to be a much stronger source of cohesion for the bureaucratic organization than class origin. References to the stature and strength of the samurai-turned-bureaucrat of the early modern period may not strike us as very strange. In speaking of the modern-day bureaucrat, however, the reference is no longer to his physical strength but the stature he himself probably feels as a member of an elite class and as belonging to an organization that can be expect to take care of his well-being. When we think about how many years have been added to our lives after retirement, we can imagine how much of a boost to his morale it is when he can expect another job waiting for him when he makes his "descent from heaven." "Lack of Impartiality" and Other Negative Criticisms Erupt Most often, the emphasis until now has been on the positive aspects of the Japanese bureaucracy--that is, its responsibility in formulating and implementing influential public policy, its image as the impartial embodiment of the national interest, and its role in promoting economic development. More recently, however, what is gushing forth like an unleashed dam are criticisms of the bureaucracy's negative aspects. First of all, there is a chain of criticism that sees bureaucrats as really considering it to their own advantage that government based on the party system is in a fluid, changing state; that they are preventing politicians from showing political leadership; and that they have come to take their own leadership role for granted. Leadership is never more needed than at times of global confusion, and yet, according to these critics, public policy has gone off course because of [bureaucratic] inertia and self-interest. Second, at a time when economies are moving toward global deregulation, Japan's bureaucracy is being accused of not taking the leadership nor changing what is apt to be a passive stance on deregulation and market liberalization and of thus creating more obstacles to this process than necessary. According to critics, it will be a matter of no small significance if, at a time when world economic rules are being re-done in the midst of a new world order, we merely assume the bureaucratic spirit will act to correct this passivity toward new rule-making and system-building. Third, critics are saying that the priorities which the bureaucracy has recommended as remedies for Japan's economic slump are not necessarily the right ones and, in fact, may have only prolonged the recession. The criticism is similar to the one President John Kennedy made in 1961 soon after taking office when, meeting with opposition from fiscal and monetary authorities, he is said to have complained that they were "emphasizing a balanced budget more than the welfare of the American people." Turning such negative arguments around, critics might argue that the government under its current party system has gotten too lax in its duties and the bureaucracy has taken up that slack, attempting to insure the continuity of government as well as to stabilize the economy and soften the medium and long-range impact of international adjustments. In fact, the disorderly ebb and flow of party-system governments is only too common to many of the countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development [OECD]. Such, for example, seems to be the case in the United States with the apparent confusion one finds in the Clinton administration, or in England under Prime Minister Majors, or in France under Prime Minister Balladur. Italy's political situation is the most fluid and unstable of all. Undoubtedly these conditions are all tied to the worldwide slump economies are experiencing. At the same time, while we see a global movement toward liberalizing markets and establishing a global economy, we also note that within democratic governments, social interests are narrowly competing with each other within their own national borders. Out of necessity, enterprises operate on a global scale, but those who have influence only within their own national borders and have relatively little competitive power must have political representation and tend to become a social presence that relies on the strength and support of government. In the majority of cases, those social forces have access to political power; thus, what seems to be true throughout the world, in general, is that there tends to be an awkward strain between governments and economies. It is probably quite natural, especially within administrations which represents those types of social forces, for disputes to surface regarding economic policy. Market Covers for Government Paralysis The question is whether Japan's bureaucracy can stand up to those kinds of basic problems. It might not be at all strange, no matter how brilliant or full of missionary zeal young bureaucrats may be, for the negative aspects of bureaucracies to win out over their more positive aspects when those very characteristics are taken to the extreme. The only saving hand for government is held by the market and--through the steady growth of market forces independent of the political activities of elected officials and bureaucrats and the competition between them--its ability to lessen the role of government itself. Certainly, in the short run, this lack of political leadership in economic negotiations with foreign countries will be a disadvantage. However, it is also true that in the absence of an accord between Japan and the United States the market is continuing to develop on its own, and the recession and high yen have taken on the force of a surging wave, propelling Japan's manufacturing industry into direct investments to Asia-Pacific countries, especially China. This direction will someday probably eliminate the trade deficit Asian countries have with Japan. The rapid development of the economies of Asian countries will also probably alter their relationship with the United States. Nor does it seem such developments will be greatly affected by the fact that "framework" talks between the United States and Japan have temporary stalled. However, as long as one takes seriously the task of strengthening democratic government and as long as our actions to bring us closer to that end are important in raising the international level of confidence in Japan, then it is necessary to endeavor to keep the potentially negative aspects of Japan's bureaucracy from surfacing and coming too strongly into play. To put it another way, an effective antidote is probably the one that improves the quality of our elected officials as the representatives of our interests. Restraining our bureaucrats will not lead to any solutions. Instead, we must not delay in cultivating and nurture elected officials who are capable, strong, informed, and well-versed in policy.
