The deputies believe that if Xinjiang is to have a stable social-political environment, we must first stabilize and increase input in south Xinjiang. Deputy Julaiti Maimaitiming said, Hotan Prefecture is an exceptionally poor prefecture; the national separatist elements' subversive activities are a problem. Relying on our own hard work and struggle alone--without the state and the autonomous region's special political and financial support--it will be impossible for the prefecture to accelerate development or to become relatively well-off at the same time as the rest of Xinjiang. Deputy Yibulayinmu Sulaiman said, agricultural input in south Xinjiang should be greatly increased, because south Xinjiang's development is dependent primarily on agriculture, and if this problem is not properly resolved, we can't even begin to talk about becoming well-off, and it will adversely affect stability. He also said that if south Xinjiang wants to keep its talented people, the government must formulate special policies to keep those people and create an environment that respects knowledge and talents. Delegate Hadir Kayitoufu said, some of south Xinjiang's prefectures, autonomous prefectures, and counties are economically backward; the peasants carry a heavy burden and cannot afford to send their children to school. He suggested that while the government vigorously develop the economy, it should reduce the minority nationality students' school expenses in some regions to support educational development. He also said that we should continue to vigorously implement the "Law on Regional Autonomy of Minority Nationalities" and assign minority nationality and Chinese students on an equal basis, because it will help promote stability. Deputy Zhu Ruojing [8540 5387 7234] said, stability is the prerequisite for reform and development. Without a stable political environment and without unity among the nationalities, there will be no economic development and prosperity for south Xinjiang. Deputy Maimaitiming Tuoheti said, it is imperative that we truly understand that the threat to Xinjiang comes mainly from national separatism and that we must crack down on the separatist conspiracies within the region and strengthen the political and legal contingents. Delegate Qi Baowen [7871 0202 2429], who represent the military police, said that they shoulder the important responsibility of protecting the fatherland's unity, opposing national separatism, and preserving social stability. He said that the unity between the Army and the people must be strengthened, that we need to acquire a stronger sense of national defense, and we must resolutely and steadfastly struggle against a handful of minority nationality separatists and other hostile forces and make a positive contribution toward protecting social stability and promoting economic development.
