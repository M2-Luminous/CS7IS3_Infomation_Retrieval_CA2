The first part of the two-part program includes security, socioeconomic and legal issues that need to be coordinated; the second part deals with the methods and the mechanism of unification, Raig said. "Estonia can realistically expect to join the European Union before the other former socialist countries," Raig claimed. The country's main goal is not to lag behind Ukraine, Slovenia and the Czech Republic that already have asked to be admitted to the union, he added. The working group consists of a score of politicians and economics experts. Last week it appointed Priit Kolbre, the head of the Foreign Ministry's foreign economic policy department, as its secretary, Raig told BNS.
