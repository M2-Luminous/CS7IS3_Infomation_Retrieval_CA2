The Daewoo Group named automaking, heavy industries and service; Hanjin chose transportation, heavy industries and construction; Ssangyong picked automaking, non-metal mineral and energy; Kia opted for automaking, heavy industries and steel; and Hanhwa selected energy, chemical and service. Among groups ranked from 20 to 30, Keumho, Daelim, Dongah, Hyonsung, Halla, Dongbu, Keukdong, Woosung, and Miwon have announced their two choices. Other conglomerates, who face a Jan. 18 deadline to name their mainstay industrial fields, are said to be watching the moves of their rivals before making any decisions. The Hyundai Group is reportedly set on automaking and electronics and is weighing chemical and heavy industries for its third choice. Samsung has picked electronics and heavy industries and is scrutinizing the chemical and service sectors. Lucky-Goldstar is firm on electronics and chemicals, but is picky over energy and service, while it is easier for Daewoo as it became unnecessary to designate Daewoo electronics a mainstay firm since it was named a blue chip company for stock diversification. Lotte is expected to choose construction over chemicals as it will be no match for Hyundai or Samsung if they name chemicals. Sunkyong has decided on energy and chemicals and will choose another from electronics and service, but it is most likely to select the latter sector as its main subsidiary (SKC) can handle electronics and chemicals. Haitai is set on beverages and food and will select the second field from electronics and service. The choice is said to be hard as it depends much on service, but must grow an electronics arm for the future.
