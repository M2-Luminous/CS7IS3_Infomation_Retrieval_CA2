Ilona Dienstbierova covered their talks. [Dienstbierova] [passage omitted] I will recall briefly the bilateral talks between Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus and Slovak Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar. The Slovak prime minister commented on the initial conditions of the countries that are to join the Partnership for Peace plan. [Begin Meciar recording] We are equal in a political and legal sense, but not in reality. We are not equal in terms of the geopolitical situation and economic development. As far as the state and the level of building the Armed Forces is concerned, we are not on the same level either. That is why the Partnership for Peace, as a contractual principle and as a blueprint for doing things, is creating an opportunity and is initiating a certain process. The development of this process could take place (?on an individual basis). At the same time, the course of this process cannot be determined at present. This means that its outcome might be quite different, irrespective of the fact that things may appear to be a certainty today. Thus, the Partnership for Peace plan has opened up a process which, we think, is providing an opportunity for us. Even though not all of us are on the same level as we stand here on the starting line, there is no way we can forecast as yet what the results will be. [end recording] [passage omitted]
