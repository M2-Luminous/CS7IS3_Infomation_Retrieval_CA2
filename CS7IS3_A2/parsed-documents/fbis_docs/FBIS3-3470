They said that it is necessary to pay great attention to these problems and deal with them properly, otherwise social unrest and political instability will ensue. Xing Bensi, deputy to the National People's Congress [NPC] and vice-principal of the CPC Central Party School, said in an interview with this reporter: If in the 1950's and 1960's, the contradictions among the people markedly manifested themselves in the ideological arena, they are now evident in economic benefits. Unfair distribution and a wide gap between the rich and poor has become an outstanding problem toward which the masses bear deep resentment. He said: An important factor leading to strained relations between the party and the masses and intensifying contradictions among the people is the problem of party style. Once a minority of party members and cadres have grasped power, they are concerned only with their own interests and no longer work for the masses. In the end, they will meet with the opposition of the masses. Guo Ningfu, member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] National Committee, said: At present, the public order situation is not good, prices have been rising too fast, and the phenomenon of corruption is serious. If these problems are settled properly, the people's unity can be strengthened and our undertakings can further flourish; but if these problems are not settled well, contradictions will be intensified and this will unnecessarily infringe upon social stability and the development of our undertakings. Hou Zhenting and other NPC deputies from Hunan said: On the one hand, teachers' pay is in arrears and IOUs are issued for grain purchases; on the other hand, gorgeous offices are built and top-grade limousines are bought; and enterprises are in the red and workers' basic pay cannot be guaranteed while, on the other hand, factory directors and managers travel and give lavish banquets to others at public expense. How can the masses be satisfied with this? Xing Bensi said: It is necessary to pay great attention to solving some outstanding problems regarding the relations between the party and the masses and between cadres and the masses to pacify the masses. For example, the phenomenon of issuing IOUs is, to be blunt, a kind of peasant exploitation. Viewed from historical experience, if something goes wrong in China in the future, this will be where the problem comes from. Therefore, we can never again allow any infringements on peasants' interests. Li Zhen, NPC deputy from Shandong, said: Apart from conscientiously improving the people's living standards and doing a good job in the comprehensive management of social order, governments at all levels must maintain closer ties with the masses, always have their well-being at heart, do more practical and good things for the people, properly handle contradictions among the people under the new situation, and nip various unstable factors in the bud. NPC deputies and CPPCC National Committee members also held that vigorous measures must be taken to wipe out special privileges and corrupt behavior, both of which are detested by the masses. They proposed strengthening mass supervision of government officials.
