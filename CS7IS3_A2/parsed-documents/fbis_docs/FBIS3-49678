Apparently, if -- as Lech Walesa said -- the talks end in failure, it will be necessary to say that this was the fault of the organizers. The Polish president also said that he had proposed to Prime Minister Klaus that he deliver a joint statement on behalf of all four countries, but, apparently, this suggestion was not "taken up." In this connection, we asked Prime Minister Klaus for an interview. [Krejci] Prime Minister, would you care to comment on the statements made by President Walesa? [Klaus] First, I would like to state quite unequivocally that the Czech side is not the organizer of this meeting. I think that certain of our neighbors and partners have either simply forgotten this or they do not want to hear it. We did not come up with the idea that President Clinton should come from Brussels and brief the Central European countries on the outcome of the U.S. initiative in NATO. We have -- of course -- absolutely no power to do this and we have even less power to persuade the U.S. Administration that this meeting should be held in Prague. This was solely the initiative of the U.S. side, and we can only say that we were glad to accept it. This means there can be no suggestion at all of any organizing on our part. As far as the Visegrad countries drafting a joint communique is concerned, I do not know if there is a sufficient consensus of interests and views for this. I do not think it is possible to place the cart before the horse; this means that, first of all, it is necessary to have concurring views and only then can a communique be drafted by simple means. Unfortunately, however, this is not the situation. The term joint interests cannot be used to describe the maximal interests of one country. Only the highest common denominator of the interests of the four Visegrad countries can be a joint interest. The Czech side certainly does not act like a bottleneck or is the one to lower the common denominator. [Krejci] Could you somehow specify the diversity of interests that you mentioned? [Klaus] We do not measure the closeness of cooperation by the number of summits involving heads of state or foreign ministers, but by real tangible deeds and, in this case, it seems obvious to me that the most significant deed so far has been the creation of CEFTA, or the Central European Free Trade Zone, while the bottleneck blocking the intensification of this free zone, the speeding up of its completion, and the inclusion of a larger number of commodities in this free trade zone is not the Czech Republic. It is, on the other hand, the side that constantly asks its partners for more effective cooperation. [Krejci] How do these diverse interests manifest themselves with regard to entry into NATO? [Klaus] It is not my place to analyze the interests of Poland, Hungary, or Slovakia. I simply do not want -- and the Czech side is not doing this -- the foreign policy card to be played as a substitute for the domestic policy card. I am a little concerned, however, that this is what we are beginning to see in some of the Visegrad countries. [Krejci] After the Slovak Republic paid its debt in the clearing account with the Czech Republic, this debt was incurred again as you predicted last month. How will the government proceed in this regard? [Klaus] The government will proceed precisely in accordance with the agreement concluded on clearing relations between the Czech Republic and Slovakia, this means, that if a debt is incurred, it is a condition that it be repaid in hard currency by the middle of the following month. Nothing more and nothing less. I am pleased that when this situation arose for the first time there was no hitch. Of course, we will refine the clearing agreement; however, we will not increase the margin. On the other hand, I think that the various devaluation shifts have more of a long-term than a short-term effect, so it is not out of the question that balanced relations between the Czech and Slovak economies in foreign trade will be achieved earlier than it may seem.
