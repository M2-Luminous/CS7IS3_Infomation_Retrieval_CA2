The commander of the rebel Uganda People's Army (UPA), known simply as Abwongoto, was killed at a school in Kumi District on Wednesday where a handful of his fighters were reportedly trying to use children as human shields. His comrades, believed to number about a dozen, surrendered. The UPA's fighters had dwindled to a few score in recent years, and it had degenerated into a bandit group, Western diplomats said. It was no longer considered a serious threat to the government of President Yoweri Museveni, which has largely succeeded in stamping out rebel activity. [passage omitted]
