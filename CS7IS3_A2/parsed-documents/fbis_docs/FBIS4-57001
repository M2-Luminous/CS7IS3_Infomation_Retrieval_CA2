Menem thus stressed that the facilities where the controversial Condor-2 missile was developed and built will be used for "the production of civilian goods and services alone." The president made these remarks in opening this morning the 2d Euro-Latin American Space Forum [II Jornadas Euro-Latinoamericanas del Espacio] at the Libertador Hotel in Buenos Aires. Representatives from European and American space agencies, research institutes, universities, and companies are attending this forum. Representatives from Argentina, Chile, Brazil, and Mexico will lecture on the development of their space programs. Teledialing [telediccion] -- the remote gathering of data, using satellites -- especially for the exploitation of natural resources and environment conservation, will be among the main issues for discussion. During the opening ceremony Menem was joined by Conrado Varotto, the National Commission for Space Activities [CNAE] chairman; European Space Agency Chairman Michael Lefevre; and Senator Jose Figueroa. In his speech, the president emphasized "the peaceful" goals of the space projects, and noted that an Institute for Higher Space Studies [Instituto de Altos Estudios Espaciales] would be operating in Falda del Carmen, in Cordoba Province. After emphasizing the importance of science and technology, Menem noted: "Historically, and especially over the past decades, Argentina has not been using its gray matter, and given the reduced possibilities for development existing here we, incredibly enough, became exporters of brains." The president said: "We are proud to say that this trend has been reversed now." He then noted that space activities have been enhanced. Menem pointed out: "The CNAE was legally established in 1991. A National Space Program [Plan Espacial Nacional] is being drawn up now, and must be completed in September. This program will establish long-term strategic planning. This planning is now possible thanks to the economic stability." Menem noted: "In a breach of trust, I can say that one of the program's key points involves using the so-called light satellites [satelites livianos] that are able to supply a number of scientific and practical services to our territory and to third countries." Menem said: "The Satellites SAC-B and SAC-C must be described as pioneer." He noted: "Argentina is gaining experience, and has great potential in the field of space activities." Before delivering his speech, Menem met European Space Agency astronaut Claude Nicolier, a member of an expedition that spent 11 days in space to service the Hubble space telescope.
