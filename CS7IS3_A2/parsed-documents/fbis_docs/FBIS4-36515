Under the headline "The Future of the Peace Process," the newspaper TISHRIN says: The peace process has become a target for Israeli officials, who were compelled to attend the Madrid conference in the first place, thwarted the Washington talks, disavowed the essence of the U.S. peace initiative, and made a deliberate effort to scuttle U.S. efforts. The paper adds: Judging by Israeli acts, one can safely say that Israel's acts run counter to the principles and objectives of the peace process. For, the shelling and bombardment of villages and towns in southern Lebanon, the displacement of Lebanese civilians, the destruction of their property, and the killing of innocent people in premeditated barbarous air raids have become the order of the day for Israeli officials. As for their political discourse on peace, it is merely deceptive talk designed to delude the world public. For, the peace talks have not registered the slightest progress on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks. As for the Gaza-Jericho accord, it has pushed the opportunities for peace further away, and dealt a painful blow to the efforts to achieve a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East. TISHRIN urges the international community, headed by the United States, to intervene to put an end to Israeli aggression, which is targeting Lebanon, just as much as it is targeting the U.S. initiative and the peace process. The paper wonders: Has not the region been pushed further away from the desired just and comprehensive peace? Why has United States failed to push the peace process in the right direction, given that it has committed itself to play the role of a full partner and honest broker? TISHRIN concludes by saying: The failure of the international community to put the necessary pressure on Israeli leaders to make them comply with its resolutions and principles has encouraged them to perpetrate further massacres and crimes, and to demonstrate total disregard for the peace process and international legitimacy, as well. The newspaper AL-THAWRAH addresses the same issue, saying: Given the serious Israeli escalation of the military situation in southern Lebanon, the international community must have become fully convinced that the Rabin government holds the peace process in contempt. For judging by its words and deeds, one reaches the conclusion that this government seeks to frustrate the hopes for a just and comprehensive solution in the Middle East, and to create further obstacles and difficulties that can only exacerbate the situation and render it more precarious. AL-THAWRAH adds: The Israeli military buildup in southern Lebanon, as well as the constant Israeli attacks there make it impossible for observers to identify any single Israeli positive step. This is certainly not an indication of an Israeli desire to achieve peace in the full sense of the word. Concluding its commentary, the paper says: The Tel Aviv government must understand that the party that is seeking peace cannot work to stoke fires in southern Lebanon, nor can it resort to military power and arrogance to force its dictates and conditions on others. Nor can it, for that matter, flaunt its defiance of the relevant international resolutions, and the principles cherished by the international community. For peace has its own well-known components and requirements. Once the Rabin government declares its commitment to these components and requirements, and renounces its policy of provocation and aggression, then, and only then can there be talk of just and comprehensive peace. But, given the current state of affairs, one can say that Israel is as far as it can ever be from peace. Worse still, nobody can trust the sincerity of its peace claims. For its part, the newspaper AL-BA'TH comments on the same issue, reiterating that the continuous Israeli attacks on Lebanon are indicative of Israel's aggressive character, and also of its disregard for regional security and peace, and the entire world community as well. The paper believes that this Israeli policy has been supported by the position of the international community, represented by the United Nations and the UN Security Council in particular. This is because Israel is the only party in the world that escapes punishment whenever it perpetrates aggressions against the Arabs, kills innocent civilians, and destroys their houses. In this regard, the paper notes the massacre Israel perpetrated on Thursday [9 June], which resulted in the death of scores of Lebanese civilians. Israel has persisted with its aggression and massive military buildup on Lebanese territory, the paper adds. The paper wonders: Will Israeli acts lead to just and comprehensive peace in the region? The paper explains that had Israel been actually seeking peace, it would have, at least, declared a commitment to the terms of reference of the peace process; that is, it would have expressed a willingness to implement the relevant international resolutions, which provide for complete and full withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories. Nonetheless, what we, along with the entire world community, have seen is Israel doing its best to keep the region away from true peace. The paper concludes by saying: The requirements, components, and obligations of just and comprehensive peace are too clear to be obscured. They have been recognized and identified by the entire international community. He who wants to see the region enjoying security, stability, and peace must, first and foremost, make a total commitment to implementing the relevant international resolutions. As for the policy of aggression and threats, it will only create further tension, and consequently kill the last opportunity for saving the peace process.
