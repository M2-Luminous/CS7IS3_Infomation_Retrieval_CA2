Local authorities of Russia's Southern Kurils regional administration originally proposed the idea of the "fishing fees system" to the authorities of Nemuro city in Hokkaido, but the Japanese Government has so far opposed it, saying that it would lead to Japan's acknowledging Russia's illegal seizure of the northern territories. However, Russian authorities, among other measures, have strengthened a crackdown on violations in the region. This has seriously affected the livelihood of Japanese fishermen. For example, the Russian action has decreased their catch. For this reason, the Japanese Government has changed its traditional stance, hoping to settle the matter in a practical way. It intends to conclude an agreement with Russia on the matter this year by finalizing basic plans hopefully by August in time for next year's fishing season. On 3 June, Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa told a Diet foreign affairs committee that the government "wants to encourage studying the matter," although it must still be "in line with the government's basic stance on the territorial issue." He thus indicated for the first time that the government is taking a positive attitude regarding the matter. He was answering a question from Muneo Suzuki of the Liberal Democratic Party. In response to Suzuki's pressing the government to "finalize the plans by August," Kakizawa said: "We will do our best." There currently exists a commercial agreement to pay fishing fees to Russia that is limited exclusively to gathering kelp off Kaigara Island. Last March, the local head of Russia's Southern Kurils regional administration, which has jurisdiction over Kunashir and other islands of the Kurils chain, proposed to Nemuro Mayor Kaiji Oya to expand the fishing fees agreement to allow Japanese fishing boats to operate in all of the waters around the northern territories. Local fishermen of Nemuro and other cities, who seek safer fishing operations, heartily welcomed the proposal. At the time, however, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs rejected the idea, asserting that "since the agreement on gathering kelp off Kaigara Island is an extremely special case, expanding the agreement to allow fishing in all of the waters around the northern territories would have a bearing on the very roots of our stance regarding the territorial issue." The government has now changed its stance because immediately after the Russian proposal was submitted, Russian authorities stepped up cracking down on violations by initiating a policy called "Putina (Fishing Season) `94." This posed a threat to the livelihood of many Japanese fishermen. For example, it led to a decreased catch as recorded by the Rausu Fishing Cooperative in comparison to the previous year. In turn, this led to mounting complaints against the government among local fishermen, calling for a change in its policy. The Russian Government claims there were nearly 8,000 cases of violations by Japanese fishing boats last year, and Japanese fishing boats continue to be seized. However, should Japan agree to adopt the proposed fishing fees system, it could be taken by the international community that Japan has made concessions regarding claims of its sovereignty over the northern territories. On top of that, it may give rise to the possibility of other forms of illegal fishing operations. Thus, there still are many hurdles to be cleared beforehand.
