Shumeyko is in Strasbourg as head of the Russian delegation attending a session of the Council of Europe Assembly. Shumeyko stressed that the U.N. decision allowing NATO to decide on the use of force in the war zone remains in effect. But the decision was adopted several months ago and the situation has changed considerably since then, he said. The latest actions cannot be justified by the need to protect civilians in Bosnia-Herzegovina, he continued. Additionally, Russia's involvement in Bosnian settlement has brought certain results and opened up ways for continuing the search for a compromise satisfying all sides. He believes the United States should not have openly shown support for one side, while "punishing" another. He stressed that from the military point of view the effectiveness of air strikes is also in question. "As a result of air strikes only one tank was destroyed, but civilians died. No tank can be worth a human life," he said. Shumeyko noted that the NATO actions cannot facilitate the peace process. Time will show if they have not caused further escalation of the conflict in the region, he concluded.
