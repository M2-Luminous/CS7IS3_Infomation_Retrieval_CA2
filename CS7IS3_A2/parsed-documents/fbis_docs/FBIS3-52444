According to Lieutenant General Baraq, the agreement with the PLO confers three missions on the IDF [Israel Defense Forces]: To defend the external borders of the region included in the agreement, to guard the Jewish settlements, and to safeguard the travel axes. Our correspondent Yo'el Nir reports that Lt. Gen. Baraq told the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee that the IDF understands that the government has decided to let the Palestinian police deal with the sources of terrorism. Israel assumes this will be a strong and efficient police which will cooperate with Israel in foiling terrorism and safeguarding the roads. The chief of staff made it clear that the IDF will continue to deal with terrorist acts along travel axes and in their vicinity. If the terrorists are not caught near the roads, however, the Palestinian police force will have to deal with them. [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 1400 GMT on 4 January, reporting on the chief of staff's Knesset appearances, adds: "Lt. Gen. Baraq told the committee that in 1993, 450 people were stricken off the wanted list -- 42 of them were killed, the rest either turned themselves in, were caught, or escaped abroad. The chief of staff added that 1993 was characterized by a fight against terrorism in the security zone and the rest of Lebanon, as well as by the fight against the intifadah in Judaea and Samaria. At the same time the IDF continued its buildup program on the basis of the multiyear work plan."] Answering a question regarding the involvement of senior officers in the agreement with the PLO, the chief of staff said that senior officers on the ground and in the General Staff are not supposed to deal with the political aspects of the agreement. At the same time the Army must explain in detail all the military ramifications and present its conclusions to the government. Deputy Chief of Staff Amnon Shahaq is dealing with the technical aspects of the agreement and is trying to reach the best possible arrangements in the security sphere. The chief of staff rejected charges made by the opposition that those officers who are opposed to the agreement are being silenced. He added that there are no problems or uncertainties regarding orders relating to this issue or compliance therewith. Our correspondent notes that at the opening of the session all members of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee congratulated the IDF since over the last year no soldiers were killed in training accidents.
