This is the only way to "reply to the Kohl model" and to "show that the SPD has a wealth of assertive politicians." Verheugen said it is tactically unwise to demand that the SPD make a clear coalition statement. At the same time he pointed out that "the idea of a grand coalition must not even come up." He indirectly favored a coalition with the Greens. The party must be self-confident in choosing its partners. For its policy of renewal it needs a reform alliance, Verheugen said.
