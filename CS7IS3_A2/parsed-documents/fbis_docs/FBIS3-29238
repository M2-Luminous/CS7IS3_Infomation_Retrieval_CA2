The unadjusted customs-cleared trade surplus was a double-digit climb for the second straight month following a 15.5 percent rise in December, and was the highest since a 28.1 percent jump last July. Exports increased 7.5 percent for the 11th consecutive month, up 7.5 percent to 25,929.9 million dollars. Imports also rose for the 11th month in a row, up 4.8 percent to 19,824.3 million dollars. A ministry official said that in terms of volume, exports are little changed while imports are growing strongly. This is not yet apparent in the figures, however. This is because the strength of the yen against the dollar is probably causing a temporary rise in the value of overall surplus in what is known as the "J-curve effect." The dollar averaged 111.94 yen in January, up 11.5 percent from the same month the previous year when it averaged 124.86 yen. The rise in surplus comes at a time when the yen is being propped higher against the dollar as a consequence of the lack of agreement on trade issues at the weekend summit between the leaders of the United States and Japan. Japan's politically sensitive trade surplus with the U.S. rose 7.0 percent to 3.13 billion dollars, going uphill for the eighth consecutive month, and accounting for 51.3 percent of the overall surplus. A ministry official pointed out, however, that the notable characteristic of the month was a big rise in surplus with other Asian nations, which almost doubled from the previous year, surging 98.8 percent to 2.99 billion dollars. It was the 21st straight month for the surplus with Asian countries to grow. The surplus with Asian nations was driven by a three-fold increase in ship exports from a year earlier, the ministry official said, noting that Japan exported huge container vessels. Japan's surplus with the European Union returned to the downtrend after the abrupt rise the previous month, declining 36.1 percent to 1.75 billion dollars. Exports of motor engines rose 27.1 percent, and semiconductors and other electronic parts grew 39.2 percent, while automobile exports fell 16.3 percent, down for the eighth month in a row. Imports of crude oil dropped 29.9 percent, while oil products fell 18.3 percent. Although the volume in crude oil remained almost unchanged, the export value of crude oil fell due to the drop in prices, the official said. Crude oil prices averaged 14.57 dollars per barrel, down 21.7 percent from 18.61 dollars in January the previous year. Imports of semiconductors and other electronic parts jumped 50.5 percent and that of automobiles rose 42.9 percent. The official said it is difficult to predict future trends. "It will all depend on factors such as yen-dollar exchange rates and the economic situation in Japan and overseas," he said.
