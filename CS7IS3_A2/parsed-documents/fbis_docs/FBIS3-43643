AVF spokesman Stephen Maninger says allegations that right wingers are involved in township violence are hypocritical and opportunistic. [Begin Maninger recording] Well, our position is this, the government and the ANC accused us yesterday of contributing to the violence in the townships. That is total nonsense. We think that it's ridiculous to suggest that right wingers on the whole are involved because we are not the people with the AK-47s; we are not the people that are assassinating the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] leadership, that are involved in shootouts in the townships. I mean, it is ridiculous to suggest that we are in any way linked to that sort of struggle. [end recording]
