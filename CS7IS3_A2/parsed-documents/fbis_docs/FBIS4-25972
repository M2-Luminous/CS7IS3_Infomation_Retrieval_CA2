However, ravages of drought are developing quickly in the province at present, which will bring about tremendous difficulties for summer sowing and autumn seedling management in various localities. According to the present estimates conducted in various localities on 14 June, some 70 million mu of fields were afflicted with drought, and of this, 30 million mu were severely afflicted. Due to the drought, dead seedlings resulted in 850,000 mu of corn and peasant fields sown in spring and summer. Seedlings were unable to emerge normally on 1.5 million mu of summer-sown cropfields. And nearly 20 million mu of summer-sowing cropfields were unable to be sown on time due to the drought. A department concerned, maintains that if there are no heavy rains in the near future, the province will be threatened by the difficulties in sowing seedlings, ensuring sound growth of seedlings, and providing drinking water for people and animals. According to the weather forecast by the provincial meteorological department, far from promising obvious rainfalls in the near future, the province will experience high temperatures in succession. At the moment, the situation of combating drought to ensure summer sowing and summer harvest is extremely grim. Therefore, all localities should cool off from the joy of bumper harvest and should rapidly set off a mighty movement of combating drought to ensure summer sowing and summer harvesting throughout the province. As demanded by the emergency notice of the provincial government, all localities should lose no time and concentrate energies on sowing and managing summer crops. By overcoming the fear of difficulty, the mood of worry, and the idea of waiting for rains at the mercy of the elements, all localities should make full use of all water sources and water areas to combat drought with a view to ensuring sowing and sound growth of seedlings. Meanwhile, attention should be paid to resolving problems in providing drinking water for people and animals. The areas now harvesting wheat should make appropriate arrangements for simultaneously harvesting, sowing, and managing crops and for ensuring both wheat harvest and drought combat with a view to winning the last victory in summer sowing and harvest through drought combat and to reaping an even greater bumper harvest in autumn crops.
