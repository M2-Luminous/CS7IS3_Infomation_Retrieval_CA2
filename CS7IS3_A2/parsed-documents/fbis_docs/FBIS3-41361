JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI. A smuggler who sold grease to other smugglers in place of opium residue was arrested. According to a report by our correspondent: Following the reports of the Hezbollah nation to the personnel of the antinarcotics office of the Khomeynishahr law enforcement region concerning the activities of narcotics trafficking gangs, the law enforcement officials began surveillance of the activities of the two above-mentioned gangs. In this connection, the selling gang had specified a delivery place for the narcotics in Esfahan. Since these two gangs were under surveillance by officials, at the precise time of the delivery of the substance, six professional smugglers with 40 1-kg sealed packages of opium residue and 9 million rials in cash as well as two vehicles were captured. According to a report by the public relations office of the Esfahan law enforcement zone, after the seizure of the above substances, while weighing and examining them, the officials in the antinarcotics office realized that grease had been substituted for the opium residue packages. In their confessions, the accused say that the substance was sold to them recently by an experienced smuggler in the east of the country as opium residue, and because they had bought narcotics from him several times, they did not suspect it. Based on this report, in the continuation of the examination of this case, the officials identified the cheating smuggler, who was active in one of the border cities in the east of the country. After his arrest, he told the officials that he had done so because he is deeply in debt. It is interesting that a number of grease cans were discovered from the hiding place of the cheating smuggler. On the whole, four accused persons, considering their various past records in the trafficking of narcotics and explicit confessions, were sent to judicial authorities and condemned to jail.
