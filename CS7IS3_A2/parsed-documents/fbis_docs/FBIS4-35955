In an exclusive interview with MENA deputy chief editor Jalal Salim, al-Asnaj said that the ongoing war in Yemen has left approximately 80,000 people dead, wounded, or homeless. He pointed out that the real loser in this war is the Yemeni people before their leaders, since the war has seriously harmed the people's interests and institutions. He added that the advocates of war must return to reason and heed the appeals of their Arab brothers and the calls of the international community to start negotiations among the Yemeni parties concerned. Asked if there were flaws when the Yemen unity was declared four years ago that have led to the current situation, al-Asnaj said: Naturally, there was a major flaw in the composition of the Yemeni unity because it preceded the preparations for the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, as if it were tailored to suit Iraq's plan for expansion in the region. He noted that major components of the unity, which enjoys the support of the Yemeni people throughout the country, were lacking. He added: Two armies remained in Yemen, one in the north and another in the south. Two financial institutions, two diplomatic representations, two departments for security and general intelligence existed before and remained after the unity. In addition, the riyal remained the currency in the north and the dinar the currency in the south after the unity. Al-Asnaj noted that the existing contradictions between the north and the south, in terms of the makeup of each society, had also been overlooked. The north, he added, is a society of tribes, the military, and the leadership, while in the south there are developed administrative institutions where experienced and qualified people find the opportunities they deserve on an equal footing, unlike the north, where opportunities go to the privileged and the loyal only. Explaining the contradictions on which the Yemeni unity was based, al-Asnaj said that four years after this unity was declared, differences deepened and the views of the Yemeni Socialist Party and its representatives in the south and President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his representatives in the north were not harmonious. He added that a third party, the Yemeni Reform Grouping, entered the composition of the bilateral alliance which had concluded the unity agreement after general elections were held in Yemen 14 months ago. He noted that the ruling alliance became tripartite with the entry of the Yemeni Reform Grouping, which is a political organization comprising the Hashid Tribe and the (?politicized) Islamic Movement in Yemen and has links with Sudan. This, he said, prompted further (?contradictions) within the authority structure which made the Yemeni Socialist Party feel that its role in achieving unity had been ignored and that its equality with the northern side had diminished to a great extent. Al-Asnaj explained that this situation had a direct effect on the ordinary citizens in the southern governorates when President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih decided that his men should run the southern governorates' affairs beginning with the post of governor and ending with the posts of customs directors. He said the Yemeni citizen in the south suffered complications in handling his daily affairs, in addition to the increase in cost of living and the spreading unemployment. In light of these negative developments, he said, the unity became a source of misery for the southern citizen and a source of prosperity for the minority in the north. He went on to say that this explains part of the problems that exist today and which led to this war that we witness with pain. Replying to a question on the Yemeni unity's fate and future in light of the current circumstances, he said "the government in the south" is eager to assert its belief in and concern for its right to reformulate the Yemeni unity in a manner that will erase the memory of the "pools of blood" that have been shed under the slogan of a false legitimacy and under undesired protection because the unity existed only on paper. He accused Sanaa of unilaterally abrogating the Pledge and Accord Document recently and said: This gives the Yemeni public a new example of misbehavior. He noted that anyone who declares war on his people and rejects the mediation of brothers and the international community, represented by the Security Council, loses all bases of constitutional legitimacy and every sense of struggle for the sake of the Yemeni people's unity because unity does not come about over the people's skulls. He said that the "Democratic Republic of Yemen" will be an experiment and a beginning toward removing the peoples' bitterness and grudges that have led to a grinding war caused by Sanaa, which was enthusiastic about it. Concluding the interview, al-Asnaj answered a question on his expectations about the recognition of the recently proclaimed government in south Yemen. He said there are Arab and international indications in this regard that might be announced soon.
