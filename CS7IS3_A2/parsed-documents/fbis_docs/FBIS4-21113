Five drug smugglers of this kind have been arrested so far this year. Half a Kilogram of Heroin The latest arrived in Stockholm by ferry via Russia and Finland. The Finnish police thought they knew what was going on, but instead of arresting the Tanzanian, they shadowed him on the trip to Sweden. When he reached Stockholm the Swedish police took over. The suspect took a taxi to a residential address in southern Stockholm where a fellow countryman was waiting. At that point the police moved in. It eventually turned out that the suspect was indeed smuggling heroin. He was carrying about half a kg in his stomach. Traffic Gains New Momentum Superintendent Lars-Erik Karlsson, chief of the narcotics division in Stockholm, revealed that this African smuggling activity started two summers ago. Since then around 40 couriers have been caught when they came to the Nordic region. Last year the traffic seemed to die down somewhat, but after the arrest of five people in the first two months of this year alone, Karlsson fears that a new wave is on the way. The smuggling routes have varied. Some have come by plane, others by boat. Karlsson is convinced that the smuggling is organized. A common feature is that the drugs involved are brown smokable heroin from Pakistan. Some of the couriers were loaded up, as Karlsson puts it, in Africa while others swallowed their smuggled cargo in Istanbul, Turkey. Two Already Sentenced Two of the five people who have been arrested so far this year have already been sentenced. One, who smuggled in 587 grams, was sentenced to five years in jail plus lifetime expulsion. The other, who was carrying a record 667 grams, received a sentence of 5.5 years plus lifetime expulsion.
