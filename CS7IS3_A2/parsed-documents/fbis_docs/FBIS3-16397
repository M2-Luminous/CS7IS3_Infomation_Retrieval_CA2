The news conference held by the chairmen of the Armenian and Azerbaijani parliaments provided the most documentary evidence about that meeting. Considering the importance of the event and broad audience, I have eliminated the reporters' questions during the news conference, and I thought it appropriate to quote Ararktsyan's words as completely as possible. [Ararktsyan] A meeting took place between me and Rasul Guliyev, chairman of the Azerbaijani parliament, on the Idzhevan-Kazakh road on 12 March. This was our first meeting. During our first telephone conversation, I congratulated Mr. Guliyev on being elected chairman of the parliament. We had agreed at the time to meet at an opportune time. The opportunity arose at this time. I think that the talks were constructive in nature, and we agreed to discuss matters pertaining to the future, and basically not to brood over, or analyze, or examine past events. I could say that basically the talks centered around these matters. Naturally, we could not have delved into details and examine details. Therefore, we divided the talks in two: global matters, including the approach of the two sides to the Karabakh problem. Also, on our part we had our own specific proposals, which I will inform you about. As regards the first problem, the sides confirmed once again that they favor a peaceful resolution of the problem, and that the establishment of a stable and guaranteed peace in the region is a priority. And only then start negotiations on the status of Nagorno-Karabakh. This is in conformity with CSCE Minsk Group's initiatives which are enshrined in the schedule on urgent measures worked out in Vienna. The next one was that Nagorno-Karabakh should fully participate in the settlement process of the problem. As you know, in this case too, the Vienna schedule notes that Nagorno-Karabakh is a party to the conflict, and that this in itself does not imply any political consequences. Next, the sides agreed that international organizations, in particular CSCE, should take part in the peace process, and various countries -- as you know Russia has its own proposals and initiatives -- could come forward with their own initiatives. That the Lachin humanitarian corridor should always be functional was also raised. I again repeat, these were the global issues raised, we have not gone into detail, which is the work of the diplomats. These were the main global issues on which we (?agreed). In addition to that, our side, the Armenian side, guided by the fact that the atmosphere of mutual confidence should be restored [words indistinct], made a unilateral proposal. Specifically, that Armenia is ready to make its communication routes available for transportation of (?certain) goods from Azerbaijan to Nakhichevan. Let me say that this is not a new proposal. Our government had proposed to Turkey more than a year ago that Armenia is ready to make its communications routes available for the transportation of freight to Nakhichevan. This is a reply to the claims of certain circles that Nakhichevan is allegedly also under blockade. The second concrete proposal, which was made for the first time, was that Armenia is unilaterally ready, without any preconditions, to make its communications routes available to bring (?fuel) and power to Nakhichevan. We are ready to enter into technical talks even this very day or tomorrow to realize this plan. These are in general the issues raised [words indistinct]. As regards these last two proposals, the Azerbaijani side will study them and reply [words indistinct]. I repeat that we have placed no preconditions as regards these concrete proposals, and (?they) could be implemented very quickly [words indistinct] [Geuzelyan] The chairman of the Armenian Supreme Council was asked many questions. Let me mention only one, the most interesting one. Asked if he believes that peace could be achieved this year, Mr. Ararktsyan said: [Ararktsyan] I do not want to engage in predictions. I am trying to do concrete work as much as possible. It is clear that this is the most important issue and we should exert all efforts to attain peace, of course, an honorable and just peace.
