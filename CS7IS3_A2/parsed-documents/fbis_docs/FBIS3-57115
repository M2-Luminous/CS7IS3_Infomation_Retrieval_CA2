The U.S. President, in his 30-minute telephone conversation, emphasized that the issues of human rights and citizenship are not linked to the issue of the withdrawal of Russian troops. The United States, since the incident in Latvia on 10 January and the events connected with it, has not changed its stance on the issue of the withdrawal of Russian troops and believes that the issue of human rights and citizenship is to be settled by the Latvian state itself, stressed Guntis Ulmanis. Bill Clinton also informed Ulmanis about his visit to Moscow last week. The U.S. President discussed with Russian President Boris Yeltsin the issue of the Skrunda radar station. Clinton recommended continuing talks at the level of the government commissions on this issue and seeking a compromise solution.
