The presidium asked not only for the names of reporters who deal with security issues but also for their pen names or the indentation symbols they use. According to police spokesman Ales Svoboda, the requests have only been made by telephone so far; there is no written evidence of them. The spokesman said yesterday that the Police Presidium only wanted to update the current list of journalists. He denied any claims that the collection of names and symbols of the reporters was to serve for their persecution. "It is only so that we know whom to invite to news conferences, for instance," he said. According to Svoboda, it is becoming ever more frequent that people call the police claiming to be journalists.
