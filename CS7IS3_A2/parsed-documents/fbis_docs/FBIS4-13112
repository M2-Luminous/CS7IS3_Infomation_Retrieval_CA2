In an exclusive statement to INA's correspondent in Cairo, the Korean ambassador said U.S. determination and deliberate attempts to harm Iraq, and its use of the Security Council to apply illegal resolutions against it, violate international law and seriously jeopardize world peace and security. He said U.S.-Western attempts to commit aggression against Iraq, besiege it, and interfere in its domestic affairs are all part of a old, and now new, colonialist scheme, led by the United States, to intimidate Third World nations, particularly countries that adhere to independent decision making and reject U.S. hegemony. The North Korean ambassador said U.S. claims about the implementation of international resolutions, whether by Iraq or Korea, have fallen on deaf ears and have no legitimate foundation or relation to international law. He said these resolutions are void and are in line with U.S. interests in the world. He said the Security Council has lost its true role in maintaining law and protecting nations and is now being used in an ugly manner to achieve U.S.-Western strategy whose features are today clearer than any time before. The ambassador said his country firmly rejects the false propaganda campaign led by the United States against it under the pretext of Korea's rejection of the White House wishes and orders.
