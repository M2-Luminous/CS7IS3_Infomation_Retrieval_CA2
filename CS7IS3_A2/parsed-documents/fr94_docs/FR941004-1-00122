FR941004-1-00122 FR941004-1-00019 Background In Executive Order 12866, ``Regulatory Planning and Review'' (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the President set forth the Administration's regulatory philosophy and principles. The Executive Order contemplates an efficient and effective rulemaking process, including the conservation of the limited government resources available for carrying out its regulatory functions. In responding to both the letter and the spirit of the President's order, the Secretary of Transportation has directed administrations within the Department of Transportation (DOT) to focus on improvements that can be made in the way in which they propose and adopt regulations. The Administrative Conference of the United States (ACUS) recently observed that the rulemaking process has become increasingly time consuming. (Aviation interests in particular have expressed concern to the FAA over the time-consuming workings of the regulatory process.) ACUS believes that agencies should consider innovative methods for developing rules and obtaining public input, including the use of such groups as advisory committees and negotiated rulemaking committees. The FAA and the industry have been engaged in one such effort for several years, through the Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee (ARAC). In addition to focusing on consensus-based rulemaking, ACUS believes that agencies should consider the use of ``direct final'' rulemaking where appropriate to eliminate duplicative review of non-controversial rules. Under the direct final rulemaking procedure, an agency issues a final rule with an opportunity for comment and a statement that if the agency receives no adverse or negative comments, the rule becomes effective automatically at a specified time after close of the comment period. If an adverse comment or a notice of intent to file such a comment is received, the agency withdraws the rule before the effective date and issues a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in the normal manner. This expedited process was initially recommended by the Vice President in his report on the National Performance Review (``Creating a Government That Works Better and Costs Less; Improving Regulatory Systems''). Use of the process is encouraged in rulemakings in which the agency does not believe there will be adverse public comment, in order to help agencies streamline their rulemaking procedures. The FAA proposes to use the direct final rulemaking procedure for non-controversial rules and for consensual rules, where it believes there will be no adverse public comment. The FAA believes that this expedited process can be used effectively for a number of proposed agency rules, including many of the proposed regulations based on recommendations of broad-based advisory committee groups such as ARAC. The FAA would consider issuing a direct final rule where such an advisory committee has involved representatives of all interested parties in negotiating a proposed rule; the committee has reached a unanimous recommendation; and the nature of the negotiations leads the FAA to believe the public will not file adverse comments. The FAA would expect this often to be the case, for example, for recommendations of the ARAC intended to harmonize FAA and European technical standards for the manufacture of aircraft. The direct final rulemaking process may also be used to regularly issue airworthiness directives, whenever there is broad consensus within sections of the aviation community on the FAA's view of the appropriate correction for an unsafe condition in an aviation product. Other possible uses of the process would include routine regulations amending airspace designations and possibly the extension of a compliance date that is not expected to be controversial. The Direct Final Rule Procedure When the FAA believes that a proposed regulation is unlikely to result in adverse comment, it may choose to use the direct final rule process. The direct final rule will advise the public that no adverse comments are anticipated, and that unless a written adverse or negative comment, or a written notice of intent to submit an adverse comment is received within the comment period, the regulation will become effective at the end of a specified period of time after close of the comment period. If no written adverse or negative comment, or notice of intent to submit such a comment is received within the comment period, the direct final rule will become effective on the date indicated in the direct final rule. The FAA will publish a notice in the Federal Register indicating that no adverse comments were received and confirming the date on which the final rule will become effective. Comments that are outside the scope of the rule will not be considered adverse under this procedure. A comment recommending a rule change in addition to the direct final rule would not be considered an adverse comment, unless the commenter states that the rule would be inappropriate as proposed or would be ineffective without the additional change. A comment not so qualified would be beyond the scope of the rulemaking. If the FAA does receive, within the comment period, an adverse or negative comment, or written notice of intent to submit such a comment, a notice of withdrawal of the direct final rule will be published in the Federal Register , and an NPRM will be published with a new comment period. Normal procedures for the agency's receipt and consideration of comments will then apply. Interested persons are encouraged to submit comments on this proposed new procedure. In particular, comments are invited on specific areas of the FAA's regulations for which this procedure might be appropriate. Regulatory Evaluation
