FR940802-1-00025 FR940802-1-00010 Performance Standards Due to the lack of industry standards for EFVs, the NPRM proposed performance standards concerning EFV construction and operation to assure an adequate level of safety. The Joint Commenters' proposal eliminates most of these proposed standards. RSPA has become aware that two pipeline safety standard committees, American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM) F17 and American National Standards Institute/Gas Piping Technology Committee (ANSI/GPTC) Z380, are studying EFVs. The F17 group is developing standard test procedures for uniform performance testing of EFVs and expects to issue emergency standards soon. The emergency standards would expire upon completion of the normal ASTM standard cycle and issuance of permanent standards. The Z380 committee is evaluating the need for using EFVs. They are also determining appropriate applications for the device. The standardized requirements should provide a higher level of reassurance about the reliability of EFVs. Reliability has been a concern due to the past absence of participation by pipeline industry-sponsored safety standard committees. Should RSPA await the completion of performance standards by either or both of these professional committees before proceeding with this EFV rulemaking? Impact Assessment RSPA prepared a regulatory evaluation to accompany the NPRM. This evaluation is on file in the Docket. Each year, according to the evaluation, about 300,000 new high pressure service lines are installed and 600,000 existing high pressure service lines are replaced. At a cost of $20 per EFV, the estimated annual impact of requiring EFV installation as proposed in both alternatives would be $18 million. Aggregate annual savings of $19-$31 million would result from reduced deaths, injuries, fires, explosions and evacuations. The Joint Commenters say that the regulatory evaluation contains errors. RSPA seeks additional comments if new information is available. RSPA seeks information on where specifically the analysis is in error, and, if so, where specifically should it be changed? Please justify any proposed changes with supporting data. Authority: 49 U.S.C. 5103, 60102, 60104, 60108, 60109, 60110, 60113 and 60118; 49 CFR 1.53. Issued in Washington, DC, on July 27, 1994.
