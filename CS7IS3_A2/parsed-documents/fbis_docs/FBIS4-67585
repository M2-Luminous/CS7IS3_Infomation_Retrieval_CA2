CORD, which was developed by the power generation (KWU) division of Siemens AG, has thus proved its efficacy in this field as well. In addition to the reactor pressure vessel, all four circulation loops and the reactor water purification and residual heat removal system in the Swedish Oskarshamn 1 nuclear power station (442 megawatts) were decontaminated in 13 days. The test results available to date show that well over 99.6 percent of the radioactivity was flushed out, in other words that the average decontamination factor was much greater than 200. This process makes it possible to convert all the chemicals involved into carbon dioxide and water without residue, even while the decontamination work is still under way. On completion of decontamination, therefore, the water reacquires demineralized water quality. The dissolved cations and radioactivity have been removed by the ion exchanger filter in the reactor water purification system, thus requiring no additional ion exchanger. Once the reactor pressure vessel had been hosed out with high-pressure water, it showed only a "residual wipe-off activity" of about 4 Bq/sq.cm. The dose rate at the bottom of the vessel was lowered by more than 20 mSv/h to under 0.02 mSv/h, and this extremely low radiation level now makes it possible to carry out the relevant tests and repair work. Following the positive results obtained with CORD, Siemens-KWU has been commissioned to undertake a similar job in Finland, where the 300-cu.m primary system of the Lovlisa nuclear power station is scheduled for decontamination in August 1994.
