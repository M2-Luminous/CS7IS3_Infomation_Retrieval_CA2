He said there has been an equivocation about what is happening in Lusaka. [Begin recording] [Valentim] There has been an equivocation. On 6 March 1994, the government made its third offer. The first offer was made on 13 December, and the second on 27 February. On 6 March, the government offered us the Ministry of Health, and we accepted it. It offered us the Ministry of Tourism and Hotels and we accepted it. It offered us the Ministry of Commerce and we accepted it. It offered us the Ministry of Construction Materials, but we told them that there was no such ministry. In fact, there are no installations, stationery, furniture, or even mats. This is a ministry that was supposed to be created from the existing Ministry of Public Works. On 27 February, the government offered us the Ministry of Public Works. So, we suggested a minor change. There are no other ministries that UNITA is asking in addition to what the government has offered us. To say that we are asking for key ministries while we are trying to (?accommodate) the government's offer, is completely wrong and is contrary to the proposals [words indistinct] placed on the negotiating table. [Unidentified correspondent] So, is that the only outstanding issue to be tackled at the Lusaka talks? [Valentim] That is one of the problems. We will now deal with the question of governors. We have (?stated) our position [words indistinct] for the sake of national reconciliation. We also want other provinces where we feel we have a role to play regarding [words indistinct] Huambo and Benguela. [Correspondent] What was the government's response? [Valentim] Well, instead of discussing the issue clearly, the government is saying that we are exaggerating and [words indistinct] we ought to clearly debate the issue. [Correspondent] You have lost the elections [words indistinct] the government has offered you several ministries and provinces. How can you [words indistinct]? [Valentim] I think that what is a stake here is not the question of elections, but how to resolve national [words indistinct] that could permit national reconciliation, otherwise there would be no negotiations and offers. We are negotiating. [end recording]
