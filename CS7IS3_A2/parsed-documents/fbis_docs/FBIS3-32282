He added that he is confident that Colombian President Cesar Gaviria will not run for the post. The Costa Rican foreign minister said he has been virtually elected OAS secretary general because he has the confirmed support of 23 countries: He needs 18 votes to be elected. [Begin Niehaus recording] If elections are held without pressure -- in Costa Rica we call it arm twisting -- we will obviously win. [end recording] Referring to the possible confirmation of Colombian President Cesar Gaviria's candidacy to the post, he clearly suggested that Gaviria give up the possibility of officially announcing his candidacy. [Begin Niehaus recording] Twenty-two or 23 countries are convinced this is fair. I am sure other countries will join them. Above all, I am sure -- and I say it with great respect -- that President Gaviria will take these aspects into consideration and abstain from officially announcing his candidacy. [end recording]
