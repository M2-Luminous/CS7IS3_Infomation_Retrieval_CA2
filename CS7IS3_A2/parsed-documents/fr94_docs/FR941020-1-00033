FR941020-1-00033 FR941020-1-00007 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Coast Guard 33 CFR Part 165 [CGD01&hyph;94&hyph;023] RIN 2115&hyph;AE84 Regulated Navigation Area; Heli-Carriers International, Upper New York Bay, NY and NJ AGENCY: Coast Guard, DOT. ACTION: Notice of withdrawal of rulemaking. SUMMARY: The Coast Guard is withdrawing the May 1994 notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) which proposed to establish a regulated navigation area (RNA) in the waters of Upper New York Bay in an area south southwest of Liberty Island and west of Federal Anchorage 20D for the purpose of operating a helicopter sightseeing service. On June 28, 1994, the Coast Guard Captain of the Port, New York, received a notice that this sightseeing service would not begin operation as scheduled. DATES: The NPRM is withdrawn and this rulemaking docket is closed effective October 20, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Lieutenant Rosanne Trabocchi, Project Manager, Captain of the Port, New York, (212) 668&hyph;7933. 0 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background and Purpose On May 19, 1994, the Coast Guard published in the Federal Register (59 FR 26156) an NPRM that proposed to establish a RNA in the waters of the Upper New York Bay from July 25, 1994, until December 31, 1998. This RNA was proposed due to a request by Heli-Carriers International to operate a helicopter sightseeing service from a floating heliport on the waters of Upper New York Bay. The proposed RNA set forth a defined water area for the heliport to anchor, and regulated vessel traffic in and around the area. Three (3) comments were received in response to the NPRM. On June 28, 1994, the Coast Guard Captain of the Port, New York, received notification that Heli-Carriers International was cancelling their application for a floating heliport license in favor of applying for a land site from which to operate their helicopter sightseeing service. Heli-Carriers International intends to reapply to the FAA for a floating heliport license at a future undetermined date. Therefore, there is no immediate need to establish the proposed RNA. The Coast Guard is withdrawing the NPRM and closing the docket on this rulemaking. The Coast Guard will initiate a new rulemaking project and publish an NPRM upon receipt of a new request from Heli-Carriers International. Dated: October 4, 1994. J.L. Linnon, Rear Admiral, U.S. Coast Guard, Commander, First Coast Guard District. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;26001 Filed 10&hyph;19&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;14&hyph;M
