The person who is in charge of the Palestinian side in this peace agreement talks about the need for the continuation of the jihad against the State of Israel. [Al-Agha] I think when we started this peace process, we started the negotiations. Indeed, I am astonished about what is said in the broadcast about this, and indeed I didn't hear this statement. I have no official thought about this, so I would have to ask my chairman to understand what happened about this. [Engel] I see. And if he says to you that indeed, he said and talked about the idea of the jihad, so you are going to implement now the idea of jihad, or you are going to continue with the peace process? [Al-Agha] No, no, maybe the head means not only the armed struggle, but also any other means, like negotiations, like other. I don't think -- I am sure that Mr. 'Arafat doesn't mean what happened.
