Zhang Wenlung, 28, of Jiansu Province in eastern China, used a pocket knife and toy gun to force a Xiamen Airlines Boeing 737 jet with 72 people aboard to fly to Taiwan on June 24. Zhang, a former soldier in the mainland army, was given a nine- year jail term instead of 12 years as recommended by the prosecutors because he surrendered himself to police upon landing. Ten mainland aircraft have been commandeered to Taiwan since last [words indistinct]. The repatriation of hijackers has become the most pressing issue for authorities on both sides of the Taiwan Strait. During the cross-strait technical talks held in Taipei in December, negotiators failed to work out any solution to the problem because they were unable to bypass the sovereignty and jurisdiction issues involved. Meanwhile, another three hijackers, Zhang Hai, who forced a Xiamen Airlines Boeing 737 to fly to Taiwan on Nov. 5, and Li Zianyu and Han Shuxue, who together commandeered a China Northern Airlines MD82 passenger plane to Taiwan on Nov. 12, were indicted by prosecutors Tuesday [4 January] for violating the aviation law.
