At the last meeting of the German company with the Belgian aviation press, Paul Vandermoere stated that, according to a "British study," each Belgian taxpayer paid some 64,000 Belgian francs [BFr] to Lufthansa's competitor on routes to Germany: namely Sabena. As there are some 5.9 million taxpayers in Belgium, we understood that the total contribution came to something in the region of BFr38 billion. Apparently this was an underestimate, as the individual in question had based his calculations on the total Belgian population. Which means a true figure of some BFr64 billion. For 1993? We thought this was much too high. Or else there was some misunderstanding. The only way to form a clear picture was to take a look at the report consulted by Lufthansa, but which the company -- understandably -- refused to supply. But as luck would have it a copy landed on our desk one morning and provided some very interesting facts -- and not only about Sabena. Capital Increase... The study in question was carried out by the Economist Intelligence Unit [EIU] last year and is entitled "Travel and Tourism Analyst." In this study, the EIU acknowledges that "the European Commission made no bones about finding out whether or not the member states should or should not be airline owners," while stating that, for the Americans at least, such a situation is inevitably seen as favoring disguised public aid. This U.S. accusation is countered in Europe with the argument that the rules of Chapter 11 of the U.S. bankruptcy Code is also contrary to the rules of fair competition. But the fact remains that, since August 1991, several government "subsidies" have been granted to various European airlines. These are, according to the study: - Sabena: 65.4 billion Belgian francs [BFr] ($1.8 billion) in August 1991, an amount accepted by the Commission, on condition that no other aid is granted. The study notes that the "package" also includes the wiping off of a BFr16.2 billion public debt and a capital injection of BFr19 billion. The figure quoted by the Lufthansa representative does not therefore relate to 1993, but must be a part of Pierre Godefroid's Phenix plan for restructuring Sabena. - Air France: 2 billion French francs [FFr] in December 1991, FFr1.3 billion in mid-1992 and FFr1.5 billion in early 1993, or $370, 260, and 270 million respectively. The EIU reports that the first injection, although directly public, was accepted by the European Commission as it was a capital increase by the majority shareholder. The second relates to the BNP's acquisition of an 8.8 - stake in the Air France capital. The third relates to an investment by the CDC [Deposit and Consignment Office] and is the subject of a study by the European Commission to decide whether or not it should be considered as state aid, given the CDC's status. - Iberia: 120 billion pesetas ($1.2 billion) in August 1992, an amount accepted by the Commission as part of the company's modernization plans, in particular for fleet renewal. - Air Portugal: 35.1 billion escudos ($260 million) both to wipe off a debt and convert 3.1 billion escudos into shares. Or State Aid The recent "report of the wise men," the group headed by Herman De Croo, seems to favor the system of "One aid, last aid." The above companies (including Sabena and Air France) should therefore leave it at that and, in future, expect to be self-reliant. The EIU's report, in speaking of "possible future aid" (remember that it dates from last year), mentions the Irish government's contribution to Aer Lingus ($250 million) as part of a restructuring plan, together with a new requirement on the part of Air France for which the government would be willing to inject FFr5 billion. Since then, it has become clear that Air France is likely to be asking FFr8 billion. The question now is therefore that of interpretation of the notion of "last chance." The management of the French company is playing a double game which although very understandable is difficult to unravel as it is addressed at two publics. On the one hand, it is said that Air France could disappear tomorrow if (in this order) the unions reject Christian Blanc's restructuring plan or if the Commission also fails to accept it. On the other hand, it is said that France would never abandon its national company, the question being the price which would have to be paid. All of which raises some real questions regarding the "ethics" of the European Commission's work. Let's assume that Delors and his team accept a capital injection from the French government of Ffr 8 billion. The aim would be to ensure the company's recovery. But what if this recovery included the discontinuation of flights to certain destinations, leaving the way free for the competition (which by the way?), for example? And as Sabena is linked to Air France would it too have to indirectly suffer? And, finally, to put it bluntly: if Air France were to fold, what would be the fate of Sabena? While a private investor may consider it necessary to inject new capital into his company, the question remains whether a government which is the majority shareholder also enjoys that same right. Of course, you could ask that government to consult its shareholders (the taxpayers), but that is rather a simplistic view as the unions are at pains to point out. Nevertheless, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit (a British organization), since August 1991 some $4.2 billion have been invested by governments or public institutions in European airlines and this may be no more than the beginning. It is understandable that certain companies take this badly and in particular Lufthansa which has been forced, facing a "state-aided Sabena," to cut flights to Berlin due to overcapacity. However, the problem lies in the status of companies -- whether in Europe or elsewhere -- in which the government is shareholder. This sensitive question is far from being resolved.
