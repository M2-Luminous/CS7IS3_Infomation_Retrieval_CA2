In a telephone conversation with AL-DUSTUR, Dr. al-Mu'ashshir explained that U.S. President Bill Clinton had promised His Majesty King Husayn to seriously study the possibility of reducing Jordan's debts to the United States and that this issue would be followed up through various key channels. Dr. al-Mu'ashshir said that this is one way to indirectly help Jordan, especially since the U.S. foreign aid is being reconsidered and even reduced, and this would therefore be the best way to help Jordan. He added that the U.S. Administration has welcomed the idea of replacing sea searches by an international on-land inspection of the goods bound for Jordan through the Gulf of Aqaba. He noted that sea searches increase freight charges and reduce cargo sizes because of the need to leave space inside ships to carry out inspections. Dr. al-Mu'ashshir explained that UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali has shown clear interest in the proposals made by Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-al-Salam al-Majali when they met last week. Those proposals call for easing Jordan's burdens resulting from the blockade imposed on the Port of al-'Aqabah, facilitating the processing of Jordan's [import] applications and treating them like those of other countries harmed by the blockade imposed on Iraq, and reducing the excessive bureaucratic measures imposed on Jordan. He said that the response of the British Lloyds Company to the proposal for on-land inspections rather than sea searches has encouraged the U.S. Administration to accept such a compromise in order to ease Jordan's burdens resulting from the blockade on the Port of al-'Aqabah. He said this response has left a good and satisfactory impression among Americans. Dr. al-Mu'ashshir stressed Jordan's concern for unanimous Arab decisions, especially over the lifting of the Arab boycott of Israel. He said the boycott issue depends on the Arab League, which has the final say in this regard. He said, however, that the secondary and third degree boycott can be studied and ways can be worked out to deal with this matter.
