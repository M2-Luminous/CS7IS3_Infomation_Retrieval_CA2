The number of western Germans taking up residence in the new laender has been increasing from year to year, while fewer and fewer eastern Germans are moving west. Whereas 395,343 people moved from east to west in 1990, the figure for 1992 was about half that. By contrast, in 1992, 111,345 people from the old laender found a new home in eastern Germany --that is, almost three times as many as two years ago. In the first half of last year, this trend gained in momentum. By the end of May 1993, the Federal Office of Statistics in Weisbaden registered the departure of 75,588 people from the new laender. During the same period, 55,907 citizens from the western part of the country took up residence east of the former demarcation line. Projected figures for the whole year indicate that 180,000 people will have left the east and 135,000 will have moved there --the gap is closing. The main reason for this development is that many people starting out in a career want to begin in the east: "Young lawyers and doctors, as well as bank employees, can often make more rapid career progress in the new laender than in the west," says Stefanie Wahl of the Bonn Institute for the Economy and Society (IWG). As a result, urban centers such as the "boom region" Leipzig-Halle are particularly popular with those starting their careers in the east. However, the number of people returning to the east is also continually rising, and that benefits the economy there. According to Stefanie Wahl, in the west these people "often obtained professional qualifications that they can now use." For one group in the population -- that is, foreigners -- the trend has already been reversed. In the first five months of last year, 5,769 foreigners moved from the east to the west, and 6,177 moved to the east.
