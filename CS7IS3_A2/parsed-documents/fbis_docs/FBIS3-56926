People were interested in various aspects of our aggravating and difficult life. It is understandable that on the eve of the Supreme Soviet session, which is to resume its work on 18 January, viewers wanted to hear Stanislav Stanislavavich's opinion on current matters. He called the situation in Belarus difficult and conflicting, and stated that it should be fundamentally changed. This task is beyond the current Supreme Soviet's powers, so he supports the idea of early elections. It should be noted that sometimes the questions were posed point-blank. For example, Minsk resident Valyeriy Kharkow wanted to know whether it is not time for the Supreme Soviet chairman to resign of his own will. "If I had seen any advantage to my resignation, or if someone else had secured the holding of new elections, I would have resigned long ago," underlined S. Shushkevich. "Instead, I am doing everything in my power to propel the process of reelecting our parliament by preparing the necessary legal basis." A viewer from Orsha, having stated that during the last year prices in the Republic increased 28 times, asked why the parliament does not replace Prime Minister Kebich who drove the economy into a dead end, with Karpyenka who is a supporter of market economy. To this S. Shushkevich answered: "The issue is not only in the government. Just look at your neighbor states of the former USSR. The situation there is no better. I think that we must look for people with market ideas and place them in the Cabinet of Ministers. This way we can activate the levers of the market economy." Of course, the viewer did not forget to ask Stanislav Stanislavavich about his opinion on the unification of currencies with Russia, as well as about the consequences of this serious step for Belarus. The Supreme Soviet chairman stated that if unification brings a parity of prices for energy resources then the economic situation will begin to improve. Yet nobody but we alone can put things in order in our home. Of course, it was impossible to answer all the viewer's questions during a one-hour cast. Besides, many questions required special references to be answered. Therefore, it was resolved that all the questions that were phoned in during the cast, should be handed to the parliamentary speaker who will answer them in full detail.
