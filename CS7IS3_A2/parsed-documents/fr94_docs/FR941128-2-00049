FR941128-2-00049 FR941128-2-00039 FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION Public Information Collection Requirements Submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for Review November 16, 1994. The Federal Communications Commission has submitted the following information collection requirements to OMB for review and clearance under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507). Copies of these submissions may be purchased from the Commission's copy contractor, International Transcription Service, Inc., 2100 M Street, NW., Suite 140, Washington, DC 20037, (202) 857&hyph;3800. For further information on these submissions contact Judy Boley, Federal Communications Commission, (202) 418&hyph;0214. Persons wishing to comment on these information collections should contact Timothy Fain, Office of Management and Budget, Room 10214 NEOB, Washington, DC 20503, (202) 395&hyph;3561. OMB Number: 3060&hyph;0029. Title: Application for TV Broadcast Station License. Form Number: FCC Form 302&hyph;TV. Action: Revision of a currently approved collection. Respondents: Non-profit institutions, and businesses or other for-profit (including small businesses). Frequency of Response: On occasion reporting requirement. Estimated Annual Burden: 54 responses, 20.25 hours average burden per response, 1,094 hours total annual burden. Needs and Uses: On 7/16/92, the OMB approved for use a new FCC Form 302&hyph;FM (3060&hyph;0506) to be used by licensees and permittees to apply for a new or modified FM license. The FCC Form 302&hyph;FM was created through the Total Quality Management (TQM) process. At the time of approval, the current FCC 302 was to be used only for the AM and TV services. At this time, the Commission is separating the AM and TV services into separate forms. The FCC Form 302&hyph;TV will use the current OMB control number (3060&hyph;0029). Licensees and permittees of TV broadcast stations are required to file FCC Form 302&hyph;TV to obtain a new or modified station license, and/or to notify the Commission of certain changes in the licensed facilities of these stations. The data is used by FCC staff to confirm that the station has been built to terms specified in the outstanding construction permit, and to update FCC station files. Data is then extracted from the FCC Form 302&hyph;TV for inclusion in the subsequent license to operate the station. The FCC Form 302&hyph;AM will be submitted to OMB as a new collection and will require a new OMB control number. OMB Number: 3060&hyph;0484. Title: Amendment of Part 63 of the Commission's Rules to Provide for Notification by Common Carriers of Service Disruptions (Section 63.100). Action: Revision of a currently approved collection. Respondents: Businesses or other for-profit. Frequency of Response: On occasion reporting requirement and Other: Initial report due 120 minutes or three days after incident depending on the number of potentially affected customers and type of disruption. Final report due 30 days after initial report. Estimated Annual Burden: 208 responses; 5 hours average burden per response; hours total annual burden. Needs and Uses: Section 63.100 previously required that ``any local exchange or interexchange common carrier that operates transmission or switching facilities and provides access service or interstate or international telecommunications service that experiences an outage which potentially affects 50,000 or more of its customers on any facilities which it owns or operates must notify the Commission if such service outage continues for 30 or more minutes. Satellite carriers and cellular carriers were exempt from this reporting requirement.'' An initial and a final report is required for each outage. In addition to those changes made in Section 63.100 in the Memorandum Opinion and Order (MO&O) and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) adopted by the Commission on 11/5/93, pursuant to the present Order and previously approved by OMB, the amendments to this rule requires carriers to report 911 outages when more than 25% of the lines serving a PSAP are affected; to indicate, when specifying the types of services affected by any reportable outage and 911 is one of those services, whether more than 25% of the lines to any PSAP were disrupted; to provide 911 managers, when more than 25% of the lines to a 911 PSAP are affected, with any available information that will help those managers mitigate the effects of the outage on 911 callers; and to report all fire-related incidents affecting 1,000 or more lines. In the NPRM, it was proposed that carriers report fire-related incidents affecting 100 or more lines, 911 outages were to be reported under different criteria, carriers were not specifically asked to include information as to the percentage of affected lines serving a PSAP in their reports (though ``all available information'' was required), the carriers were not asked to give PSAP management available information that would help mitigate the affects of an outage. See Appendix A for the rules and requirements. These changes will eliminate confusion in the proposed 911 reporting requirements that resulted in unnecessary and even false 911 outage reports, eliminate unnecessary reports of small unavoidable fires not related to any carrier activity, provide the Commission with information as to the severity of the 911 effects of large outages that are reported under numerical thresholds rather than as special facilities outages. As a whole, the amendments to Section 63.100 will enable the Commission to become aware of significant outages at the earliest possible time so that we may monitor developments; to serve as a source of information for the public; to encourage and, where appropriate, to assist in dissemination of information to those affected; to take immediate steps, as needed, and after analyzing the information submitted, to determine what, if any, other action is required. After extensive study, the additional reporting requirements will increase the monitoring capacity of the FCC to include all tandems that form the major interexchange carrier networks and 41% of the total access lines of the twelve major local exchange carriers. In addition, the reporting of outages affecting ``special'' facilities will add another 9.5 million lines to the FCC's monitoring capacity. This will allow the FCC to monitor through the required reports outages affecting approximately half of the total access lines of the twelve major local exchange carriers, almost a tripling of present coverage. With the additional coverage, the FCC will be able to perform the functions mentioned above far more efficiently. The reports for fire-related incidents will allow the Commission to monitor the efficiency of network fire prevention and control systems in the absence of major fire-caused outages. This is necessary because fire-caused outages are especially rare but especially extensive. The extent and gravity of outages over the last few years shows the depth of the need for FCC monitoring of outages to maintain a reliable telecommunications network.
