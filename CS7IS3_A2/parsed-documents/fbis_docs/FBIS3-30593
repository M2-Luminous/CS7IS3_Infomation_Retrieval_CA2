Regarding some criticism and various interpretations of Slovenia's participation in the Partnership for Peace plan, Peterle said that they were a result of lack of understanding of the matter. He emphasized that this plan envisages several groups of countries and corresponding procedures for their incorporation. A special procedure is envisaged for the former Warsaw Pact members, while a different procedure is envisaged for some other countries, among which is also Slovenia. Minister Peterle said that Slovenia is still waiting for the official reply of the NATO consultation council regarding the request to be included in the Partnership for Peace plan. The headquarters in Brussels have indicated that Slovenia's membership in the consultation council will only be possible when our country will sign the agreement on associate membership in the European Union, Lojze Peterle said.
