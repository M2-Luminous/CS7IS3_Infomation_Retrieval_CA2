Under his command, fighters and militiamen protected with their own bodies the great dam of the Chongjiang He hydropower plant in Zhongdian against the snow, rescued more than 100 teachers and pupils of the Sanba Primary School in Weixi County who were trapped by flooding, and made arrangements for pupils to continue their studies.
