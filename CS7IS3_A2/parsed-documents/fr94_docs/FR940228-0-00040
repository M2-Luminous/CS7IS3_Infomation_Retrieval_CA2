FR940228-0-00040 FR940228-0-00007 The comment period for the proposed rules closed on June 17, 1991. Only one letter 5 was received in response to the proposed rule changes. The commenter supported the 60-day buy-in time frame for mortgage-backed securities in a fail to receive status but opposed the proposed rule for customer sell orders. However, the commenter suggested modifications to the time frame for buy-ins of customer sell orders if Treasury decided to adopt such a rule. 5 Letter from Peter J. Murray, Chairman, Government Securities Operations Committee, Public Securities Association (PSA) and Laura E. LoCosa, Chairperson, Mortgage-Backed Securities Operations Committee, PSA, to Kenneth Papaj, Director, Government Securities Regulations Staff, Bureau of the Public Debt, Department of the Treasury, dated June 17, 1991 (hereinafter ``June 17, 1991 PSA Letter''). Treasury did not issue these rules in final form prior to the expiration of its rulemaking authority on October 1, 1991. Treasury's authority under the GSA was permanently reauthorized on December 17, 1993, hence the long delay in finalizing these rules. II. Section-by-Section Analysis of Proposed Changes A. Buy-Ins for Fails To Receive The Department is now adopting without significant change amendments to paragraphs 403.1, 403.4(g) and 403.5(c)(1)(iii) that were proposed in April 1991. These provisions would require all government securities brokers and dealers that are required to register or file notice pursuant to 15C(a)(1) of the Exchange Act to take prompt steps to obtain possession or control of mortgage-backed securities that are in a fail to receive status for more than 60 calendar days through a buy-in procedure or otherwise. 6 The Public Securities Association (PSA), which was the only commenter on the proposed rules, supported the 60 calendar day time frame for buy-ins of mortgage-backed securities, stating that ``*␣*␣* the proposal is a reasonable approach.'' 7 This time frame reflects the recommendations made in July 1989 by an industry-wide task force established by the PSA. 8 6 The term mortgage-backed securities includes only those mortgage-backed securities that are included in the definition of ``government securities'' as set out in section 3(a)(42) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(42)). 7 June 17, 1991 PSA Letter, supra note 5, at 2. 8 Letter from Marianna Maffucci, Vice President and Assistant General Counsel, Public Securities Association, to Kenneth Papaj, Director, Government Securities Regulations Staff, Bureau of the Public Debt, Department of the Treasury, and Michael Macchiaroli, Assistant Director, Division of Market Regulation, Securities and Exchange Commission, dated July 10, 1989. As discussed in more detail in the preamble to the proposed rules, the Department is adopting a longer buy-in time frame for fails to receive for mortgage-backed securities than the 30-calendar day time frame in place for other government securities. This longer time period is appropriate given the normally longer settlement cycle for mortgage-backed securities (which is often as long as 30 days), 9 the complexities of these instruments and the scarcity in the market of specified pools. To avoid abnormal settlements, 10 the Department reiterates that any buy-in accomplished pursuant to these rules would be allowed to settle on the next regularly scheduled settlement date for that particular class or pool of mortgage-backed securities. 9 The PSA has developed a system to standardize the settlement process for mortgage-backed securities. See Public Securities Association, ``Uniform Practices for the Clearance and Settlement of Mortgage-Backed Securities and Other Related Securities'' at 15&hyph;1 (1988). This system has proven successful in alleviating operational workloads during the heaviest settlement periods, which has contributed to a reduction in the high fail rates for mortgage-backed securities. 10 A settlement date other than the regularly scheduled settlement date can be requested, however, the buyer pays a premium for this abnormal settlement. The Department understands that the PSA will implement buy-in procedures for mortgage-backed securities similar to those in place for other government securities. We believe that reliance on procedures that are already familiar to the broker-dealers should facilitate the implementation of this rule and view efforts to standardize the operational procedures as a positive step. B. Buy-Ins for Customer Sell Orders The Department's proposed rules included a requirement to buy-in customer sell orders (other than a short sale) in cases where the government securities broker or dealer had not obtained the securities from the customer within ten business days after the settlement date. For registered government securities brokers and dealers the Department was proposing to add paragraph 403.4(l) which incorporated by reference paragraph (m) of SEC Rule 15c3&hyph;3 (17 CFR 240.15c3&hyph;3(m)), with one modification pertaining to the definition of a short sale. 11 This rule has been suspended by the SEC with respect to exempted securities since 1973, including government securities. 12 A companion buy-in rule for customer sell orders that would apply to financial institutions that are required to file notice as government securities brokers and dealers was also proposed in April 1991 by adding new paragraph 403.5(g) to the GSA regulations. 11 The proposed rule also included an amendment to section 403.1 which would make paragraph 403.4(l) apply to registered brokers and dealers that were required to file notice as government securities brokers and dealers with the SEC. 12 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 10093 (April 10, 1973), 38 FR 12103 (May 9, 1973).
