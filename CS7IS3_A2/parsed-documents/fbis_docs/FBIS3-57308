This trip, which is regarded here as an important event in rapidly progressing Chinese-Russian relations, is being made in line with the accords reached during Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin's visit to the PRC in December 1992. The head of Russia's foreign policy department will hold talks with his Chinese counterpartue Qian Qichen and will meet with Jiang Z emin, president of the PRC and general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, and with Li Peng, premier of the PRC State Council. One of the main topics to be discussed by the sides is the preparation of the second top-level Russian-Chinese meeting, this time in Moscow. The sides will examine regional and international problems of interest to Russia and China as permanent members of the UN Security Council. It is believed here that the situation in Northeast Asia, where the nuclear problem of the Korean Peninsula is most acute, also will not be overlooked. Key aspects of bilateral relations -- trade-economic and military-technical cooperation and border questions -- will be touched on during the talks between Andrey Kozyrev and Qian Qichen, which are being held within the framework of regular consultations between the two countries' Foreign Ministries. The talks are expected to result in the signing of an intergovernmental agreement on crossing points on the Russian-Chinese border and also a protocol on consultations between the Russian Federation and PRC Foreign Ministries. The Russian minister will address Chinese political experts at the Institute of People's Diplomacy in Beijing and will visit the Shenzhen special economic zone in the south of the country, which is an experimental base in implementing reform and a policy of openness. He will also visit the ancient capital of the Middle State -- the city of Xian, the cradle of Chinese civilization.
