Lieutenant General Ehud Baraq, the chief of staff, has recently stated in a cabinet meeting that a delay in the IDF withdrawal from the Strip is liable to provoke radical elements, who realize they have nothing to lose, to carry out terrorist attacks against IDF targets. A senior officer said yesterday: "On the one hand, we must start cooperating with the Palestinian police, and on the other, to pursue antiterror activities." The chief of staff and the Central Command commander have instructed IDF commanders to pursue their ordinary operational activities. And indeed, a long series of operational activities was carried out during the past week, including the capture of Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] and Islamic Jihad fugitives, searches of Palestinian homes, patrols, and ambushes.
