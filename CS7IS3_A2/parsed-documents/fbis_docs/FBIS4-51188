Zheng Silin, of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation (MOFTEC), said China's infrastructure and financial resources simply could not sustain the rapid economic growth of the past two years. The economy grew 13.4 percent last year and 13.2 percent in 1992. In a meeting with the Chinese Manufacturers' Association, Mr Zheng said the double-digit growth had resulted in a severe shortage of raw materials and funds in the country and had spawned high inflation. But he said the macro-economic adjustment package implemented in the second half of last year had proved effective in reining in growth, adding that there were signs that the economy and booming property prices had been slowing down since March. Figures released by the State Planning Commission last week showed that the economy grew 12.7 percent in the first four months down from 13.9 percent a year ago. Based on these figures, the commission predicted economic growth in the first half of the year would be 12 percent. Extrapolating on this, the economy should grow by no more than eight per cent for the rest of the year if China wanted to keep annual economic growth to less than 10 percent this year. Mr Zheng also said yesterday the next stage of China's economic expansion would be hampered if it failed to speed up growth in the inner regions, where energy and raw materials were concentrated. As a result, the central authorities were working out a stratgy to attract foreign capital to help develop the poorer region. As part of the strategy, China for the first time singled out the inner provinces to take part in the four-day trade and investment fair organised by MOFTEC, which ends in Hong Kong today.
