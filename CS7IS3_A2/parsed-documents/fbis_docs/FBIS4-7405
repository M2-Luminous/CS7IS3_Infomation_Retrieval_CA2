FBIS4-7405 "dreas083_d_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-083 Daily Report 22 Apr 1994 South Korea IAEA Studying Fuel Rod Inspection Proposal IAEA Studying Fuel Rod Inspection Proposal SK2204012594 Seoul YONHAP in English 0113 GMT 22 Apr 94 SK2204012594 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, April 22 (YONHAP) -- The International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] was studying Friday the meaning of North Korea's request for IAEA inspectors to be "present" when nuclear fuel rods are changed at its five-megawatt reactor. The IAEA specifically wants to find out whether "presence" means simple "observation" or activity that would allow the collection of samples, a senior South Korean Government official said. The IAEA will not accept the North Korean proposal if it just involves observation or limited participation. In their negotiations in Vienna, the IAEA is demanding that its inspectors be allowed to collect samples of the waste material produced during the changing of nuclear fuel rods, the official said. If the IAEA could collect samples of such waste material, it would be able to estimate how much plutonium North Korea had extracted since the five-megawatt reactor went into operation in 1986. "The IAEA is in contact with North Korea in order to find out the exact definition of the word 'presence' of IAEA inspectors," the official said, adding that the nuclear watchdog is expected to make a decision soon on Pyongyang's proposal after analyzing its political and technical intentions. North Korea has not made its position clear on additional IAEA inspections of its nuclear facilities, requested by the U.N. Security Council president's statement. The official also denied press reports that North Korea had offered conditions to the United States on further IAEA checks.
