The organizations say although Zimbabwe has surplus food in reserve, the country's southern areas were running desperately short. The provincial administrator for Zimbabwe's southern Masvingo Province, Mr. Alphonse Chikurira, said some districts had never recovered fully from the devastating drought. Mr. Chikurira said 20 percent of the 2,100,000 people in Zimbabwe's Masvimgo Province had registered for drought relief this year, compared with about 80 percent during the 1992 drought. Officials estimated that about $18.5 million would be required this year to buy food for the needy in Masvingo, southwestern Matabeleland, and eastern Manicaland Provinces.
