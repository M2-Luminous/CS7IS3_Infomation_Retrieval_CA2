Gelbard, accompanied by a group, paid a courtesy call this morning on Deputy Prime Minister Amnuai Wirawan. The deputy prime minister noted the longstanding good relations between Thailand and the United States, especially their cooperation and mutual understanding in narcotics suppression. The Thai Government has paid special attention to this problem, and has been trying to get cooperation from its neighbors Burma, Laos, and China to wipe out production sources. Gelbard said that there is a trend of drug addiction becoming a more complicated and more serious problem as technology continues to advance. There is also growing consumer demand. He thanked the Thai Government for its consistent cooperation with the U.S. Government in fighting against narcotics.
