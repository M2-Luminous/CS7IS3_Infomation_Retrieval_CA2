It is necessary to provide the background information before giving an update on a situation that has become incandescent. At the end of December, the Italian Government, at the initiative of Minister Colombo, decided to denounce the agreement under which our country belongs to the EMBL by protesting about the disproportion between our financial contribution (16 percent) and the number of Italian researchers present in Heidelberg (1 percent). According to the statute a member country must give a year's notice of its intention to leave. Therefore, if there are no new developments, Italy will leave this research organization in January 1995. Prof. Alfonso Maria Liquori, a biochemist, reminded us on these same pages (23 January 1994) of the historical roots of the Heidelberg laboratory, the benefits that Italian molecular biology had gained from it, and the damage that would result if Italy should leave. Prof. Riccardo Cortese and other scientists who have sent letters of protest to Minister Colombo are of the same opinion. "Italy's withdrawal from the EMBL would damage both the European scientific community and that of Italy, and in particular it would reduce the opportunities for exchanges to be made between young Italian researchers and their European colleagues." Intolerable Situation A large part of the biological community opposes these vehement requests and expresses appreciation of the action launched by Minister Colombo, stressing that this, rather than an irreversible abandonment of the Heidelberg laboratory, is the only way we can protest against a situation that has now become intolerable. ICGEB (International Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology) Director Prof. Arturo Falaschi in Trieste is a supporter of this position. "The EMBL," explains Falaschi, "conducts basic research into molecular biology and in particular it deals with the study of viruses, the cell cycle, the structure of proteins and the genome. The spin-offs from this research can be considerable for the vaccine and pharmaceutical industry in general, and for agriculture and food production." "The importance of this laboratory for Italy, where nothing exists of a comparable size, is not in question," he stressed. "What appears to be unacceptable is the continued tolerance of the disadvantageous conditions under which Italy is participating." Falaschi shows some tables in which the figures speak for themselves. In the past few years, out of a total of about 300 researchers there have been less than 10 Italians, while there have been about 100 Germans, 70 British, and 30 French. Nevertheless, today Italy is the third supporter of the EMBL, after Germany and France, with a contribution of about 10 million German marks [DM]. Small Nuclei "I would be the first person to be sorry if Italy were to leave the EMBL," confirms Minister Colombo. "Last fall, when the president and the managing director of the EMBL visited Italy, I expressed unease about the fact that our country, despite its contribution of DM9.7 million, was below the quota both as far as personnel and scholarships were concerned; and because it had not even acquired, like the other major contributors, an outstation, that is an important EMBL-affiliated center, in its own territory. Therefore, we agreed that our proposal to set up about 10 small EMBL research nuclei in Italy, at the same number of universities, instead of a single outstation, would have been discussed at the next council meeting. The council has reduced the offer to just four nuclei. This has led to our protest action." The denouncement of the agreement, Colombo persists in stressing, has a double function; that of making us stronger in the negotiations that we will face to obtain more dignified conditions for our country; and that of requesting clarification from our researchers, because if the number of our people at Heidelberg is small this also depends on internal reasons. "I hope," concludes Colombo, "that I will soon be able to announce a favorable solution to the crisis."
