He said the message was conveyed to him during a courtesy call by US Ambassador David Lambertson. The ambassador met him to discuss developments in Thailand's efforts to solve the problem, particularly as it affected children, women and work safety. The labour issue was used by the US as a trade barrier, Mr Phaithun said. He said the Thai Government had brought clauses on child labour up to international standards with the banning of any child under 13 from the work force. The law also specified the type of work children could or could not do, he said. Many revolutionary decrees were lifted and the state enterprise labour law was amended to allow state employees to set up unions, he said.
