The EAGA is an original project initiated by the Philippines and vigorously pursued by President Ramos during his state visits to Indonesia and Malaysia, two members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which have expressed keen interest, along with Brunei. The president signed a memorandum circular which set in motion the policy of increased cooperation among the participating countries in trade, investments, telecommunications, and tourism. Executive Secretary Teofisto Guingona Jr. said that with this circular's issuance, senior economic officials of the four countries can now proceed with the signing of a memorandum of understanding to formalize EAGA establishment and define their participation in the project. In the memorandum circular, President Ramos ordered the Departments of Foreign Affairs [DFA]; Trade and Industry; Transportation and Communications [DOTC]; Tourism; Agriculture and Environment and Natural Resources; National Economic and Development Authority; Coordinating Council for Philippine Assistance Program; and other concerned agencies to identify strategies and initiate programs to promote EAGA. The DFA was directed to set specific guidelines for the exchange of delegations and visits between government agencies and local government delegations with their counterparts in the EAGA; coordinate with Congress for the formulation of guidelines in the exchange of parliamentary delegations; coordinate activities related to Philippine participation in the EAGA, particularly those with diplomatic implications. On the other hand, the DOTC was ordered to, among others, initiate a meeting of civil aviation and airline officials of the four participating countries to draw up the basic terms of reference for the proposed Borneo, Mindanao, Sulawesi transnational air service system; initiate a meeting of shipping and port officials of the four countries to study the feasibility of establishing regular passenger and cargo shipping services in the EAGA.
