Gen. Daniel Garcia, and as such the national Army is concerned with providing for the country the guarantees and institutional tranquility that will truly support the normal development of the elections that are to take place in a few months. This is a cause for concern for us, he noted, because we want to make it clear that the Army's support is a guarantee that the elections will take place in total and absolute calm. He stated that in this way the handing over of power will take place without mishaps. Chain of Command Reestablished Lt. Gen. Garcia imposed a new kind of clarity in the handling of the institution from the very first moment he took control. He redefined the officers' internal relations due to their tendency to deliberate. Garcia said that perhaps that attitude still existed because some "nostalgic officers continued to think as they did during the past military process." In an exclusive interview with LA MANANA, Garcia discussed various social and political topics and the country's foreign relations. Absolute Calm in the Armed Forces The economic situation affecting the country, as well as an Armed Forces internal reorganization imposed by the executive branch, has affected all the components in one way or another. The general said that there is absolute calm regarding this rather acute situation. Regarding the common characterization of the Armed Forces as "a family," Garcia said that the definition was an oversimplification, and had be analyzed from two different levels. The definition of a military family is too all-encompassing, and people might think it includes the "retired" personnel. The issue is much more complex and serious if we include them in the definition. The Army commander in chief is responsible exclusively for those "on duty," Garcia said. "We certainly have economic needs, just as any other group in the country, but we are optimists. We think the situation of the country will improve, Army needs will be met, and our situation compared to the rest of society will improve," Garcia said. Armed Forces Reorganization Regarding what has been called the new Army structure, Garcia said: I personally think the term is too explosive. People might think the reorganization implies a total destruction of present structures in order to create new ones." [no beginning quotation marks as published] "I say our work is to adapt, `update' [preceding word in Italian] present Army structures to adapt it to new conditions. We must try to make it more functional and efficient. We must make it more responsive to the new cultural, technological, scientific, political, and social development of the world, the region, and the country. This has prompted us to propose and implement a series of gradual changes day after day. We have tried to reach conclusions on the elements we must change in order to make the institution more efficient at a time of responding to the demands of the new times in which we are living." Armed Forces Position Same as Government's The Army in particular, as well as the other two armed branches, have participated in regional and world conferences to analyze changes in the new world political geography. Some of these changes reflect the intentions of some of the large world powers to participate in combined operations to repress drugs and terrorism. Some of these changes also imply dropping the "traditional Army" concept, which in Latin America stems from colonial times. Garcia was very clear about this problem. He said that the issue of collective forces, even within Mercosur [Common Market of the South], has been discussed in international forums. "Our country's policy has been very clearly established by the president," Garcia noted. [passage omitted] "We have maintained the traditional Uruguayan position of not participating in or encouraging the creation of inter-American forces. That is a national foreign policy position. We think this is not really what all countries want at this time, particularly because of our regional resources' degree of development," Garcia said. Fight Against Drugs and Terrorism We think police forces should be responsible for fighting drugs and terrorism. This is in accordance with our countries' internal order. We believe that to commit the Armed Forces as institutions to fighting these kinds of activities, before the bodies specifically created by the states for these functions are overwhelmed, is hasty and inappropriate for the development of the specific responsibilities that have been assigned to the armies. We maintain, however, a careful watch on those types of activities, in the sense that we continue to study the information available on those areas, and continue to plan for possible Army participation in the task, in the given case that the national government decides that we should intervene. Increased Armed Forces Participation in UN Peace Missions Regarding our Armed Forces's future participation in UN-sponsored peacekeeping missions and the Armed Forces institutional responsibility to ensure the continuation of scientific research in the Antarctic, Gen. Garcia said our institutional participation is increasingly active and direct. "These Armed Forces activities are part of our country's foreign policy. This small country is very dependent on world peace and order to guarantee its own peace. We think that our contribution to the United Nations for maintaining peace in other areas of the world contributes to preserving our internal order, and benefits us in our desire to prosper in peace," Garcia said. [passage omitted] Armed Forces Will Respect Election Results Regarding the possibility of unexpected electoral results, Gen. Garcia clearly erased any doubts with respect to the Armed Forces' position: He categorically ruled out any position different from that which is established in the Constitution and the law. "At present I do not see any reason to think that the Army will do anything else but strictly abide by the Constitution and the law," Garcia stressed. In accordance with this strong affirmation, Garcia said that the Armed Forces, and particularly the Army, is absolutely calm, even though the present economic situation affects all social groups and the Armed Forces must be completely dedicated and cannot maintain other sources of income.
