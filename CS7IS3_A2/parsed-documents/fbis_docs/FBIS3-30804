"The extremist Muslim leadership must understand that Bosnia has been divided and that it would take a great war to reunify the disunited Bosnia-Herzegovina," Krajisnik told Politika TV this evening. He added that the cochairmen of the conference on Bosnia-Herzegovina have been clearly told that the Serb side will accept only "the results already achieved at the conference." This means, Krajisnik said, acknowledging the fact that "there already are three states in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina and a revival of a quasi-state of Bosnia-Herzegovina cannot be advocated." Krajisnik said that "this means that in no way can we accept the plan, for that would mean returning to the Vance-Owen, which was flatly rejected by our assembly." Speaking on the demilitarization of Sarajevo, Krajisnik said he is convinced "solutions can be found which would satisfy Serb interests." "In that case we would not have anything against the demilitarization of Sarajevo and the establishment of a UN protectorate," Krajisnik said.
