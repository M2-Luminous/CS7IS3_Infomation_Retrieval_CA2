The unit staged report-back performances of military training such as enemy-subduing boxing, skill in using clubs, and unarmed combat to mark the anniversary. Established to meet contingency needs with maintaining social stability and protecting the people's peaceful labor as the guidelines, the unit has made positive contributions to Changsha's reform and opening up to the outside world. In July last year, Changsha's urban and rural areas were universally hit by floods and waterlogging. Over 1,000 dams, mountain embankments, and reservoirs were in danger and 1 million mu of paddy fields was submerged. Ordered by the Changsha Garrison Command, all militiamen of the unit pitched into the work, guarding dams, plugging breaches, and rushing to save the people's lives and property. They successively saved more than 30,000 people who were marooned by flood waters and over 700 tonnes of goods and materials. The unit has also played the role of a shock force. This year the unit has dispatched its members in more than 300,000 individual instances to take part in the construction of key development projects such as the Xiang Jiang 100-li flood control embankment and (Furong) Road, thus yielding impressive economic results. The unit has also repeatedly made contributions to maintaining social security. Yesterday, provincial and city party, government, and Army leaders [provincial Secretary] Wang Maolin, [provincial military district Commander] Pang Weiqiang, (Wu Xiangdong), Shen Ruiting, and Tang Zhixiang watched the unit's performances of military training and reviewed the unit.
