Red banners were ever so popular in the early 1960s. Those were the days when socialism was fashionable, the undivided Communist Party of India was the second largest party in Parliament, and the mighty Soviet Union was helping India set up massive public sector steel plants at Bhilai and Bokaro. Three decades and a plastic surgery on the eco-political face of the country later, market-driven capitalism has obliterated the socialist goals of yesteryears, the public sector faces phased privatisation and a lonely Left movement is looking for committed allies to help put it back on the political road. This is a time for soul-searching for the Left parties in India for they know that unless they unite and re-adapt to the changing times they will be left behind in the race for political control. "Contrary to what the popular media would like to believe, socialism is far from dead. It will survive. And nowhere is its future as bright as it is in the Third World, the most exploited part of human habitation," says the veteran CPI (Communist Party of India) leader, Mr M. Farooqui. "But to be effective, we need to be united," Mr Farooqui acknowledges. It is this realisation that has brought the two principal Left parties, the CPI and the CPM (Communist Party of India-Marxist) closer to each other. Only recently, the general secretaries of the two parties, Mr Indrajit Gupta and Mr Harkishen Singh Surjeet, issued a joint circular, calling for the setting up of inter-party coordination committees at the state level. For those who like to keep track of dates, it is significant that the friendly vibes between the two parties have come in a year that marks the 30th anniversary of the historic 1964 split in the Communist Party of India. It is no less significant that the CPI and the CPM have chosen Vijayawada as the venue of their forthcoming joint rally in Andhra Pradesh, the first in a very long time. It was in Vijayawada that the last party Congress of the undivided CPI was held way back in 1961. "We have recognised the vital importance of Left unity," says the CPM politburo member, Mr Prakash Karat, "and are doing our utmost to achieve it." The recent central committee meeting of the CPM in Calcutta devoted considerable time to a discussion on this issue. The meeting, at least informally, also discussed the possibilities of identifying allies with whom the party could have electoral adjustments. As a senior Left leader put it, "The unity of the Left and democratic forces is the only way to meet the threat from right-wing, communal and fascist parties." During the last few years, the Left has been holding on to the shirt tail of the National Front led by Mr V.P. Singh's Janata Dal. But now that the National Front has withered away and the Janata Dal is nothing but a shadow of its past, the Left has no option but to choose new partners for itself. On the face of it, many consider Mr Mulayam Singh Yadav's Samajwadi Party (SP) to be an ideal partner of the Left as Yadav not only calls himself a socialist but, had once even described his party as a "real Left party." Though he still has a lot of respect and goodwill for the Left, Mr Yadav is more than a bit miffed about the manner in which the Left Front "ditched" him during the recent assembly elections in U.P. [Uttar Pradesh] "If the Left had stood by us as we had expected it to do, we would have got an absolute majority in the House," Mr Yadav says. Mr Yadav has another reason to be cautious about any understanding with the Left. His comrade-in-arms, Mr Kanshi Ram of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), has been involved in a bitter war of words with Communist leaders over who really represents the poor and the downtrodden in the country. And Mr Yadav, can ill afford to antagonise Mr Kanshi Ram at this juncture. Fundamental differences between the mainline Communist parties like the CPI and the CPM on the one hand and the "Far Left" represented by groups like the Indian People's Front (IPF) have been stumbling blocks in the way of a broader Left unity. The radical Left has made its presence felt among the student community. "With our string of successes in university elections across the Hindi heartland, we are beginning to be noticed," says Mr Vinod Mishra, the firebrand Naxalite who came overground sometime ago to head the Liberation group of the CPI (Marxist-Leninist), a major constituent of the IPF. The campuses that were won over by the All India Students' Association (AISA), the students' wing of the IPF, include the Benaras Hindu University, -- for long a stronghold of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), a BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) affiliate. Apart from storming the "saffron bastion" of U.P., the AISA humbled the Students' Federation of India (SFI), a CPM affiliate, in the Jawaharlal Nehru University students' union elections. "There are persisting differences among the various Left groups but a functional unity is within our reach," feels Mr Mishra. After all, he says, the SFI and AISA activists cooperated with each other during the recent students' agitation in Bihar. For many Left watchers, the Communist movement in India can survive only if the Left parties change gears to keep pace with developments worldwide. Leaders like Mr Farooqui are already beginning to look at China and Vietnam as role models. Both these countries, he says, have pushed through economic reforms while maintaining a tight leash on the political structure of their countries. China, he points out, has opened up its economy but has taken care to protect its national interests by refusing to sign GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade). But, Left watchers point out that economic reforms is not the only aspect of "changing gears." They refer to the faint signs of a schism within the principal Left parties on the ticklish issue of internal democracy. The expulsion of Ms K.R. Gowri, a Communist to the core and a pioneer in evolving progressive agrarian reforms in Kerala, from the CPM for raising a voice of dissent, is seen by many as "counter-productive" to the party's interests. Mr Karat, however, disagrees. "The party is more important than any individual. The individual is what he or she is because of the party," he says. Left leaders, however, agree that a certain amount of flexibility is essential to bring about Left unity. Both Mr Farooqui and Mr Karat are unanimous in the view that a joint struggle against the economic policies of the government can be an effective first step in uniting "Left and democratic forces."
