This is the first visit by a foreign minister since the assumption of diplomatic relations between the two countries in 1958. Kinkel paid tribute to the economic opening up of the small Southeast Asian people's republic and promised the continuation of German development aid, as it also corresponds to the new Asia concept of German foreign policy. However, framework conditions for investments must be established by Laos itself. With an annual per-capita income of $210, Laos is one of the poorest countries in Asia. Since 1990, Germany has provided about 80 million German marks in development aid, particularly in the health sector.
