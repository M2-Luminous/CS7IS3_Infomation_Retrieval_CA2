It stipulates the speeding up of normalization in the areas that witnessed clashes between fighters from the two parties in north Iraq. The agreement also stipulates that the normalization process should be completed in three days. Barzani stressed the need to protect "our people's democratic experiment and unity and the Iraqi national opposition movement and its future." Talabani, who will head for Kurdistan accompanied by a number of the "National Congress," called for "maximum efforts to restore stability and security to our homeland." A high-ranking official in the Congress has said that "matters are normal and the agreement is complied with fully." He pointed out that units belonging to the Congress are deployed on the contact lines and at main facilities and security barriers in the area. Kurdish administration sources have stressed that calm has been restored in the area and that the administration has managed to contain all the violations that had taken place over the past two days. In the same context the Iraqi opposition official criticized "Iranian exaggerations" about the situation in Iraqi Kurdistan. And officials from the two main Kurdish parties, in statements to AL-HAYAH, accused Tehran of seeking to "foment sedition." They denied a report attributed by AFP to the official Iranian News Agency, namely that a "senior official" from the Kurdistan Democratic Party said that 2,800 people have been killed in the fighting in north Iraq.
