On developments in Russia, Chernomyrdin confirmed for the pope his government's intention to pursue reforms set in motion and, after outlining the Russian position on Bosnia of opposition to any international solution to hostilities based on the use of force, the prime minister said crisis conditions in ex-Yugoslavia must be managed "with peaceful methods." A brief communique issued by the Holy See at the end of the meeting, which ran to 50 minutes rather than the 30 minutes scheduled, said, "During the audience, the prime minister illustrated for the Holy Father the present situation of his government on major problems in national and international life." The pope, for his part, "expressed the wish Russia's material and spiritual progress with profound respect for the religious freedom of all believers." At the end of the talk, held in Russian, the pope and the prime minister exchanged gifts of papal medallions and rosaries and a painting of a Russian landscape. Though the atmosphere prevailing was described as "very cordial," Holy See observers noted that Chernomyrdin did not invite John Paul to Moscow and recalled that an invitation was not forthcoming from Russian President Boris Yeltsin during his meeting with the pope on December 20, 1991. The pontiff was, however, warmly invited to the Russian capital by the Soviet president of the time, Mikhail Gorbachev, who had two private audiences in the Vatican, in December 1989 and in November of the following year. Chernomyrdin also met here with Vatican Secretary of State Msgr Angelo Sodano and his foreign minister, Jean-Louis Tauran, for a talk in which the two sides "reviewed some bilateral problems between the Holy See and Russia and especially various aspects of life in the Catholic community residing there," said the communique released by the Vatican press office.
