During a brief stopover in Luanda yesterday, on his way back from Cote d'Ivoire, UN Special Representative Blondin Beye expressed, as ever, hope in the future of the Lusaka peace talks. After condemning the resumption by the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party, MPLA-PT, of the fighting in the Central Plateau region, Blondin Beye urged the international community not to allow the Angolan peace process to derail. Speaking to the MPLA-PT media, Blondin Beye said he had met a National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] team led by UNITA Secretary General Eugenio Manuvakola during his stay in Cote d'Ivoire. That UN official added he and the UNITA team had discussed the Angolan peace process. He also had talks with other international figures concerning the Angolan problem.
