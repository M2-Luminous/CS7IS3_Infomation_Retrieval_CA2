Though the traitor Kim Yong-sam has paid lip-service to "democratic politics" and "reformed politics" since he came to power, he, in actuality, has pursued more cruel repressive politics than the preceding military fascist dictators', the article says, and continues: The puppet beefed up the riot police by 17,000 men in his first days in power and then by nearly 40,000 men of hundreds of companies up to now. "Special detective teams" have been installed at police stations throughout South Korea and more than 1,500 "patrol cars 112" and other repressive equipment have been additionally deployed there. Now the notorious "National Security Law" remains unchanged and such repressive tools as "the Security Planning Board," "the secret affairs command" and "the police agency" have been further expanded and strengthened in South Korea. This proves that the traitor Kim Yong-sam is a truculent fascist dictator wearing the "civilian" mask. The fascist clique have defined the South Korean Federation of General Student Councils (Hanchongnyon), the successor to the National Council of Student Representatives (Chondaehyop), as "a pro-North organization" and "an organization benefiting the enemy." They made abortive by force the talks between students in the North and the South and the fourth pan-national rally in Seoul in June and August last year and, worse still, they arrested hundreds of students on the spot and jailed the chairman of Hanchongnyon and many other core elements of the student movement on the charge of violations of the "National Security Law." The fascist clique have also suppressed the struggle of the workers for vital rights and democratic freedom by invoking even "the emergency arbitration power," which the preceding dictators had not dared employ. When peasants and people of other strata and students demonstrated against agricultural market opening on February 1, the Kim Yong-sam group mobilized 130 companies of riot police more than 15,000 strong and let them fire multiple teargas canisters at the demonstrators, leaving many of them wounded, and walk off some 400 demonstrators. There is nothing to be expected from the Kim Yong-sam fascist regime. It is only too clear that with this regime left alone, it is impossible to meet the demand of the people for independence, ensure their democratic rights and achieve national reunification.
