They want ministers to consider a controversial scheme to allow all 25,000 registered drug addicts to receive heroin and other drugs free on the national service. They are also demanding a royal commission on drug control and an American-style national drugs task force to spearhead a new anti-drugs campaign. "We've won several battles but we've lost the war," Keith Hellawell, chairman of the chief constables' committee on drugs, said yesterday. "The current policy has not stopped young people turning to drugs. "It has not stopped the violence and other crime related to drugs. We need to win the hearts and minds of a generation and turn them around." Tony Blair, shadow home secretary and the favourite to become Labour party leader, last night supported the police initiative. "It is desperately important that the government recognises the scale and urgency of the drugs problem," he said. "It must put together a comprehensive programme which cuts demand as well as supply." Police alarm at the rising drugs menace follows new evidence that Britain is caught up in a drugs explosion. Chief constables say existing policy has failed to stop the emergence of a "drugs generation" made up of tens of thousands of youngsters who have turned to crime to meet their drugs bills. Hellawell will unveil fresh evidence of the crisis when he chairs the chief constables' drugs conference at Wakefield next week. "It's extremely serious. It's not just confined to the big cities. This affects every city and town in the country. It's right across society, it's right across our youth. I will guarantee your children have been offered drugs or at least know about drugs in their school. "Headmasters are keeping it under wraps. This is a cancer in our society that has to be excised. Otherwise I don't know where it will lead." Richard Browne, Britain's chief customs drugs investigator, told THE SUNDAY TIMES: "I can stem the flow. I can make it more difficult for them and restrict the amount that comes in. But we can't link arms around the coastline and stop it. It's a bottomless pit." Chief Superintendent Paul Cook, head of community affairs and drugs in Greater Manchester, admitted that police and Customs had failed to halt the drugs explosion. "The entire police effort over the last 25 years has had no discernible effect on the availability of drugs on the streets," he said. "I've talked to ministers until I'm blue in the bloody face. We have got to address this problem." A cabinet sub-committee set up last year under Tony Newton, leader of the Commons, is considering switching resources from policing to reducing drugs demand among the young. The review, due to report to John Major this summer, is likely to propose giving the police a greater role in educating the public about drugs. Police chiefs warn, however, that Britain is facing a drugs crisis matching the worst affected cities in the United States. Philip Thomas, West Midlands assistant chief constable and head of crime operations, said: "Drug dealers are protecting a trade which is causing more social disruption than anything else in our society." "There have been drug-related shootings in Liverpool, Manchester and eight in Birmingham in the last 12 months," says Thomas. Last year there were 31 drug-related murders and attempted murders in London alone. New research shows the black market in heroin, cocaine, cannabis and other illegal drugs is now worth £5 billion a year. Police, fearful of the "knock-on" effect on burglaries, car thefts, credit card fraud and street robberies, point to new figures showing that Britain has overtaken the United States in car crime, previously the record holder. Customs chiefs revealed last week that Britain is now the most lucrative market in the world for heroin and cocaine traffickers, giving international drugs syndicates a profits "premium" of more than 30 percent. Crack, the highly addictive cocaine derivative, is a growing source of concern. "We're seeing huge amounts being targeted at Britain and Europe," said Browne. Large quantities of pure cocaine are being shipped to "crack factories" in the inner cities including Tottenham, Stoke Newington and Brixton in London, Moss Side in Manchester and parts of Liverpool, Glasgow and Edinburgh. Manchester police estimates that the average heroin addict consumes nearly £30,000 worth of the drug each year, paying for their habit by street dealing, prostitution and theft.
