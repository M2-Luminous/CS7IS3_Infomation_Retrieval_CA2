SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On October 20, 1994, the President signed into law Pub. L. 103&hyph;382, the ``Improving America's Schools Act of 1994,'' amending the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA). Title I of the ESEA reauthorizes, for a five-year period, programs currently under Chapter 1 of Title I of the ESEA. Programs under Title I are designed to help disadvantaged children meet high academic standards and include programs operated by local educational agencies in high-poverty schools (Part A), Even Start family literacy programs (Part B), programs for migratory children (Part C), and prevention and intervention programs for children and youth who are neglected, delinquent, or at risk of dropping out (Part D). The Department intends to encourage broad State and local flexibility in implementing programs under Title I. In particular, the Department intends to issue regulations only where absolutely necessary_for example, where the statute requires a regulation or where a regulation would provide flexibility for States, school districts, and schools. The Department will also provide nonbinding guidance, including through a Policy Manual, respecting legal and policy issues under the Title I programs. This nonregulatory guidance can serve to inform parents, schools, school districts, States, and other affected parties of the flexibility that exists under the statute, including multiple approaches that may be available in carrying out the statute's requirements. The Assistant Secretary invites advice and recommendations from interested parties_including Federal, State, and local administrators, parents, teachers, and members of local boards of education_concerning issues on which regulations may be necessary or with respect to which nonregulatory guidance would be helpful to clarify statutory ambiguities and to provide for flexibility. Negotiated Rulemaking Section 1601 of Title I requires that, before publishing any proposed regulations to implement programs under Title I, the Assistant Secretary will establish a negotiated rulemaking process on issues involving a minimum of two key provisions in the statute_``schoolwide programs'' and ``standards and assessment.'' Therefore, the Assistant Secretary specifically invites comments on these two provisions, including whether and where regulations are necessary and nonregulatory guidance would be helpful. The appendix to this notice describes the two statutory provisions in greater detail and raises questions for consideration. Commenters should use this discussion to guide their thinking. The discussion, however, is not intended to restrict the issues that commenters may address. The Assistant Secretary will select individuals to participate in the negotiated rulemaking sessions to be held in Washington, DC from among the individuals or groups providing advice and recommendations. The Secretary will publish a separate notice in the Federal Register providing details about the negotiated rulemaking process. Invitation to Comment This request for comments is designed to elicit the views of interested parties, particularly Federal, State, and local administrators, parents, teachers, and members of local boards of education on regulatory issues under Title I. In addition to inviting specific comments on schoolwide programs and standards and assessment, the Assistant Secretary invites comments on other potential regulatory issues concerning provisions under Title I. Since the Department intends to minimize regulations and support flexibility, the Assistant Secretary also seeks recommendations concerning where guidance might be necessary. The Assistant Secretary requests that each commenter identify his or her role in education and the perspective from which he or she views the educational system_either as a representative of an association, agency, or school (public or private), or as an individual teacher, student, parent, or private citizen. The Assistant Secretary urges each commenter to be specific regarding his or her recommendations, including identifying the particular section of Title I pertinent to the comment.
