Raja Mohan: "Clinton Rakes Up Human Rights Issue"] [Text] Washington, Feb. 15--The U.S. President, Mr. Bill Clinton, reaffirmed on Monday the increasing alignment of his country's position with that of Pakistan on Kashmir, a development that could further set back relations with India. All American pretence of providing an even-handed approach to the problem now appears to have been dropped. It is possible that the Clinton Administration is stepping up its diplomatic activism on Kashmir to extract major concessions from India and Pakistan on the nuclear issue. The policy of linking nuclear non-proliferation in the subcontinent to the resolution of the Kashmir dispute is being fully backed by Pakistan. Declaring that promoting respect for human rights around the world was a "pillar" of U.S. foreign policy, Mr. Clinton declared that "we share Pakistan's concerns about human rights abuses in Kashmir." His remarks came while accepting the diplomatic credentials of the new Pakistani Ambassador to the United States, Ms. Maleeha Lodhi. Mr. Clinton made no effort to provide a balance by either referring to terrorism or territorial integrity of States in the region. All that he had to add on the subject was "we also oppose infringements of individual human rights as a result of extremism and fanaticism, whether of religious or secular nature, wherever it occurs." Plea to Clinton Ms. Lodhi made a strong plea for U.S. support on Kashmir, when she presented her credentials to Mr. Clinton. In a speech peppered with resounding references to the founding fathers of the United States, she called on Mr. Clinton to use his "good offices to put the issue of Kashmir on the front burner of world attention," so that there was a breakthrough in 1994 on the issue that "threatens regional stability and world peace." Declaring that the people of Kashmir were alone in the subcontinent in being denied "self-determination," she alleged that "half a million brutal occupation troops (were) making their life miserable," and that they "are denied the basic tenet of Jeffersonian democracy," the "pursuit of happiness." Praising Mr. Clinton for his policies on promotion of human rights and democracy, Ms. Lodhi asked him, "can we proselytise democracy around the world, and deny it in Kashmir? Can we reach human rights but only selectively apply it when convenient? Mr. President, morality selectively applied is by definition immoral. It is not worthy of the new global agenda to which both our nations strive." Ms. Lodhi thanked Mr. Clinton for bringing the issue of Kashmir before the United Nations last September, and said she was encouraged by the remarks of Ms. Robin Raphel, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for South Asian Affairs, who has called for the resolution of the Kashmir dispute "in a way consistent with the views and aspirations of the people of the valley." Dialogue Welcomed He looked forward to the occasion when he could "accept" the offer of the Prime Minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, to visit Pakistan, Mr. Clinton said. He had a "strong interest in reducing tensions in South Asia and especially encouraging productive relations between Pakistan and India." Welcoming the resumption of Indo-Pakistan dialogue, Mr. Clinton called the Foreign Secretary levels talks "an important step to address outstanding issues, including Kashmir and the control and elimination of weapons of mass destruction." Ms. Lodhi made a strong appeal to the United States "to seize its unipolar moment to implement the goals we share: peace, security and non-proliferation." Declaring that Pakistan shared U.S. goals on non-proliferation in South Asia, she called on Mr. Clinton to end the current "discrimination" against Pakistan, in the form of the Pressler Amendment. Expressing anguish that the Amendment targeted only one nation on the earth, Pakistan, she said the current U.S. law on non-proliferation "removes all incentives to India, which is the only nation in South Asia that has demonstrated a nuclear capability, to be forthcoming on the question of non-proliferation." Ms. Lodhi reiterated the readiness of the Government of Pakistan "to go any place, at any time, and talk to any one to advance the cause of a nuclear free South Asia." She urged Mr. Clinton "to act as a facilitator of a new initiative, a new dialogue on a regional solution to the problem of proliferation." `Eliminate Weapons' In his response, Mr. Clinton noted that India and Pakistan were engaged in programmes to acquire weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile delivery systems. "Continuing tensions between Pakistan and India, combined with these on-going programmes, creates the potential of a nuclear exchange with devastating consequences for the region and the world at large." He asked Ms. Lodhi to "work constructively with us to cap such weapons programmes, and then to reduce and eliminate weapons of mass destruction from South Asia." On purely direct bilateral relations, Ms. Lodhi made a strong sales pitch for the continuing "strategic relevance" of Pakistan to the United States. She declared that Pakistan was a model of "enlightened, progressive Islam for the entire world." As a nation of "moderation," Pakistan could provide a "nexus" between southwest Asia and the West Asian and the Central Asian republics. Mr. Clinton welcomed the economic reforms in Pakistan and expressed the hope that "Pakistan will enact and enforce tough laws to fight the drug trade more vigorously." The emerging consensus between the United States and Pakistan on Kashmir and the nuclear issue remains, however, to be consolidated.
