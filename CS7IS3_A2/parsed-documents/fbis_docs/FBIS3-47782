Both sides said Tokyo does not view as serious recent declines back below the 20 percent goal for foreign share of the Japanese microchip market, a level reached last year after high-profile talks that prompted criticism as managed trade. "We were disappointed," said a U.S. trade official, citing Japan's "lack of willingness to take the measures necessary" to prevent the microchip issue from reemerging as "a point of contention" before a bilateral summit on February 11. A Japanese Trade Ministry official said Tokyo rejected the call for new steps because, despite recent share declines, foreign access to the Japanese market has steadily expanded and efforts in the area were being rewarded. "You don't have to alternate between hope and despair over quarterly figures," the Japanese official told reporters, speaking on condition of anonymity. But the U.S. official told a separate briefing, also on condition his name not be used, that last year witnessed "a continuous decline for foreign market share." Noting that broad-based bilateral talks that aim at agreement before the meeting between U.S. President Bill Clinton and Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa include a review of existing accords, he said the microchip issue will likely be "another problem to be dealt with." But, touching on an area of strong Japanese objections, the U.S. official said the specific target-setting used in semiconductors "is not necessarily the right approach for all products or for all areas we have problems with." He also expressed hope that Wednesday's "emergency consultations," which Washington requested, will lead Japan to "take a more forthcoming and activist approach to the issue." No date was set for further semiconductor talks. The U.S. made no specific proposals but asked Tokyo to craft a plan to boost foreign microchip use in autos, telecommunications and video games, increase "design-in" opportunities and consider reviving some earlier steps, the U.S. official said. The U.S. reckons that the foreign share of Japan's microchip market fell to 18.1 percent in the quarter through September from 19.2 percent in the preceding three months and 19.6 percent in the first quarter of 1993. Japan, which includes in its calculations "captive" microchips sold by foreign makers to their subsidiaries in Japan, says the July-September figure was 19.7 percent, after 21.6 percent and 21.5 percent, respectively, in the previous two quarters.
