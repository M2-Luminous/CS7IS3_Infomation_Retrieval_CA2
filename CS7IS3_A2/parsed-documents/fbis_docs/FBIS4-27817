The wheat-price accord reached earlier Friday by the government and the ruling parties was the "utmost decision," Fujii said at a news conference after a morning cabinet meeting, Under the accord, the price the government pays to farmers for wheat will be frozen for the third consecutive year. Conditions for setting wheat prices are different from those for rice prices, Fujii said. "We must work to win the support of growers and the public" on rice prices, he added. The area under cultivation for wheat is on the decline and "simple calculations" based on supply and demand indicate a need for a price cut, he said. Strong opposition within the ruling coalition parties to a cut in the price paid to wheat growers resulted in the accord to freeze prices. The government's policy is to lower prices to narrow the gap between prices at home and abroad. Japan's government-set wheat prices are about five times world market levels. Fiscal 1994 government purchase prices for rice will be decided in early July. Asked about a reported threat by the national tax administration agency to withhold licenses to sell beer from leading supermarket chain Daiei Inc., Fujii said he knew nothing about it but would look into the matter. Agency officials reportedly told Daiei that its plans to reduce retail beer prices despite a recent beer tax hike are "making it difficult" for the agency to grant licenses to sell alcoholic beverages to new stores to be opened by Daiei. Fujii said price-setting is "basically free," but that beer is "one of the special products that involves various social problems such as underage drinking and alcoholism."
