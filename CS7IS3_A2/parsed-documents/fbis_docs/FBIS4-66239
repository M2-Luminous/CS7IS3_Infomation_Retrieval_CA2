Those that will have to feel adverse effects are investors in commercial buildings, medium and high-class residences, and developers of large tracts of land. New Tax System Good for Fair Competition After Mainland China promulgated its land added-value tax, it first caused a great stir among Hong Kong's real estate trade and later also evoked a strong reaction from mainland real estate dealers. It has already become a hot topic of discussion these days. We have to admit that for a long time past the tax burden on real estate dealers on the mainland had been exceptionally light, and the rate of investment returns [hui bao 0932 1032] had been very high, which was not at all consonant with the principles of fair competition. For instance, before promulgation of the real estate added-value tax, a foreign real estate company had to pay only a 3 percent commodity-house business tax and a 33 percent enterprise income tax. The tax burden was really rather light for the real estate trade. I made a very simple table giving a financial analysis of development plans, comparing the rate of after-tax investment returns under the old and under the new tax law. The computation indicates: Under the old tax system, the lowest consolidated tax rate was 37 percent and the highest 42 percent. The lower the amount of added-value, the higher the rate of consolidated tax, and the larger the amount of added value, the lower the rate of consolidated tax. This was highly unreasonable. The highest rate of after-tax investment returns could be, at its highest, 189 percent and at its lowest 29 percent, allowing indeed a very high rate of returns. Under the new tax system, the lowest rate of the consolidated tax is 53 percent and the highest 73.2 percent. The smaller the amount of added value, the lower the consolidated tax rate. The higher the amount of added value, the higher the consolidated tax rate. The rate of after-tax investment returns could, at its highest, reach 80.4 percent and at its lowest be only 23.45 percent. This did away with the unreasonable state of affairs under the old tax system, and is beneficial for fair competition, beneficial also for the rational disposition of adjusted social resources. Positive and Negative Effects of the Value-Added Tax Positive Effects of the Value-Added Tax 1. The land added-value tax has a certain significance and function in that it ensures orderliness in land and other real estate transactions in the market, in that it rationally regulates increment from land value gains, and in that it protects the interests of the state and promotes modernization projects. 2. The new tax has a positive effect in that it adjusts the structure of real estate investments by encouraging local and outsider real estate developers to invest more in low-profit residences and in renovations in old city districts, and in that it thereby promotes optimal structuring of real estate investments. That is so because the new tax law stipulates that all sales that show a profit of 20 percent or less of the cost are exempt from land added-value tax. 3. The new tax law is also most significant and effective in protecting actual large investments of real estate developers. It actively combats speculation in land and buildings, and other unscrupulous activities seeking sudden undeserved large profits. It has a restraining effect on the overheating of the real estate market, and it regulates the direction in which social funds should flow. It safeguards the capital needs in certain "bottleneck" sectors and in industry. Negative Effects of the Land Added-Value Tax Under the new tax system, the rates of China's consolidated tax on real estate are from 53.1 to 73.3 percent, which would be an exceptionally high rate among the countries of Southeast Asia. If land added-value tax would be levied throughout the nation, we are afraid, it would deal yet another blow to the mainland real estate market, which at the present time is adversely affected by macro-regulation and control and by a generally depressed market. Because real estate development is investment for comparatively long durations, real estate developers will normally place investments only if they can expect fairly high rates of returns. When real estate developers see that an excessively high tax will be levied, and the rate of returns will be reduced, they will most probably temporarily defer the project in question, or rather stop the intended project altogether, unless they can shift the tax burden onto the consumers. Moreover, in view of the imperfect state of the present legal system, "underground trading," which had formerly been involved in many real estate projects, may again raise its head, and many more real estate dealers will adopt irregular trading methods, such as writing out false invoices, and this would be felt as "unfair" by the majority of discipline-conscious and law-abiding real estate dealers. Furthermore, the second-hand real estate market will also be adversely affected. The second-hand real estate market is extremely important for the development of the entire real estate market. In China, the second-hand market is already much inconvenienced by procedural problems, and the problems would become even more serious by the effects of the added-value tax. In that case we figure that in future sellers will demand sundry expenses (such as fitting-out expenses) in addition to the house prices, as a means to evade tax. In sum, in areas and cities where investments have already shifted toward private residences and the renovation of old city districts the land added-value tax will in reality have no adverse impact, because low-profit houses are exempt from land added-value tax. Those who will really be affected are bound to be investors in large office buildings, in medium- and high-class residences, and developers of large tracts of land. However, this is precisely the initial purpose of promulgating the land added-value tax. According to latest reports, the land added-value tax has been designated a local tax. That means, the local authorities have the power, with the approval of the central finance and tax departments, to be flexible in the implementation and application. The Guangzhou Municipal Government will these days announce that it will permit the transfer of many-storied houses, an act which is extremely important for the invigoration of the second-hand market. On the whole, the land added-value tax will not seriously and adversely affect developments in the real estate trade, but will rather ensure that the Chinese real estate trade will enjoy for a certain period a sustained, stable, and healthy development, for which prospects are very good.
