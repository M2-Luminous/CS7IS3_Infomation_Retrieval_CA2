The quantity seized is double that seized -- 28,397 rounds -- during the period December 1988 to December 1993, according to the institution. The two most recent PGR operations took place between 28 May and 4 June, in which its personnel managed to seize more than 28,544 rounds of ammunition in several actions in the country. Both reports indicate that Nogales, Sonora, is where the PGR has arrested the most gunrunners. During the operations, which were conducted over the period of a week, PGR personnel managed to seize almost as many rounds of ammunition as were seized during the past 61 months of the current government administration. Statistics provided by the Deputy Attorney General's Office for Delegations and Inspection Units [Subprocuraduria de Delegaciones y Visitaduria] also show that during the current year, 537 weapons and approximately 800 vehicles were seized from alleged criminals; many of them linked to drug trafficking activities. The weapons seized have been detected at road checkpoints (precos), airports, and during investigations of drug trafficking groups. Regarding the entry of weapons and ammunition into the country, the PGR has reported that the corresponding investigations are under way to learn the origin and destination of the shipments, as well as the identity of the persons involved. In most cases, the PGR has not revealed the names of the alleged criminals so as not to hinder the investigations. PGR statistics establish that it has seized 60,156 rounds of ammunition during the period 1 January-5 June 1994. Up to a few days ago, the PGR had seized 31,712 cartridges. In its two most recent operations, however, the PGR seized 28,544 rounds, thus, increasing the amount to more than 60,000 live rounds. The largest amount of ammunition was seized during the week of 28 May, when 18,385 rounds were impounded and three persons were arrested during the two operations carried out in Jalisco and Tamaulipas. Later, the PGR seized a shipment of 9,400 rounds loaded on a van with California State license plates, at the 49-km marker on the Jalisco-Nogales international highway. PGR members also managed to impound a shipment of 7,676 rounds of various calibers and seven weapons last week. The shipment was being transported by Ramon Isordia Pedroza and Jose Zepeda Mora and was discovered at the 21-km checkpoint on the Hermosillo-Nogales international highway.
