FR941103-2-00064 FR941103-2-00031 Response: The statement that the Regional Office expense in 1995 included the Dolores Project is incorrect. The Regional Office expense category applies only to the initial CRSP units (i.e., Aspinall, Flaming Gorge, Glen Canyon, and Navajo), and not to the Dolores Project. Dolores Project costs are shown in their own, separate PF&hyph;3 budget document. Regional Office expenses shown in the initial units (CRSP) work plan differ from those included in the PRS because Western inadvertently used an unofficial version of Reclamation's PF&hyph;3. This document did not differ from the official budget in total costs for the CRSP initial units. An adjustment within the program was made, which increased the Regional Office expense by $564,000. This was made to balance to the FY 1995 Budget Submission funding amount. b. Comment. The O&M figures (for the Rio Grande Project) in the PRS appear to double count capitalized moveable equipment (CME) expenses for the years 1995, 1997, and 1998 . . . . Response: Western agrees with the comment and has rerun the RGP study to eliminate this error. c. Comment: For 1994, the difference in expenses between the Work Program and the PRS appears to be comprised of the $35,000 for CME less a $20,500 expense reduction, which is unex- plained. Response: Western's numbers were correct and have been used in the PRS. The commentor's table shows a difference of $28,885. There are four reasons for the difference: (1) O&M expenditures planned for FY 1993 on the Elephant Butte Dam of $67,548 (portion assigned to power = $67,548 X 20.8% = $14,050) were not spent in FY 1993, but were obligated and actually spent in 1994; (2) expenditures planned on the Elephant Butte Powerplant ($30,854, of which 100-percent is repayable by power revenues) were not spent in FY 1993, but were obligated and actually spent in FY 1994; (3) the $35,000 referred to as CME for FY 1994 is not CME, but miscellaneous tools which is charged off to O&M and is properly includable in the total O&M for the year; and (4) item number (2) was further complicated by the fact that both the Work Program and the FY 1995 Budget Congressional Submission are based on an incorrect version of the summarized report. A line item (which should be included in the Other Expense line) which appears on the detailed report was coded incorrectly so that it does not appear on the summarized reports, but is included in the totals of both reports. Thus, the totals are $40,000 higher in the Work Program than the total of the numbers shown and $23,921 higher than the total of the numbers shown in the FY 1995 Congressional Budget Submission. The $40,000 budgeted Other Expense item was later reduced to $23,921, which matches the $1,141,775 figure shown in the FY 1995 Congressional Budget Submission. Following is a table which recaps the above information starting with the figures shown in the commentor's table:
