FR940922-0-00030 FR940922-0-00014 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 50 CFR Part 285 [I.D. 091694B] Atlantic Tuna Fisheries; Bluefin Tuna AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Closure of the General category fishery. SUMMARY: NMFS has determined that the 33 metric tons (mt) set-aside for the late-season General category quota beginning September 15, will be taken by September 16, 1994. Therefore, the General category fishery will be closed effective at 1200 hours on Saturday, September 17, 1994, except that 8 mt will remain available for the New York Bight fishery beginning September 20, 1994. This action is being taken to prevent overharvest of the quota established for this fishery. EFFECTIVE DATE: 1200 hours on September 17, 1994, through December 31, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: John Kelly, 301&hyph;713&hyph;2347, or Raymond E. Baglin, 508&hyph;281&hyph;9140. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Regulations implemented under the authority of the Atlantic Tunas Convention Act (16 U.S.C. 971 et seq. ) governing the harvest of Atlantic bluefin tuna (ABT) by persons and vessels subject to U.S. jurisdiction are found at 50 CFR part 285. Section 285.22 subdivides the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas recommended U.S. quota among the various domestic fishing categories. Implementing regulations for the Atlantic Tuna Fisheries at 50 CFR 285.22(a) provide for an annual quota of 531 mt of large medium and giant ABT to be harvested from the Regulatory Area by vessels permitted in the General category. Of this amount, 65 mt are to be set aside for a late-season fishery beginning September 15. Based on landings statistics, the fishery was closed on August 15, 1994, with only 23 mt remaining for the late-season set-aside. A reallocation of 18 mt from the reserve increased the set-aside to 41 mt, of which 33 mt were allocated to General category fishermen from all areas to be fished from September 15 through September 17, and 8 mt were allocated to the New York Bight fishery to be fished from September 20 until the 8 mt are taken. Based on early landing reports, it has been determined that the late-season quota of ABT allocated for the General category will be exceeded by greater than 100 percent if the fishery remains open for the planned 3 days. However, given the need to provide sufficient notice to vessels already at sea, and out of equity and safety concerns for fishermen returning to port with legally-caught bluefin, it has been decided to effect the closure as of noon on Saturday. Fishing for, retention of, possessing, or landing large medium or giant ABT by vessels in the General category must cease by 1200 hours September 17, 1994. The intent of this action is to prevent overharvest of the quota to such an extent that subtractions of the overage would seriously and adversely impact the 1995 fishery for this category. This closure of the late-season General category fishery will not affect the 8 mt set-aside for the New York Bight or other categories fishing for ABT. As of this date, the Incidental, Angling, and Harpoon categories remain open, and the Purse Seine category is subject to individual quotas. Classification This action is taken under 50 CFR 285.20(b) and is exempt from review under E.O. 12866. Authority: 16 U.S.C. 971 et seq. Dated: September 16, 1994. Richard H. Schaefer, Director, Office of Fisheries Conservation and Management, National Marine Fisheries Service. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;23390 Filed 9&hyph;16&hyph;94; 4:05 pm] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;22&hyph;P
