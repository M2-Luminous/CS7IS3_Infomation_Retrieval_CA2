The minister is in Brussels for talks on strengthening ties between Estonia and the European Union. He said the two sides are going to sign an agreement on Estonia's associated membership in the European Union in autumn of this year. An agreement on free trade between them can come into force from January 1, 1995. The minister said Estonia's ultimate aim was full membership of the European Union. "We are ready, everything now depends on Brussels' decision," the minister said. ITAR-TASS learned from sources in the European Commission that the question about the further expansion of the European Union will be considered only in 1996. While in Belgium, the Estonian minister held talks with officials of the West European Union. According to Minister Luik, he was assured that the Baltic countries would soon be able to establish closer ties with the WEU policy.
