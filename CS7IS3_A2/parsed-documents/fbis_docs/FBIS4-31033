He will then have many reasons to savor his victory. First, because shortly before the first round of the elections this 62-year-old man miraculously survived a car accident, which has left him wearing a metal surgical collar. Second, because he has overcome the accusations about his controversial past when, as a young Communist, he formed part of the militia responsible for crushing the 1956 uprising. Indeed, for most Hungarians, this former Communist is still primarily a reformer who contributed to the collapse of the Soviet bloc by enabling East German refugees to reach the West via Hungary in 1989. [De Gerondo] How can your past as party leader be reconciled with your recent conversion to supporting free trade and the market economy? Will you continue the previous government's policy? [Horn] I find it difficult to understand how my past as a party man can interfere with my conversion to a supporter of a free market economy. On Sunday, in the parliamentary elections, the Hungarians overwhelmingly rejected the previous government. Logically, I find it difficult to see why I should continue that government's line. But, to the extent that your question relates to the Hungarian Socialist Party's intention of setting up a market economy, I say firmly that this is our intention. [De Gerondo] If you become prime minister, what will you do to draw a distinction between your role as party leader and that of government chief? In particular, will you be able to counterbalance the influence of the MSZOSZ (the powerful trade union federation led by Sandor Nagy), the legacy of the past and the basis of your electorate? [Horn] The functions of government chief and party leader are not incompatible. Moreover, there are many examples in Western Europe. I personally await the decision of the forthcoming Socialist Party congress. As regards the second part of your question, we have still not analyzed in detail the fundamental structures of our voters or their sympathies. My intention is to entrust this task to an opinion poll institute. Today, nobody in Hungary can answer this question. Everybody has the right to express his own views. However, I must add that I am well enough known for people to realize that I make my decisions alone. [De Gerondo] Will you continue the current privatization policy? In particular the return of land to its former owners and the payment of compensation? [Horn] We will not continue the privatizations in the same way. Compared with the policy pursued by the former government coalition, we want to prevent corruption. Privatization operations will be open and subject to the sovereignty of the deputies. The goal will be to protect jobs, and even to create them, and not to deliver Hungary to uncontrolled commercialism. To answer the second part of your question, it is natural that the legal provisions on compensation, which have already been adopted, should be respected and that compensation should be carried through without restrictions. Respect for the Opposition [De Gerondo] Following your victory on Sunday, will you take account of the opposition's proposals if they serve the country's interests? [Horn] Even in the past, I have always taken account of proposals or even ideas from other groups. Without discrimination. I will not depart from that line of conduct now. [De Gerondo] Hungary needs Western aid to rebuild its economy. Will you continue the policy of cooperation with the Western countries set up over the past four years, or will you adopt a different course? In particular, will you have different relations with the countries of the former Socialist bloc and with the countries which have emerged from the former USSR? [Horn] Hungary does not need Western aid to rebuild its economy. To modernize its infrastructure, this country must follow one political line: maintaining market relations with all the countries which have a mutual interest. The Hungarian Socialist Party's position is known: We will not question the bases of our foreign policy which is the result of a general consensus among the six parties represented in parliament. However, we cannot deny that the previous government made mistakes in relations with the East European countries. Geopolitically, and also because of historical circumstances, it is logical that we should give more weight to our relations with Eastern Europe. [De Gerondo] Will you give new impetus to the process of integrating Hungary in the European Union and NATO? [Horn] That would be a kind of "unrequited love." The integration process is now functioning by itself as a series of provisions which have been discussed and drawn up and which contain preconditions. In this respect, it is rather unlikely that a change of government will make big differences to the process started. [De Gerondo] You are also known as the Socialist monarch. You were a reformist Communist in the past, and now you are a Socialist. Are you really a democrat? [Horn] Over the past four years and especially in recent weeks, I have been given many titles. I have not heard the one you mention, or at least I do not remember it. I think that over the past few years, the Hungarian Socialist Party has asserted itself as a truly democratic movement, as a force of the Left which defends the interests of the majority of society. I am president of this party. But you probably know this comment by Heinrich Boell: "Any honest man has been a Communist at least once in his life."
