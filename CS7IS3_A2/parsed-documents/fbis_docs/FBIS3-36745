As the Foreign Ministry statement says, in the interview Kozyrev reported that Latvia is attempting to deport thousands of people to Russia, which he called ethnic cleansing. In this connection, the Latvian Foreign Ministry states that these claims are baseless. The Latvian Government, reacting to statements of this kind from Russian officials, has repeatedly pointed out that allegations of ethnic cleansing do not correspond to the truth, the document emphasizes. The Latvian Foreign Ministry believes that the attitude expressed by the Russian Foreign Ministry proves that senior Russian officials are blatantly ignoring the conclusions of international institutions at several levels regarding the real human rights situation in Latvia.
