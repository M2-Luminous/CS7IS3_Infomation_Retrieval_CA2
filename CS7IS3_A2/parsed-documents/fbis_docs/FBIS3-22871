Lavrushenko, including recorded remarks by A. Zhokin, deputy chief of GosAtomNadzor; from the "Vesti" newscast] [Text] Lavrushenko: The production of nuclear weapons still remains a very well-kept secret -- not only for the uninformed population, but also for the federal radiation safety control bodies. The All-Russia Conference of GosAtomNadzor [State Committee for Supervision of Nuclear and Radiation Safety] that was held in Novosibirsk stated this fact with alarm. Now the regions that produce nuclear weapons have the added problem of storing radioactive materials that have been taken out of service. It is proposed to set up one of the storage depots in Tomsk-7. Zhokin: It must, naturally, be stored in a dismantled state, and it must further be regenerated and processed once again in the place where it was produced. There are no other places; they do not exist. Lavrushenko: This is regarded as an unconvincing argument by the population of areas where bombs have been assembled for many years without the population's knowledge, and where -- on the basis of this argument -- unexploded bombs will now be stored again for many generations, even though the military and the Ministry of Atomic Energy are trying to win the Tomsk and Siberian residents' agreement by offering large sums of money. The explosion in Tomsk-7 last year was a much more convincing argument.
