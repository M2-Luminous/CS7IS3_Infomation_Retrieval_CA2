He told journalists at the Green Point sports stadium on Sunday [20 March] that he believed Mr Justice Goldstone had produced prima face evidence of a very serious nature. "Close to 20,000 people have been killed and a comparatively small number of people have been arrested and very few convicted. Therefore it is absolutely necessary that this prima face evidence forms the basis of an investigation by an international team. Until then I will not make any firm statement," he said. "We are investigating here the crimes committed by experts who know how to cover up," he said. "International experts with equal ability to uncover these crimes are needed to investigate the allegations. It is a pity (State) President de Klerk has been so dismissive of the findings of a judge of the appeal court, which has shown that we were right in calling for an international investigation." Mr Mandela started a one day rally tour of the Cape Peninsula by addressing children at a Lions Club of Camps Bay children's day at the stadium.
