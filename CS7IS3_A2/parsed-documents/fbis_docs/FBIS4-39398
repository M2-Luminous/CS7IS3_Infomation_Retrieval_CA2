Vyacheslav Marychev, a member of Zhirinovskiy's faction in the State Duma, proposed to discuss the issue of "banning the anti-popular fascist movement `Democratic Russia'" because, according to him, it is to blame for the current economic plight of the country. The "Democratic Russia" was the major movement which helped Boris Yeltsin come to power. The Duma rejected the proposal and Speaker Ivan Rybkin stressed that such a question is outside the powers of the lower chamber.
