"That is our objective, that's the U.N. objective to see that cessation negotiated," Perry told ABC's program "Good Morning America." U.S. F-16 fighter planes carried out air strikes against Serbian positions near the besieged Muslim enclave of Gorazde on Sunday [10 April] and Monday. "We have to wait for a day or two to see what the Serbs' next action is," he noted, "if they start the shelling again, it is very likely that the United Nations will call for more air strikes and NATO will deliver those air strikes." The United Nations has proclaimed that Gorazde is a safe haven and has put U.N. forces in there. If the Serbs begin shelling at Gorazde again, Perry stressed, "the U.N. can invoke close air support to protect the U.N. forces." Russia has denounced NATO air attacks against Bosnian Serbs and threatened to delay joining the NATO's partnership for peace. Perry said that "I think the timing of their joining is not so important as the fact of joining." He also said it is not necessary to consult with Russia on whether the U.N. should call for this strike because Russia agreed the U.N. resolution which allowed for the U.N. to call the strikes. "So the United Nations' responsibility at that point was simply to invoke the action when it happened," he said, "you cannot have consultation in the middle of a close air support operation." Asked what is the biggest national security problem for the United States, Perry said that "over the long term, the greatest problem, potential problem, is with Russia." "If the reform movement should fail in Russia," the secretary claimed, "this would be a great catastrophe not only for Russia but for the whole world and for the United States security."
