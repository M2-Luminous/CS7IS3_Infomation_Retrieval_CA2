This Has Been Urged by Vitaliy Churkin, the Russian Federation President's Special Envoy"] [Text] It seems that the latest negotiations by Kozyrev in Belgrade and Churkin in Pale were used by Milosevic and Karadzic in their purely egoistic interests. In this event it appears that U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who accused the Serbs of spinning a web of lies and deceptive statements about their intentions in Gorazde, is right. According to him, "the Serbs are lying to the United Nations and even to their traditional ally, Russia." This probably accounts for the sharpness of Vitaliy Churkin's statement. Incidentally, the West missed no chance of noting that the Serbs' tactics in Gorazde annoy the Russian leadership. This led to the conclusion that Moscow may not after all have so many levers to influence them. And even that relations between it and Belgrade are not as friendly as was thought earlier. In this context it is supposed that President Yeltsin, whose statement on the Bosnian crisis was expected yesterday, will take all this into account and start cooperating with the West more closely. It is unlikely, however, that the presidential statement will coincide in tone with Churkin's pronouncements. The latter, if facing far from easy explanations to the parliament, the unmistakably pro-Serbian mood of the majority of whose deputies is well known. Apparently Churkin will also have a dialogue with the military who up until now have had certain disagreements with the Foreign Ministry's position on a number of issues. It would be premature in these conditions to talk about a radical change of line in Russia's policy in the Balkans. It is clear, however, that it can be essentially adjusted, which does not bode any comfort to the "cheats" from the Serb leadership both in Pale and Belgrade. But in any event, it is hard to expect that on the question of a Balkan settlement Russia will resort to the children's formula, "the cat has left her kittens...." ["koshka brosila kotyat"]
