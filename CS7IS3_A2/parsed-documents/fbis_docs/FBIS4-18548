Good evening, Mr. Minister. Mr. Minister, in your opinion, how great is the chance that the Zulus will participate in these first really free elections in your country? [Botha] I think I must first of all clarify some very important points. The Zulu people are divided. According to our information, the African National Congress also has strong support among the Zulus. What is, of course, very, very important is that the king of the Zulus certainly has the support of the majority of the Zulus. But this is now causing a tremendous tension because the majority of the Zulus support the king because of their loyal feelings and emotions toward the him. On the other hand, the majority of the Zulus want to take part in the elections and this is the crux of the matter. The South African Government is in between. We are doing our absolutely best to try to bring about reconciliation. The day after tomorrow, Friday, a very important meeting will take place. For the first time, the four leaders, namely President De Klerk, Mr. Mandela, as well as the Zulu king, and Chief Buthelezi, will meet first bilaterally and then later jointly. We do hope that some way of this present impasse could be found. [Hochner] I understand that it would be best for South Africa, for your country, if this solution were achieved. But what will happen if it is not achieved? Is a postponement of the elections conceivable, in order to have more time and to talk to Zulu King Zwelithini? Or is an election possible that takes place in the whole of South Africa, but not in KwaZulu and Natal? [Botha] You are asking a very important question. The fact of the matter is that the overwhelming majority of the South Africans want to vote. The greater part of the country is free of violence. I am afraid that media concentrate only on violence. In the greater part of South Africa you can travel, you can relax, and find no violence whatsoever. I am not blaming the media for concentrating on the violence, but I thought I should tell my friends in Austria and Germany that South Africa is not going up in flames. I have a very real hope that the elections will take place. There will be turbulence. We could not do what we have done without turbulence because the change has been too dramatic. Both in the minds of the whites and the blacks there are tremendous doubts, but we are resolved to go ahead to have the elections. My party will be a prominent member of the new government. We trust that a solution will be found for the position of the Zulu king. [Hochner] One could say that the whites are ceding or giving back the power to the majority, the black majority. Might the blacks not only get the political, but also the economic power back from the whites in a relatively short time and might disputes over economic questions and influence in the economy arise between the white minority and the black majority? [Botha] We are not thinking in terms of color any longer. Those days are past. [Hochner] Are you sure that this also applies to the black majority? [Botha] Yes, yes. I can testify to this. I accompanied President De Klerk last Sunday to one of the biggest religious meetings in the world where 2 million black South Africans gathered. They belong to the Zionist Christian Church. The friendship and warmth that President de Klerk and myself were seeing was astounding. My own party has a growing number of black followers. My aim is to have a majority of blacks supporting my party in the Transvaal Province. I wish Europe would start accepting that this is a new South Africa. [Hochner] Thank your very much, Mr. Foreign Minister. Good luck to you and your country for the elections. [Botha] We need it. [Hochner] Thank you.
