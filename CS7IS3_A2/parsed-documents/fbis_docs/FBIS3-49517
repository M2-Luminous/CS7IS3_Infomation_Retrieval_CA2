Czech radio correspondent Eva Hulkova has recorded several statements there. [passage omitted] The next speaker to come to the Czech radio microphone was Polish Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski. [Begin Olechowski recording, in English fading into Czech translation] What we are saying is that we regard the Partnership for Peace as a very important contribution to European security. We think it is an innovative, constructive, and optimistic program. As we have often been saying, our problem with this program is that, although it is a step in the right direction, it is a very small step, because this program does not provide a clear prospect for our NATO membership. We have noticed, unfortunately, that in all the Western institutions in which we are seeking membership, there are various stages of preparation for our membership. No promise has been given to us that we will actually get this membership. This is where the essence of Polish criticism lies. [end recording] [passage omitted]
