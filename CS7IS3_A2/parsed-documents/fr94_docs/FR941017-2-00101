FR941017-2-00101 FR941017-2-00060 [Release No. 34&hyph;34814; International Series Release No. 727; File No. SR&hyph;Phlx&hyph;94&hyph;42] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating to an Enhanced Parity Split for the Specialist in 3D Foreign Currency Options October 7, 1994. Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby given that on August 15, 1994, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Phlx'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the Phlx. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The Phlx, pursuant to Rule 19b&hyph;4 of the Act, proposes to amend Exchange Rule 1014(h) in order to permit an enhanced parity split for the specialist in the cash/spot foreign currency options (``FCOs'') on the German mark, commonly referred to as 3D FCOs. The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, the Phlx, and at the Commission. II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, the Phlx included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Phlx has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. (A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change The Commission approved the 3D FCOs for trading on March 8, 1994. 1 The product is an Options Clearing Corporation issued, European-style 2 option that will be listed, initially, in one-week and two-week expirations. As an inducement for the 3D FCO specialist to make deep and liquid markets in this new options product, the Phlx has determined to provide the 3D FCO specialist with an enhanced parity split in all 3D FCO trades. 1 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33732 (March 8, 1994), 59 FR 12023 (March 15, 1994). 2 A European-style option may only be exercised during a specified time period immediately prior to expiration of the option. Recently, the Commission approved two different enhanced parity split rules with respect to Phlx equity option specialists. 3 The Phlx now proposes to amend Exchange Rule 1014(h) to adopt an enhanced parity split for the 3D FCO specialist. Specifically, the 3D FCO specialist would be entitled to receive a 50% split of the first 500 contracts in any trade in which the 3D FCO specialist and one or more crowd participants are on parity as defined in Rule 1014(h). 3 See Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 34109 (May 25, 1994), 59 FR 28570 (June 2, 1994) (providing an enhanced parity split for new specialist units trading newly listed options classes), and 34606 (August 26, 1994), 59 FR 45741 (September 2, 1994) (providing an enhanced parity split applying to specialists, other than new specialist units, for certain assigned classes). The Exchange represents that customers, as they are defined in Rule 1014(h), will not be disadvantaged by this rule. The benefits accorded customers under subsection (i) of that rule will not change. Specifically, customer bids/offers for under 100 contracts will have time priority over all other bids/offers. In that instance, the 3D FCO specialist cannot be on parity with such customer so the enhanced split will not apply. The purpose of the proposed enhanced parity split, according to the Phlx, is to encourage the 3D FCO specialist to make deeper markets in order to attract order flow to the Exchange. At the end of the first year, the Foreign Currency Option Committee (``Committee'') will conduct a review of the entitlement to the enhanced parity split and additional reviews will be conducted by the Committee every six months thereafter. The Exchange believes that the foregoing rule change proposal is consistent with Section 6 of the Act, in general, and with Section 6(b)(5), in particular, in that it is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, facilitate transactions in securities, remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, as well as to protect investors and the public interest.
