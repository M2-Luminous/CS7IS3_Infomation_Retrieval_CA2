Papers here today brand this as unpardonable acts of military provocation and premeditated kickup of military confrontation. An analyst of NODONG SINMUN says: The grave military step taken by the South Korean puppet clique at the instigation of the United States is a very grave provocation going beyond the limit of mere threat to us. We can never tolerate and overlook the military racket of the South Korean puppets encouraged by outside forces. The Korean people and People's Army do not want a war but are never afraid of it. If the South Korean puppets dare ignite a war against us, our people and People's Army will answer it with a hundred-fold retaliation. A MINJU CHOSON analyst declares that if the Kim Yong-sam group provoked a war against the North in league with outside forces, we would take a decisive self-defensive step to defend the socialist motherland and the dignity of the nation.
