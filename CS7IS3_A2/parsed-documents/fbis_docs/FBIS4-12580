This move, which takes advantage of the new situation manifested in the Security Council's periodic discussion of the economic blockade on Iraq, is aimed at explaining Baghdad's position on a number of issues, including its implementation of Security Council resolutions and its response to the resolution on long-term monitoring of weapons of mass destruction. The adverse effects on the people caused by the blockade in terms of food and medicine shortages will also be explained. AL-DUSTUR learned from the Iraqi Foreign Ministry sources that a number of ministers, advisers, and diplomats will leave Baghdad simultaneously for a number of Arab and foreign capitals. Minister of Culture and Information Hamid Yusuf Hammadi will visit Jordan, Yemen, Sudan, Djibouti, and Libya. Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf will visit Malaysia, Indonesia, and India. Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti, Iraq's permanent envoy to the UN mission in Geneva will tour Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, and Mauritania. Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Dr. 'Abd-al-Amir al-Anbari will visit Romania, Bulgaria, Poland, Portugal, and the Netherlands. Second Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Wisam al-Zahawi will visit Greece, Italy, the Vatican, New Zealand, Germany, and Japan. Counselor Wahbi Qurrah Ghuli will visit Venezuela and Argentina. The Iraqi foreign minister is scheduled to make another tour for the same purpose, but the source declined to name the capitals the second tour will include. Meanwhile, Baghdad is witnessing increasing diplomatic activities. A Turkish Foreign Ministry undersecretary will arrive in Baghdad next Thursday to discuss the Iraqi oil pipeline crossing Turkish territory and the possibility of selling the oil locked in it since the embargo on Iraqi oil exports in August 1990 when the Security Council adopted resolutions imposing economic and technological sanctions against Baghdad. Romanian Foreign Ministry undersecretary is currently visiting Baghdad as envoy of his country to the Iraqi leadership, and is carrying a message dealing with the detention of Romanian citizens in Iraq after judicial sentences were issued against them. Preparations are under way in the Iraqi capital for the visit of Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati who will hold talks on a number of issues between Tehran and Baghdad suspended since the cease-fire on 8 August 1988 after an eight-year war. Diplomats said Velayati will discuss with Iraqi officials the fate of prisoners and the Iraqi planes that took refuge in Iranian airports during the second Gulf war that broke out on 17 January 1991. The number of these planes is 148, including 22 civilian planes. An Iraqi Foreign Ministry source expects that the Iranian official will arrive in Baghdad leading a delegation that comprises a number of experts within the next two weeks. The Iraqi envoys' visits to world capitals will prepare for the next debate on the oil embargo imposed on Iraq due to take place in New York next month. An Indian envoy visited Baghdad last week and conveyed a message requesting the release of an Indian citizen who had been convicted by Iraqi judges.
