Fredriksson reviewed a study commissioned by the state of Schleswig-Holstein on future opportunities for the Baltic region. Fredriksson, speaking at a symposium held in Kiel in January, pointed out that the Baltic sphere of influence encompasses 10 countries with a population of 50 million. This region represents a purchasing power greater than China's and approximately the same as that of France, Italy, or Britain. The study was carried out by the EuroFutures Institute, headed by Fredriksson. It reviews the basic factors for future opportunities in the Baltic region in terms of population, buying power, number of large enterprises, volume of internal trade, level of university education, research and development, infrastructure, and airline services. The study also reviews the number of investments and investment growth in the Baltic region. But hard work is required if the opportunities in the Baltic region are not to remain mere projects. The coastal states must therefore begin to act and commit themselves to the exploitation of existing opportunities and the development of new ones. EuroFutures points out that the profile of the region must be strengthened. The Baltic region must become better known to the economic and political decisionmakers in order to attract foreign investment. The infrastructure must be reinforced and the results from research and development work and innovations must be converted to growth-positive enterpreneurial activities. Fredriksson thinks that the activities of universities and research institutes should be coordinated with the prospect of creating a couple of dozen internationally recognized know-how centers. Schleswig-Holstein Is Active The government of the German state of Schleswig-Holstein has, since the late 1980's, been very active in promoting the Baltic region as a future growth area in Europe. Schleswig-Holstein has, among other things, taken the initiative of creating a "Baltic program" for the European Union. Heide Simonis, Schleswig-Holstein's prime minister, who addressed the symposium, said that the Baltic region will become a European fringe area unless we take concrete steps and join forces to consolidate its development. Simonis pointed out that the region stands up well to comparison. The levels of education, technology, and research are high. The Baltic has a lively commercial traffic and plays an active part in world trade. Internal trade alone represents 6 percent of world trade. Schleswig-Holstein is a federal state with a population of 2.6 million, which has succeeded extremely well in making use of the various support programs of the European Union. A study, completed last year by the Satakunta-Liitto, indicates how well Schleswig-Holstein has handled this opportunity. The province of Vaasa has kept active contact with Schleswig-Holstein. Cooperation began thanks to contacts between Vaasa and its twin city Kiel.
