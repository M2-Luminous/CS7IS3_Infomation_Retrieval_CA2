Ciller was addressing her party's assembly group meeting. [passage omitted] [Begin Ciller recording] [passage omitted] As a democratic state of law, we are obliged to struggle against a separatist group in line with laws and moral values. We must comply with the requirements of democracy. We must remain unremittingly loyal to national and international commitments with regard to human rights. Despite this, we become the targets of human rights accusations leveled by internal and external circles, which serve as tools for the propaganda waged by the bandits through lies and deception. Certain foreign centers use the support to be provided to these separatist terrorists as a means of blackmail. They supply them with all kinds of assistance, both overtly and covertly. We must face all this without violating national and international law. We reached this current stage despite all these negative conditions. [end recording] [passage omitted] Commenting on the economy, Ciller reported that the U.S. currency rate, which soared to 40,000 Turkish lira [TL] on the eve of the 5 April decisions, has now stabilized at TL32,000-34,000. The Central Bank's overnight interest rate dropped from 800 percent to 30-70 percent. Interest on Treasury bonds also began dropping rapidly as of this week, she noted. Pointing out that the monthly budget deficit, which stood around TL32 trillion, was reduced to 4.5 trillion, Ciller remarked that the government's target for this year's budget deficit is 107 trillion, as opposed to last year's target of 200 trillion. She declared: For the first time in the history of the republic, we will halve the budget deficit. The prime minister explained that the wholesale price index, which increased by 32 percent in the first month [following the economic decisions], decreased to 9 percent this month. She estimated the inflation rate between June and December as 20 percent.
