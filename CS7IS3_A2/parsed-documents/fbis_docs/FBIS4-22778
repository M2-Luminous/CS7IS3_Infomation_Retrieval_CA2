He graduated from MGU [Moscow State University] with distinction in the field of economic cybernetics. He is a doctor of sciences. He has published some 100 scholarly works and articles on issues of Soviet and Russian economic development. Since the early 1990's he has worked on problems of the structural crisis in the Soviet and Russian economy and development of approaches to overcome it. From 23 December 1992 to 21 September 1993 he was Russian minister of foreign economic relations. During the time that he worked in this post he was able to overcome the downward trend in exports, increase the export of finished products, and reach a stable positive balance of trade. He retired on 21 September 1993 in disagreement with Presidential Edict No 1400, entitled "Constitutional Reform in Stages," which he believed violated the Constitution. He is a deputy to the State Duma and chairman of the State Duma Committee on foreign economic policy. [Kozlov] Sergey Yuryevich, how would you describe the present state of affairs in the Russian economy? [Glazyev] As not very reassuring. The paramount problem now is the state budget, a draft of which is being reviewed in the Duma right now. The actual economic policy which is concealed in this draft will not help the country out of economic crisis and gives no guarantees against plunging into hyperinflation and a disastrous decline in production. The validity of the macroeconomic hypothesis on which the draft budget is based raises grave doubts. The budget itself does not fit this hypothesis in its income and expenditure parts. For example, the income part for foreign economic activity is greatly understated. Budget income from the profit tax is exaggerated. [Kozlov] And yet the budget was written by professionals... [Glazyev] We can assume that they were guided by the 7-8 percent growth rate which occurred at the end of last year. Beginning from this they calculated the approximate levels of income and expenditures. The reality, however, proved much harsher. According to expert estimates the drop in production may be much more than expected and could be somewhere on the order of 20-25 percent. Naturally, this will make it impossible to reduce the rate of inflation and will put the country on the brink of a plunge into hyperinflation. In January of this year the drop in machinebuilding production reached almost 50 percent compared with last year. Possibly this is not felt much in governmental structures, but the workers whose enterprises have shut down and the sectors whose production volume has decreased several times over are undergoing a disaster today. [Kozlov] Can we speak of even a rough balance in the budget? [Glazyev] There is an obvious discrepancy in priorities in the expenditure part. It is contemplated that enormous amounts of money will be spent to maintain the fuel-energy complex and agriculture, while inadequate amounts are envisioned for science-intensive industry, conversion, and stimulating growth in high-tech production areas. The obvious disproportions of the budget message, its unreliability to put it one way, lead me to think that we have to help the Government formulate a normal economic policy and an acceptable budget. [Kozlov] Isn't that what the Supreme Soviet, of sad memory, was striving for? [Glazyev] Well, so everything in life repeats itself. In all likelihood we will propose to the Government that they join forces with specialists from the State Duma. This kind of initiative is in the spirit of recent steps of the Federal Assembly, President, and the opposition to achieve civil peace and consensus. [Kozlov] When can we expect adoption of a refined and amended budget? [Glazyev] We must try to see that the country enters the second half of the year with a ratified budget for 1994. Then we will immediately be able to begin work on the budget for the next year. [Kozlov] Incidentally, what happened to the recently published anticrisis program of academicians Abalkin, Petrakov, and Shatalin, the Saburov program, and indeed, your own program, Sergey Yuryevich? [Glazyev] They were certainly considered in preparation of the President's Message to the Federal Assembly, but they were not actually reflected in the Government's economic policy. [Kozlov] What do you think of the term "Ukainization of the economy?" Much has already been said about the similarity of negative processes occurring in the Russian and Ukrainian economies. What differences do you see? [Glazyev] The term "Ukrainization" is improper from the start. Objectively speaking, Ukraine is in a completely different foreign economic situation than Russia. Russia today has a stable positive balance of trade with a very significant excess of export over import. Ukraine, on the contrary, has a large and chronic trade deficit. It seems to me that without large-scale foreign aid it will be hard for Ukraine to overcome its economic crisis. [Kozlov] What can you say about the current structure of Russian export? The anticrisis program which you authored envisions mechanisms to get back the many billions of dollars which have settled in the foreign bank accounts of a small number of Russians. How do you intend to do this? [Glazyev] The structure of Russian export has now changed for the worse. Its raw material component has intensified anew. As for domestic capital abroad, by last summer the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations had introduced a system to monitor foreign currency revenue from export of raw materials. It was fairly well thought out and had technical support, but unfortunately, in the second half of the year it practically ceased operations. We were not able to stop the leakage of foreign currency income abroad. Generally speaking, there is nothing difficult in monitoring export and import. The appropriate instruments have been well-known for a long time. Everything depends on the desire of the Central Bank, Ministry of Finance, State Customs Committee, and Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations to take the appropriate measures. Judging by everything, they still do not have this desire. But everything is determined by the macroeconomic situation in the country. Repressive measures produce little here. But if conditions for stabilization are secured the investment climate will change for the better and legal capital will begin to return. As for investment by Russian natural and legal persons in physical assets abroad, in particular in real estate, this capital is lost forever. [Kozlov] What is your attitude toward the method established in Russia for determining the exchange rate of the ruble in auctions at the interbank currency exchange? How well does the rate that is formed correspond to the actual ratio of the ruble and the dollar? [Glazyev] It seems to me that determination of the exchange rate should be a significant, independent element of government economic policy. The rate today is established in a largely unplanned way. It is subject to such fluctuations that exporters and importers cannot make long-term or even medium-term forecasts. It is essential to have an exchange rate policy that is independent, intelligible, and predictable for all participants in economic activity. I do not think that the exchange rate of the ruble today is too low, though. That is, of course, if you do not take account of non-commodity, embodied Russian assets. The stock market, the market for capital still has not started working in Russia. Therefore the exchange rate is formed exclusively in the commodity market. [Kozlov] The last 100 days of voucher privatization have come. In your view, has it been possible to accomplish the assigned tasks within the framework of the model chosen by Goskomimushchestvo [State Committee on Administration of State Property]? [Glazyev] I do not think so. Effective ownership mechanisms have not been created in the economy. We do not know who three-quarters of the privatized enterprises today belong to. If we consider the fact that 80 percent of the commercial banks were formed by industrial enterprises, we will see that the ownership system which has developed among them is the system of an undeveloped market economy--the so-called "Yugoslav model." It leads to chronic depression, galloping inflation, economic disintegration, and separatism. Perhaps the time has come to look around and move toward creation of an effective system of market-based ownership relations and not carry this hopeless scheme to its final "triumph." [Kozlov] On the one hand everyone talks of consensus and national reconciliation, while on the other they intimidate you with another round of confrontation... [Glazyev] The dividing line does not run between advocates and opponents of the reforms. It lies between those who want to establish order, attain economic success, and overcome the crisis and those who continue to rock the boat, instill radicalism in public opinion, frighten the people with civil war, and stir things up, creating muddy waters which they themselves take advantage of.
