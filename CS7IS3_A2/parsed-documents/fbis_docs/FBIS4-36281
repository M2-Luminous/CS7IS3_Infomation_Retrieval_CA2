Information confirms that the security agencies of the rebel gang raided houses of the GPC members on the pretext of searching for weapons before arresting them and taking them to detention centers. Reliable sources said these security agencies did not inform the families of some GPC members that they were detained. Other information says the detainees were subjected to psychological and physical torture at the hands of experts in torture after they had refused to sign a statement supporting al-Bid's declaration of secession. The GPC Standing Committee is astonished by this criminal conduct. It holds the criminal gang fully responsible for what may happen to the detainees at the hands of their henchmen and calls for their immediate release. The Standing Committee urges all political parties and organizations and the popular institutions and organizations to denounce this cowardly act, which was carried out by the elements of apostasy and secession in the Socialist Party. Having failed to face the valiant forces of unity and constitutional legitimacy, these elements seek to take revenge from the innocent civilians, including members of our organization. We also draw attention to the fact that these criminal, suppressive acts carried out by the elements of rebellion and secession in the Socialist Party expose the rigid totalitarian mentality, the tyrannical suppressive will, and the conspiratorial policies that still live at the minds of the enemies of democracy, human rights, and civil liberties; and who do not respect other opinions. These acts are yet another addition to the series of crimes committed by this gang against our people and will not go unpunished.
