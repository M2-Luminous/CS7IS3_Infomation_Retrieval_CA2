Saudi Arabia sought to prove that it was the true master of the Gulf region. Throughout the discussions, the Saudi representative's stand was obvious: Progress in the multilateral talks and the practical implementation of confidence-building measures can take place only after the peace process makes further progress. [passage omitted] Eytan Bentzur, a Foreign Ministry deputy director general and member of the Israeli delegation to the Qatar talks, says the Saudis encumbered the progress of the talks. They should realize better than anyone else that they have a vested interest in the peace process, and in deflating tensions in this sensitive and charged region, he said. [passage omitted] Despite the Saudi attempt to place obstacles, resolutions were adopted. It is unclear whether the Gulf states were thereby disobeying Saudi Arabia, which tried to demonstrate that its own stands will prevail vis-a-vis the other members of the oil-producing countries alliance, or perhaps the Saudis were militant only in plenum sessions. Outside the formal talks, the Israeli delegation held conversations and meetings with the Tunisian representative, who made attempts to soften the Saudis, with the representatives of Oman, Egypt, and the U.S., and with the Qatari foreign minister. After the talks, Israeli delegates said this was another step toward normalization with the world. [passage omitted]
