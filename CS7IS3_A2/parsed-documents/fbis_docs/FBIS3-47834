It will strengthen its early-warning capability by stepping up its efforts to collect and analyze data on North Korea, including information on developments in North Korea's nuclear development program, its policy toward South Korea and its military structure. The NSP will be restructured in accordance with the NSP law as amended late last year so that it can better promote the national interest and security, Director Kim said. Information services for the private sector will be increased to make the NSP an intelligence and information agency in which the people have full trust, he said. President Kim responded to the report by expressing his hope that the NSP grows into a world-level information and intelligence agency. "We're living in an era where information is power," he told the NSP chief.
