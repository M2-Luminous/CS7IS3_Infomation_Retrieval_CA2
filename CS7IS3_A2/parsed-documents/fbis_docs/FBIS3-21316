Raja Mohan: "U.S. Harps on Human Rights Violation"] [Text] Washington, Jan. 25--The Indian Ambassador to the United States, Mr. Siddharth Shankar Ray, has conveyed to the Clinton Administration, New Delhi's concern over the series of negative pronouncements on Kashmir, Punjab and human rights that have emanated from the highest political level in Washington. The Ambassador yesterday told the Assistant Secretary of State for South Asian Affairs, Ms. Robin Raphel, of the larger negative impact of these statements on the bilateral relations. India had instructed Mr. Ray to convey its unhappiness with the turn of events in Washington, in particular the recent letters of the U.S. President, Mr. Bill Clinton, to supporters of secessionist movement in Kashmir and Punjab. U.S. deeply troubled: In a separate development, the Clinton Administration has informed the U.S. Congress that it is pressing India "to strengthen the recently formed Human Rights Commission, prosecute human rights violators, and allow access to Kashmir by human rights monitoring groups, particularly the International Committee of the Red Cross." Responding to concerns expressed in the U.S. Congress about human rights violations in Kashmir, the U.S. State Department has said that it is "deeply troubled" by the reports of human rights abuses in Kashmir, "both by Indian security forces and by militant groups." In a letter to Mr. Tom Lantos, the chairman of the Congressional Human Rights Caucus, the Assistant Secretary of State for Legislative Affairs, Ms. Wendy R. Sherman, said the Clinton Administration had regularly raised human rights concerns with the Indian officials "as part of an intensified dialogue on human rights, urging them to bring an end to such abuses." The letter sent in late December was made available today to correspondents here. Patronising tone: The formulations in the letter reflect attempts in the recent weeks by the State Department to make the administration's articulation of Kashmir policy less offensive. But it is well short of amounting to a fair position on the Kashmir issue. The positive reference to Indian democratic tradition is marred by the patronising tone of the letter: "India is a democratic State with the capacity to reform itself, and we will continue to encourage this process at every opportunity." For once, the administration acknowledges, in the letter to Mr. Lantos, the linkage between the insurgency and the human rights situation in Kashmir and it notes that Washington has "urged all parties involved to resolve their differences peacefully and abstain from violence." But by equating the responsibility of the Indian State to restore law and order and protect innocent citizens from the ravages of militancy in Kashmir with the terrorist violence sponsored by Pakistan, the formulation slips into the by now familiar diplomatic sleight of hand. Standard formulation: The letter from the State Department also reiterates the now standard American formulation on resolving the Kashmir problem: "We believe the resolution of the Kashmir problem can be best achieved through negotiations between India and Pakistan, taking into account the wishes of the people of Kashmir." The State Department has clarified in the recent past that the reference to the wishes of the people of Kashmir, does not imply a support to the notion of the self-determination, it is only a recognition of the practical necessity of making any Indo-Pakistan agreement on Kashmir acceptable to the people of Kashmir. The administration also indicated that it does not favour the plebiscite or any other particular procedure for ascertaining the wishes of the Kashmiri people. It suggested that the procedure could be decided within the framework of Indo-Pakistan negotiations. These verbal gymnastics, however, do not obfuscate the fact that the Clinton administration has gone far beyond the fair position outlined by the Bush administration in 1990 favouring the Simla agreement as the means of resolving the Indo-Pakistan dispute over Kashmir. Nor does it hide the ill-advised posture of activism and intervention in Kashmir adopted by the Clinton administration. Washington is also yet to recognise that its activism has complicated the Indian efforts to initiate a political process in Jammu and Kashmir. The American rhetoric on human rights and Kashmir along with signals of White House support for secessionist groups has generated strong illusions among the militants in Kashmir and the political establishment in Pakistan that Washington will be able to deliver through international diplomatic action, what they have not been able to achieve on the battlefield. Kashmiri Pandits' plea: The lack of balance in the Clinton Administration's position on Kashmir was the main theme that a delegation of Kashmiri Pandits based in the United States sought to present Ms. Robin Raphel, who saw them yesterday. The group from the Indo-American Kashmir Forum [IAKF] drew the attention of the State Department to the plight of their community, and called on the United States to take a more even-handed approach to the Kashmir problem. They also told Ms. Raphel that "any tilt or even the perception of a tilt towards one party or the other will effectively erode the role the United States can play and should play in resolving the Kashmir problem." The group of Kashmiri Pandits, who support the creation of a Union territory within the Kashmir valley for their community, have called on the United States "to publicly identify Kashmir Pandits as a party to the dispute and settlement in Kashmir." In a press conference yesterday, the IAKF said Ms. Raphel assured them that the U.S. is fully aware of the complexity of the Kashmir issue, and has no intention of being one-sided in its approach. The IAKF is also intensifying the efforts of the Kashmiri Pandits in the United States to present their case to the Congressmen and familiarise them with the dimensions of the Kashmir problem that have been barely noticed, let alone understood in the United States. To the extent that the complexity of the Kashmir problem can be brought before the American public such lobbying effort may have some value. But it will be tragic if different sections of the people of Jammu and Kashmir begin to believe in the illusion that the road to peace in Kashmir runs through Washington. Neither the letter writing by Mr. Clinton, nor the human rights cacophony from the U.S. Congress can bring peace to Kashmir. It has not so far in Bosnia. Only a democratic political process within the framework of the Indian Union can restore peace and tranquillity to the State of Jammu and Kashmir. Congressmen's assurance UNI, PTI report: Meanwhile, the Republican Party Congressmen--Mr. Jim Ramstad and Mr. Rodney Grams--have agreed to take up the Pandits' case and promised to help arrange a special Congressional hearing to highlight their plight.
