IZVESTIYA quotes the Russian President as saying at a press conference on the resutls of his visit to Tbilisi that "the goals of Russian policy are clear and specific: We should have not only friendly relations with Georgia but also maintain relations of allies." The newspaper points out that "the principal event during the visit was the signing of a treaty of friendship, goodneighbourliness and cooperation as well as a number of documents on economic relations." KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) on Boris Yeltsin's visit to Georgia: In an article headlined "The Tbilisi Treaty: What It Gives to Russia and the Peoples of the Caucasus", the newspaper writes that due to fellows like an unnamed soldier from among the Russian peacekeeping force in South Ossetia, whose picture was taken by the newspaper's correspondent (the photograph is on the newspaper's front page), "Ossetian and Georgian farmers for the first time in years of sanguinary confrontation have got an opportunity to go about their primary business in the land of their forefathers". Without the Russian soldier-peacemaker, it is impossible to undo the knot of Caucasian contradictions, the newspaper added. TRUD and RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA point to a great importance of the Russian-Georgian treaty for the two countries. NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA recalls that the Russian-Georgian agreements signed are subject to ratification by the parliaments. "There will probably be a lot of opponents of the accords" in the top legislatures of both Russia and Georgia," the newspaper writes, pointing out that although Moscow recognises Georgia's territorial integrity, it nevertheless "urges Tbilisi to determine the political status of Abkhazia and South Ossetia". PRAVDA takes a rather sceptical view of the results of Boris Yeltsin's visit to Georgia. It points out that although Georgia did sign a treaty with Moscow, it is being reported from Sukhumi that "Georgian armed detachments already penetrate Abkhazia's Gali district". Newspapers feature photographs of the crew of the U.S. space shuttle Discovery, with Russian cosmonaut Sergey Krikalev among them. The shuttle blasted off into space on Thursday. IZVESTIYA on an instruction issued by the chief of staff of the Russian Government that from now on only a representative of ROSSIISKAYA GAZETA will be allowed to be present at cabinet meetings: "The closed doors, behind which the government policy will be apparently fashioned from now on, is the most hopeless way to avoid public scrutiny of the work of the cabinet of ministers". RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA carries a two-page article by academicians Leonid Abalkin, Nikolay Petrakov and Stanislav Shatalin, who offer a new, milder "economic reform concept". Touching upon Russia's economic and social problems, they write in particular that "the country has found itself before a dangerous threshold. By crossing it, Russia runs the risk of losing forever a chance for revival as a great power". KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA on the academicians' economic programme. The newspaper maintains that the programme virtually resembles the one suggested by Russian Liberal Democratic Party leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy during his election campaign. "The difference is that while Zhirinovskiy can simply speak about the problems and promise that they would be resolved instantaneously, the government would have to tackle them". NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries an interview with Anatoliy Dolgolaptev, member of the Federation Council, who comes out in favour of changing Russia's economic and geopolitical status in the world, pointing out that this is much more important than the vociferous political tussle at the top which diverts the attention of society.
