In their view, the cabinet's socioeconomic program is not in any state to extricate the country from crisis. The opposition also called on the law and order agencies to urgently start an investigation into facts relating to accusations that high-ranking officials are involved in corruption and abuse of their official position. The hunger strike on Ulaanbaatar's main square by activists of the opposition forces has been going on for seven days now, in spite of the fact that the president and parliament have spoken in favor of this extreme political action being ended. The hunger strike on Freedom Square, organized by supporters of the government, has already been going on for five days now. They have stated that they will only stop it after the opposition does the same. "Free microphones" have been set up in both squares which anyone can use who wants to talk about the problems worrying him. Today, according to a report from a source in parliament, members of the Great Hural discussed the political situation in the country. The draft decision on this issue was handed over to the leaders of the political parties.
