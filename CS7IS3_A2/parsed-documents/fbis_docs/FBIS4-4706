Speaking to reporters at his office on 21 March, Saleh Affif, coordinating minister for economics, finance, and develoment supervision, said Indonesia's foreign debt now stand at U.S. $90 billion, 40 percent of which belong to the private sector, 20 percent of which are short-term debt of less than one year, and the remaining 40 percent which are government debt. He added that 40 percent of the U.S. $90 billion debt are in Japanese yen. "We must be careful because the 15-percent appreciation of the yen in the last 12 months has increased our foreign debt by U.S. $3billion. This is quite a large amount," he said. Therefore, the government is now making efforts to reduce the amount of new commercial loans, 25-year long-term soft loans from the Consultative Group on Indonesia (CGI), as well as 10-year long-term export loans, which has an interest of six to seven percent. To reduce the amount of overseas debt, several steps have been taken, including the placing of restrictions on commercial loans by the Overseas Commercial Loans Coordinating Team. Meanwhile, the National Development Planning Agency will be in charge of monitoring export loans. "What is difficult is how to prevent the private sector from taking on new commercial loans," the minister said. [passage omitted]
