In its latest Hong Kong property equity research paper, the firm said strong earning growth from the swift land price rises and the steep rent hikes from 1993 onwards should combine with the expansion in the sector's price/earning ratios to take stock prices to new highs. The paper, entitled "Major Re-Rating Awaits Property Stocks in 1994", said the key drivers of the re-rating will be the dissipation of the fear that Hong Kong will suffer from a mass exodus of residents and capital ahead of 1997 and the realization that the property market is well supported by strong incomes that China has helped generate and is not an asset bubble. China is a major source of long-term opportunities for Hong Kong property companies and not a source of political risk, which pressures immovable assets like property, the paper said. Another factor pushing the re-rating is that the market is starting to accept a valuation paradigm that values certain quality property stocks on an earning multiple basis, which recognizes these companies as generators of long-term earnings. Salomon Brothers, in the Asia Pacific region outside Japan, has branches or representative offices in Bangkok, Seoul, Singapore and Taipei, with the regional headquarters in Hong Kong.
