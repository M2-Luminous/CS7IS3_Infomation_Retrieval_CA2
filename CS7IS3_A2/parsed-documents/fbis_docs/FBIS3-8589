"The discussion is clearly only being prolonged, and deputies are straying from the matter in hand," Ftacnik said, calling on the premier to "pluck up courage" and make a speech. If he did not, then it was "clearly time to end the debate." Chairman of Parliament Ivan Gasparovic said in reaction to this that the debate could be ended if deputies stopped asking for permission to speak. Ftacnik's appeal was not passed as a formal motion, and the debate continues with a speech by Culture Minister Dusan Slobodnik on the theme of success in the increasing of Slovakia's profile and the necessity of the Bojnicky Altar being returned from the Czech Republic. After Ftacnik's speech, Meciar went to sit next to Deputy Chairman of Parliament and SDL chairman Peter Weiss and started talking to him.
