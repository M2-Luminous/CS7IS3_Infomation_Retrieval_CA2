In an interview with AL-AHRAM published today, 'Abd-al-Majid said that it is not possible to reconcile Arabs and Israelis and establish Arab-Israeli peace so long as the Arab nation remains fragmented and riven by conflicts. He said this when referring to the fact that although three years have passed since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, the repercussions of that crisis still reflect negatively on the Arabs' active march. He said he fears Arab disputes might grow worse in the coming period, particularly border disputes. The Arab League secretary general called for speeding up the amending of the current Charter to permit the adoption of decisions by majority vote rather than by consensus. He also called for setting up an Arab court of justice. Touching on the call for an Arab summit to mark the 50th anniversary of the establishment of the Arab League, 'Abd-al-Majid hoped this call will be received favorably. However, he stressed the need for a favorable climate for this and emphasized that good preparation for such a summit would be inter-Arab candidness as a basis for reconciliation. Commenting on the Lockerbie crisis involving Libya and some Western states, 'Abd-al-Majid pointed out that the Arab League Council has called for trying the Libyan suspects in the International Court of Justice with the participation of Scottish judges. He reiterated the League's support for Libya's right to exercise sovereignty on its territory and to refuse to hand over its citizens. The Arab League secretary general added that he will continue his efforts to find a peaceful solution to the Lockerbie crisis.
