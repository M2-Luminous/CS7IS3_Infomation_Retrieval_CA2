The Copenhagen Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, signed by 20 countries, goes into effect June 14 and South Korea will submit to the amendment soon afterwards, the ministry said. The revised version sets down an earlier date to eliminate all use of chemicals destructive to the ozone layer such as CFCs and halon. These chemicals are used as coolants in refrigerators and air conditioners. CFC use will be banned as of Jan. 1, 1996, while use of halon was to cease Jan. 1 this year. South Korea, however, belongs to the developing nation category and is exempt from these deadlines. The Copenhagen Amendment excludes a ban date for developing countries and members are to decide next year on another set of guidelines.
