FR941116-2-00070 FR941116-2-00057 Antitrust Division United States v. General Electric Co., et al.; Proposed Termination of Final Decree Notice is hereby given that defendant General Electric Company (GE) has filed with the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, Eastern Division, a motion to terminate the Final Decree in United States v. General Electric Company, et al. , In Equity No. 8120, which was entered on October 12, 1911, and the Department of Justice (Department), in a stipulation also filed with the Court, has tentatively consented to termination of the Final Decree, but has reserved the right to withdraw its consent based on public comments and for other reasons. The complaint in United States v. General Electric Company, et al. , filed on March 3, 1911 and brought against GE and other lamp manufacturers, alleged, inter alia, that GE acquired interests in and control over other lamp companies, but concealed its ownership interests in them in order to give the impression of competition among numerous, independent lamp manufacturers. The complaint also alleged conspiracies to restrain trade and to monopolize. The conduct was charged as violating the Sherman Act of 1890. The Final Decree prohibits GE from conducting its incandescent lamp business except in its own name, and enjoins certain practices, including price fixing, resale price maintenance, price discrimination, tying and exclusive dealing arrangements. The United States has filed with the Court a memorandum setting forth the reasons why the United States believes that termination of the Final Decree would serve the public interest. Copies of the complaint and Final Decree, motion papers, the stipulation containing the United States' consent, the United States' memorandum and all further papers filed with the Court in connection with this motion will be available for inspection at Room 3235, Antitrust Division, Department of Justice, 10th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20530 (telephone 202&hyph;514&hyph;2481), and at the Office of the Clerk of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, Eastern Division, 201 Superior Avenue, Cleveland, OH 44114 (telephone 216&hyph;522&hyph;4355).
