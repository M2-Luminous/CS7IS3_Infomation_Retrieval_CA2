Quality of Consumer Goods In 1993, the Russian Federation State Inspection for Trade, Quality, and Consumer Rights Protection conducted 64,400 inspections of consumer goods quality at industrial and trade enterprises; 62 percent of them resulted in finding the goods defective. Quality of individual categories of goods is characterized by the following data: Found defective, grade reduced quantity as % of total volume of inspected goods 1992 1993 Meat, thousand tonnes 1.1 4.8 10.7 Whole milk products, 0.6 5.5 5.7 thousand tonnes Eggs, million units 12.7 28.4 25.7 Vegetable oil, 0.3 31.4 17.4 thousand tonnes Fish and fish 1.8 8.6 16.6 products, thousand tonnes Confectionery items, 0.7 11.6 12.1 thousand tonnes Knitwear, thousand 45.5 21.0 25.7 tonnes Hosiery, thousand 21.1 39.6 31.0 pairs Sewn items, thousand 103.5 18.8 23.4 items Leather footwear, 78.2 20.9 18.8 thousand pairs At the Pestovskiy Meat Combine joint-stock society in Novgorod Oblast, 67 percent of the inspected quantity of sausages were found below grade; at Magadanskaya sausage factory--40 percent; at Astrakhan city milk combine and the Olovyanniki butter plant in Chita Oblast--53 percent and 90 percent of butter, respectively; at Birsk dry and fat-free milk combine in the Republic of Bashkortostan--40 percent of milk products; and at Kirov poultry factory--62 percent of eggs. During one-time inspections, complete production batches of footwear were found defective at the TOO [limited liability partnership] Volzhane in Samara Oblast; TOO Kavkaz in Stavropol Kray, POO [expansion unidentified] Sportobuv in Sverdlovsk Oblast; and in one-third of inspected quantities of output at Astrakhan and Ivanovo footwear factories. Poor-quality garments were being produced by the Magnitogorsk garment factory in Chelyabinsk Oblast and the Borisoglebsk garment factory in Voronezh Oblast, and the PTShO [industrial-technical sewing association] Kuban in Krasnodar Kray, where the share of defective output amounted to 20-44 percent. Deliveries of Mineral Fertilizer to Agriculture In January 1994, deliveries of mineral fertilizer for the needs of agriculture are characterized by the following data (in thousand tonnes). Delivered in January 1994 January 1994 as % of January as % of December 1993 1991 1992 1993 Mineral fertilizer total 67.7 7 10 26 64 including: nitrogen 42.3 12 13 28 55 phosphate 5.2 2 3 12 58 phosphorite 5.6 12 21 137 121 flour potassium 14.6 7 8 22 91 The continuing decline in the production of mineral fertilizer (by 26 percent as compared to January 1993); increased exports (1.8-fold); and poor solvency of agricultural consumers resulted in fertilizer shipments to domestic market consumers falling by a factor of four in January as compared to January 1993. As a result, farms will get no more than 40 percent of the needed quantities this year. In Russia as a whole, soil fertilization decreased as compared to 1990 by 57 percent; fertilizer deliveries declined in all regions, but most of all in the following. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Delivered in January 1994|As 2000070040f January 1993 | | |, thousand tonnes | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Pskov Oblast |0.1 |16 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Vladimir Oblast |0.1 |11 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ryazan Oblast |0.6 |4 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Kirov Oblast |2.3 |25 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Kursk Oblast |0.1 |8 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Lipetsk Oblast |0.02 |0.5 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Rostov Oblast |0.1 |3 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Stavropol Kray |0.3 |9 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Republic of Mordova [Mor-|0.1 |2 | |dvinia] | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Consumer Services Over the elapsed year the volume of consumer services, as reported by officially registered enterprises, amounted to R0.7 trillion, which in current prices is nine times more than in 1992 and in comparable prices--40 percent less. Services provided the population in rural areas account for 11 percent of the total volume (12 percent in 1992). Distribution of consumer services by form of ownership in 1993 is characterized by the following data (in percents of the volume of consumer services by category). Form of ownership state private other nonstate Total volume of consumer 54.2 32.2 13.6 services including: shoe repair and custom 49.5 36.3 14.2 manufacture clothes repair and 48.6 37.6 13.8 custom manufacture knitwear custom 39.9 43.4 16.7 manufacture and knitting radioelectronics and 58.5 27.2 14.3 household appliances repair repair and technical 35.3 42.5 22.2 maintenance of means of transportation furniture repair and 50.0 27.5 22.5 custom-making dry cleaning and dyeing 56.4 31.8 11.8 laundry services 81.2 11.7 7.1 housing repair and 53.7 32.3 14.0 construction photo services 50.8 36.7 12.5 services of public baths 78.8 11.5 9.7 and shower facilities barbershop and beauty 42.2 47.4 10.4 salon services consumer goods rental 72.1 17.7 10.2 services transportation services 60.3 27.5 12.2 Incidence of Contagious Diseases Among the Population The difficult epidemiologic situation in the Russian Federation continued in January 1994.
