FBIS4-53582 "dreas098_l_94005" FBIS-EAS-94-098 Daily Report 20 May 1994 Philippines U.S. Colonel's Killers Said Covered by Amnesty U.S. Colonel's Killers Said Covered by Amnesty BK2005103294 Quezon City PTV-4 Television Network in Tagalog 0500 GMT 20 May 94 BK2005103294 Quezon City PTV-4 Television Network Tagalog BFN [Text] Major General Alfredo Filler, Armed Forces of the Philippines [AFP] vice chief of staff, stressed that the members of the Alex Boncayao Brigade involved in the killing of U.S. Colonel James Rowe are covered by the government's amnesty program. Filler said that the killers were captured and punished. They, however, still have the right to apply for the amnesty program. It will be recalled that the U.S. Government objected to the granting of amnesty to the three New People's Army rebels who killed Rowe while on his way to JUSMAG [Joint United States Military Advisory and Planning Group] in Quezon City during the latter part of 1980. According to Filler, the Philippines will not be violating the diplomatic agreement which it signed wherein the government will give protection to American nationals in the country. Filler clarified that the agreement does not stipulate the banning of parole or amnesty.
