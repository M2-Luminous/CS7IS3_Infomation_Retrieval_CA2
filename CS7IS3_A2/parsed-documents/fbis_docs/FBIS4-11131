In statements at the Government House, the president said the decree will be made public this Thursday as part of a search for solutions to the serious problem of the electricity shortage, a situation which forced authorities to regulate the service three months ago. Reina declared that he has spoken to the presidents of Panama and Nicaragua, Guillermo Endara and Violeta Chamorro, as well as to advisers of Costa Rican President Rafael Angel Calderon to ask for their help in solving the problem. The president said that Honduras will ask these countries to sell their energy surplus to Honduras so as to try to cover the daily deficit of over 80 megawatts that now exists in local electricity supply. Three months ago, the National Enterprise for Electric Power (ENEE) implemented an energy rationing plan that has caused losses estimated in the millions for the private sector, in addition to interfering with the government's activities, as well of those of citizens in general. The crisis was brought on by a lack of water at the "Francisco Morazan" hydroelectric plant, which supplies 63 percent of the national demand, as well as by a lack of planning by previous administrations, according to official sources. Operations at the hydroelectric plant could come to a standstill in the next three months if the rainy season is not good, ENEE experts concluded.
