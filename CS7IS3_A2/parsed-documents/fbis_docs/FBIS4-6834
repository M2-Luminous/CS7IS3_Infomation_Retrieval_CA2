The agreement came as Trade, Industry and Energy Minister Kim Chol-su met with visiting Chinese Minister of Internal Trade Zhang Haoruo for talks on promoting bilateral economic links. Officials said Kim asked Zhang to open the Chinese market to official auto imports from South Korea. He also requested China's active interest in allowing South Korea's corporate entry into the distribution market since it is linked with bilateral trade expansion, officials said. Zhang, in response, said South Korean companies should invest mainly in improving and building China's distribution network including warehouses and marine transport centers. The two trade ministers decided that Seoul would send a government-private study team to China around June or July to look into the distribution market. They agreed that their governments would fully support the planned construction of the Korea business center in Beijing and an oil refinery that South Korea's Yukong hopes to build in Liangchuan.
