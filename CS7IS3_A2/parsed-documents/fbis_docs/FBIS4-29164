Mr. Rabuka, who led the two coups in 1987, told parliament during a debate on crime and punishment, there could be no guarantee Fiji would not have another coup nor that it would be bloodless as was the case in 1987. The prime minister said some people blamed present lawlessness in Fiji on the 1987 coups but he would not apologize for having overthrown the elected government of the late Dr. Timoci Bavandra. Mr. Rabuka pointed to a recent speech in which President Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara warned that poor urban Fijians could become a destabilizing force if their situation was not improved. Referring to the fact that Fiji's Indian population represent the bulk of the business class, Mr. Rabuka said indigenous Fijians felt disadvantaged and that their (?souls) were starving. With new circumstances he said no one could guarantee there would not be another coup. Following Mr. Rabuka's remark, members of the opposition National Federation Party and the Fiji Labor Party walked out and refused to return causing the House of Representatives to adjourn its proceedings until tomorrow.
