He affirmed his decision in a letter to Sejm speaker Jozef Oleksy: "Because my constitutional initiative was rejected already after its first reading without a serious discussion and without so much as am examination, I have decided to withdraw my representative from the Constitutional Commission. At the same time, I withdraw my constitutional draft." "One is surprised by the president's decision," says speaker Oleksy. ``It is regrettable that he has withdrawn his candidate because that narrows down the scope of consultations. In his statements today, the president did not confine himself to constitutional matters, but also referred to the entire parliament. It is not quite clear what he had in mind when he spoke of the need to suppress the postcommunists. After all, he himself gave the postcommunists a chance. Well, that's it. The Sejm majority rejected his constitutional draft. "But what surprises me most of all is that the president does not know if he will hold talks with the Sejm on nonconstitutional topics. I think he made a mistake or a slipup when he said that there is a conflict between the president and parliament in every single country, for example in Russia. That possesses militant undertones, and is hardly an appropriate thing to say. "I have the impression that the president does not want to see a constitution adopted in the nearest future. I fail to understand what he means when he says `graveyard peace.' "I will talk to the president and try to clarify with him what the powers of the highest state bodies are. That is a subject of my concern. Provided, of course, that it is still possible to talk to him. "I see no reason to make loud noises about a break of relations between the president and parliament, even if the president has suffered a defeat because of the rejection of his legislative initiative. I would not like confusion and political squabbling to be the only way to achieve objectives.'' Says Aleksander Kwasniewski, chairman of the Constitutional Commission: "The president has commenced his election campaign too early. He wants to use the constitution as his chief political argument. We will support the constitution that has been prepared by parliament, but the president, at the head of nonparliamentary forces, will call on people to shun it." Kwasniewski recalled that the Constitutional Commission has not only the right but also the duty to fulfill the law on preparing and adopting the constitution, whether or not the president takes part in this work. But he fears that the president is intent on deflecting the debate away from the constitution toward politics in general and the subject of who supports the president and who does not. "We are approaching an absurd situation," Kwasniewski continues. "Either we have democracy and parliamentarism, where we respect the law, or we have a destabilization of the state and the use of illegitimate legal methods. We are now dealing with an offensive against parliament just because we won the elections. That is a repetition of the old communist principle whereby power lies wherever the communists happen to be, and everything not connected with the communists has nothing to do with authority, or parliamentarism, or democracy."
