FR940722-0-00043 FR940722-0-00013 In the introductory text of NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2), North Dakota proposed to increase the amount of probable total annual production allowed for SOAP applicants from one hundred thousand tons [90,718.47 metric tons] to three hundred thousand tons [272,155.41 metric tons]. North Dakota also proposed, in the introductory text of NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2), that the costs of certain activities specified at NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2) (a) through (f) (discussed at findings 3 (b) through (g) below), which must be performed by a qualified public or private entity designated by the Commission, may be assumed by the Commission upon the written request of an operator in connection with a permit application. North Dakota's proposed revision to increase the amount of probable total annual production allowed for SOAP applicants from one hundred thousand tons to three hundred thousand tons is consistent with and no less stringent than section 507(c)(1) of SMCRA. North Dakota's proposal regarding the cost of certain activities that the Commission may assume upon written request of an operator in connection with a permit application would appear to grant discretion to the regulatory authority that is not granted in section 507(c)(1) of SMCRA. Section 507(c)(1) requires that the specified costs ``shall'' be assumed by the regulatory authority. This SMCRA provision is implemented in the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 795.9(a), which require the payment of such costs for eligible applicants who request the assistance ``[t]o the extent possible with available funds.'' Similarly, North Dakota's rules at NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;02 (introductory text) also require that the Commission pay costs for qualified applicants who request the assistance ``[t]o the extent possible with available funds.'' Therefore, the Director finds North Dakota's proposed revisions to the introductory text of NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2), when read in light of the regulatory limitations at NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;02, to be no less stringent than section 507(c)(1) of SMCRA and no less effective in meeting SMCRA's requirements as set forth in the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 795.9(a). Based on the discussion above, the Director is approving the proposed changes to the introductory text of NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2). b. NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2)(a), Probable Hydrologic Consequences North Dakota proposed to create new NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2)(a) to incorporate a portion of original NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2) allowing the commission's possible assumption, for qualified SOAP applicants, of the cost of the determination of probable hydrologic consequences (PHC determination) required by NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;14(1)(o) and to specify that such costs include the engineering analyses and designs necessary for the PHC determination. Proposed NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2)(a) is substantively similar to and is no less stringent than section 507(c)(1)(A) of SMCRA. Accordingly, the Director is approving proposed NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2)(a). c. NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2)(b), Development of Cross Sections, Maps and Plans North Dakota proposed to create new NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2)(b) allowing the Commission's possible assumption, for qualified SOAP applicants, of the cost of the development of cross sections, maps, and plans required by NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;14(1)(r). Proposed NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2)(b) is substantively similar to and is no less stringent than section 507(c)(1)(B) of SMCRA. Accordingly, the Director is approving proposed NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2)(b). d. NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2)(c), Geologic Drilling
