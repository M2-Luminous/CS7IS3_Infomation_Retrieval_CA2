An air pollutant detector will come onto the market before the end of the current year in the shape of the highly sensitive ``Bio-Check F'' pocket meter, which is based on biomolecular detection principles. Unlike conventional metering methods, which are so complicated that they can only be applied by specialists and are laboratory-dependent, this device can be used easily, rapidly, and anywhere by anyone, and is also reasonably priced. This will encourage widespread use in the interests of improving health and environmental protection. The main factors that had to be guaranteed in developing a reliable system that private individuals could use to measure the formaldehyde concentration in the air indoors were high sensitivity, easy use, and low production costs. An indicator surface on the ``Bio-Check F'' changes color from white through pink to red, and comparison with a color-code strip shows whether the formaldehyde concentration in the air is below the maximum recommended indoor level, is equal to it, or exceeds it. It is thus just as easy to use as, for example, an alcohol level test for drivers. The new detector also brings the cost of formaldehyde measurement way below (to less than a third of) that of the laboratory process needed to date. Formaldehyde is widely used as a basic ingredient for synthetic resins. The gas, which in its pure form is colorless and gives off a pungent smell, is used in the production of amino plastics and phenolic plastics, which in turn are ingredients of products such as adhesives, synthetic foams, insulating materials, floor coverings, and textiles (which it renders crease-resistant). If formaldehyde is released by the glues used in furniture, wall coverings, and chipboard, or by furnishing fabrics, it can cause discomfort or even, in higher concentrations, constitute a health hazard. The Federal Health Authority therefore recommends 0.1 ppm (parts per million) as the threshold value for air quality assessment purposes in the home, in schools, and in other indoor environments. In other words, the formaldehyde concetration ought not to exceed one 10-millionth by volume, for example 0.1 milliliter per cubic meter. The new measuring system is enzyme-based. These biological catalysts make it possible to single out and register only the substance to be measured. To perform the measurement, the system is activated by pressing the base of a phial in the measuring device with the thumb, thus breaking it. The liquid thus released flows into a small, permeable, sintered glass rod, where it activates the freeze-dried enzymes and the reagents. Of the molecules that diffuse over the surface of the glass rod, the only ones converted are those ``recognized'' by the enzyme contained there (formaldehyde dehydrogenase). As a result, pigment molecules form on the surface of the rod. The color change that takes place after two hours can be evaluated using a color comparison strip.
