"It is very important to build up our relationship with the democratic leaders in Russia as well as Central and East Europe," he said. "They are our friends. They have new and democratic institutions and they have liberalised their economies. "Russia has a hugely important part to play in the world. The relationship between Russia and NATO can only be to the benefit of both sides. We have been seeking at this meeting to build a stable framework for the most profound changes in modern history." Mr. Major went to meet NATO military chiefs, including the Supreme Allied Commander Europe, General George Joulwan, and the chairman of the Military Committee, Field Marshal Sir Dick Vincent. He wanted to hear their advice about what action was feasible in Bosnia and how the summit's decisions to open NATO doors to the East could be implemented.
