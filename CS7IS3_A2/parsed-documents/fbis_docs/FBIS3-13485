After the meeting, which lasted about 75 minutes, Ross said they discussed the PLO's commitment to resuming the peace negotiations and its commitment to the Declaration of Principles. He said they also discussed a number of topics, including Palestinian concerns about the situation in the occupied territories and commitments related to the peace process. Ross said that the most important thing is to finish these negotiations and start implementing the Declaration of Principles. What concerns us, he said, is to see a change in the situation on the ground, new realities in the region, and the implementation of the Declaration of Principles. Before meeting with 'Arafat, Ross met with the Israeli delegation led by Jacques Neriya, the Israeli prime minister's adviser, who arrived in Tunis today.
