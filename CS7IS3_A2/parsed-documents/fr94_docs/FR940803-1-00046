FR940803-1-00046 FR940803-1-00010 Paperwork Reduction Act This notice of proposed rulemaking contains information collection requirements in the form of written or computerized training and testing schedules under the proposed §§192.809 and 195.509, and recordkeeping to substantiate the training and testing of personnel under the proposed §§192.819 and 195.519. These paperwork requirements are necessary to properly implement 49 U.S.C. §60102. The operator would develop the schedules and prepare and maintain the personnel training and testing records for proper performance of the proposed rule. However, pipeline operators with adequately qualified personnel currently have such records of training and testing. For persons newly trained and tested under the requirements of this proposal, much of the information required for the personnel records would be available in the required qualification schedules. None of these information collection requirements would be prepared for the purpose of submittal to RSPA. These proposed information collection requirements have been submitted to the OMB for approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. Chap. 35) and 5 CFR 1320 under the following: ADMINISTRATION: Department of Transportation, Research and Special Programs Administration; TITLE: Qualification of Pipeline Personnel; NEED FOR INFORMATION: To prevent pipeline incidents and accidents by assuring the competency of pipeline personnel through training, testing, and periodic refresher training; PROPOSED USE OF INFORMATION: To ensure pipeline personnel have the necessary knowledge and skills to competently perform regulated operation, maintenance, and emergency response functions; FREQUENCY: On occasion; BURDEN ESTIMATE: $2.5 million (initially), and $0.9 million (annually) thereafter; RESPONDENTS: Operators subject to CFR Parts 192 & 195; FORM(S): None; AVERAGE BURDEN HOURS PER RESPONDENT: 1.8 hours (initially), and 0.7 hours (annually). For further information contact: The Information Management Division, M&hyph;34, Office of the Secretary of Transportation, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590, Tel. (202) 366&hyph;4735. Comments on the proposed information collection requirements should be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Washington, DC 20503, Attn: Desk Officer for Department of Transportation, Research and Special Programs Administration. It is requested that comments sent to OMB also be sent to the RSPA rulemaking docket for this proposed action.
