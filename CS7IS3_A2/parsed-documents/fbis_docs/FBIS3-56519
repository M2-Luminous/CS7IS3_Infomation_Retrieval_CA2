Addressing a press conference after the government session on 11 January, the premier pleaded that the government was taking account of the danger of expansion of Russian capital, taking measures and keeping the situation under control. While keeping tabs on the activities of major monopolies of the neighbor country in the national economy, however, the government does not intend to interfere in specific deals. Answering a question about possible restrictions on Russian capital in Estonia, Mr. Laar said that there was no need for that. It would be a rash act for Estonia to bar the inflow of capital, investments, and the creation of joint firms with businessmen from any country in the East or in the West. "This would be disastrous for us," he underscored. In this connection the prime minister sharply criticized the president's call to support Estonian capital exclusively. "I am not idolizing Estonian capital," he stated quoting the Chinese aphorism about cats of different colors: white or black, it doesn't matter if they catch mice. "We are only against major monopolies" that would be able to gain inordinate influence here. As for Russia, it is second to Finland today as Estonia's trading partner, as regards import and export, according to the Estonian Finance Ministry. Commodity circulation in the third quarter of 1993 amounted to nearly 1 million cronas. Russia's share in Estonian export reaches 20 percent and nearly 19 percent in import. Estonia boasts a small but positive balance in its trade with Russia. Cars are in first place in importance in the overall export structure of Estonia. In the first quarter this export item accounted for 185 million cronas; in the second, 230; and in the third, 320. Buying cars in the West, Estonian firms keep about a third of them, selling the greater part in the East at a profit. There is a small stream of cars flowing in from East to West (Zhiguli and Moskvich cars). This is, according to Sergey Trofimov, chief specialist of Estonia's Finance Ministry, quite normal business: buy low and sell high. In fourth place is fuel: 174 million cronas in the third quarter of 1993. This business is also quite legitimate. Estonia buys fuel from Russia and resells it at a profit in the West. Notably, Russian firms often ask Estonian firms to act as brokers. The fifth position is taken by nonferrous metals. Their export in the third quarter was worth 170 million cronas. The amount of these metals imported by Estonia, according to Mr. Trofimov, was worth several tens of million of cronas. Where does the metals for export come from? First, from pilfering inside the country. Second, it is being smuggled out of Russia. Notably, both countries make money in the process. True, in Russia it is private persons rather than the state. But this situation is likely to change after Russia takes full control on its side of the border. And finally, on 11 January, the Estonian Government confirmed a treaty with Russia on cooperation in the area of standardization, certification, and metrology, which would also promote trade between the two countries.
