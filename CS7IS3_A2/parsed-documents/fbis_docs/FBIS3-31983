President Cesar Gaviria has appointed Manuel Rodriguez as this agency's first minister. Rodriguez was director of the government's Institute for the Development of Renewable Natural Resources (Inderena), an organization that will be liquidated shortly. The Congress of the Republic approved the creation of the Environment Ministry last year. The guidelines, planning, and implementation of this ministry will be financed by a special transfer of resources, Rodriguez stated when he accepted the position. Colombia is a country rich in natural resources, but those resources have suffered a serious erosion during the past years due to the high levels of contamination and deforestation to allow for the emergence of "concrete jungles." The government has announced, however, that it will launch a strong environmental protection policy, which the new agency will coordinated.
