According to this contract, Xiamen University is to train internationally recognized advanced engineering specialists for modern business aircraft repair to meet the needs of the company. In recent years, with the increasing demand of advanced management personnel and special technical experts, many foreign investors have approached Chinese educational institutes for training their staff. Along China's coastal areas, schools and the educational funds supported by foreign investors are increasing. Many universities have cooperated with foreign investors in training their staff by various means. Prominent universities like Beijing, Qinghua and Fudan Universities are the first choices for advanced management personnel training. It is calculated that the expenses in training advanced management staff in China is only about one percent of that in the United States. At present, among the already operating foreign-funded enterprises, eighty percent of their management staff members are Chinese. Largely trained with funding from abroad, many have been assigned to other affiliations in other countries.
