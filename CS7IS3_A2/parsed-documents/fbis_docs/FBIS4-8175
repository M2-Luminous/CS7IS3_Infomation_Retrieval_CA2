President Karadzic said Russian diplomats would try to bridge the current gap between the Serb side and the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR]. The talks between Churkin and Karadzic lasted almost an hour. The Russian envoy said he was immediately leaving for Sarajevo, where he should meet UNPROFOR officials. "I hope to return [to Pale] this evening to resume talks with president Karadzic," Churkin added. Srpska republic president Radovan Karadzic told reporters that the previous crisis (NATO ultimatum on 20 February) had been successfully resolved owing to Churkin. "However, now we do not know how to find a way out of this situation, but we know for certain that UNPROFOR has abused the presence of UN representatives,, blamed the Serbs for the attacks, and bombed our positions," Karadzic said. "We do not see how we can cooperate with UNPROFOR when they have sided with one of the sides in the civil war. However, the Russian diplomacy will try to bridge the gap between us and UNPROFOR," Karadzic said. It is expected that talks between Karadzic and Churkin will be resumed later this evening after the Russian envoy returns from the Muslim part of Sarajevo.
