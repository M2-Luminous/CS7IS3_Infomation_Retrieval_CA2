The president also denied that he wanted to reduce Guzman's sentence to life imprisonment. The president was obviously answering an alarming piece of news disseminated by television on 16 February, according to which the government signed a 10-point "peace agreement" with Guzman that included an item on improving Guzman's prison conditions and ended with a general amnesty for him and his henchmen. It was good for Fujimori to have denied in Bogota the existence of such a pact because it worried some groups of people -- which possibly constitute a majority of the population -- who worry more about the severity with which they think terrorists should be treated than for the alleged trampling of their human rights. These groups reacted with indignation when President Fujimori said he had granted Guzman and Iparraguirre preferential treatment in order to get them to write the letters calling for peace. This indignation was reflected in the polls at the time. We will never know how many "Yes" votes [for the approval of the new Constitution] he lost with that revelation. He should not then repeat the mistake by stumbling on the same rock again. Guzman's letters had the positive effect of creating great confusion among Shining Path cadres, true, and encouraging a split between their leaders and militants. But they have not stopped the violence, which has continued. This continued violence has made many people doubt government policies on the matter, believing that they are unnecessarily indulgent with individuals who do not deserve anything other than the harshest punishment. In fact, as we proposed in this column earlier, the efficient Justice Minister Fernando Vega Santa-Gadea should make public a detailed report on Guzman's imprisonment conditions and what assurances we have that he will not be able to leave his jail until the end of his days. The television crew who filmed him without his striped uniform, warmly calling for an unconvincing pacification, should now show us where he is and who he is talking to. Because we still have the bitter taste of his letter with instructions to Scandinavian Shining Path followers, which was first published by EXPRESO, and the fact that no one was able to explain how the letter left the jail, first, and how it left the country, second.
