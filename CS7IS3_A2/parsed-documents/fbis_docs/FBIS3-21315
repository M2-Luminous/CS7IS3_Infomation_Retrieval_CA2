Raja Mohan: "U.S. Sees India as a Big Emerging Market"] [Text] Washington, Jan. 25--The Clinton Administration continues to send mixed signals to India. Even as the White House puts out letters signed by the U.S. President, Mr. Bill Clinton, with remarks on Kashmir, Punjab and human rights that are needlessly offensive to India, senior economic policy makers in the administration are pointing out the emerging economic opportunities in India and the absence of a political initiative in Washington to consolidate these opportunities. The U.S. Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade, Mr. Jeffrey E. Garten has said that as the economic reform gathers momentum, India may be "in a position to provide significant commercial opportunities for U.S. firms throughout the 1990s. Addressing the American Foreign Policy Association in New York late last week, Mr. Garten expressed the hope of the Clinton Administration to "develop a more regular, higher profile commercial policy dialogue with India in the future." Larger strategic framework: Mr. Garten's reference to India was part of a larger strategic framework being developed by the U.S. Commerce Department to engage the "big emerging markets" (BEMs), such as China, Indonesia, South Korea, India, Turkey, South Africa, Poland, Argentina, Brazil and Mexico. Although Japan and Western Europe are likely to remain the biggest markets for the United States, Mr. Garten suggests that the "big emerging markets," hold--far more promise for large incremental gains in exports." He estimates that nearly three-fourths of the growth in world trade in the next two decades is likely to take place in the developing world--much of it occurring in the big emerging markets. The BEMs are likely to double their share in world GDP in that time, to 20 percent from today's 10 percent. By the year 2010, according to Mr. Garten, the share of the BEMs in world imports is likely to exceed that of Japan and the European Union combined. Talking of the new commercial opportunities in India, Mr. Garten has urged the reinvigoration of "dormant U.S.-Indian Government-to-Government economic and commercial forums, and encourage the involvement of business groups." In a reference to the Indian expatriate community in the United States, Mr. Garten believes that the U.S. business community and the Government should find ways of working with them," whose familiarity and ties with India would be invaluable." The expanded Indo-U.S. commercial dialogue, according to Mr. Garten, should cover not only issues such as intellectual property rights, workers rights, and market access, but also procedures for export financing and export licensing. The U.S. Commerce Department, which is laying the ground for a comprehensive commercial initiative towards the BEMs, believes that the advanced industrial nations may have to compete fiercely for a share of these markets. Mr. Garten notes that since the Indian economic reforms began, top European leaders have visited India to pursue enhanced commercial ties. He also records that the Prime Minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, has travelled to Germany, Japan, France, and South Korea with a "commercial agenda in hand." Mr. Garten notes that "America has been conspicuously absent from this flow." He insists "this must change." The incipient American strategy towards the BEMs understands the need for "deft balancing" of commercial and foreign policy considerations. The close coexistence of commercial opportunities with the problems of "human rights, worker rights, nuclear non-proliferation, and violations of intellectual property rights," poses difficult policy dilemmas. Mr. Garten recognises the independent political aspirations of these countries, who "often effectively challenge U.S. policies in multi-lateral organisations, such as the IMF, GATT and the United Nations." Voices beginning to be heard: The inability of the South Asia Bureau in the U.S. State Department to find that appropriate balance between different American interests in India that has brought the high expectations just a year ago on Indo-U.S. relations crashing down. It has been stuck with the tiresome agenda of human rights, preventive diplomacy on Kashmir, and non-proliferation, without any reference to the larger economic opportunities for the United States, that are emerging not only in India, but also in other parts of the Sub-Continent. The letter-writing from the White House has not helped either. But other voices in the Clinton administration, most notably the Commerce Department, are at least beginning to be heard. It may be recalled that the announcement of the Prime Minister's visit to the United States early this year came from Ms. Joan Spero, U.S. Under Secretary of State for Economic and Agricultural Affairs. Ms. Spero was putting Mr. Rao's visit in the context of the new emphasis in Washington on economic diplomacy. It may yet be possible that the U.S. policy towards India could get a better balance, as the Clinton administration sorts out the current chaos in its foreign policymaking. PTI reports from Delhi: Additional access to Indian garments: The United States has agreed to accord additional access of about 40 million square metres over and above the notional level of about 500 million square metres for Indian garments in the current calendar year under the new Indo-U.S. textile agreement. Both the countries signed an agreement on Saturday last in Washington, after three days of intense negotiations, an official release said today. For other cotton made-ups, including hand-loom made-ups, an enhanced 115 percent had been provided, which is of the order of 13 million square metres. For pajamas and nightwears, gent's jackets, which were under unilateral specific limit have now been shifted to Group I with bilaterally agreed specific limit. Similarly, items under category 338/339 (cotton T-shirts), category 315 (twills), category 326 (satins) which were hitherto covered by Group II limit have also been shifted to Group I with specific limit. In the case of category 351/651 and category 334/634, improvement of 15 percent had been provided and in the case of 338/639, an uplift of 50 percent have been provided.
