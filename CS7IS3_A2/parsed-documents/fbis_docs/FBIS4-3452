Inflation was showing no sign of improvement and urgent action was needed to combat soaring prices, the People's Bank of China Vice Governor Dai Xianglong said at a national financial conference in Shanghai. Investment in fixed assets, seen as a primary cause of China's continuing high inflation rate, was still too large, Mr Dai said. He said the bank would tighten its control over credit in this area. However, the vice-governor emphasised that the bank would continue to provide loss-making, state-run enterprises with operating funds to ensure they would survive the credit crunch. "As some state-owned enterprises are facing increasing financial difficulties, banks will extend loans for operational funds on a case-by-case basis," Mr Dai was quoted by Xinhua (the New China News Agency) as saying. Figures released by the State Statistical Bureau this week showed that 49.6 per cent of all state-run enterprises are losing money, with losses in the first quarter totalling 15.7 billion yuan (about HK$13.89 billion). Factors contributing to the struggles of the state-owned enterprises include tightened investment and reduced supply of materials, Mr Dai said. Another factor was that state-owned enterprises which have been transformed into stock-holding or joint venture companies ceased to have their production included in state-sector statistics. "We must remain cool-headed," he was quoted as saying, adding that the bank would continue to focus on currency stabilisation to ensure an appropriate rate of economic growth. Western financial analysts said the People's Bank would face a difficult balancing act if it was to restrict credit but still provide enough money to bail out state enterprises. "I think they have adopted the right approach in clamping down on loans to fixed-asset investment projects but still an awful lot of new credit will be needed to keep these loss-making enterprises afloat," said the manager of a Western bank in Shanghai. "There is also the risk that loans made for operational funds will get diverted into risky investment projects," the banker said. "The central bank unfortunately still has very little control of where loans eventually end up," he said. Analysts pointed out that even though the economic austerity, or rectification programme, had been in place for nearly a year, economic growth was still in double figures and inflation had continued to rise, almost on a monthly basis. Inflation in some key cities is already at more than 30 per cent and the government is clearly concerned that if prices continue to rise it could be faced with a renewed bout of social unrest. Control of prices has been made the top priority and municipal officials have been ordered to regularly check the prices of food, services and other daily necessities to ensure inflation does not get any worse. However, analysts consider the actions so far by the government could be too little, too late.
