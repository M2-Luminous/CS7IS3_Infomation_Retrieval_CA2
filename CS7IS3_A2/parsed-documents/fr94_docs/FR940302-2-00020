FR940302-2-00020 FR940302-2-00008 (3) The cash deposit rate for subject merchandise exported by an exporter not covered in this review, a prior review, or the original investigation, but where the manufacturer of the merchandise has been covered by this or a prior final results or determination will be based upon the most recently published company-specific rate for that manufacturer, and (4) The cash deposit rate for merchandise exported by all other manufacturers and exporters who are not covered by these or any previous administrative review conducted by the Department will be the ``all others'' rate established in the LTFV investigation. On March 25, 1993, the Court of International Trade (CIT), in Floral Trade Council v. United States, Slip Op. 93&hyph;79, and Federal-Mogul Corporation v. United States, Slip Op. 93&hyph;83, decided that once an ``all others'' rates is established for a company, it can only be changed through an administrative review. The Department has determined that in order to implement these decisions, it is appropriate to reinstate the original ``all others'' rate from the LTFV investigation (or that rate as amended for correction of clerical errors or as a result of litigation) in the proceeding governed by antidumping duty orders. Because this proceeding is governed by an antidumping duty order, the ``all others'' rate for the purposes of this review will be 6.32 percent, the ``all others'' rate established in the LTFV investigation (56 FR 25660, June 5, 1991). These deposit requirements, when imposed, shall remain in effect until publication of the final results of the next administrative review. This notice also serves as a preliminary reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during this review period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties. This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act and 19 CFR 353.22. Dated: February 22, 1994. Joseph A. Spetrini, Acting Assistant Secretary for Import Administration. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;4775 Filed 3&hyph;2&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;DS&hyph;P
