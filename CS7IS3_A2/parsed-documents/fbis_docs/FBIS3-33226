Rojas] [Text] The Defense Ministry, through General Rafael Montero Revette, has reported that leaders of the bloody 4 February and 27 November coup attempts have expressed to the government their interest in reaching agreements to resolve the current situation. Gen. Montero said there are no preexisting conditions for dismissing the proceedings against them. Gen Montero, who arrived with High Military Command members, met with President Rafael Caldera at the Miraflores presidential building. Montero said informal talks have been held with the coupists who fled to Peru on 27 November but that these contacts have not been held at the Defense Ministry level. There is great interest in resolving the problem, not only for those imprisoned in Venezuela, but for those living abroad as well. Francisco Visconti and other exiles asked about their legal situation and were told that everything was status quo. Montero said the coupists are willing to return, but the government has not established any prerequisites for their return. "No one has been told to apply for discharge," he said. This government position was also reported to Commander Hugo Chavez, who has not been pressured to request his discharge. The minister said he has not personally talked to Chavez. "But I know he has every intention of helping to solve the detained officers' problem." Montero denied Chavez has demanded his proceedings be dismissed based on a decision to discharge him. Montero said none of the officers have been pressured in this sense. In addition, Montero said the Armed Forces and the government will help those who ask to be discharged to get a job so they do not have any problems. The files of those who do not request to be discharged will be studied carefully but none will be forced to request it. All of the files are being studied. Some of them have been approved and the officers have been released. Others will probably be released, too. The Military Justice Administration, Legal Advisory Office, and Defense Ministry are currently considering each of the files. [Rojas] Will the officers benefited by dismissing the proceedings remain in the Armed Forces? [Montero] Probably. [Rojas] Can you guarantee that they will not become a reason for division in the Armed Forces should they be readmitted? [Montero] We will first consider who will be reinstated. Montero finally referred to rumors that Venezuelan businessmen support Colombian guerrillas at the border. The minister said the Military Intelligence Directorate is investigating, but he does not believe there are "Venezuelan traitors."
