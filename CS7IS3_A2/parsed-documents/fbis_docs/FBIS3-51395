Mr. Monde, who addressed a news conference, pointedly refuted the label of extremist. Recalling his past as a Duvalierist militant and his current democratic commitment, he stated that only God and idiots do not change. The Haitian democracy must be a struggle of ideas but not of men, he added, while coming out in favor of a national conference to get out of the crisis. We, Haitians, must sit around a table to work out a strategy to get out of the crisis, a strategy that would honor the country, he stated. [passage omitted] Monde said he is against reducing the Haitian Army as requested by some political sectors, but he does wish to create a police force to solve the problem of repression in Haiti. [passage omitted] Furthermore, he pointed out that he had warned the officials of the Revolutionary Front Haitian Advancement and Progress, FRAPH, the main neo-Duvalier party, that he would not tolerate a deputy being manhandled or persecuted by this group. He met with the leader of this group, Mr. Louis Jodel Chamblain. Any deputy must be able to go to his district, he pointed out, while saying he is ready, if necessary, to accompany some parliamentarians. He also assured the press of his support, asserting that he will firmly intervene every time a journalist has problems in fulfilling his duty. [passage omitted]
