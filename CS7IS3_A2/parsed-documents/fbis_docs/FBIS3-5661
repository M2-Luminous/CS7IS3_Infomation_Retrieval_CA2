For many years, they were imported from foreign countries to meet popular demand. Thus, the production of Pepsi did not take place in Vietnam until after the lifting of the U.S. trade embargo and a spectacular yet harsh competition has already occurred in the Vietnamese market between Coca-Cola and Pepsi. The question to ponder is: Two major U.S. soft drink companies are already operating in Vietnam. What will happen to our soft drink companies? Will they survive or die? Some 20 U.S. construction companies have tendered bids for the construction of many segments of National Highway No. 1 with loans and funding from various international monetary and financial institutions. Dozens of other U.S. companies specializing in different sectors have also brought their goods, machinery, equipment, and technology to the Giang Vo Trade Fair in Hanoi. More American companies are expected to do business in Vietnam. Research results released by some American companies indicate that within the next two years, business activity in Vietnam will reach as much as 2.7 billion dollars. Needless to say, there will be harsh competition among American companies themselves, between American companies and other foreign companies, and between American companies and Vietnamese companies. Therefore, it can be said that with the lifting of the U.S. embargo, we enjoy an opportunity and also face a challenge. It is an opportunity because the lifting of the trade embargo provides us with a very good chance -- provided that we are smart and vigilant -- to have access to capital and modern technology to develop new trades and occupations, increase economic activities, and generate more jobs, thereby turning the strong points of the outside world into our own strength. Meanwhile, we face a not-too-insignificant challenge. American companies all have huge financial assets with billions of dollars at their disposal. Furthermore, they have the best technology in the world. As for our companies, it is difficult to compare them with their American counterparts in all respects. Therefore, as far as direct business transactions are concerned, it will be very easy for us to lose if we are not wise enough. As for macro-management, to be strong enough to compete in future business activities, we need to initiate the following tasks as soon as possible: -- Forming large economic groups which are financially strong enough to compete. Each group must have at least several thousand billion dong as capital. -- Taking urgent steps to train a contingent of management cadres who are highly professional, business-wise, and quick at mastering modern technology. Good cadres and capital are the minimum basic conditions for new business activities. To succeed in forming large economic groups, the first decisive factor rests with unity. In wartime, all of our people remained united in the struggle to wrest back independence and do away with the shame of losing our country. At present, let all of us unite in the struggle to make the country powerful and eliminate poverty and backwardness. Let our economic units merge into large groups to work toward our common goals. The workstyle that we have followed so far in which small-scale business activities prevail, every businessman is for himself, and everyone pursues short-term profits at the expense of common interests will only harm us and weaken our potential. That workstyle is no longer suitable with large-scale business activities in the days ahead. It is also worth noting that while doing business in Vietnam, all major foreign economic companies or groups of companies must abide by Vietnamese law. Therefore, in macro-management, it is necessary for the state to perfect the legal system and where necessary, work out incentives to encourage foreign business people to invest in those preferred foreign-funded projects and limit investment where local investors can manage or in those projects which do not meet Vietnam's conditions and economic development requirements. Competition plays an essential role in the market mechanism. Business operations are under state management. Nonetheless, the decisive factor of success rests primarily with the strength of each economic unit and with the potential of our country as a whole.
