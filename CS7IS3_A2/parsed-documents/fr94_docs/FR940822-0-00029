FR940822-0-00029 FR940822-0-00009 (2) Diesel fuel. The October 1, 1993, floor stocks tax does not apply to diesel fuel held exclusively for an exempt use. In determining whether diesel fuel is held exclusively for an exempt use, the following rules in paragraphs (a)(2) (i) through (iv) of this section apply: (i) An exempt use, with respect to diesel fuel, is any use of diesel fuel (other than use in producing a diesel fuel/alcohol mixture or as fuel in a diesel-powered train) that is described in section 6427 and that entitles the ultimate purchaser to a credit or payment equal to the tax imposed by section 4091. Thus, for example, exempt uses of diesel fuel include use other than as a fuel in a diesel-powered highway vehicle (as defined in ยง48.4041&hyph;8(b)(4) of this chapter), use on a farm for farming purposes, exclusive use by a State or local government or nonprofit educational organization, and use in an off-highway business use. (ii) Diesel fuel held for use in a diesel-powered train is not exempt from the October 1, 1993, floor stocks tax under this paragraph (a)(2) unless the fuel is held by a State or local government. Thus, the exemptions for use other than as fuel in a diesel-powered highway vehicle and off-highway business use do not apply to fuel used in a diesel-powered train. See section 6427(l)(3) as amended by section 13241 of the Act. (iii) Diesel fuel is held exclusively for an exempt use only if the person that holds the fuel at the first moment of October 1, 1993, actually uses the diesel fuel in an exempt use. (iv) Diesel fuel is not held exclusively for an exempt use if, at the first moment of October 1, 1993, the diesel fuel is held for resale (including resale to a person that will use the diesel fuel in an exempt use). Thus, for example, diesel fuel held by a retailer for sale to a construction company for use in the construction company's off-road machinery is not exempt from the October 1, 1993, floor stocks tax. However, the construction company would be eligible to claim a credit or payment equal to the tax under section 6427. (3) Aviation fuel. The October 1, 1993, floor stocks tax does not apply to aviation fuel held exclusively for an exempt use. In determining whether aviation fuel is held exclusively for an exempt use, the following rules in paragraphs (a)(3) (i) through (iii) of this section apply: (i) An exempt use, with respect to aviation fuel, is any use of aviation fuel that is described in section 6427 and that entitles the ultimate purchaser to a credit or payment equal to the tax imposed by section 4091. Thus, for example, exempt use of aviation fuel includes any use on a farm for farming purposes, exclusive use by a State or local government or nonprofit educational organization, and use other than use as a fuel in an aircraft in noncommercial aviation (as defined in section 4041(c)). (ii) Aviation fuel is held exclusively for an exempt use only if the person that holds the aviation fuel at the first moment of October 1, 1993, actually uses the aviation fuel in an exempt use. (iii) Aviation fuel is not held exclusively for an exempt use if, at the first moment of October 1, 1993, the aviation fuel is held for resale (including resale to a person that will use the aviation fuel in an exempt use). Thus, for example, aviation fuel held by a fixed-base operator for sale to an airline for use in commercial aviation is not exempt from the October 1, 1993, floor stocks tax. However, the airline would be eligible to claim a credit or payment equal to the tax under section 6427. (b) Exception for gasoline or diesel fuel held in vehicle fuel supply tank. The October 1, 1993, floor stocks tax does not apply to gasoline or diesel fuel held at the first moment of October 1, 1993, in the fuel supply tank of a motor vehicle (as defined in ยง48.4041&hyph;8(c) of this chapter) or motorboat. This exception does not apply to fuel held in the fuel supply tank of a train or an aircraft. (c) Exception for certain amounts of fuel _(1) In general. The October 1, 1993, floor stocks tax does not apply to_ (i) Gasoline that a person holds at the first moment of October 1, 1993, if the aggregate amount of gasoline held by that person at that moment does not exceed 4,000 gallons; and (ii) Diesel fuel or aviation fuel that a person holds at the first moment of October 1, 1993, if the aggregate amount of diesel fuel or the aggregate amount of aviation fuel held by that person at that moment does not exceed 2,000 gallons. (2) Additional rules _(i) Coordination with other exemptions. In determining the aggregate amount of gasoline, diesel fuel, or aviation fuel held by a person at the first moment of October 1, 1993, there is excluded the amount of gasoline, diesel fuel, or aviation fuel exempt from the October 1, 1993, floor stocks tax by reason of paragraph (a) of this section (relating to fuel held for exempt uses), or paragraph (b) of this section (relating to gasoline and diesel fuel held in the fuel supply tank of a motor vehicle or motorboat). (ii) All amounts held subject to tax if threshold exceeded. The October 1, 1993, floor stocks tax applies to all amounts of gasoline, diesel fuel, or aviation fuel (as the case may be) held by a person (and not exempt from tax under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section) if the aggregate amount of fuel held by the person at the first moment of October 1, 1993, exceeds 4,000 gallons in the case of gasoline or 2,000 gallons in the case of diesel fuel or aviation fuel.
