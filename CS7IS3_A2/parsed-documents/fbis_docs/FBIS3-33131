Carles is the presidential candidate for the Nationalist Liberal Republican Movement, National Renewal Movement, and Civic Renewal Party. "Not enough has been done to combat the corruption inherited from past regimes, since it is not enough to denounce them. Corruption continues to seriously harm the interests of the Treasury, government functions, and the majority of the people," the former comptroller general added. Carles indicated that privileges, concessions, pacts, bribes, and the "play it smart" attitude are the norm for persons who corrupt others and for corrupt persons who are bleeding the state and the people who strive for a better country. "The multiplication of these illegal and criminal activities that range from fixing fines and bonds to drug trafficking and money laundering undermine a citizen's chance to obtain greater progress and freedom," he noted. [passage omitted] According to the presidential candidate, "widespread" unemployment is another consequence of the corruption in the state bureaucracy, which has tentacles that reach the major public services and which does not meet the essential needs of all Panamanians for health, housing, transportation, communications, electricity, and water. He said the inefficiency and deficiency of public services constitutes one of the clearest examples of the "prevalence of corruption" that feeds on institutionalized immunity through a series of provisions and laws that allow influence peddling, something that is a slap in the face of the people and prevents national and international investments.
