FR940304-2-00151 FR940304-2-00079 IV Accordingly, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12, the subject exemption is authorized by law, will not present an undue risk to the public health and safety, and is consistent with the common defense and security. The Commission further determines that special circumstances, as provided in 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(v), are present justifying the exemption; namely, that the exemption would provide only temporary relief from the applicable regulations and that the licensee has made good faith efforts to comply with the regulations. Therefore, the Commission hereby approves the following exemption: Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant, Unit No. 2, may operate without conforming to the requirements of GDC&hyph;2 as they apply to the exposed portions of the support systems for EDG Nos. 12 and 21 providing that the compensatory measure as described herein is in place for the period of the exemption. Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that granting the above exemption will have no significant impact on the quality of the human environment (February 17, 1994, 59 FR 8033). The subject Unit No. 1 EDG No. 11 upgrade GDC&hyph;2 exemption if effective from its date of issuance through May 15, 1994. Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 23rd day of February 1994.
