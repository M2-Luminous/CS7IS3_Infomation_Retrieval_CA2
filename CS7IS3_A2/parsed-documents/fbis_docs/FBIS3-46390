The preparatory work, which began at the end of 1991 and is expected to be completed eight months ahead of schedule, has cost about 1.2 billion yuan (about 137 million U.S. dollars). Infrastructure for the project, including facilities for transport, water and electric supplies, telecommunications and facilities to house the construction workers, has been completed. Roads totalling 60 km, covering the construction site, have opened to traffic. The Yellow River bridge, or Huang He bridge, which ranks first in China in handling capacity, has been built. The rail transshipment station, which is expected to handle nearly one million tons of materials and equipment, is also nearing completion. During a recent inspection of the construction site, Deputy Minister of Water Conservancy Zhang Chunyuan urged all the workers to continue to work hard so that the principal part of the project will start this year. Located about 130 km downstream from the Sanmen Gorges Dam in central China's Henan Province, the Xiaolangdi Water Control Project has a designed storage capacity of 12.6 billion cubic meters. Experts say that the 11-year project, together with other reservoirs nearby, will enable the lower reaches of the river to resist the level of a flood that occurs only once in one thousand years, instead of its present water-control capacity of only once in dozens of years. The project will make it possible to basically eliminate ice runs plaguing the lower reaches and prevent the Yellow River bed in the lower reaches from silting and rising, which has been a constant problem for hundreds of years. The project will cost hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars. Part of the project will use loans from the World Bank, and international bidding will be invited for the undertaking.
