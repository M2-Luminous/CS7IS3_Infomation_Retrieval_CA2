The Tatar leaders rejoice that they have finally, after a three-year tug-of-war, wrenched from Moscow recognition of their independence. Boris Yeltsin is pleased that he had been able to remove from the document a clearly separatist spirit expunging the former autonomous entity's sovereignty slogans. The authorities of the other republics, components of Russia, are hoping to use the path beaten by Tatarstan. But yesterday seems to have become critical for the future of the Federation Treaty, upon which, some people some time ago were going to build "a new, stable Russian statehood." [passage omitted] The Tatar leaders sacrificed political rhetoric for getting all the benefits in the economic sphere. It is these agreements (especially the budget agreement), rather than the treaty itself, that were the hardest to secure. The day before, the republic's premier admitted that "Boris Fedorov's departure made the entire process substantially easier." The historic Tuesday is nevertheless fraught precisely with political complications. Its smaller consequence consists in the fact that the concluded treaty is not going to add predictability in relationships between Moscow and Kazan: Even if Tatarstan contravenes the constitution of the former autonomous entity, nobody there for this reason will alter their own Fundamental Law, by Mr. Sabirov's admission. This signifies that also still remaining is the legal basis for fresh claims (should they arise) to the federal authority. Thus, when Boris Yeltsin states that the treaty is going to be a model "of removing differences between the federal and republican constitutions," he, to put it mildly, overestimates the achievement. Here is the greater consequence: Russia has a further 87 regions, not counting Chechnya. The new federal constitution has proclaimed them all equal. The question "If the Tatars can do it, why can't we?" is quite natural. Why should the other regional leaders swallow this treaty in silence? By the way, their kurultay -- the Federation Council -- already wants to consider the Russo- Tatar treaty at its session, for precisely these reasons, it seems. [passage omitted]
