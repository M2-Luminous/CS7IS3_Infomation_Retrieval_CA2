II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, the CSE included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The CSE has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant parts of such statements. A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change 1. Purpose The purpose of the rule filing is to extend for 90 days the Exchange's pilot program governing preferenced trading. The Commission originally approved the pilot in February 1991, and subsequently extended the pilot several times. The pilot is currently approved through May 7, 1994. 3 3 See Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 29524 (August 5, 1991), 56 FR 38160; 30353 (February 7, 1992), 57 FR 5918; 31011 (August 7, 1992), 57 FR 38704; and 32280 (May 7, 1993), 58 FR 28422. On February 25, 1994, the CSE filed a rule change containing certain proposals to further enhance the quality of its market, including a proposed prohibition against ``auto-quoting'' and limitations on the maximum spread which exchange specialists could quote in the stocks in which they make markets. 4 Further, on March 31, 1994, the CSE filed a rule change which would make its preferencing pilot permanent. 5 The Commission's staff has requested that the Exchange seek an interim 90 day extension of the preferencing pilot in order to afford the Commission the opportunity to consider the relationship between the quality of markets proposal and the preferencing program. 6 4 See SR&hyph;CSE&hyph;94&hyph;01; Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33849 (April 1, 1994), 59 FR 16870. 5 See SR&hyph;CSE&hyph;94&hyph;01. In its filing for permanent approval, the Exchange requests that two restrictions of the pilot be lifted: first, the number of preferred securities be expanded beyond the current 350 limitation; and second; a lifting of the ban on cash payments to preferencing dealers for preferenced orders. 6 Conversation between David Colker, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, Cincinnati Stock Exchange, and Jill W. Ostergaard, Attorney, Division of Market Regulation, SEC, on April 25, 1994. Accordingly, this rule filing would extend the existing pilot program form its current expiration date of May 7, 1994 until August 6, 1994. During this interim extension, the pilot will continue to operate in accordance with all existing conditions. 7 7 These conditions include the two cited above regarding the number of preferenced securities and cash payment for order flow, as well as the requirement that the Exchange provides certain information to the Commission.
