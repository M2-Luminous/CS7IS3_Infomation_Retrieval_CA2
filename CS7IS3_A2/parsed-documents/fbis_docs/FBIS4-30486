The reason is that Japan is faced with a bevy of crucial future issues such as welfare and attendant fiscal burden based on the imminent arrival of an aged society, industrial infrastructure and international relations. We asked experts how they would portray visions of the Japanese economy. [Boxed item: "Basic Public Works Investment Program." The Social Infrastructure Construction Program was approved by the government in June 1990 in response to requests from the United States for expansion of domestic demand during the Japan-U.S. Structural Impediments Initiative talks. The program called for public works investments totaling about 430 trillion yen during a 10-year period beginning in fiscal year 1991 and ending in fiscal year 2000. The report released in December 1993 by the prime minister's private advisory organ known as Economic Reform Research Council and the outline of external economic reforms issued by the government in March of this year indicate that a final decision will be made in June, including provision for funding. Sources suggest that the government will ask the private sector to augment government programs by a total of 100 trillion yen.] [ASAHI SHIMBUN] I see that you described Japan as "a loan shark that lives in a shack" in your book, An Outline for Reform of the Japanese Economy. [Noguchi] The reason why the Japanese current trade surplus is so huge is that there is an absence of domestic investments which offset the high savings rate. The difference between savings and domestic investments represents the surplus in the recurring balance of payments and, while that difference is invested overseas, Japan's social infrastructure remains impoverished. In other words, Japan lives in a shack while it practices its role as a loan shark. We should alter this situation by rechanneling overseas investments to Japan and improving our living conditions. The end result of such action will be a reduction in the surplus in balance of payments. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What actions should we take in specific terms? [Noguchi] In Japan, social infrastructure affecting living conditions such as sewage, road and park systems, and commuter railways still exist in a meager state. We should improve those systems while savings rates are still high. If we wait until the arrival of the aged society and when savings rates have fallen, it will be too late. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Wouldn't it be adequate to stimulate private-sector investment through deregulation, without relying on public works spending? [Noguchi] Your suggested approach would be adequate if we were speaking of merely reducing balance of payments surpluses by equalizing savings and investments, but our ultimate goal should be an improvement in our living standards. Attainment of that goal will require a revision of the basic public works program and a bold expansion of public works investment. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] The Economic Reform Council's report stipulates as a prerequisite of improvement in social capital, "the provision of funding which will not leave a legacy of debt for future generations." [Noguchi] Logic says that if you use government bonds to fund public works projects, you will leave a legacy of debt for future generations. However, if restrictions relative thereto are imposed, a huge tax increase will be required and it will become impossible to implement that which is required. It is the obligation of our generation to build a quality social infrastructure and leave it as a legacy for future generations. It would be acceptable to issue government bonds for that purpose. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] However, wouldn't that result in leaving unpaid bills for payment by future generations? [Noguchi] Many people think that government bonds, like household debt, leave the need to repay debt at a future date, but this is a major misunderstanding. Government bonds represent a household debt like the husband borrowing from the wife and differs in substance from a situation in which a household borrows from outside sources. The redemption of government bonds provides for repayment of debt to a nation's citizens. Thus, government bonds do not represent a legacy of debt for the nation as a whole. Redemption of government bonds will have to be handled through modest future tax increases, but such measures would be appropriate from the standpoint of equitable distribution of fiscal burdens. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] The Ministry of Finance has stated that it already faces a financial crisis in the current situation wherein the government bond balance has exceeded 200 trillion yen. [Noguchi] The ratio of government bond balances outstanding rose sharply against the gross national product (GNP) from the 1970's to the 1980's. I believe the risk of financial failure existed during those years. However, since the 1980's, the ratio of the balances against GNP has fallen. Accordingly, fiscal deficits are not a very serious problem. It is only logical that fiscal authorities concern themselves about expansion of deficits, but the problem lies in converting such concerns directly into government policy. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] The viewpoint exists that Japan's balance-of-payments surplus is a valuable resource. [Noguchi] Since we exist in a situation where insufficient savings is a worldwide problem, Japan's surpluses play an unmistakable role in international society. Thus, if Japan were to reduce its surpluses as well as overseas investments, the money supply and demand situation would tighten and interests rates would rise in foreign nations. However, notwithstanding the potential for such a situation, there is a need to reduce balance-of-payments surpluses to take enhancement measures relative to our living standards. I believe that "reduction of balance of payments surpluses for the sake of international coordination" represents a conceptual misinterpretation of substantive issues.
