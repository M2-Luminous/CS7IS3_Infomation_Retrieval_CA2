The king blamed continued disputes among the Cambodian factions as the main cause of the political problem in his country. The $3 billion UN administration of Cambodia during the transition period leading to the election was not just the most expensive UN operation, it achieved only partial success. That is, while the United Nations succeeded in organizing the election and formation of government of the people, it failed to achieved peace and national reconciliation, which were just as important. To date, no one can tell how much more investment will be needed to achieve the complete goal as desired by the United Nations. It is strange that while so far there is no answer to the question of how much more the world has to pay to enable the Cambodian people to avoid genocide, certain countries have openly said that they are ready to make more investment by sending in their soldiers or providing arms to the Cambodians. This would only exacerbate the fighting in that country. It appears as if the world has put a cap on its budget for peace in Cambodia and has begun to contemplate a budget for war and destruction. As long as the Cambodian factions continue their disputes, the trend for more intense fighting could gain greater support from other Western countries. If the Cambodian leaders agree to the strange proposal advanced by the west, peace will likely be achieved only by extermination of the Cambodian race.
