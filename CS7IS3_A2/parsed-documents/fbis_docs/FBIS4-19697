Ambassador Volkan Vural, adviser to Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, who has been having preliminary contacts in Washington prior to the prime minister's visit on Friday [14 April], ascertained IMF's inclination on the matter during the talks he held with IMF Deputy Chairman Russo yesterday. In addition to Volkan Vural, Emre Gonensay, presidential adviser on economic matters; Necati Ozfirat, under secretary of the Turkish Planning Organization; and Bulent Ozgun, head of the Directorate of Foreign Trade, are among the members of the Turkish delegation to the United States. The question of Turkey's urgent need for new credits was the focal point in the Turkish delegation's talks with the IMF and World Bank officials. They mostly focused on the possibility of new financial resources for Turkey. Russo informed the delegation that the IMF is prepared to extend new credits to Turkey, saying that the conclusion of a stand-by agreement between the two sides will facilitate the credits. Meanwhile, Thomas Wiens, one of the deputy chairmen of the World Bank group in which Turkey is included, informed Volkan Vural that a request by the Ciller government for new financial resources can be considered within the framework of an agreement between the World Bank and Turkey. The officials in Washington are convinced that Ciller will launch an initiative with the World Bank and the IMF on Friday aimed at persuading them to extend new credits to Turkey. A World Bank official, who prefered to remain anonymous, has informed MILLIYET as follows: "Turkey has two options at the present time. It will either find a short-term credit with high interest, which I believe will be very difficult to get, or it will conclude a stand-by agreement with the IMF and the World Bank. That will enable Turkey to get a credit that can be repaid without difficulty. There is no alternative." It has been reported that Prime Minister Ciller will try to secure a credit of $5 billion in New York and Washington. However, it has been ascertained that a stand-by agreement with, for example, the IMF, will only provide a credit of "$300 million or $400 million for Turkey. Ambassador Vural and his delegation also held talks with Assistant Secretary of State Stephen Oxman, who is responsible for European affairs. They discussed matters that concern the relations between the two countries in general and tried to establish the agenda of the meeting President Clinton will have with Prime Minister Ciller probably on Friday. Drawing attention to the economic situation in Turkey, Vural explained the Ciller Government's "urgent need for financial resources" and urged the Clinton administration to support Turkey. Furthermore, Vural suggested that a certain amount of cash from the Turkey-U.S. Defense Fund be transferred to Ankara without being linked to any project. However, U.S. officials refrained from responding favorably to his suggestion. The Ciller government is very interested in the U.S. Eximbank Fund for $5 billion, which the Clinton administration disclosed in December 1993. Although the existence of that fund has been used as propaganda material in domestic politics in Turkey, a U.S. official said: "The United States benefits from that fund more than Turkey does. It is a fund that facilitates the sale of U.S. products on a unilateral basis. That gives an opportunity to U.S. businessmen to make profits." Stephen Oxman responded to Vural's request for financial resources as follows: "We want to help Ankara particularly at a difficult time for Turkey. However, we are also in a difficult situation. Meanwhile, we have to make recourse to the U.S. Congress on such matters. The congressmen will immediately respond by raising the question of human rights, the Cyprus issue, and the Kurdish problem. Securing approval for cash aid or financial resources for Turkey will be easier if progress is made on those matters." The chilly approach the Clinton administration, the IMF, and the World Bank have adopted on Turkey's request for financial aid, particularly IMF's insistence on a stand-by agreement, has undermined the chances of Ciller's visit to the United States being successful.
