Commenting on Clinton's warning, issued Tuesday, a foreign ministry spokesman suggested that the United States had just as much to lose as China if MFN is not renewed in June and he reiterated Beijing's opposition to the linkage of MFN with human rights. "The Chinese government has repeatedly and clearly stated that the mutual offer of MFN status between the United States and China is a reciprocal and mutually beneficial arrangement," the spokesman said. "MFN status should not be linked to other issues irrelevant to it. This position remains unchanged," he added. Clinton said Tuesday that while he had no wish to withdraw China's MFN, Beijing had yet to make the "significant progress" demanded by his executive order in some areas of human rights. Asked if China's MFN status was in serious jeopardy, the president replied. "Yes, it is a possibility." Clinton must make a decision on MFN renewal by June 3. The MFN issue has dominated Sino-U.S. relations for the past year, and ties have been further strained by bitter disputes over textile quotas, U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, and alleged Chinese sales of missile technology to Pakistan. At the same time, however, economic and trade ties have strengthened considerably, with the American business community, which is firmly opposed to the withdrawal of China's MFN, investing heavily in what is now the fastest growing economy in the world. MFN status entitles imports to be brought into the United States at low or zero customs rates. In China's case, the status is worth hundreds of millions of dollars. The U.S. trade deficit with China soared 25 percent last year to a record 22.8 billion dollars, an independent U.S. agency, the International Trade Commission (ITC), said Tuesday. The deficit has risen steadily in the past three years, from 12.6 billion dollars in 1991 to 18.2 billion in 1992 and 22.8 billion in 1993, the ITC said.
