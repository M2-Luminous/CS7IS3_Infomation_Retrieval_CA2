FBIS4-51762 "dreas085_d_94005" FBIS-EAS-94-085 Daily Report 3 May 1994 South Korea U.S. Refutes DPRK Claim on Armistice Agreement U.S. Refutes DPRK Claim on Armistice Agreement SK0305024594 Seoul YONHAP in English 0227 GMT 3 May 94 SK0305024594 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Washington, May 2 (YONHAP) -- The State Department Monday refuted North Korea's claim that the Korean Armistice Agreement is useless and invalid, affirming that the pact remains in effect. Department spokeswoman Christine Shelly, commenting on Pyongyang's statement that the Armistice Agreement is null and should be replaced by a peace pact, said that "We cannot accept its claim that the armistice is `useless' or `invalid.'" "Our position is that the Armistice Agreement remains in effect. We are proceeding on that basis," Shelly said. Pyongyang officials have demanded negotiations with Washington on the matter, a move interpreted here and in Seoul as an attempt to blur the current international focus on the North Korean nuclear row and to engage the United States in yet another form of dialogue. North Korea insists that talks on the peace agreement should be held exclusively between it and the United States since South Korea is not a signatory of the 1953 armistice pact. "...We note that in February 1992, North and South Korea agreed that questions of peace and security on the peninsula should be resolved primarily through inter-Korean dialogue," said Shelly. "We strongly support that approach." The spokeswoman added that Washington will abort all talks with Pyongyang if the latter goes ahead and refuels a nuclear reactor without the presence of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) experts. North Korean officials have repeatedly threatened to go ahead with the refueling if the IAEA continues to make inspection demands on the process. Reminding that inter-Korean talks can play an important part in resolving the nuclear impasse, Shelly said Washington hopes the two Koreas will resume dialogue in the near future.
