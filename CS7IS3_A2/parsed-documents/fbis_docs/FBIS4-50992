Xie said that in the first four months of 1994, Nanning signed 40 cooperation projects with overseas firms, involving 18 million U.S. dollars in total foreign investment. In 1993, the city approved the establishment of 242 foreign-funded firms, involving 82.4 million dollars in total overseas investment, he said. Nanning currently has 386 foreign-funded businesses in such areas as transportation, energy, farming, construction, finance, commerce and real estate, the mayor said. Of the 386 businesses, 19 involve an investment of at least 10 million dollars each, he added. Since 1992, Nanning has stepped up infrastructure construction to pave the way for the influx of overseas investment, he said. For example, the capacity of automatic telephone exchanges in the city soared to 65,000 lines in 1993 from 15,000 lines in the previous year. Xie announced that an investment fair and a commodities fair will be held in Nanning June 15-18 to seek overseas investment in urban construction and property development, he said.
