(IDO) is close to reaching an agreement with Motorola Inc. of the United States to construct 159 more Motorola-formula car phone relay stations possibly early next week, industry sources said Saturday [5 March]. IDO, Japan's major mobile phone operator, and the U.S. telecom equipment maker are currently ironing details of the deal, including the timing of construction, according to the sources. The accord would help avoid U.S. trade retaliation against Japan, they said. The sources said IDO still opposes a U.S. call for allocation of part of the frequencies presently used for Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp.-formula phones to Motorola. If both companies reach a final agreement, Japanese telecom trade negotiators are ready to start talks with their U.S. counterparts to avoid U.S. retaliation, an official at the Posts and Telecommunications Ministry said.
