The ANC refused to present its package of proposals to the alliance before the leaders of the group committed themselves to being flexible. The ANC asked the alliance to obtain such a commitment from their leaders and report back no later than Monday. If the report back was positive, the talks would resume on Monday. The Freedom Alliance has indicated that it prefers an agenda to a proposal or package, and that it wants to discuss issues point by point. In terms of the government package, the alliance must accept the rulings of the provincial power as outlined in the constitution if it wants the government to accept the double ballot paper. The alliance must furthermore agree to the retention of the present provisions governing the entrenchment of provincial constitutions. [passage omitted]
