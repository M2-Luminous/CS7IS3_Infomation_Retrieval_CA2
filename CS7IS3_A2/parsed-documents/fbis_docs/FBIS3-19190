He is demanding a role for the regions in Europe, and wants to attract French investors to his region. [Lopez] On this first official visit you are surrounded by ministers and businessmen. Is it not, however, a political visit rather than an economic visit? [Ardanza] This visit has three aims. The first is clearly political, the second is economic, and our third aim is to change the image of the Basque country. I tried to explain to Rene Monory, the president of the French Senate, and to French leaders the idea we have of our place in the Spanish state and in Europe. I believe that, while we are close geographically, the French political class does not really know us. [Lopez] Are you not also trying to appear more European than Spanish and trying to stress your importance in a Europe of the regions, which is nonetheless a difficult exercise in France? [Ardanza] Of course it is difficult (...). European construction can only be achieved by abandoning some of the sovereignty of the states. For the first time in its history, this continent... is attempting a process of peaceful unification. It is understandably slow (...). The dynamism will be born within the states by the rise of regional movements (...). I think that the regions deserve greater powers at the European level. [Lopez] Are you satisfied, as a Basque, with the stance taken by Madrid on the question of fishing rights in the context of Norwegian entry into the European Union [EU]? [Ardanza] It is normal that we should defend this sector of activity which is important for us. In 1986, when we joined the EC, we kept a low profile. Today, we have proved our respect of democracy and our competence, and the Spanish Government has been a driving force behind the European idea. Clearly, the countries now applying for membership have some of the highest incomes per inhabitant in the world and they fully intend, through joining, to further improve their position. By defending our fishing rights we want to put the brakes on the implementation of a two-speed Europe with a rich north and an increasingly poor south. [Lopez] What were your plans when you came to Paris? [Ardanza] What do we see on the geoeconomic level? In addition to the north-south divide, is there not also an East-West divide? Faced with development in the east, from London to Lyons via the channel tunnel, and in the Mediterranean from Genoa to Barcelona, the Atlantic fringe was going to be marginalized. That is the purpose of our initiatives: developing partnerships between the various regions of the countries on this fringe, in particular to avoid having to take a resigned attitude toward Brussels. Second, France is our leading economic partner and we would like to allay certain fears that your country's businessmen have concerning the Basque country. The best recommendations come from companies that have already set up in our region. [Lopez] Is it to further attract them that you have granted tax incentives? [Ardanza] We have the same taxation powers as a state. In the delicate industrial situation our region finds itself in, I think it is quite normal to want to attract companies. We are not the only ones using this type of incentive and I do not think it is what people call fiscal dumping. It is also true that the Basque state has always historically intervened in the region's economy, but of course I would like the state to be as least interventionist as possible. However, we have to encourage companies to modernize by helping them financially and sometimes by taking stakes in them.
