President Alija Izetbegovic of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency opened the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly session with the following words: Esteemed deputies, guests, and friends: I have a somewhat unpleasant duty to address you again on the issue of the Geneva negotiations, which have become [word indistinct] at which Bosnia meets its friends but also its enemies, both open ones and those concealed. The negotiations have become deadlocked and they are facing a collapse. That is why we are meeting today to exchange views and decide what to do. Perhaps some new ideas will be expressed in this hall today, which will point to a way out of this standstill and open up some new paths. I therefore call on the deputies -- since they are the most informed and called upon as to what the people think -- to tell us their views and present new ideas that might encourage the negotiations. Let them do so bravely and freely, as this is a time of change and everything is (open) to suspicion and reassessment -- everything, that is, except some basic principles and the one aim, and that is the salvation of the people and the country. There are no taboos and nothing is politically sacred. During the previous Geneva negotiations, our delegation consistently represented the views of the Assembly, as established at the session on 28 September 1993. We asked the Serb side to return the occupied territories in the Drina River valley and in western Bosnia. The Serbs made some concessions in eastern Bosnia, but they also took two steps back when it came to Brcko and Doboj. The Croatian side persistently refused to accept the mutually satisfactory solution regarding our access to the sea at Neum. They offered solutions unacceptable to us near Prevlaka and in Peljesac. The Croats also rejected our proposal for a military disengagement in central Bosnia. We proposed that the HVO [Croatian Defense Council] forces pulled out from the region of Vitez and Novi Travnik, in which case the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army units would also withdraw, and the civilian bodies and the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] members would take control. Since they rejected this proposal, the confrontation near Vitez has continued. The talks are to continue on 10 February. They are entering a critical phase. We expect a more active participation by the United States, which can only have a positive influence on the course of the negotiations. I believe that our delegation should be given full freedom to negotiate, but the Assembly would make the final decision. The delegation should represent the views of the Bosnia- Herzegovina Assembly of 28 September 1993, but also take into account all the useful ideas and proposals that will be presented today by the deputies or the deputies' caucus. The delegation should also be authorized -- if no progress is made, and if it judges that the negotiations on this basis have become exhausted -- to request that the entire issue be referred to the UN Security Council. In that case, we would ask the Council to implement finally all the relevant resolutions on Bosnia-Herzegovina -- that is, we would remind the Council of its duty. I can see no other solution. I do not think there is need to stress that our position at the negotiations depends to a large extent on our military situation, the strength or the weakness of the enemy, the morale and the limits of endurance of our people, the humanitarian conditions, and other elements. The state delegation has tried to be as objectively informed about these facts as possible, and it has tried within its limits to assess as realistically as possible these important factors. Finally I would like to reiterate that our aim is peace but only just peace. All our efforts are devoted to this end, President Izetbegovic of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency said today in his opening address at the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly session.
