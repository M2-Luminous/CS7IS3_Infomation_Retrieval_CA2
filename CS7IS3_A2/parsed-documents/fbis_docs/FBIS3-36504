Peslyak in Moscow on 5 February -- recorded] [Text] A good two-thirds of the 25 Russian-Georgian documents signed in Tbilisi apply to the economic relations sphere. We asked Oleg Soskovets, the Russian first deputy prime minister, to characterize the results of the agreements and treaties that were signed. [Video shows footage of Yeltsin, Shevardnadze, and others at documents-signing ceremony in Tbilisi. Then Oleg Soskovets is shown seated in his office being interviewed] [Soskovets] Let us take the agreement on cooperation in the communications field. What does it signify? It signifies that our television programs -- the Ostankino and Russian Television programs -- will be regularly relayed, received, and shown to Georgia's inhabitants and the whole region. I think that a legal format has simply been given to all those relationships that were developing previously as part of the traditional old relations of partnership. Now they have been endorsed at the level of interstate relations. Now the old laws have a foundation. In principle, Georgia is an independent state and whether it uses our television programs and information sources depends on many things, since in principle we must now work on a commercial basis with this state. An agreement was signed on international highway communications. This is also a matter purely of production links. They existed traditionally in the former Soviet Union. Now they need to be given a legal format in line with international law. Well, they have now been legalized. Agreements were signed on trade and economic cooperation with the appropriate appendices. I should like to dwell precisely on this area, which is the most complicated at the present time, as Georgia, since it acquired its independence, has been busy working on its own economic policy and industry reform. At present both of these spheres of activity are in difficulties, especially industry, power- generating, and transport. It is therefore, necessary, in view of Georgia becoming a CIS member, to find approaches that will not unite the two economies but, with them functioning quite independently of each other, will provide opportunities for them to develop various production infrastructures. In this respect the Georgian side has been displaying considerable interest in Russian industrial enterprises and power-generating enterprises. During the negotiating process proposals were made to the Georgian Government that Russian joint-stock companies and joint-stock capital should become involved in Georgia's industrial and oil-refining enterprises. Georgia now possesses fine transport potential in view of its ports, and I think that, given a normal development of events, we shall simply be involved at the economic level and economically in the production activity of these infrastructures. This was a more serious agreement, since here there can be no question of any disinterested links that might weaken Russia's economy, as ways are being sought to create financial clearing relations, since Georgia has its own currency. Let me reiterate that there can be no philanthropic relationship where the Russian enterprises, which are now the real economic subjects in our economic zone, will not receive the funds for the output they supply. Nor, naturally, must our companies, such as Roskontrakt, which are involved in giving substance to these relations in respect of goods, be bankrupted by this cooperation. This is one of the main tasks that we have set ourselves. We explained this to the Georgian side and it was received quite normally, as should be the case in a civilized world. [Peslyak] What can you say more specifically about power-generating, transport, and other areas of bilateral links? [Soskovets] Georgia still has a metallurgical industry, which had earlier been transformed into one of the Soviet Union's unified metallurgical complexes. It still has a deposit of manganese ores, without which it is impossible to produce steel. It also still has units for the production of ferrous alloys in Zestafoni, manganese in Chiatura, and there is the iron and steel works at Rustavi. These enterprises, especially the enterprise in Rustavi, were oriented toward the oil industry market. They make extra-strong oil well casing. I think that we must not lose this production capacity, enabling us to have high-quality piping for the oil men that is, at the same time, between 30 and 40 percent cheaper than world prices, and that we must not neglect it. I think that it is essential to avail ourselves of this opportunity and to organize this link. That is one example. Another example is in the refining and transportation of petroleum products. I must say that the existing potential for using Georgia's territory for commodity pipelines and the transportation of oil and gas -- I have in mind exporting -- is a very convenient opportunity for us to reduce transportation costs. As far as Georgia's industry is concerned, I must of course say that all these conflicts, which have been going on over the last few years, have in effect ruined Georgia's economy. The plants are at a standstill and so is the transport system. It is at present winter in Tbilisi and yet there is no heat in the apartments. The provision of electricity for lighting is strictly regulated, and so on and so forth. I think that first and foremost, of course, we all have to do a lot of work to revive all our economic activities. [Peslyak] You spoke of an agreement on road transportation cooperation, but the railways also account for a considerable proportion of transportation. This concerns Russia's economic interests, and the economic security of Georgia, and indeed its neighbors. [Soskovets] The head of the Georgian Government's Department of Railways has expressed a willingness to become part of the system of the Russian Federation's Ministry of Railways. This statement was made prior to the visit and our Railways Minister Gennadiy Matveyevich Fadeyev is now studying the issue. The fact is that a mass of Russian goods passes through the territory of Georgia. Therefore, we must not evade the issue, but probably it is not possible at present to see how we can take part in such a way that we do not become a donor and simply say that the Georgian railways will be some department or railway like, for instance, the West Siberian Railway or the Far Eastern Railway. The Georgian Government has proposed that our transport management entity -- our Transport Ministry -- become involved, for instance, as a shareholder in the development, construction, and extension of the port in the town of Poti. There is a also a proposal that Batumi too, is expanded and conditions created for the modernization of the oil refinery. Another proposal is to build a 150-kilometer section of pipeline to develop the transportation of gas to Turkey. [Peslyak] The first deputy prime minister remarked with a smile that the Moscow City Government had concluded its own agreements, and soon Muscovites will be becoming acquainted, for instance, with new examples of Georgian wines and brandies.
