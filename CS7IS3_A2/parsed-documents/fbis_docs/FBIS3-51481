Monde, who has coveted the presidency of the chamber since the beginning of the legislature, has acquired the post thanks to a compromise by the socialists, and by members of the Alliance for Parliamentary Cohesion, ACP, to the detriment of outgoing President Antoine Joseph of the Movement for the Establishment of Democracy in Haiti. The National Front for Change and Democracy [FNCD] parliamentarians admit that they are dissatisfied with this choice. In the opinion of some, this election confirms the strong tendency toward the clean sweep prevailing in the Chamber. Difficult days are expected. Bob Monde is a resolute, avowed, fierce opponent of exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Several FNCD and centrist parliamentarians say they fear the future with such a choice. Bob Monde will be assisted by socialist Mac-Ferl Morquette as vice-president. It is Emmanuel Reyme, the Haitian Christian Democratic Party man, another fierce opponent to the exiled president, who has been elected first secretary. The ACP has thus resumed control of the chamber.
