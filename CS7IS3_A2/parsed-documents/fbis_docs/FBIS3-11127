Reymundo Roberts at Robles' apartment in the Palermo neighborhood of Buenos Aires City; date not given] [Text] [Roberts] What is your opinion of the sentence handed down by the military court [on the murder case involving nine students and a professor from La Cantuta University in Lima, Peru]? [Robles] This has been a step forward because it presupposes the acknowledgement that the murder was indeed committed, as had been charged. Nevertheless, only the ones who committed the murder were punished -- the Colina group from the National Intelligence Services (SIN). The mastermind behind the murder -- Presidential Aide Vladimiro Montesinos -- and the person who executed his commands -- General Nicolas Hermoza, the chairman of the Armed Forces Joint Command -- emerged unscathed. [Roberts] How do you know that Montesinos ordered the murder? [Robles] Because that group answers directly to him. What the sentence says, namely that it was a "personal initiative without having been ordered by their superior" is not true. [Roberts] What is the reason for such brutal murder at La Cantuta University? [Robles] Those people are completely deranged and Montesinos hired them precisely because they have no scruples. They seem to have no principles at all. They feel powerful because they have the backing of the country's rulers and think it makes no difference whether they kill sheep or people. [Roberts] Was there any proof that the university students were involved in terrorist activities? [Robles] No, that allegation has never been proved. They were not found in possession of subversive literature, weapons, or leaflets ... They offered no resistance! They were most brutally abducted and murdered. Their bodies were then quartered and burned. The sadism in this action has nothing to do with the way the true Peruvian Army acts. [Roberts] What was Gen. Hermoza responsible for? [Robles] It is my considered opinion that he was implicated in this affair because the Colina group operation was supported by several units that answer directly to him. In such a special operation, one that entailed entering a university, no general would have dared take a step without being authorized to do so. [Roberts] Did any of the military who were found guilty not plead during the trial that they were obeying orders from their superiors? [Robles] It seems that they did not, but their attitude is quite understandable -- there are many ways to coerce a person into submission through promises, blackmail, threats ... They are well aware that intelligence services have their own rules of conduct and that they can pay very dearly if they happen to ignore them. [Roberts] Do you believe that the sentences have been very lenient? [Robles] Had they been tried by a civilian court, the sentences would have in all likelihood been much more severe. The truth is that the crimes they committed -- labeled homicide because there was no violent clash between them -- do not exist in the Military Justice Code. Hence, they had to somehow make these crimes fit in there so that the military could be tried by a military court. [Roberts] Was it an obvious case of civilian jurisdiction? [Robles] Absolutely. The law passed by Congress to remove the case from a civilian court was most aberrant and cast discredit on the rule of law in Peru. It was a gross interference by the legislative branch in the realm of the judiciary. A specific law was passed for this trial which goes against all legal regulations. Congress bowed to this trick because it is in the hands of a group of cowardly and obsequious people who are at Fujimori's beck and call. This law was enacted when it seemed imminent that the Supreme Court was going to rule that a civilian court had to hear the case. Overcome by despair, they urgently convened a session of Congress -- even obliging those deputies who were on holiday to be present at the debates -- and passed the law. It was such a scandal that the U.S. and German Governments strongly protested, and the prime minister had to resign. This laid bare the fact that the belief that there is a democracy in Peru is totally erroneous. What we have is a dictatorship by Fujimori propped up by a military coterie. [Roberts] Some contend that Vladimiro Montesinos is a sort of black monk who wields as much -- or more -- power than the president himself. [Robles] That is true -- many of the changes, the true quakes that are taking place in our institutions, have been the work of his hand. As is public knowledge, Montesinos is a former Army captain who has protected drug traffickers. In fact, he has not severed his ties with them. He was cashiered from the Army following his conviction for treason, as he had sold confidential documents to other countries. [Roberts] Can it be said that human rights are systematically violated in Peru? [Robles] The Colina group -- not the Army -- has indeed been violating human rights in a systematic way. Hiding themselves under the false colors of countersubversive struggle, they are involved in these criminal actions, which in many cases are perpetrated to eliminate those who oppose the government. [Roberts] Do you agree with Fujimori in the sense that Shining Path is about to be routed? [Robles] I hope so because they are the worst scourge we have ever had. Nevertheless, it is quite difficult. This is an overly triumphant attitude by Fujimori in order to be re-elected. The Shining Path continues to wreak havoc in our country.
