I propose the following conclusion on the first item on the agenda: After the perfidious murder of the British citizen, a representative of the UNHCR [UN High Commission on Refugees], and the wounding of the two workers of this organization in Zenica on 27 January 1994, the Government of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina conveys expressions of its deepest condolences to the family of the murdered man, the Government of Great Britain, and the UNHCR. Condemning this terrorist act, the Government of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina will do everything with a view to discovering and punishing the culprits of this horrific crime. This murder has taken place at the moment when we need humanitarian aid the most, but we are convinced that this act will not lead to the suspension of the delivery of humanitarian aid in central Bosnia and we think that it would be catastrophic if the innocent population paid the price for this terrorist act. As for the second item on the agenda, the military intervention of the armed forces of the Republic of Croatia in the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, I propose the following conclusion: The Government of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina asserts, according to the reliable reports from the field, that an open military intervention was launched on the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina by the armed forces of the Republic of Croatia. The Government of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina asks for an urgent session of the UN Security Concil and demands that the UN Security Council condemns this aggression and takes measures in conformity with Chapter 7 of the UN Charter and all relevant resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly adopted so far. These were the two conclusions on the two items of the agenda. Do we agree with these conclusions? [word indistinct] Thank you. The extraordinary session of the Government of Bosnia-Herzegovina has been concluded.
