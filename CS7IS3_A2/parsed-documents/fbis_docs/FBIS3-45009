The session listened to a report by Yang Tonghui, member of the provincial party committee's Standing Committee and secretary of the discipline inspection commission, on last year's struggle against corruption in the province and on proposals for the future struggle against corruption. At the session, provincial party Secretary Xie Shijie stressed: Leadership should be strengthened over the struggle against corruption, the provincial party committee and government, as well as party committees and governments at all levels, should regard the struggle against corruption as an important political task, put it on their agenda, and carry it out persistently. The party Central Committee has set three requirements for the current struggle against corruption. These three requirements should be implemented in the period up to the Spring Festival so as to make phased achievements. This year's struggle against corruption will be arranged by the provincial party committee in light of Sichuan's actual conditions according to the Central Committee's plan. Xie Shijie pointed out: In our work, we should play the exemplary role of leading cadres, strengthen education against corruption and for a clean administration, and conscientiously abide by the system of cadres reporting major cases and the system of maintaining files for clean administration. In the course of rectifying arbitrary collections of charges, we should straighten out malpractices in using special funds, examine and deal with major and important cases, pay proper attention to strengthening discipline in key departments, resolve problems by looking into their root causes and symptoms, constantly make phased achievements in a down-to-earth manner, and profoundly and protractedly carry out the struggle against corruption so as to ensure the smooth fulfillment of all tasks this year and to promote the better and faster development of the province's reform, opening up, and conomic construction.
