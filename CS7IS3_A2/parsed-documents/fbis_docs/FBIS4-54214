Between 200 and 250 guerrillas died in the fighting Wednesday and three government soldiers were killed and another 27 wounded by land mines as they advanced down National Route 10, Battambang deputy governor Serey Kosal told AFP by telephone. The governor said most of the guerrillas had been found strewn alongside the highway, killed by artillery fire, and that some 50 others appeared to have been executed by bullet shots in the back of the head. He said the 50 dead rebels had been executed by their commander for trying to retreat as government forces advanced to Phum Svay Sar, 10 kilometers (six miles) from Treng, which the government said it captured two days ago. Ammunition and weapons had also been left behind, he added. No independent confirmation was available. Serey Kosal said that he would go to the highway Thursday and take photographs of the Khmer Rouge dead as evidence. Treng was the government's frontline prior to an offensive that led to the capture of Pailin in March, one month before it was retaken by the rebels, who surged forward and pushed government forces back to within 15 kilometers (nine miles) of Battambang.
