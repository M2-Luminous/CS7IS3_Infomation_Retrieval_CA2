The study, carried out by the Institute of the German Economy (IW), advocates a long-term shift to wage increases which reflect only productivity growth rather than additional, political considerations such as a desire to redistribute income. It specifically rejects a policy of short-term wage restraint as inadequate and even advocates holding wage increases below the rate of productivity growth "for a certain time" to ameliorate the EU's current "situation of structural underemployment." This approach would allow European companies to improve their profitability, which would in turn stimulate investment and create jobs. According to the study, increased international competitive pressures and the constraints of the EMU economic convergence process also imply an end to wage increases which exceed the growth of productivity. The study argues that such increases, coupled with unfavorable changes in international currency exchange rates, have hurt the competitiveness of European firms in relation to their U.S. and Japanese counterparts, especially since 1985. In 1992, for example, the unit cost of EU industrial products was almost 14 percent higher than the unit cost of comparable U.S. and Japanese goods. Meanwhile, as the EMU target dates for the convergence of the European economies approach, the tools traditionally used to compensate for excessive wage hikes will be increasingly unavailable: monetary policy will have to follow a strict anti- inflationary course, fiscal policy will be geared toward budgetary consolidation, and currency devaluation will cease to be a politically viable option.

The current Social Democratic Party (SDP)-led coalition government launched the initiative last year as a three- year experiment to relieve official unemployment. Parliament will have to decide the initiative's future by 1996. Some 50,000 individuals have already entered the program and are receiving government allowances to withdraw from the labor market for up to one year in order to study, care for a child or elderly family member, or take a skills-enhancing sabbatical. With the country entering the "unofficial" campaign for a parliamentary election, which must be held this fall, the issue is receiving attention in party platforms and public discussion. On 8 May, the Radical Liberal Party, a junior party in the governing coalition, adopted its official position. As summarized by Copenhagen BERLINGSKE TIDENDE business section reporter Jakob Elkjaer on 9 May, that party's ruling council pledged support for continuing the program, while indicating it wanted to see some changes. The council came out unequivocally, however, in favor of leave for training and education. It also backed the government's plan to ease the burden on the treasury by requiring contributions from workers and employers based on the principle of "collective insurance." As expected, the Social Democrats greeted this announcement with enthusiasm, Elkjaer continued. Reaffirming her own party's stand, SDP Labor Minister Jytte Andersen declared that "the leave arrangements should be made permanent. The success which the program has enjoyed shows that people want to become more qualified, take care of their children... This is part of a modern labor market policy." Acknowledging complaints of high costs and disincentives to get a job, Andersen said the government planned to cut the present education allotment. The current payment, equaling the maximum level of unemployment compensation, would be reduced to 80 percent of that amount. The Employers Confederation (DA) also used the occasion to reiterate its stand. Elkjaer reported that its director, Jens Andersen, stated that the DA opposes continuing leave for child-care and sabbaticals, suggesting it puts too great a burden on business. While the group supports leave for training and education, it opposes universal contributions from employers, asserting that only those firms directly benefiting from training or retraining should have to pay contributions. Dansk Industri, the association representing heavy industry, also stated cautious approval for funding training leaves but adamantly opposes leave for care of the elderly and for skill-boosting sabbaticals. The stand taken by the Christian Party, another partner in the ruling coalition, was summarized in an article in BERLINGSKE TIDENDE on 2 May by Erik Bjorn Moller. At its just-completed convention, that party also announced its support for extending the program. The Christian Party denounced the attack on the program by the Liberal and Conservative Parties, saying it could not consider cooperating with them in the campaign or in a subsequent coalition unless they halted their opposition. The two parties--the largest in the nonsocialist camp--immediately rejected this condition.

The government further pledged that if buyers demonstrate strong demand for the initial offering, it will place up to 1 million of its remaining shares on the market. If the first offering is completely sold, the state's ownership share will drop from 73 to 61 percent. If both offerings are completely sold, the figure will drop to 59 percent. There is some reason for optimism, the article claims, judging from the steady upswing on the Helsinki stock market and enthusiasm for Finnish shares elsewhere. The firm will use projected stock sale proceeds of about 700 million markkas to improve its high debt-equity ratio, which resulted from the collapse of the Soviet market and the European recession. Furthermore, the article notes that, like the Finnish export sector as a whole, Valmet has recently experienced a strong recovery in foreign demand for its products, most notably papermaking machinery. One year ago, the company's total foreign and domestic orders amounted to 5.4 billion markkas; they now are worth almost 6.2 billion markkas.

Deger claims rumors have circulated according to which the preparatory committee of the World Trade Organization (WT0), over which Peter Sutherland presides, intends to establish "a negotiating group" on the social clause. However, Deger notes that an unnamed "official source" in Paris indicated that such a group would only be useful if it focused on the social clause within the context of the current environment. On the other hand, this official was cited as saying, "France is interested in horizontal discussions so that the social clause can be the object of consultations in all negotiating groups." (Dian I. x36286) (Paris LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES in French 24 May 94 p 6) FRANCE FINDS ALLY IN JAPAN IN SHIPBUILDING--Philippe Moreau, writing in LES ECHOS, notes that French shipbuilders, who reacted violently" to the U.S. position on subsidies for the shipbuilding industry and felt themselves isolated in their fight against a U. S. strategy they deemed the "most protectionist on earth," have found an ally in Japan. Because Japan also has protested the U.S. position, the French Government has "suddenly" found a new reason to intensify its resistance to the U.S. stance, Moreau claims. He cites Prime Minster Edouard Balladur as saying that the U.S. effort to protect its shipbuilding industry is "a step backward in regard to the initial objectives of the negotiation and is contrary to French interests." Subsequently Balladur stated that the French Government would make diplomatic demarches to the EU requesting the latter to reject the U.S. position. However, French shipbuilders fear that the French Government will be handed a fait accompli by the European Commission, which is sensitive to the fact that Denmark, Germany, and Italy are eager to conclude an agreement with the United States. In that case, French shipbuilders will not only ask that a "process of ratification be acted on in advance but that national compensatory measures be prepared" as well. The shipbuilders would like to reinstate a system of "interest advantages" (bonification d'interet) for shipping fleets so that "shipping companies can again buy ships in France." (Dian I. x36286) (Paris LES ECHOS in French 19 May 94 p 7) TRADE VERSUS HUMAN RIGHTS VIEWED--Commenting on President Bill Clinton's anticipated decision to renew China's Most Favored Nation status, Jean-Francois Revel writes in the Paris weekly LE POINT that the position generally adopted by democratic leaders who must choose between human rights and trade is usually the result of "blackmail" by those countries such as China and Vietnam that abuse human rights. Ravel contends that China "ordered" France to cease trading with Taiwan, and China is threatening the United States with reprisals if its Most Favored Nation status is revoked. Neither Chinese nor Vietnamese concessions, he writes, comprise a solution, since authorities in these countries concede to releasing political prisoners only to reincarcerate them later to show that they do not bow to foreign pressure. In this ongoing "blackmail," Revel argues, democracies should not be reproached for defending their interests but for not defending them enough. While Clinton may "give in" to Ghina's blackmail, it is actually China that is in the more vulnerable position of the two, exporting $30 billion annually to the United States compared with the $8.8 billion it imports. (Rosa N. x36287) (Paris LE POINT in French 21 May 94 p 45) JAPAN-U.S. TRADE ACCORD DEEMED GOOD FOR EU--Marc Deger, writing in LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES, cites unnamed sources at the European Commission as saying that "any U.S.-Japan trade agreement which opens the Japanese market is good for Europe." Deger notes that any such agreement should respect the principal of Most Favored Nation, the basis for GATT, and any market opening promised to the United States by the Japanese should also apply to third parties, such as the EU. Deger also cites Peter Gulford, spokesman for Foreign Trade Commissioner Leon Brittan, as having "categorically" stated that both the United States and Japan have given the EU assurances that they will not face discriminatory measures as a result of an agreement. In mid-May during a visit to Paris, Japan's Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata said that "Japan will never accept number targets. Any quantitative goal to reduce Japanese trade surplus in relation to the United States would lead to managed trade contrary to the principles of GATT. The fact that the United States renounced such number targets is positive for France." Additionally, Deger contends that the trade negotiations between the United States and Japan augur well for the resolution of issues left in suspense by the Uruguay Round, especially the issue of financial services. A Japanese-U.S. agreement on this issue will profit France, a major provider of such services. However, Deger points out that the effect of U.S.-Japanese market opening negotiations on EU-Japanese trade is not certain. On the one hand, if there is no agreement and the U.S. market closes its doors to Japanese trade, the EU will feel more pressure from Japanese imports. On the other hand, even if the Japanese Government opens its market to everyone, it cannot control whose imports Japanese businessmen will buy, "probably those of the United States," according to unnamed sources in Paris cited by Deger. (Dian I. x36286) (Paris LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES in French 25 May 94 p 3) COMMENTARY ON AGRICULTURE MARKET SHARE, GATT EFFECTS--A commentary by Nadege Forestier in LE FIGARO states that to maintain France's worldwide market share in agriculture despite the constraints of GATT, the French Government should consider exporting its agriculture "without restitution." Forestier points out that the importance of agriculture exports to France in large measure prompted the turmoil over reduced export subsidies under the GATT agreement. However, Forestier counters that in reality, the impact of these measures is less than it seems. According to the Agriculture Ministry's "Information Bulletin," the GATT accord only directly involves 4 percent of the value of France's agriculture and food processing production. Moreover, only 20 percent of production is exported and 70 percent of exports are for EU countries. In Agricultural Minister Jean Puech's view, the GATT accords and the lower export subsidies must not impede France from maintaining and developing its market share. To do so, two conditions must be met, according to Puech. First, certain Community rules must be changed to be able to produce and export "without restitution and without government aid." Secondly, farmers must be able to work at marginal cost." Forestier explains that this means the cost of farming must be paid for by sales of subsidized products in a way which would allow supplementary quantities to be produced less expensively. These in turn would be able to be exported outside the EU without restitution. Grain growers, who are mainly involved, would not be hostile to this, Puech believes, adding that the government will debate this strategy at the beginning of this summer. (Dian I. X36286) (Paris LE FIGARO Le Fig-Eco supplement in French 18 May 94 p II) ALPHANDERY REVISES STATUTES FOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS--On 25 May Economy Minister Edmond Alphandery presented to the Council of Ministers a bill to revise several statutes governing financial institutions in France. The bill adheres to a EU directive which will come into force in July 1995. It will require all credit establishments in France to provide a "guarantee system." The details of the system will be established by the banking regulatory committee, which will set the threshold of guarantee protection at 400,000 francs (Fr). Additionally, in case of the bankruptcy and liquidation of a credit establishment, the bill will give full authority for management and direction of the failed company to the administrator appointed by the Banking Commission in order to avoid any conflict between him and the former directors. The following are other provisions of the bill: -- The general directors of the Credit National bank will be named by its board rather than the Council of Ministers. Additionally, its governing statutes no longer need approval by the Council of State. -- Companies will be regulated by a specialized financial institution, the Entrepreneurs Office, rather than a suboffice for accounting. Again, the president of the Entrepreneurs Office will be selected by its board. -- As part of the reform of the Bank of Deposits and Consignments, its director general will be named for a duration of five years rather than an unlimited term. For the current director, Philippe Lagayette, his two years as president will be taken into count. -- Banking statutes will redefine a mission for the small business service, matched with a Fr50O-million share of Small and Medium-Sized Business Equipment Credit (CEPME's) company's Fr1- billion capital increase. The bill will also establish a National Forecast Office for the stock exchange. It will also establish a central office for savings banks. -- The bill will reinforce protection for insurees and depositors. It intends to establish a mechanism to monitor reinsurers and will monitor insurance groups on a consolidated basis. It will also provide reinforced protection for those insured under group insurance contracts. (Dian I. x36286) (Paris LES ECHOS in French 26 May 94 p 4) REACTION TO FEDERAL RESERVE INTEREST RATE HIKE--An article in the Paris financial daily LES ECHOS on 18 May commented that the reversal" in the position of the Clinton administration regarding the advisability of raising the U.S. discount rate came as a result of the pressure of a very strong correction in the U.S. bond market. Previous rate hikes by the Federal Reserve had not stabilized the financial markets because of statements by members of the administration which pointed out the weak level of inflation or minimized the rate of growth, according to the article. In addition to the Clinton administration's "poor understanding of the debt market reactions" effect on the dollar, the administration further affected the value of the dollar by its attempts to raise the value of the yen in order to reduce Japanese trade surpluses. The turnabout by the White House on this issue was "spectacularly" confirmed on 17 May by Clinton's main economic adviser, Laura Tyson, who indicated in an interview with THE WASHINGTON POST that the political situation in Japan could lead to loosening pressure in the framework of negotiations on market opening. Clinton's reversal and the Federal Reserve hike should have increased the value of the dollar or at least stabilized it. The article explains that this did not happen because the market, overheated by a year and a half of a policy which undermined the credibility of the Federal Reserve, distrusted the White House's recent policy conversion. Alternatively, the article suggests that the markets may have opted primarily for an economic reading of the dollar-mark exchange rate course. (Dian I. x36286) (Paris LES ECHOS in French 18 May 94 p 28) FRAMATOME PRIVATIZATION TO BE DELAYED--An article in LES ECHOS reports that any privatization of the nuclear energy manufacturer Framatome through an Alcatel-Alsthom buyout is not likely. To explain, the French Government has given the "pretext" that it wants a fuller analysis of the possible social consequences of such a buyout. The article notes that the explanation seems paradoxical since Framatome's privatization had been considered almost certain after the current government majority fared well in legislative elections last year, particularly since the Framatome buout was a small operation. Despite the government's explanation, the failure apparently was caused by financial considerations. The government wanted Alcatel- Alsthom to acquire 51 percent of Framatome at market prices. But Alcatel-Alsthom President Pierre Suard was reticent to spend any more than strictly necessary to purchase Credit Lyonnais and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA), which in turn would allow him control of Framatome. Suard's reticence came from his view that Framatome was a group with little prospect of increasing its profits in the future. However, there was little disagreement among the negotiating parties that the government retain a right of veto over Framatome's foreign operations, similar to that exercised within oil companies Elf and Total. With Framatome, this mechanism would apply particularly to any exports of nuclear technology to countries presenting security risks or converting civilian nuclear CAPABILITIES TO MILITARY USE. (Dian I. x36286) (Paris LES ECHOS in French 25 May 94 p 25) COFACE TO RETAIN PUBLIC MISSION--According to Georges Quioc, writing in LE FIGARO, France's main export trade credit insurer, Coface, will continue to insure government export credits despite having become privatized. To resolve this apparent contradiction, the government has just modified the insurance code, published in the 15 May "Official Journal," to allow the government to retain supervisory rights over Co face management as well as over the nomination of its directors. The modification decree has also confirmed the appointment of two government commissioners who will sit on Coface's board. They will attend all board meetings and will exercise the right of veto on the nominations of the president and director general of COFACE. (Dian I. x36286) (Paris LE FIGARO Le Fig-Eco supplement in French 18 May 94 p VI) ECONOMIC ESPIONAGE TO INTENSIFY--An article in the paris daily liberation states that a report by former aerospatiale head henri martre on economic espionage indicates this "neglected field" is on the verge of "receiving a boost." Martre, now in charge of the general planning commissariat, stressed that this field has become an essential lever to help competitiveness and employment." Except for those firms working in sensitive scientific and technical industries, French business is not as well equipped to ferret out information as its Japanese, U.S., or German competitors. However, Martre stated that economic intelligence--now called "technological monitoring"--is gaining ground. As an example, the Society of Competitive Intelligence Professionals (SCIP), an affiliate of a U.S. company and an association whose members include firms practicing economic intelligence, now has 80 members in France. Among them is the Elf Aquitaine oil company and Syntelabo, the pharmaceutical lab of the L'0real group, which in 1989 established an 18-member office responsible for coordinating information collected throughout the world. This office not only scans scientific magazines but garners important information from seminars, where researchers are eager to disclose the result of their research to prevent colleagues from claiming it for themselves. In addition to their own resources, companies interested in economic intelligence often resort to private investigative firms, which now number about 15 in France, the most important of which is the SCRL (expansion unknown), an affiliate of the French Foreign Trade Insurance-Credit Company (Coface) and the Edmond de Rothschild financial company. These companies have bankers, chambers of commerce, and lawyers as clients and claim they only seek information by legal means. However, the present trend for economic intelligence leans toward so-called "tactical information" gathering, which is still in an "embryonic" stage and more difficult because it is "more confidential." Its confidential nature may sometimes compel detectives or former intelligence operatives seeking it to "use illegal means," the Martre report stressed. (Rosa M. x36287) (Paris LIBERATION in French 24 May 94 p 10) GERMANY BUNDESBANK REPORT REJECTS DEVALUATION--German industry suffered a decline in competitiveness at the beginning of the 1990's but has recently improved its performance, according to the Bundesbank's latest monthly report. The Bundesbank attributed this improvement to smaller wage increases, progress in fighting inflation and changes in currency exchange rates. In the same report, the Bundesbank rejected using interest rate reductions to devalue the German mark and gain a relative price advantage over foreign competitors. The bank's view is that the competitiveness of any economy ultimately depends on ''fundamental preconditions,'' such as an appropriate" wage policy, a tax policy oriented toward competition, and the reduction of regulations and other bureaucratic hindrances. (Rick H. x36504) (Frankfurt/Main FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE in German 19 May 94 p 16) ABB HEAD ON INVESTMENT IN RUSSIA--Eberhard von Koerber, head of German operations for the international conglomerate Asea Brown Boveri (ABB), has noted the potential for increased German investment in Russia in several sectors, countering a recent internal Economics Ministry report which warned against investing in Russia because of the economic downturn there. Von Koerber remarked, for example, that major projects were discussed during Russian President Boris Yeltsin's recent visit to Germany, which included the expansion of a high-quality rail line to Russia, a high-speed rail line from St. Petersburg to Moscow, a highway from Berlin to Moscow, a new natural gas pipeline from Russia to Germany via Belarus and Poland, an expanded telecommunications network, and an effort to conserve energy in power plants. According to a separate Bundesbank report, German investment in Russia was 31 million German marks (DM) in 1993, while Russian investment in Germany was DM153 million, a disparity Yeltsin cited as an indication of the need for increased German investment. (Charles W. x365O7) (Frankfurt/Main FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE in German 16 May 94 p 15) GREECE NEW MINISTER OF ECONOMY VIEWED--In an article in the 6 May issue of I KATHIMERINI, Andonis Karakousis writes that new Minister of National Economy Yiannos Papandoniou is a "methodical Europeanist with a good team, who is relatively acceptable to the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) and who maintains good connections with the business world." In addition, Karakousis continued, Papandoniou is experienced in public finances and increasingly aware of the need to reduce budget deficits by stamping out tax evasion and reducing government spending. Finally, Papandoniou's longtime experience in foreign trade is expected to sharpen his interest in developing trade and investment with the Balkans and, more generally, East European countries. However, Karakousis contended, Papandoniou has some obstacles to overcome. He lacks the clout and power of his predecessor, the late Yiorgos Yennimatas, who was PASOK's number two man. Papanoniou will also have to contend with the increasing independence of the Ministry of Finance, which will not willingly accept a Papandoniou intervention in its policies. However, Papandoniou has a sense of diplomacy and he enjoys good relations with most government officials which should make his task easier, Karakousis commented. He added that Yennimatas's "old guard" is being replaced by a new generation of technocrats with a strong pro-European tilt who will show increased sensitivity to the need for economic policy stabilization. An article in the 8 May issue of I KATHIMERINI characterizes those who entered the National Economy Ministry with Papandoniou as technocrats who are between 30 and 40 and hold modern views on the functioning of the economy. They include (full first names are unknown): -- Y. Kandhalepas, secretary general for international economic relations who is expected to assume larger responsibilities. -- I. Stournaras, a Bank of Greece official and member of the council of economic experts, who is a specialist in monetary affairs. -- I. Tsamourkelis, in charge of plans for the partial privatization of the Greek Telecommunications Organization (0TE). -- K. Lambropoulos, a specialist in exports and trade with the Balkans. -- St. Avgouleas and I. Geivelis, advisers who are alternate directors of the European Union (EU) office in Athens. -- M. Papaioannou, secretary general of the ministry, a holdover from the previous administration whose resignation Papandoniou rejected to avoid creating the impression he is "purging" Yennimatas's aides and changing policy. (Rosa M. x36287) (Athens I KATHIMERINI in Greek 8 May 94 p 46; 6 May 94 p 21) DELAYS SEEN IN PRIVATIZATIONS--According to an article in TO VIMA TIS KIRIAKIS, the privatization of government-owned companies is turning into an intragovernmental controversy. Although an announcement is expected soon on the sale of 30 percent of the Greek Telecommunications Organization (OTE) to the two foreign companies chosen by the previous government, other sales are not going as well. In fact, even the sale of small, failing companies will be "dangerously delayed." Moreover, while certain government officials are promoting plans for the sale of 10 percent of the Public Petroleum Company, others are "dragging their feet" on the Skaramangas shipyards' partial privatization, to which the Greek Government has already obligated itself to the Community. In addition, the Bank of Greece clashed with the Ministry of Industry over its continuing to inject new government capital into debt- ridden government-owned companies. (Rosa M. x36287) (Athens TO VIMA TIS KIRIAKIS in Greek 15 May 94 p D1) TRADE UNIONS LOSING GROUND--An article in TA NEA reports that workers are leaving trade unions in droves, mainly in the private sector, confirming the Greeks' disaffection toward trade union activity. According to polls conducted over a number of years, an overwhelming majority of the workers believes that trade unions are not taking workers' interests to heart and some 86 percent of the workers think that trade unions have become too partisan. Figures show that of the 2 million private sector workers, only 350,000 belong to unions and that in the four-year period between 1989 and 1992, the number of workers participating in trade union elections dropped 14.5 percent. In contrast, civil service trade unions are flourishing, with 85 to 90 percent of public workers unionized and most of them participating in trade union elections. (Rosa M. x36287) (Athens TA NEA in Greek 3 May 94 p 51) ITALY REACTION TO FEDERAL RESERVE RATE INCREASE--Washington correspondent Ennio Caretto, writing in the Milan daily CORRIERE DELLA SERA on 18 May, characterized the Federal Reserve's rate increase on 17 Nay as a "knockout punch" and as totally unexpected. Caretto wrote that the Federal Reserve tried to justify its "historic change of position"--signalling the end of low-cost money in the United States--with the necessity to control inflation and strengthen economic expansion. According to Caretto, President Clinton sided with Federal Reserve Chairman Allen Greenspan "but only formally." In doing so, Caretto claimed Clinton was trying to keep his policy disagreement with Greenspan from becoming public and to dissipate the suspicion that the economy is entering a stagnant phase. However, Caretto added, future events may threaten to dispel Clinton's "forced optimism" and expose the disagreement between the two, who until now had worked together to reduce the deficit. Since Greenspan has frustrated Clinton's policy of lower interest rates, Caretto said, pursuing the opposite strategy and pulling the whole system along, Clinton, "finding himself with his back to the wall, may decide to get rid of the 'friend/enemy' Greenspan." An article in the Turin daily LA STAMPA on 19 May reported the comments of new Treasury Minister Lamberto Dlni and others. According to Dini, Italy and other European countries should not be concerned about the recent Federal Reserve rate increase because it was the right decision to control inflation. The article pointed out that for once industrialists, bankers, and economists are in full accord. Cesare Romiti, Fiat CEO, agrees the decision was intended to control inflation, while Mario Sarcinelli, president of the Banca Nazionle del Lavoro (BNL), stated that the rate increase confirmed the distancing of U.S.'s monetary policy from that of European central banks. In Rome's daily LA REPUBBLICA on 18 May, Vincenzo Nigro commented that not everything is working out as planned for U.S. monetary policy. Nigro stated that the Federal Reserve and especially the Clinton administration have pondered long and hard over the necessity of cooling off an inflation that does not yet exist. Many observers, however, have begun to think that Greenspan is "fighting a ghost." If Greenspan sees a ghost, Nigro said, there is not much Clinton can do about it, despite the fact it may slow down the economic recovery he was hoping would heat up and strengthen by the 1996 elections. Since Clinton cannot use government spending to stimulate the economy, some people believe the peace between him and Greenspan is destined to be brief, Nigro notes. He concluded, "This can only create new problems for the U.S. economy. It is a vicious circle." For this reason, Clinton and his advisers have let it discreetly be known that they do not understand why Greenspan and his aides believe interest rate increases are in order. (Anilla B. x36283) Arguments Against Government Economic Program--Maurizio Valentini, writing in Rome's L'ESPRESSO, points out several reasons why Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's economic program is doomed to failure, since in Valentini's opinion, all of its provisions would lead to inflation. A major aim of the program is to replace gradually direct taxes with indirect ones. Experts at the National Institute for the Study of the Economy (ISC0) say such a move would cause inflation because each percentage point rise in indirect taxes adds that percentage point to the price of consumer goods. In addition, switching from direct to indirect taxes would immediately allow the wage earners more money to spend, increasing domestic demand, which in turn would risk increasing prices. According to Massimo Russo, head of the European Area of the International Monetary Fund, "Italy's major economic risk comes from government spending because budgetary maneuvering room to stimulate the economy is absolutely nonexistent." Valentini interprets this to mean that the only thing Berlusconi can do is to follow the program set out by the governments of his predecessors Giulio Amato and Carlo Azeglio Ciampi. However, Valentini doubts Berlusconi can follow such a rigid plan because the last interest rate drop, which followed that of the German Bundesbank, will probably be the last one for a long time, since higher U.S. interest rates will dictate against another such move. According to former Industry Minister Paolo Savona, a possible Berlusconi intervention in the country's economy that was not strictly tied to improved international competitiveness would only increase the national debt, which would give the international markets the "umpteenth proof" of Italian unreliability. Valentini stresses how disastrous this would be, after Italy's economic image took an upswing in the past two years thanks to the policies of Amato and Ciampi. This improved international image has brought foreign capital into the country, alleviating the national debt. Reversing those policies now would have the opposite effect: less and more expensive capital. "In other words, Berlusconi cannot work an Italian miracle," Valentini concludes, "because the biggest miracle, that of restoring confidence in the Italian economy, has already been provided by Amato and Ciampi."

Since the lira left the EMS in September of 1992, a part of the Italian economy has been able to export "massively," with an "extraordinary" price flexibility, to half of the world's markets, while other European countries are struggling to export anything. Although Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has said he is in no hurry to rejoin the EMS, in a recent radio interview he stated that he was thinking about it and that current foreign exchange market conditions indicate it would be possible. Such a statement, Taino claims, strikes terror in the hearts of many businessmen and draws the interest of speculators. Those who have debated EMS reentry include: -- Mario Monti, dean of the Bocconi University, who thinks the lira could reenter on a central parity that would not undervalue it and that would stimulate Italy's economic structure to become competitive for its own merits and not thanks to favorable exchange rates. -- Innocenzo Cipolletta, director of Confindustria, is convinced the lira, as it now stands, is compatible with economic and monetary convergence with other European countries. However, before reentering the EMS, he believes Italy's interest rates should be in line with those of the other member states and not higher, as is now the case. -- Bruno Rambaudi, owner of a major machine tool company, said that leaving the EMS was the element which allowed Italian industry to remain functional during the recession and to launch a recovery. He said reentry would be possible if inflation and the cost of money were realigned with those of other EMS members, the cost of labor remained under control, and the fight against the deficit continued. -- Gabriel Stein, an economist with London's Lombard Street Research company, believes reentering the EMS would be foolish and finds comfort in the fact that Foreign Minister Antonio Martini is anti-EMS. In Stein's opinion, the friction in the government between the National Alliance and the Northern League could bring on a crisis at any moment and being in the EMS under these conditions could prove to be dangerous. Besides, Stein questions the need to reenter the EMS since the Italian economy is doing well. -- Gilberto Gabrielli, a professor at Bocconi University and manager of one of Milan's major securities houses, said that Berlusconi's discussion of EMS reentry was more political than economic. Gabrielli said that before talking about the virtues of Europe, he would like to see the economic results of the first half year.

At that time, fiscal management was "demoralized and discredited," budget deficits had surpassed the most pessimistic forecasts, and companies used the recession as a pretext to stop their Social Security contributions. Additionally, convergence with the EU was "seriously threatened" by an economic crisis that the former finance minister had been "totally unable" to manage which resulted in an "open war" between the ministry and the Bank of Portugal over the bank's independence in setting monetary policy. Azevedo comments that Catroga's willingness to acknowledge the government's responsibility for the recession has earned good will and that fiscal reform has increased revenues by 250 million contos in the first quarter of this year. Moreover, interest rates are clearly on a downward trend and Catroga is studying various measures to strengthen the capital market. Azevedo contends that the "most radical and obvious" solution is for Bank of Portugal Governor Miguel Beleza, who has confided to close aides that he will resign unless the situation improves, to define clearly his institution's independence and reach a consensus with the government. An article in the Lisbon weekly O INDEPENDENTE maintains that tensions continue in the Bank of Portugal between Beleza and those members of the bank's administrative council appointed by the former finance minister. The article claims that Beleza intends to bring the conflict to Prime Minister Anibel Cavaco Silva's arbitration. Meanwhile, the bank and the government's forecasts for inflation and economic growth do not agree; the bank believes inflation will be 6 percent by the end of the year and the government forecasts 4 to 5.5 percent. Similarly, the Bank of Portugal expects GDP to grow by 1 percent this year while the government forecasts a 1- to 2-percent growth.

In particular, the steel, pharmaceuticals, construction, and furniture industries are favored by the accord. The eight products on which tariffs will be completely eliminated (steel, pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, construction material, farm machinery, furniture, beer, and liquor) are all areas in which Sweden has a comparative advantage. These goods, plus chemicals (where tariffs will be lowered over a 10-year period), account for 25 percent of Sweden's industrial exports. The pharmaceuticals industry, in fact, sells 90 percent of its production abroad. Pharmaceuticals exports, which have been hurt by competition from cheap imitation drugs, will also benefit from new patent and copyright rules. Lindstrom also believes that the Uruguay Round's stricter anti-dumping regulations and new mechanism for settling disputes will also "make the situation brighter for Swedish steel companies." The new methods for resolving disagreements will make it more difficult for large countries to discriminate against smaller ones like Sweden, according to Lindstrom. Truck and stereo manufacturers and the paper industry will also benefit from a one-third reduction of tariffs on other manufactured goods.

During the recent recession, many Swedish firms, instead of letting machines lie idle, disassembled them and sold them abroad, notably to China, Poland and the Baltic states. SI head Magnus Lemmel estimates that Sweden lost about 15 percent of its industrial capacity this way. As a result, the percentage of Sweden's GDP contributed by industry has fallen to about 18 percent--below the OECD requirement for an industrialized country--and imports have risen drastically as production has moved overseas. Industrial investments are now increasing by about 20 percent, but the SI cautions that it may be too late: Even if this rate of investment continues, it will take about a decade to recoup the lost capacity. (Wendy S. x36506) (Stockholm SVENSKA DAGBLADET in Swedish 4 May 94 p 27) DANGER OF BRAIN DRAIN CITED--More highly educated Swedes are being lured out of the country by higher-paying jobs and a greater salary differential in job rankings. The head of the Industrial Research Institute, Gunnar Eliasson, claims that the Swedish wage differential is too low and that the tax system equalizes income too much. According to a study by the consulting firm Human Resources Services (HRS), a chief executive officer in Sweden makes nine times as much as an industrial worker; in the United States and Asia this ratio is 25 to 1. Workers of the new generation, Eliasson points out, are more mobile than their predecessors and the European Economic Area (EEA) agreement will further internationalize the labor market. Eliasson predicts a crisis if only "1 percent of the country's best-educated workers leave." Anders Tapper of HRS does not believe the situation is as serious as Eliasson maintains but does foresee a risk "that companies such as Ericsson, Astra, and Pharmacia will lose their best researchers." Tapper also believes there could be an immigration into Sweden of less-educated workers willing to work for lower wages.

He noted that BSEC, a private corporation established and primarily run by Turkey with Turkish personnel, plays an important role in the country's foreign policy and stated that the Foreign Ministry was ready to cooperate and support any commercial efforts undertaken through the BSEC. Cetin pointed out that the Black Sea region has a market of some $300 million with a need for all kinds of goods and with more modest needs compared with the higher standards required by Western markets. He also claimed that the region has remarkable infrastructure needs, such as harbors, roads, airports, communication networks, energy systems, pipelines, dams, housing construction, and tourism, providing Turkish companies with a variety of business possibilities.
