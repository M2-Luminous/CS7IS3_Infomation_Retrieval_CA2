The sentence is to be carried out in a prison with the second highest security level. The verdict has not yet taken effect, and the accused and the state attorney are still able to appeal against it. Justifying the verdict, Judge Premysl Spicar said that by betraying state secrets in 1992, Wallis committed two crimes -- that of threatening state secrets and abusing public office. Despite the objections of the defense, the court said Wallis was a public servant, although it did not uphold the claim of the prosecution that by abuse of public office Wallis had caused particularly serious consequences. Thus the court finally gave a lower sentence than that asked for by the state attorney, who in his closing speech had proposed that Wallis be imprisoned for 6.5 years.
