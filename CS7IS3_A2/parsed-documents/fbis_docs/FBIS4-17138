Together with television viewers we are expecting your report on the Georgian-Abkhaz talks in Geneva. [Ioseliani] Good morning. What are you interested in? [Announcer] What happened yesterday at the meeting between the Georgian and Abkhaz delegations? Some documents were to be discussed yesterday, I mean the documents worked out by UN and Russian diplomats. [Ioseliani] This document could have been used as the basis but it was impossible to accept it in its present form. The Abkhaz side yesterday suggested a completely unacceptable plan -- as could have been expected -- to legalize what they gained after the war. They are trying to breach Georgia's territorial integrity and create a union of the two states, create a confederation which will mean that there will be Georgia and Abkhazia. They [Georgia and Abkhazia] would conclude an alliance which would have a mutual body to regulate these two states. This suggestion was completely unacceptable for the United Nations, the Security Council, for us, and for everybody. But there is an intermediate plan put forward by the United Nations and the Russians and we are working on it now. We shall see what will happen, although we have no great hopes because yesterday they [the UN and the Russians] said that it was the maximum that they could suggest as our [Georgians'] suggestions were unacceptable for them [Abkhazians] and vice versa. [Announcer] Batono Jaba, are the places where the peacekeeping forces will be deployed mentioned in the documents, or is this still to be discussed? [Ioseliani] The question now is the political status [of Abkhazia]. As you know, the issue of deployment has fallen through. The Abkhazians then demanded the unacceptable: If the peacekeeping forces were to enter the territory adjacent to the Inguri river -- it was specified in the agreement that the UN peacekeeping forces would have been deployed in the conflict zone -- the Abkhazians demanded that peacekeeping forces also enter the territories near Zugdidi. I do not think that anything will be resolved today but we must still work on it. Nothing ventured, nothing gained! And besides, the world must learn what we are suggesting from the point of view of the political settlement. Probably everything will have been finished by tomorrow because I think nothing will happen today. [Announcer] You have been listening to a member of the [Georgian] delegation at the Georgian-Abkhaz talks in Geneva.
