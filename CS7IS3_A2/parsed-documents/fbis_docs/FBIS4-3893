According to the China Labor Development Bulletin issued here jointly today by the Labor Ministry and the Statistics Bureau, some 600 cities and counties nationwide had by the end of last year taken up reform of the pension calculation system, involving a total of 25 million workers. Some 13 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities have put their pensions under a unified provincial plan, in which the pensions are shared on the provincial scale. Township enterprises in 1,900 cities and counties across the country have introduced unified social management of retirement pay, which better protects the interests of the retired workers. To lighten the burden of enterprises, over 1,000 cities and counties now distribute pensions through banks or social insurance institutions, a practice common internationally. According to the bulletin, the reform of the industrial injury insurance system, focusing on centralized administration and socialized management, is drawing nearer completion. The reform has covered over 500 cities and counties in 19 provinces and autonomous regions, involving 11 million people. Labor Ministry Spokesman Liu Guanxue told reporters today that the vigorous reform of the unemployment insurance system has produced good results. A total of 530,000 enterprises and 79 million working staff have benefited from the reform. According to Liu, China had collected 1.63 billion yuan for the insurance fund by the end of 1993. Some 930 million yuan had been used on the unemployed. A total of 1.03 million jobless people had received unemployment relief aid from various labor departments. According to the release, some 5.5 million women workers from 300 cities and counties have been placed under the protection of the maternity insurance which effectively boosted the employment of women.
