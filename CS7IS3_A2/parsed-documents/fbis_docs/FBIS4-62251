At a meeting with local authorities, he stated that according to U.S. satellite surveillance, there is a huge oil field in this rayon and the adjacent stretch of Azov Sea, no smaller than the famous field in Kuwait. N. Ormandzhi, deputy chairman of the oblast administration, told a ZAPORIZKA PRAVDA correspondent that the U.S. oil expert had offered Zaporozhye residents assistance in surveying oil deposits, which he believes, lie about 1.5 km below the surface. CIS-made drilling equipment cannot drill deeper than 500 meters. In the words of the guest, his company, if a relevant agreement is signed, is ready to immediately allocate $10 million for exploratory and test drillings, and will demand no compensation in the event of a negative result. After the American toured the region, he asked for some preliminary documentation, and promised to return in May. By that time, the authorities need to make a decision. However, the "Krymgeologiya" and presidential representative in Priazovye rayon, N. Kalayanov, is very much in doubt that there are oil deposits in the region. On the other hand, some 20 years ago, local residents often found some greasy liquid in local rivers, the color and smell of which was reminiscent of oil condensate that is always found near oil deposits. While it remains to be seen whether U.S. experts will find oil in the rayon, natural gas has already been found here, and plenty of it. According to N. Oramndzhi, the size of gas deposits may amount to 5 billion cubic meters -- or even larger, because the 100-meter-deep layer runs way beyond the rayon's boundary. The "Krymgeologiya" state enterprise, with which the state administration signed an agreement, has already started drilling 12 wells. Each of the wells will enable extraction of as much as 1,000 cubic meters of gas per day. Experts estimate that construction costs of those wells, 1.8 billion rubles, will be earned back within eight months. Those estimates are well grounded -- back in 1936, the first experimental gas-filling station in the country was built in Priazovye rayon, and it supplied natural gas to boiler-houses and automobiles until 1950. So, gas is already in the rayon. There might also be oil. Moneybags from Texas would not throw their money down the drain.
