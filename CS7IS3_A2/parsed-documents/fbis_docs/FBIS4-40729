But, he said, the armsrace launched by certain countries of that region compelled Armenia to work constantly on the technical potential of its army. Under the treaty on conventional weapons, Armenia could have no more than 220 tanks, 220 other armored vehicles, including 135 MICV's, 100 combat planes and 50 combat helicopters. It can have no more than 60,000 troops. According to Dalibaltayan, the armed forces were brought up almost to their full strength and sufficiently well equipped with weapons and hardware. They were still wanting officers but, Dalibaltayan said, an all-arms army college was to open in Armenia this year. Several think tanks related to the national Defense Ministry were working on Armenia's military doctrine. The staff under President Ter-Petrosyan would come out with a draft doctrine of their own, Dalibaltayan said. Whether or not Armenia supplied Nagorno-Karabakh with weapons and army hardware, was absolutely immaterial, he said, because in the course of combat operations the Karabakh defense forces had captured enormous stocks of weapons and hardware, materiel and ammunition. A sufficient number of Armenian volunteers went to defend the sovereignty of Karabakh, Dalibaltayan said.
