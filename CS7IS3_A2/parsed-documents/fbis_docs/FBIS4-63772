The guest met with Anatoliy Zlenko, Ukraine's minister of foreign affairs, President Leonid Kravchuk, and other state leaders. "To us Ukraine is a very important European state," Mr. Hurd told journalists at Borispol Airport. Asked what national security guarantees Britain can provide to Ukraine, Mr. Hurd said: "The fact that Ukraine has joined NATO's Partnership for Peace program is your security guarantee." The foreign ministers of Ukraine and Great Britain met and held talks at Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Speaking to journalists, Anatoliy Zlenko said: "During our one-on-one conversation we discussed opportunities for strengthening our bilateral ties, focusing on issues facing the European Community today. In particular, these issues concern the international conference on the Pact of Stability in Europe [as received] to be held in Paris, Ukraine's steps toward membership in the European Union, and issues of primary importance for the development of economic cooperation." Anatoliy Zlenko expressed his satisfaction with Mr. Hurd's visit to Kiev. "I am pleased to note," the Ukrainian minister said, "that our relations are good enough to allow us to be frank in our conversations." Speaking of the possibility of international organizations (UN and CSCE) influencing settlement of the "Crimean problem," Mr. Hurd said that these issues will be studied, but he believes Ukraine is capable of solving the problem itself. During the meeting between President Leonid Kravchuk and Douglas Hurd, the president said: "We are not demanding anything special from Crimea. We are only demanding adherence to the Ukrainian Constitution. Ukraine will under no circumstances use force to solve the `Crimean problem': All issues must be resolved only through negotiations."
