[passage omitted] "It is clear that the party of Democratic Kampuchea (DK or Khmer Rouge) is not sincere in its supposed desires for peace and national reconciliation," a statement from the prince said. A contradiction in the Khmer Rouge's support for a proposal from King Norodom Sihanouk to end the conflict between the guerrillas and the government revealed their insincerity, the prince said. "The simple proof is that, while declaring they accept all the elements of His Majesty the King of Cambodia's proposal, the Khmer Rouge do not want to recognise the Royal Government of Cambodia and at the same time they insist that they become members or advisors to that same government," the prince said. In a clandestine meeting on December 17, the prince and the guerrilla leader agreed to set up a working group to discuss implementing the king's proposal where in exchange for ceasing all guerrilla activities, opening up their zones and merging their fighters with the national army, "acceptable" members of the Khmer Rouge would be given senior government posts. In his statement, the prince dismissed Khieu Samphan's accusation that he had reneged on an agreement over the composition of the working group. Khieu Samphan said the two leaders had settled on a formula where the group should either consist of representatives from just the Khmer Rouge and the royalists or if the Cambodian People's Party (CPP) were to be included, then the third party in the coalition government, the small Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party, had also to be represented. But the prince -- who recently appointed just two representatives, cabinet ministers Veng Sereivut from FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] and Sok An from the CPP -- said he told the guerrilla leader that the king's proposal "clearly referred" to talks between the "DK and Royal Government," not between the guerrillas and individual parties in the coalition government. [passage omitted] The government has up to 2,000 troops poised ready for a final attack on the radical faction's key base at Anlong Veng near the Thai border in northern Siem Reap province, the minister said. Meanwhile, a former prime minister of the Vietnamese-installed Phnom Penh regime, Pen Sovann, criticised the notion of bringing Khmer Rouge officials into the government. "Their hands are soaked in the people's blood so we should ask the people whether we want to welcome them," Pen Sovann, who was ousted from his premier post in a 1981 internal party feud, said.
