ACTION: Notice of Correction to the Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 1994. SUMMARY: On April 1, 1994, HUD published a NOFA that announced FY 1994 funding of $231,978,631 under the Public and Indian Housing Drug Elimination Program (PHDEP) for use in eliminating drug-related crime. The purpose of this notice is to make corrections to the section specifying eligible applicants for one of the activities under the NOFA and to the number of points in one of the selection criteria. DATES: The original application deadline date is not changed. Applications must be received at the local HUD Field Office on or before Friday, July 29, 1994, at 3:30 PM, local time. This application deadline is firm as to date and hour. In the interest of fairness to all competing applicants, the Department will treat as ineligible for consideration any application that is received after the deadline. Applicants should take this practice into account and make early submission of their materials to avoid any risk of loss of eligibility brought about by any unanticipated or delivery-related problems. A FAX is not acceptable.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) announcing HUD's FY 1994 funding of $231,978,631 under the Public and Indian Housing Drug Elimination Program (PHDEP) was published on April 1, 1994 (59 FR 15574). Paragraph I.(c)(1)(ii) of the NOFA, under the heading Employment of Housing Authority Police , which listed housing authorities eligible to apply because they have their own housing authority (HA) police department, omitted from the list the HA of the City of Waterbury, Waterbury, CT, and the Buffalo HA, Buffalo, NY, and incorrectly included the Newark Housing Authority, Newark, NJ. In addition, the listing for the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development, NYC, NY, should have read: New York City Public Housing Authority, NYC, NY. This notice corrects the April 1, 1994 PHDEP NOFA by republishing the entire list of eligible applicants under paragraph I.(c)(1)(ii) to add the two omitted HAs to the list, to delete the one incorrectly listed, and to amend the listing for the New York City Public Housing Authority. This notice also corrects the number of points that will be awarded under the first selection criterion of the NOFA. Specifically, five points are added to the subcriteria at sections I.(d)(1) (v) and (vi), raising each to 15 points, and raising the total number of points to 130.
