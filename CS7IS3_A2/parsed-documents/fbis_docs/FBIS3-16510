He did not tell the Georgian parliament which particular countries were meant, but noted that their number might increase. He told Interfax that the Georgian parliament's decision to dismiss the Abkhazian parliament was somewhat hasty and not quite justified from the tactical point of view. "However, in principle, it does not contradict the political context of the situation," he said. IF Note: The Georgian parliament ruled that pending parliamentary elections in Abkhazia the functions of the Abkhazian parliament will be performed by the Abkhazian Council of Ministers which will be granted the status of a temporarily evacuated body. The resolution also says that all the laws, adopted by the Abkhazian separatists, shall be considered invalid. Chairman of the Abkhazian parliament Vladislav Ardzinba told Interfax that the talks on settling the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict would not be continued until the Georgian parliament annulled its resolution. He also said that the peace-making process was interrupted through Georgia's fault. On Tuesday, the Abkhazian parliament circulated a statement which says that no further talks would be held on peaceful settlement of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict. The Georgian parliament's decision to dismiss the Abkhazian parliament and to put the Abkhazian deputies on trial "illustrates that Georgia has put the stake on military solution again," says this document. The Abkhazian parliament qualified the Georgian parliment's revolution as illegal, because Abkhazia, it said, is an independent state, not part of Georgia. The statement also says that if the Georgian parliament reviewed its decision, the parliament of Abkhazia would continue the search for a peaceful settlement of the conflict. Russia's Foreign Ministry expressed concern about this situation and about a real threat of armed clashes. To quote Grigoriy Karasin, the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry's Department for Information and the Press, "Georgian-Abkhazian relations have deteriorated, producing a real threat of an armed conflict." At the final stage of the talks in New York, Georgia openly threatened to step back onto the path of war if Abkhazia did not unconditionally recognize Georgia's territorial integrity and agree to accept all Georgian refugees," he said. He announced that Russia was making urgent steps to prevent armed clashes in Abkhazia and interruption of the talks. "It will also support UN or UN-apporved peacekeeping operations in Abkhazia, based, if necessary, on a Russian military contingent," said Karasin.
