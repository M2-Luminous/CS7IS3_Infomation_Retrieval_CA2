Section 86.605&hyph;98 includes text that specifies requirements that differ from §86.605&hyph;88. Where a paragraph in §86.605&hyph;88 is identical and applicable to §86.605&hyph;98, this may be indicated by specifying the corresponding paragraph and the statement ``[Reserved]. For guidance see §86.605&hyph;88.'' Where a corresponding paragraph of §86.605&hyph;88 is not applicable, this is indicated by the statement ``[Reserved].''. (a) through (a)(1)(i)(D) [Reserved]. For guidance see §86.605&hyph;88. (E) Refueling Enclosure (Refueling SHED). ( 1 ) Total internal volume. ( 2 ) Capacity of mixing blower. ( 3 ) Location of refueling access ports. ( 4 ) Enclosure barometric pressure and ambient temperature. ( 5 ) Soak area temperature records. (F) Fuel Dispenser for Refueling. ( 1 ) Fuel dispensing rate. ( 2 ) Manufacturer and model of fuel nozzle. ( 3 ) Dispensed fuel temperature. ( 4 ) Dispensed fuel volume. (a)(1)(ii) through (e) [Reserved]. For guidance see §86.605&hyph;88. 4. A new §86.608&hyph;98 is added to subpart G to read as follows: §86.608&hyph;98 Test procedures. (a) The prescribed test procedures are the Federal Test Procedure, including the refueling test procedure or the fuel spitback test, whichever is applicable, as described in subpart B of this part, the cold temperature CO test procedure as described in subpart C of this part, and the Certification Short Test as described in subpart O of this part. For purposes of Selective Enforcement Audit Testing, the manufacturer shall not be required to perform any of the test procedures in subpart B of this part relating to evaporative emission testing, other than refueling emissions testing, except as specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. (1) The Administrator may omit any of the testing procedures described in paragraph (a) of this section and may select and prescribe the sequence of any CSTs. Further, the Administrator may, on the basis of a written application by a manufacturer, approve optional test procedures other than those in subparts B, C, and O of this part for any motor vehicle which is not susceptible to satisfactory testing using the procedures in subparts B, C, and O of this part. (2) The following exceptions to the test procedures in subpart B of this part are applicable to Selective Enforcement Audit testing: (i) For mileage accumulation, the manufacturer may use test fuel meeting the specifications for mileage and service accumulation fuels of §86.113&hyph;94. Otherwise, the manufacturer may use fuels other than those specified in this section only with the advance approval of the Administrator. (ii) The manufacturer may measure the temperature of the test fuel at other than the approximate mid-volume of the fuel tank, as specified in §86.131&hyph;96(a) with only a single temperature sensor, and may drain the test fuel from other than the lowest point of the tank, as specified in §86.131&hyph;96(b) and §86.152&hyph;98(a), provided an equivalent method is used. Equivalency documentation shall be maintained by the manufacturer and shall be made available upon request. (iii) The manufacturer may perform additional preconditioning on SEA test vehicles other than the preconditioning specified in §86.132&hyph;98 only if the additional preconditioning had been performed on certification test vehicles of the same configuration. (iv) If the Administrator elects to use the evaporative/refueling canister preconditioning procedure described in §86.132&hyph;96(k), the manufacturer shall perform the heat build procedure 11 to 34 hours following vehicle preconditioning rather than according to the time period specified in §86.133&hyph;90(a). All references to an evaporative emission enclosure and analyzing for HC during the heat build can be ignored.
