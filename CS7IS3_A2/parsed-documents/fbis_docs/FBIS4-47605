FBIS TRENDS--04MAY94-Japan Automakers Seek Cheaper Steel Supplies Automakers Seek Cheaper Steel Supplies Japan's prolonged economic slump may be playing a role in changing archetypical Japanese business practices such as maintaining long-term supplier-buyer relationships between materials producers and manufacturers. Recent Japanese press reports suggest that a number of Japanese automakers have decided to emphasize economic rationality over stable business relationships with Japanese steelmakers. Reflecting this trend, the 21 April Nikkei Sangyo Shimbun quoted Mitsubishi Motors executives as stating that from now on they would buy steel from "any domestic or foreign supplier that can supply appropriate quality steel at a lower price." A day earlier, Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported that Mitsubishi Motors estimated that it could cut total car production costs by at least 10 percent if it used South Korean steel. The paper also reported that Mitsubishi Motors has for the first time begun testing the quality of cold rolled steel sheet made by South Korea's Pohang Iron and Steel Company for use in its cars. The paper also noted that all Japanese automakers except Toyota are discreetly considering the use of South Korean steel to cut costs. (AUTHOR: INNES.
