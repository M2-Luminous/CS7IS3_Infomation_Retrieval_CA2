The reformed tax laws have not spurred on inflation as some predicted. Instead, it successfully increased central finance. Finance Minister Liu Zhongli said the new system has almost fortified government revenue while causing only a negligible blip in inflation. He claimed that the reform has been generally successful. Accompanied with changes in banking and at state enterprises, the tax reform aims at boosting dwindling state coffers and is believed to be one of the biggest and boldest steps in 1994 -- a crucial year for reform, leaders repeatedly say. The focus is on re-distributing revenue between central and local authorities and between the government and enterprises. Taking the place of the contract system, by which localities are only required to turn over a fixed amount of their revenue to central coffers, the new collecting method breaks payments into three parts: One to the central government, another to the local administration, and the rest shared by both. The reform has put enterprises of different ownerships in the same tax bracket of 33 per cent, creating a fair environment for competition. Meanwhile, the government cut the original 40 tax items in half and focused mainly on collecting value-added taxes. This turns out to be more scientific and easier to carry out . However when the system first went into effect on January 1, experts worried that double-digit inflation was not providing the right climate for tax reform. Some feared it would fuel inflation. Theoretically the reform will trigger cost-push inflation because some enterprises will transfer the increased tax payment onto consumers. But economists may rest assured. The price hikes inherited from the second half of last year can be traced to the above-target money supply, overheated fixed-assets investment, and the raise in grain prices. "The tax reform has not pulled up the inflation rates at a large margin," said Minister Liu, also director of the State Administration of Taxation (SAT). Before the reform each ton of steel cost more than 4,000 yuan ($461.9). The price actually fell thereafter. Plainly, it is still the relationship between demand and supply which sets prices. And while city folk complain that vegetables are more expensive than a few months ago, they can't blame this on the tax reform. The rate on the retail sales of vegetables has remained unchanged. But some wholesalers and retailers are raising the prices of their goods and services at the excuse of the reform. To check the malpractice, the central government has launched nationwide inspection tours and enhanced supervision on price management. These measures have kept the reform on the right track. According to the SAT, state tax revenue jumped 29.2 per cent in the first four months, compared with the same period last Year. Central finance revenue was 85 billion yuan ($981 million) more than expenditures. Generally speaking, most enterprises feel a lighter tax burden. In Fujian Province the new system cut 49 million yuan ($5.6 million) in taxes from state industrial enterprises, according to the Economic Information Daily. Foreign investors who find themselves paying the same amount of taxes as last year have dispelled any misgivings toward the reform. But the new system also hits some firms hard. The Economic Information Daily says that waterworks and those using farm products as major raw materials in Fujian shoulder heavier taxes than before. It suggests that the government consider lightening the burden on these firms. The SAT does, in fact, extend preferential measures to some enterprises. Welfare-oriented enterprises, school-run factories, and some commercial wholesalers are refunded part of their tax; the value-added tax rate for things like coal and farm products has dropped from 17 per cent to 13 per cent. SAT says that some enterprises are crying about increased taxes because the new system has stopped loopholes that used to make tax-dodging possible. At the same time, the central government is aware of some technical problems in the enforcement of new taxes. According to the People's Daily, only 40 per cent of stores know how to correctly make out value-added tax receipts. Some people in Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Shanghai even print and peddle fake receipts. Also the paper criticized a few local authorities who don't understand the new tax system. Their misunderstanding will likely upset the new system, it said.
