Dr. Mahmud al-Zahhar stressed to QUDS PRESS: Naturally, we will not participate in any legislative or executive institution linked to self-rule so that we will not bear the responsibility for signing an agreement that is incompatible with our doctrine and political program. Hamas, however, will participate in any elections to choose the Palestinian people's representatives provided those elections are not connected to the agreement or to any preconditions that might divert the elections toward political goals that are inconsistent with our tendencies. Al-Zahhar ruled out any clash between the Palestinian authority expected to be established in the occupied territories and Hamas. He said: We will endeavor to solve our problems on a personal level. In the event that any problem develops we will ask to meet with PLO officials or the authority to resolve the differences. [passage omitted]
