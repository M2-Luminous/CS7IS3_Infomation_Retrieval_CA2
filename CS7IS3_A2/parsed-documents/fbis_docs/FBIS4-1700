FBIS4-1700 "drchi064_b_94006" FBIS-CHI-94-064 Daily Report 1 Apr 1994 United States & Canada World Bank: Costs of MFN Withdrawal `High' for China, U.S. World Bank: Costs of MFN Withdrawal `High' for China, U.S. OW0104231294 Beijing XINHUA in English 2237 GMT 1 Apr 94 OW0104231294 Beijing XINHUA English BFN [Text] Washington, April 1 (XINHUA) -- Chinese exporters are not the only ones that would lose if the country's most favored nation (MFN) status in trading with the U.S. is withdrawn, the latest study of the World Bank said today. "U.S. consumers could end up paying as much as 14 billion U.S. dollars per year in higher prices resulting from a combination of costlier substitutes from alternative supply sources," the study said. The study "China: Foreign Trade Reform" said that "it appears that the dislocation in trade flows likely to result from withdrawal of China's mfn privileges by the U.S. would range from the dramatic to the disastrous, with the associated costs high for both parties." It should be noted, the study said, that it is possible for China to find alternative export markets to make up for these losses. China's annual export losses in the U.S. market could be on the order of seven to 15.2 billion dollars. This is a decline between 42 and 96 percent for the 15 major products China exports to the U.S., whose combined projected losses are between 3.7 and 8.5 billion dollars, with about one half of this reduction registered in the key clothing and toys or games group. Among the 15 major export products of China to U.S. are, in line of export value in 1990, toys and indoor games, clothing of textile fabric, footwear, travel goods and handbags, radio broadcast equipment, fresh or frozen shellfish, made-up textile articles, and furniture. "It appears likely that Chinese exports to the U.S. would face grave difficulty due to major cost disadvantage associated with U.S. general tariffs," which is 42 percent on average for the 15 products, as compared with 13.4 percent mfn tariff, the study said. "With such a major upward shift in the level of import duties, Chinese exports to the U.S. will clearly experience a major decline, and in some product groups, may be completely eliminated," the study said. MFN applies to all members of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). The U.S. provisionally granted mfn status to China, a non-GATT member, in 1973. U.S. domestic legislation requires the review of China's MFN status on a yearly basis.
