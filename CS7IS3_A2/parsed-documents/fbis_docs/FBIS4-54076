With the formation of Chongnyon on May 25, 1955, a proud new history of the movement of Koreans overseas based on the chuche idea was opened and, since then, the movement of Koreans overseas has developed as a genuine national patriotic movement, definitely getting on the track of chuche, the editorial notes, and continues: By adopting the policy of modeling its ranks on the chuche idea as the main line, Chongnyon has thoroughly established the chuche- based ideological system and leadership system in the organization and fortified the singlehearted unity of the ranks and firmly built up its ranks into a patriotic organization of loyalty that would believe and follow always only the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. In recent years, it has made a new progress in preparing the younger generations as trustworthy successors to the patriotic cause, thereby creating a firm guarantee for stengthening and developing the Chongnyon organization into an eternal chuche-based organization of the citizens overseas of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, a patriotic organisation. Chongnyon has intensified the work of national unity among the Koreans overseas under the banner of great national unity, energetically waged the movement for national reunification as a mass movement embracing all the compatriots in Japan and strengthened friendship and unity with the world progressive people including the Japanese people, contributing to winning greater international support and solidarity for the socialist cause of chuche, the cause of national reunification and the patriotic cause of Chongnyon. Although the situation has become complicated and the reactionaries' moves against the DPRK and Chongnyon have become more vicious, the Chongnyon officials and Koreans in Japan are giving spurs to the consolidation of the Chongnyon organization and fulfilment of patriotic tasks, deeply cherishing in their minds the faith that they will certainly emerge victorious since there is dear Comrade Kim Chong-il and the faith that the patriotic ranks of Chongnyon united in one mind around the dear leader are invincible. The editorial notes that all achievements made by Chongnyon are a great victory of the chuche-based idea of the respected leader Comrade Kim Il-song on the movement of Koreans overseas and a brilliant fruition of the wise leadership and paternal loving care of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il.
