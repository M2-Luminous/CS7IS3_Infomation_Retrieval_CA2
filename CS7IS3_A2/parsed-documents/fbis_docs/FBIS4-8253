"I believe nobody is interested in confrontation," Klaus told journalists at the break in the congress, at which he delivered a speech. CMKOS Chairman Vladimir Petrus, commenting on Klaus's address said that "he was glad to hear some of Klaus' statements, but had to think about others." Regarding the apology which the trade union leadership demanded from Klaus for comparing the trade union demonstration on March 22 in Prague Old Town Square to the pro-communist demonstration from February 25, 1948, Petrus said that Klaus's presence at the union congress was already his apology. "Klaus would have definitely not attended a conference of participants in a new February putsch. He came to the congress of his own trade unions in the Czech Republic and I personally fully satisfied with such an apology," Petrus said.
