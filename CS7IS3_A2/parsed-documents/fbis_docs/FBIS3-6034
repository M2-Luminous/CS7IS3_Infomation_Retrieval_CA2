Nakamura, 44, was arrested Friday on suspicion of receiving a 10 million yen bribe from giant contractor Kajima Corp. in January 1992. Under the code of criminal procedure, a suspect can be detained for up to 20 days for interrogation before indictment, following the initial two to three days of detention after the arrest. The money Nakamura allegedly accepted was intended as a reward for using his influence as a Diet member to help block the Fair Trade Commission (FTC) from filing an accusation against a cartel of 66 contractors, including Kajima, over bid-rigging practices, prosecution sources said. At the time, Nakamura was the deputy chief of the Special Committee on Antimonopoly Laws of then governing Liberal Democratic Party. Now an independent member of the House of Representatives, Nakamura has been in custody at the Tokyo detention house since Friday to undergo interrogation by prosecutors. His arrest came immediately after the Diet stripped Nakamura of parliamentary immunity from arrest following prosecutors' request. He had refused to comply with prosecutors' questioning over his bribery suspicion. In Japan, apprehending a Diet member while in a parliament session needs Diet approval. The Diet is in a 150-day regular session.
