Shot in various Iraqi towns, the first in four episodes focused on complaints by Iraqis about the effects of the sanctions on their daily lives and comments by Iraqi officials. Several of those interviewed said they could not understand why the embargo was being maintained "after Kuwait was returned to the Kuwaitis" and called for the Arab states to support Baghdad's position to have the sanctions lifted. The UN embargo was imposed days after Iraq invaded Kuwait on August 2, 1990. Iraqi Trade Minister Muhammad Mahdi Salih also told the program that his country opposed a UN resolution allowing for the sale of limited quantities of oil under United Nations control. Iraq says the restrictions for the sale harm its sovereignty. Besides Oman, which has always maintained normal relations with Iraq, Qatar is the only GCC country to have restored links with Baghdad after it participated in the U.S.-led coalition that ousted Iraq from Kuwait in February 1991. The GCC also groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain.
