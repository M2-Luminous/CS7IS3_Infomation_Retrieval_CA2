In diplomatic terms, this is certainly a short period for making any radical changes, and he has had additional difficulties: the communications isolation of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the war conditions that result in additional factors in the way our country appears abroad. On the other hand, the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina are still hoping that the international community could, by putting more pressure on the aggressor, speed up the solution to the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is only an additional burden for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Minister Ljubijankic personally. [Luckin] Minister Ljubijankic, you have recently presented an initiative to the NATO secretary general for Bosnia-Herzegovina to be accepted into the military alliance Partnership for Peace. What was the reason for this, and does it announce a new course in the foreign policy of Bosnia-Herzegovina? We Are a European Country [Ljubijankic] No. This is only the natural course of our becoming a European country. On 23 December last year we submitted a kind of application, a letter that I addressed to Manfred Woerner, in which I presented our intentions and our willingness to meet all the requirements to become a member of Partnership for Peace. As you know, Partnership for Peace is an initiative -- the response of the United States to the request of Eastern European countries for admission to NATO. The United States could not accept the full membership of the Eastern European countries in NATO, probably in diplomatic and political consideration of Russia, but it set the framework within which cooperation with NATO is possible. Such is Partnership for Peace. Within this group the countries would have to coordinate their military programs, their military industries programs, their strategic goals, and their military maneuvers, in other words, all the elements of military strategy and their military and political organization. [Luckin] Where do you see the positions of Bosnia-Herzegovina in this alliance? [Ljubijankic] We consider ourselves part of Europe. We are a country that has had the same experience with totalitarian communism as the countries of Eastern Europe. We can thus enter this NATO project on an equal basis, on the grounds of our cultural, geographical, and political characteristics, and our efforts to create a democratic country. Therefore, Europe is our framework, as is democracy; cooperation with the Western military Alliance is our choice. [Luckin] On the other hand, however, our republic is often reproached in international circles for providing a place for Islam to break through into Europe. What is your interpretation of this and of the criticism that we are too oriented toward the Arabic countries in our foreign policy? [Ljubijankic] I would not say that we are criticized for this in Europe; these are our own dilemmas. We are a European country and we can be nothing else. Our peculiarity is that we are a European country with a centuries-old Islamic tradition. This is perhaps a new quality, and an interesting symbiosis that the world perhaps fears a little. We must explain to the world what this is and dispel the fear and prejudice. I see no reason for religion, as a private matter for the individual, to be a cause of fear in a secular state. The Process of Forming the State [Luckin] The war conditions and the communications blockade are, no doubt, additional problems for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. How do you see the present activities, as well as the process of constituting this ministry? [Ljubijankic] You see, we are in the process of forming a state. The people who came to power at the democratic elections, who readily took over the responsibility too, are mostly people with not too much experience in the state and legal organization of the Muslim Bosniak people and Bosnia as a state. When I say Muslim Bosniak people I do not exclude them from Bosnia; they are an integral part of the multicultural Bosnia, just as the other components are. The activities of our ministry at a time of war are subject to our efforts to organize a better state. Naturally, this is much more difficult in war conditions, but we have succeeded to a great extent. The ministry plays a role in establishing the country abroad, in which we have also succeeded to a great extent, although we are faced with a blockade that has its sociological and political causes, which I would not like to go into now. However, it is a fact that we have friends in the world, and it is a fact that many organizations, individuals, and eminent intellectuals support the existence of Bosnia-Herzegovina. That official policies do not always follow public opinion results from the fact that official policies always follow highly pragmatic interests, the geostrategic interests of a country or the group of countries to which it belongs. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, naturally, has another task, which is to develop a diplomatic-consular network that did not previously exist. This is a major and serious project, and we sometimes lack experience in carrying it out, but we certainly have a resolute intention to complete it and incorporate it into the state system. [Luckin] There has been much talk about the selection of ambassadors. Could you clarify the criteria for their selection, and what do you say to the stories about this being a way to put certain prominent people in safe places, far from the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina? Strategic Goal -- An Integral Bosnia-Herzegovina [Ljubijankic] I would not say this is correct. The criteria are similar to those in other countries: an established political profile, an established political attitude and structure that corresponds to the positions of our country, as well as all the general criteria, such as language, education, and even physical appearance. [Luckin] What direction will the future efforts of Bosnia-Herzegovina's diplomacy take in presenting and supporting the interests of our country abroad, and have there been any changes in the international view of the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina? [Ljubijankic] We all have a unitary Bosnia-Herzegovina in our hearts. If you listened to President Izetbegovic's speech at the constitutent session of the SDA [Party of Democratic Action] City Council of Sarajevo, you will have heard his vision of the tactics for achieving that goal. I have nothing to add or take away from that statement. Therefore, an integral Bosnia-Herzegovina is our strategic goal, but the circumstances on the ground will not permit a rapid realization of it. Naturally, this kind of Bosnia- Herzegovina is our right, and, in my opinion, we should neither cede it nor give it to someone else. An integral Bosnia-Herzegovina in these areas is an achievement of centuries of history, so to speak. We were destined to be the ones to create Bosnia-Herzegovina as an integral state, and we should not drop it in such a short time. I think that there have been certain changes in the attitude of the international community toward an integral Bosnia-Herzegovina, but they are still ineffective. There have been changes, but they have not yielded any results yet. These changes should have more impact; they should be more effective and more efficient, and really change the position of Bosnia-Herzegovina in the negotiating process. Europe still believes that the solution that it has offered would be a modus vivendi, that it would be a way to bring peace to Bosnia-Herzegovina. We would, naturally, not like it to be peace at any price. [Luckin] There are opinions that a more aggressive foreign policy toward the countries of Western Europe, especially Britain and France, could significantly change the position of Bosnia-Herzegovina. [Ljubijankic] People sometimes think that diplomacy is something that just requires additional engagement, an additional effort, to make things change for the better. Diplomacy is a series of small steps, and there are no spectacular results, not even in the case of great countries, let alone with a small country that has suffered a lot and that has been developing its diplomacy through a war. Therefore, we could not expect any great gain or great change if we were to redirect our diplomatic activities toward England and France. Indeed, we have done so. There Is Always Someone Obstructing I have spent seven days in London, and there have been some positive results since this visit. There have also been several letters. We have made certain commitments -- naturally, within the diplomatic framework. England has indirectly made a commitment to work on a better understanding of our position of a country at war. We have suspended all our activities concerning pressing charges against England at the International Court. As far as France is concerned, there have been some positive changes, but, you see, there is always another France or another England. When these countries are prepared to make a concession, a change in the position in the collective bodies of the international community that are relevant in making decisions, there is always someone to obstruct that. I therefore think that it is not only a matter of France and England, but a larger number of countries that simply will not allow Bosnia-Herzegovina enough room to maneuver for it to survive. Luckily, we do have friends. The United States is one of them. However, the United States is strongly tied to France and England in implementing its strategic interests and the strategic interests of all NATO.
