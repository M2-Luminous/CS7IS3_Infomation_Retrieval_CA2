The left third of each ad has a photograph of the person quoted in the text of the ad. Following the text of each ad is the National Party motto "BE SURE OF A BETTER LIFE", followed by "Vote for FW de Klerk and the new National Party", the NP logo, and a photograph of De Klerk next to a voter's cross. Each ad ends with: "We've made the change." The first ad on page 11 has the photograph of Colin Wainer with the caption, "'I've never voted before, but now I'm voting National Party'." The text reads: "'I'm Colin Wainer, a professional freelance photographer, I'm 35 years old and I've never voted before. I always considered politics to be for politicians. "Two weeks ago the NP's advertising agency commissioned me to photograph people endorsing the NP for their ad campaign. For me, just another job that I was happy to do. "Since then I've photographed amongst others, a lot of ordinary black people who'll be voting NP. We chatted, even talked a little politics and their grassroots political savvy and their commitment to the NP impressed me. "But it was only when I studied the ads to check my photography that the strength of these people's convictions about the NP dawned on me. They'd been threatened with injury and death, their children were threatened and one teacher checks her car for bombs every time she uses it -- all because they dared to support the NP in the townships. What humbled me most, was that during our work not one had even mentioned danger. "Yet they offered to be seen in the papers by millions, including their intimidators. One little old grandmother said "Let them kill me. There will always be someone else who stands up for the NP. I shall be at the polling station on the 27th with a badge with Mr. de Klerk's face on it. So everyone will know who I'm voting for." "I felt ashamed by their courage. I realised that I had neither bothered to vote, nor had I never bothered to stand up for what I believe in. I never realised how important it is. "I phoned the ad agency and said that I wanted to endorse the NP. Maybe I'll lose a job or two because of it, but compared to the risks they're taking, I'd be proud to. I'm dedicating my vote to their courage. "And to you cynics out there I'll add: nobody's getting paid for these ads. And to all you who take for granted your right to vote freely and safely, take note of these people. They've worked out exactly why they take these risks.'" The second ad on page 13 has a photograph of Mxolisi Ncapayi with the caption "`I was an MK [Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing] soldier, now I'm with the National Party.'" The text reads: "My name is Mxolisi Ncapayi. I was an MK guerilla fighter against the apartheid regime. But now I'm going to vote for the National Party -- and so are hundreds of other ex-MK people like me. "To put it simply; we have seen the ANC in its true colours, and we don't like what it has become. "On the surface it talks of liberation, with the face of Mr. Mandela smiling down from every poster. "But underneath, it has become a party which is power-hungry, a party which is just using the masses of black people for its own ends, a party with its own secret agenda which will ruin the country the way many other African countries have been destroyed. "And it has become a party which sponsors violence and intimidation -- and betrays its own people. "This makes us very angry, because a lot of us fought for it -- and were prepared to die for it. "I know. I was one of them. I fought for the ANC from the day my friend Sipho was killed by the police when we were 16. "I joined MK and was sent to Zambia for training. Then I came back as a guerilla -- to liberate my country. "Eventually I was caught, and I spent four and a half years on death row, waiting to be executed for killing a police informer. "But now the struggle is over. The world has changed. And I have changed too. Our country is liberated. President F.W. de Klerk and the National Party have got rid of apartheid and apologised for it. The new National Party welcomes all races into its ranks. We are about to have our first free elections. "I changed when I was in prison. I discovered that the ANC had killed my father because he was receiving food parcels from the Church. They made a mistake; they thought the food was coming from the government. "They never bothered to check. And afterwards they never apologised, or even helped my people. I learned the hard way -- as have hundreds of other ex-MK people -- that the ANC does not care for its own, or the mass of people. It just wants power. "It still has not changed. It is still the party of violence. It still threatens and intimidates people. It still attacks those -- like us -- who dare question it. It is still living in the past. But there is no point in that. We must look to the future. "Only the NP can secure that future. Only the NP really wants to stop the violence. Only the NP has a plan which will get jobs for people -- and then we will be able to build houses and schools. "That is why I -- and all the rest of us ex-MK people -- can only vote for the NP.'"
