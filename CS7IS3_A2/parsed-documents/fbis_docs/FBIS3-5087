With political reform settled, the prime minister seems to be intending to consolidate a foothold for his coalition government to develop into a long-term full-fledged government by working on new reform tasks and giving the impression that his coalition government is in transition to "its second term as a reformist government." The prime minister seems intended to set up one private advisory body after another to break away from the conventional "bureaucrat-led" policy decision formula and set forth his own policies. Bureaucrats, however, are expected to resist shifting the policy decision to advisory bodies that are made of people from the private sector. Advisory bodies to be established are panels on "the defense issue," "the 21st century global environment," and "housing and land" to be placed under the Administrative Reform Promotion Headquarters (headed by Prime Minister Hosokawa). The "defense issue panel" is mandated to review the "Guideline for the Defense Buildup Plan," taking into account the post-Cold War world situation. The panel, to be presided over by Asahi Breweries Chairman Hirotaro Higuchi, will hold its first meeting on 28 February. The "global environment panel" is to exchange views on how Japan should contribute to addressing global environmental problems. In response to the prime minister's intentions, late last year, Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura urged Environment Agency Director General Wakako Hironaka to establish the panel, saying: "Let us work together to tackle environmental problems transcending the jurisdiction of each ministry and agency." The panel, to be chaired by Japan Academic Council President Kondo Jiro, is composed of 14 people from the private sector. The panel will hold its first meeting on 10 March and compile recommendations within this year. The "panel on housing and land" under the Administrative Reform Promotion Headquarters is the first among panels to be established for the discussion of deregulation. Keio University Professor Shigeru Ito and five scholars and businessmen will join the panel as "experts." The panel will be established in March. Their participation in the panel as "experts" reflects the prime minister's hope to "allow civilians to participate in policy decision making." The prime minister intends to promote the deregulation by overriding resistance from the bureaucracy. The prime minister is setting up one advisory body after another before he reshuffles his cabinet. Explaining why the prime minister is doing so, an aide to the prime minister says: "With the political reform settled, the Hosokawa government needs to present its next policy tasks to tackle." The prime minister seems to intend to keep the centripatal force of his government from waning after the political reform is put into effect. Explaining why the prime minister intends to fill the advisory bodies with civilians, another aide to the prime minister says the "prime minister has begun talking about his distrust in the bureaucracy, saying, `If I get things done in the way the bureaucracy tells me, I may face failure.'" Some bureaucrats are criticizing the prime minister for taking the position of attaching importance to the advisory bodies, saying: "It is absurd to allow civilians to participate in the government's policy decision making without making clear their status and responsibility." Other bureaucrats complain: "The global environmental problems panel has already been established in the Environment Agency and the establishment of another such panel is duplication." If recommendations to be made by the advisory bodies are different from policies of each ministry and agency, this will raise the issue of how the recommendations will be put into effect. The prime minister's leadership will be questioned from time to time in the future.
