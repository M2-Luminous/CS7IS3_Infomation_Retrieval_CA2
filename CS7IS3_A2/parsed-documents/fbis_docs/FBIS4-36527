Surprisingly enough, Faysal al-Husayni did not reject the suggestion. Here is what he told Qol Yisra'el's English department correspondent Dick Winter: [Begin recording] [Al-Husayni] I do not know if it was meant as a threat. In any event, if Mr. Rabin means that I should leave my home here and move to Jericho, I do not think it is a statement [preceding word in English] he should have made. [Winter] What about your office? [Al-Husayni] If he was referring to the offices, I have an office right here, where I conduct activities that are part of the peace process [preceding two words in English]. I will pursue that part which is not related only to the interim agreement. If, however, he was referring to activities pertaining to the Palestinian rule, then we can discuss the matter and see how to proceed. [end recording]
