Kargashin, Moscow Institute of Cybernetic Problems; UDC 621.382] [Abstract] Numerical physico-technological studies of complimentary polysilicon transistor structures (TS) with identical, nearly optimal profiles of impurity distribution and identical technologies were performed at T=300 K, taking into account the temperature-concentration relationships of mobilities of major and minor carriers in these structures. The complete distribution profiles, identical for n-p-n and p-n-p transistor structures with arsenite (As) emitter and collector and boron (B) base for the former, and also with B-emitter and collector and boron base for the latter are shown in graphs. Static and quasi- static parameters of complimentary TS with identical profiles of impurity distribution and topology with the emitter surface S[.sup]E[/]=1�m[.sup]2[/], were examined applying identical physico-topological (PT) models. The rate of effective surface recombination at the emitter contacts n-p-n and p-n-p of the TS was S[.sup]p[/]= 1.2x10[.sup]5[/] cm/sec at annealing temperature T < 900� C. Graphs are also provided showing the results of PT modeling the current-volt characteristic I[.sup]K[/], I[.sup]B[/]= f(U[.sub]EB[/]) of complementary TS, the current transfer ratio as a function of the collector current B=f(I[.sup]K[/]), and the emitter capacitance as a function of the collector current C[.sup]TE[/]=f(I[.sub]K[/]).
