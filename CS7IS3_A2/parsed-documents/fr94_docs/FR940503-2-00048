On April 14, 1994, Polk Power Partners, L.P. (Polk) of 1027 South Rainbow Boulevard, Las Vegas, Nevada 89128, submitted for filing an application for recertification of a facility as a qualifying cogeneration facility pursuant to Section 292.207(b) of the Commission's Regulations. No determination has been made that the submittal constitutes a complete filing. The topping-cycle cogeneration facility will be located in Polk County, Florida. On December 23, 1991, in Docket No. QF92&hyph;54&hyph;000, Mulberry Energy Company, Inc. filed a notice of self-certification for a natural gas-fueled 123 MW combined-cycle cogeneration facility. In Docket No. QF92&hyph;54&hyph;001, Polk was granted certification with a power production capacity of 118.7 MW. Thermal energy from the facility was to be used by an affiliated host for the production of liquified carbon dioxide [61 FERC ¶61,030 (1992), order denying rehearing, 61 FERC ¶61,300 (1992), appeal pending sub nom. Liquid Carbonic Corp. v. FERC (D.C. Cir. Nos. 93&hyph;1095 et al )]. In Docket No. QF92&hyph;54&hyph;003, Commission granted certification to reflect change in ownership and use of thermal output for the product of fuel grade ethanol [65 FERC ¶62,136 (1993)]. On September 3, 1993, in Docket No. QF92&hyph;54&hyph;004, Polk filed a notice of self-certification. In Docket No. QF92&hyph;54&hyph;005, the Commission granted a limited waiver of Commission's operating and efficiency standards [66 FERC ¶61,116 (1994)]. Instant recertification is submitted to reflect change in the maximum net electric power production capacity to 134 MW, change in facility's ownership and possible operational changes in the facility's thermal host.
