The FYROM president talked about that and about the need for "Europeanization" with Mr. Karl Lammers, coordinator of the parliamentary group of Christian Democratic Union; with Bonn Mayor Hans Daniels; and also at lunch with former FRGB Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher. Finally he had a two-hour meeting with over 100 German and foreign journalists accredited in Bonn. The German open disapproval of the latest act of the government in Athens against FYROM was reaffirmed at every step. "FYROM has played a significant, even a historical role in safeguarding stability and peace in the south of the Balkans, therefore also in Europe, which commits the European Union to help FYROM in every way. This time Europe must not back down and be in delay, as it did with Bosnia," Mr. Genscher said during the lunch he had with President Gligorov. Nothing Can Be Solved With Pressure The meeting between Gligorov and Genscher was initiated by Genscher. The FYROM president described it as "very fruitful and pleasant." Hans-Dietrich Genscher is not occupying an official position at this moment; he is engaged in strategic studies, but he is still considered as one of the current architects of foreign policy in Germany. Therefore his "recommendation" for Europeanization of the Greek blockade against FYROM was not his private opinion. That was also confirmed by Karl Lammers, the coordinator of the parliamentary group of the Christian Democratic Union, with whom President Gligorov started his working day. "The stance of Germany and the European Union is that Greece must lift the blockade immediately, because it does not coincide with the principles of the Union, and not only affects the border with Greece, but also the border of the European Union with a neighboring country. I hope Greece will find a way to remove this measure because it cannot use it to force the neighboring country to anything," Mr. Lammers said at the end of the discussions he had with President Gligorov. His assessment was that the question of the blockade should be solved by the Europeans, and not by the big powers, in order to avoid new divisions, according to what he stated. The Reasonable Ones Talk, They Do Not Threaten Another Greek characteristic during this visit of President Gligorov, as has been the case with all his journeys in the past two to three years, was the great number of Greek journalists who followed him everywhere. They waited for him at the hotel, at the residential houses and offices where he talked with his hosts, they photographed him and repeatedly asked: Will FYROM give up its flag so that Greece may remove the measures? The Greeks were the most numerous, or at least the most intrusive at today's news conference held by President Gligorov in Bonn. Why does the FYROM insist on solving the dispute with Greece in a "basket," and not issue by issue? Will Germany come out as a new mediator in the FYROM-Greek dispute? What concessions is FYROM ready to make? Is not the alternative road East-West not an attempt to secede from Greece? President Gligorov replied: "We had separate discussions, one question after the other. However, two years have passed. Finally we must gather our courage, sit at a negotiating table, and find solutions for the whole dispute in a basket. The reasonable ones talk, they do not threaten." President Gligorov also emphasized that FYROM and Greece, both being members of the United Nations, are committed by a resolution to solve their dispute. "FYROM will suffer great damages with the embargo," Gligorov said, "but so will Greece. Finally, we shall survive, but I don't know if the fact that we shall have damages will help Greece." Asked about his opinion on the results of last week's start of FYROM-Greek negotiations in Geneva, President Gligorov said that "they are modest, but they clearly demonstrate that the place to negotiate is in the United Nations. Two UN members must respect the resolution adopted by the United Nations. We are immediately ready to resume the negotiations, however not under the embargo conditions and with a rope around the neck, because it is not an equal and dignified position," President Kiro Gligorov said at the news conference in Bonn.
