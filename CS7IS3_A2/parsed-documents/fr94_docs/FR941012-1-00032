FR941012-1-00032 FR941012-1-00005 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Administration for Children and Families 45 CFR Part 233 Aid to Families With Dependent Children; Adult Assistance Programs; Income and Resource Disregards Related to Interests of Individual Indians in Trust or Restricted Lands AGENCY: Administration for Children and Families (ACF), HHS. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: These proposed regulations incorporate additional statutory disregards in the rules for the Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC) program and the adult assistance programs in Guam, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Included is the income disregard provided under section 13736 of Pub. L. 103&hyph;66, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, which amends section 8 of Pub. L. 93&hyph;134. This income disregard is effective January 1, 1994. This amendment provides that up to $2,000 per year of income derived from interests of individual Indians in trust or restricted lands shall not be considered in determining assistance under the Social Security Act or any other Federal or federally assisted program. Additionally, we propose to incorporate the resource disregard provided under section 8 of Pub. L. 93&hyph;134, as added by section 4 of Pub. L. 97&hyph;458, effective January 12, 1983. This provision requires that interests of individual Indians in trust or restricted lands shall not be considered a resource in determining eligibility for assistance under the Social Security Act or any other Federal or federally assisted program. DATES: Interested persons and agencies are invited to submit written comments concerning the proposed regulations no later than December 12, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Mack A. Storrs, Division of AFDC Program, Office of Family Assistance, Administrative for Children and Families, Fifth Floor, 370 L'Enfant Promenade, SW, Washington, DC 20447, Telephone (202) 401&hyph;9289. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Discussion of Proposed Rule Provisions Disregard of Certain Income Derived From Interests of Individual Indians in Trust or Restricted Lands Effective January 1, 1994, section 13736 of Pub. L. 103&hyph;66, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, amends section 8 of Pub. L. 93&hyph;134 to provide that up to $2,000 per year of amounts derived from interests of individual Indians in trust or restricted lands shall not be counted as income. The Conference Report identifies ``leases on individually-owned trust or restricted Indian lands'' as such interests [H.R. Rep. No. 103&hyph;111, 103D Cong., 1st Sess., 494&hyph;495 (1993)]. The income generally comes from interests in lands allotted to individual Indians many years ago. Income to individual Indians generated by these interests is likely to be quite small because many of the original interests is allotted lands have fractionized over time due to the inheritance of multiple heirs over several generations. Under the proposed regulations, the disregard of up to $2,000 per year would be applicable only to income. Any disregarded amounts retained by an individual after the month in which they are received would be counted as a resource. We also propose to give States the flexibility to define the yearly period for applying the income disregard. Section 233.20 would be amended by redesignating paragraph (a)(4)(i) as (a)(4)(i)( a ), and adding a new paragraph (a)(4)(i)( b ) to incorporate the income disregard required by section 8 of Pub. L. 93&hyph;134, as amended. Disregard of Individual Indian Interests in Trust or Restricted Lands From Consideration as a Resource Public Law 93&hyph;134, enacted October 19, 1973, provides for the use or distribution of certain Indian judgment funds. Public Law 97&hyph;458, enacted January 12, 1983, made several amendments to Pub. L. 93&hyph;134. One amendment made by section 4 of Pub. L. 97&hyph;458 was the addition of a new section 8 to Pub. L. 93&hyph;134. Section 8 of Pub. L. 93&hyph;134 requires that interests of individual Indians in trust or restricted lands shall not be considered a resource in determining eligibility for assistance under the Social Security Act of any other Federal or federally assisted program. Although this provision was effective in 1983, it was not incorporated in the regulations at that time because it was considered unnecessary. Interests in trust or restricted lands are not considered a resource under the definition of available income and resources in existing regulations at 45 CFR 233.20(a)(3)(ii)(D). These regulations provide, in pertinent part, that income and resources are considered available both when actually available and when the applicant or recipient has a legal interest in a liquidated sum and has the legal ability to make such sum available for support and maintenance. However, we now propose to incorporate the resource disregard in order to prevent any confusion that may result were we to incorporate only the income disregard provided under section 13736 of Pub. L. 103&hyph;66. Therefore, we would further amend section 233.20 by adding paragraph (a)(4)(ii)( v ) to incorporate the resource disregard required by section 8 of Pub. L. 93&hyph;134, as added by section 4 of Pub. L. 97&hyph;458.
