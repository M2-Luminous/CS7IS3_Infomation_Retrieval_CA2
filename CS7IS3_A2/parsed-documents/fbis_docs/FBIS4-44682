The purpose of the European Supersonic Research Program (ESRP), which will be financed equally by the three parties, is to define the basic design for a future supersonic aircraft that might succeed the Concorde. For the time being there are no plans to develop an actual supersonic aircraft. The project aims simply to choose the minimum specifications which will then enable significant research to be done. The main specifications are a range of 10,000 km, a capacity of 250 passengers and a top speed of Mach 2 (2,250 km per hour). With this initiative, the three manufacturers hope to create a center of European research that can compete with the work being done in the United States and Japan, and in a few years bring European research to almost the same level as in these two countries. Last year, just $15 million was spent on supersonic research in Europe, as opposed to $60 million in Japan, and $108 million in the United States. With their joint effort, Aerospatiale, BAe, and DASA also place themselves in a better position to negotiate their future participation in the development of a second generation supersonic aircraft that will probably mobilize manufacturers on all three continents. The development of such an aircraft is estimated to be worth around $12-15 billion (with a potential market of around 500 to 1,000 aircraft). According to the three groups: "Just one type of supersonic aircraft will be developed," for reasons of commercial viability.
