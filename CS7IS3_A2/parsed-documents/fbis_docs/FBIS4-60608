FBIS4-60608 "drnes102_k_94001" FBIS-NES-94-102 Daily Report 26 May 1994 IRAQ Report on Chemical Weapons Use in Gulf War Refuted Report on Chemical Weapons Use in Gulf War Refuted JN2605102294 Baghdad INA in Arabic 0851 GMT 26 May 94 JN2605102294 Baghdad INA Arabic BFN [Text] Baghdad, 26 May (INA) -- An official spokesman today accused some U.S. circles and the Jewish lobby in Washington of trying to mislead the U.S. Congress and to hide the causes of the mysterious illness that has afflicted thousands of U.S. and British soldiers that fought in in the Gulf war. Commenting on the report presented to the U.S. Congress by Senator Donald Riegle alleging that the Iraqis used chemical weapons against the U.S. forces during the Gulf war, the spokesman said: Medical circles throughout the world can easily diagnose chemical weapons injuries, therefore, it is illogical that U.S. medical circles, which are known for their scientific and technological progress, have failed to diagnose the cause of this illness. He said: The political pressure groups in the Congress seem to have decided to exploit this case to realize political objectives against Iraq. The spokesman added: Senator Donald Riegle's report consists of a host of personal testimonies by soldiers, and is not a technical and scientific report. This report conflicts with what had been announced by Senator John Rockefeller, head of the committee that investigated this issue. Rockefeller said that his committee had carried out research into this mysterious illness for six months, and the results showed that the U.S. Defense Department had used for its soldiers medicines that were still being tested. These medicines include vaccines and pills that are still in the research stage. Senator George Mitchell, leader of the Democratic majority, demanded that an investigation be carried out by the U.S. Defense department and concerned quarters. There was also another reason for this illness, which the U.S. Administration is trying to hide: that is, the extensive use of munitions that contain depleted uranium. Preliminary investigations, that were suppressed by the U.S. Defense Department, showed that the U.S. soldiers had not been warned against exposure to this radiation, and had not been trained to avoid radiation from such munitions.
