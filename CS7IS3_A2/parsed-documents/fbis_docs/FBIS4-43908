Never before have there been so many social welfare recipients and unemployed in Germany, he said on Wednesday [22 June] in a speech at the Social Democratic Party [SPD] congress in Halle. The country will not be able to bear this course in the long run, a change is urgently necessary, he said. He appealed to the Social Democrats to struggle with the trade unions against further social cuts. Schulte offered a close dialogue to the Social Democrats. The SPD government program forms an "excellent basis" for such a dialogue. Schulte credited SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping with having committed the party to important priorities of Social Democratic policy. The SPD chief will find fair partners in the DGB, he said. In another speech Gro Harlem Brundtland, Norway's Social Democratic head of government, stressed that her party stands side by side with the German Social Democrats. As common goals she cited full employment in Europe and a just world order. That is why one needs strong Social Democrats in Germany, she stressed. Reinhard Hoeppner, the SPD's top candidate for the Landtag elections in Saxony-Anhalt, expressed optimism that his party will achieve a good result on Sunday. This will also provide support to the Social Democrats for the Bundestag elections on 16 October, he said, speaking to 500 delegates. Hoeppner accused Chancellor Helmut Kohl (Christian Democratic Union) of having turned the stroke of luck of unification into a problem case with his "disastrous policy." The delegates unanimously adopted proposals by the east German SPD for an immediate program for the first 100 days of an SPD-led federal government. The focus is special protective measures for tenants, pensioners, and farmers in the former GDR.
