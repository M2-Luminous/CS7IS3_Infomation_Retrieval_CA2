Li Peng praised the "wise and correct" policies of the Turkmenistan Government in handling domestic affairs, developing the economy and seeking friendly relations with foreign countries, especially with its neighbors. He also expressed an appreciation for Turkmenistan's policy on nationalities and religion. Li said China is also a country with many ethnic nationalities who treat each other equally, live together harmoniously and seek common development. Referring to talks held in the past two days, Li said the two nations share identical or similar views on many issues. China is ready to expand friendly cooperation with Turkmenistan in all fields, including the building of a modern 'Silk-Road' linking China and Central Asia by railways, he said. "Such ties will also serve to enhance the contact between Asia and Europe in general," he said, calling the `New Silk-Road' "not only a broad way for economic cooperation, but also a brilliant path towards friendship." President S.A. Niyazov said the leaders of Turkmenistan and China are determined to develop bilateral ties overall. Addressing the leading Chinese entrepreneurs traveling with Li Peng, Niyazov said "The door of Turkmenistan always remains open for you and we would like to see expansion of cooperation between the business circles of our two countries." He added that the agreement signed on bilateral cooperation during Li Peng's visit will serve to consolidate the basis for a long-term cooperative relationship.
