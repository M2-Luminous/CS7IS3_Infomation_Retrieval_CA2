Are they aware of the extent of the tragedy that is being joined to their daily lives and claiming so very many victims? Are they aware that Algeria is marching resolutely down the road to ruin and that we all--all of us without exception--share responsibility for the slow death eating away at a nation and country that nonetheless has what it takes to experience a far happier fate? People are dying in Algeria today for nothing. Most of the time, they do not even know why they are dying. Or rather, they do not know why they are being murdered, because crime in our country has exceeded all possible and imaginary limits of horror. Why must Algerians be sacrificed on the altar of rancor, hatred, political ambition, lack of education, and ignorance? Why should a girl who does not want to wear the hijab lose her life on the pretext that she is not conforming to Koranic law when big traffickers and the completely corrupt are hypocritically using the precepts of Islam to enrich themselves without being disturbed in any way? It must be said that Algeria has become the country of every danger with its series of murders, attacks, and political intrigues. Some influential circles are doing everything they can to increase the deterioration and maintain a situation verging on explosion. In the fog and the anarchy, big interests are being preserved, and the people, who are suffering and cannot raise their heads, must be made aware of it. Otherwise, how can one explain the fact that practically everyone is talking about "dialogue" at a time when an Algerian is dying from murderous bullets on every street corner? The picture is already very dark, and every day it is growing a little more apocalyptic. At this rate, Algeria is becoming more and more like Sudan and Afghanistan. The fall into hell seems to be planned. But try telling that to the supporters of "the Islamic state." They are bent on using force and terror to try to impose a plan for society that is clearly out of step with the aspirations of Algerians. As though wearing the hijab would enable Algeria to solve all its problems.
