But the growth of their imports led to a record trade deficit of $12.18 billion last year. And this trend is expected to continue this year with a sharp increase in joint-venture imports, Chinese customs officials predicted yesterday. The foreign-funded firms' trade volume is predicted to hit a record high of $94 billion this year, accounting for about 40 per cent of the country's total expected trade. This compares with 34 per cent last year. Equipment imported by the overseas ventures totalled a record $16.6 billion in 1993 and became the most important factor in China's trade deficit. And equipment imports are likely to double this year to somewhere in excess of $34 billion, the Beijing-based General Administration of Customs (GAC) said yesterday. The officials made it clear that the rate of overseas investment will increase now that China has unified its foreign exchange rate this year. Investment will be cushioned against financial risk of the old market where hard currrency was sold at the low official rate sometimes and bought on the foreign exchange at the high swap market rate. Meanwhile, overseas firms' exports are expected to grow more than 35 per cent this year to reach a total value of over $34 billion. But the increase of the overseas ventures' imports and exports will impose a major strain on China's efforts to improve its balance of payments this year. And China's foreign exchange market, which is still weak because supply and demand are the same, is likely to be affected . And the net import of funds over the last few years will swing round to a net export this year. The sharp increase in accumulated foreign business investment will mean an increase in the amount of hard currencies used by them to repay capital with interest. Efforts to balance supply and demand in the foreign exchange market will be further impaired by the increasingly large remittances which will be sent abroad by overseas ventures this year.
