Poland followed Hungary's suit on Friday [8 April]. Why is the Czech Republic not planning to take such a step? The results of economic transformation in the Czech Republic are comparable, to say the least, with the results of these two countries.... [Klaus] I know well that there is no opportunity, possibility, or room in the EU today to deal seriously with those applications. In my opinion, these applications will simply lie around. The Community has made it repeatedly clear that the very first possibility to even start considering such a move would be after the EU's general conference in 1996. Therefore, I see no reason for us to engage in some hasty activities precisely at this moment. [Danes] One of the arguments used by Hungarian politicians [for applying now] is that they are interested in so-called partial membership, the possible establishment of which is indicated by some voices coming from the EU. Such partial membership should include only the political dimension. What is your view regarding the issue of partial membership? [Klaus] I repeat that, in contrast to some other politicians, including Czech politicians, I am in favor of some intermediary steps leading to membership. I believe that a certain vacuum between associate membership and full membership will have to be filled by some new initiatives. Nevertheless, I do not share the view appearing in those proposals that these initiatives should be political and security-oriented first and only then economic. I think, in fact, that it should be precisely the other way around. [Danes] The first round of the second wave of coupon privatization begins on Monday [11 April]. Although no dates have been fixed thus far, do you think that the whole process, up to the issuance of shares to the participants, will be shorter than in the case of the first wave? [Klaus] I think so. All participants have become trained in some practices, and even the method of calculation, the algorithms, the manner of issuance of shares, and the like have changed somewhat. I therefore believe that the whole process could be cut short. Although I am not going to argue about hours, days, or weeks, I am convinced that everything should be definitely over before this year is out.
