As one of the reasons, he mentioned failure to meet the schedule of payments to CLAE depositors. [Begin recording] [Cortavarria] Here we have a letter stating that the clients would begin to get their money on 7 February. By this date we had already started to prepare CLAE's closure. We reached the conclusion that if CLAE had not started to pay by this date, we would start the closure procedure. CLAE failed to begin returning the money on 8, 9, or 10 February. I believe the superintendent's office made the best possible effort to try to formalize CLAE. It is not that we intervened in CLAE even though CLAE reported on its operations. CLAE has been handing over documents that do not support the reported value of its assets. As we said since the beginning, CLAE's obligations to the public are not guaranteed. The proper procedure [words indistinct] because it is an organization not authorized by the superintendent's office. [Unidentified reporter] [Words indistinct] previously? [Cortavarria] What do you mean previously? [Reporter] [Words indistinct] [Cortavarria] Banking Law 637 of 1991 stipulates in a temporary article that banks that receive deposits from the public without authorization can formalize their status by providing information. A process then starts. The law provided the opportunity for CLAE to formalize its status, but it failed to stick by the law. [end recording]
