First there was an accusation against draft dodgers. Then talk of new measures. Next came television programs on how well the families of the martyred were treated by the state. And, surprise, surprise, Turkey had to welcome a decision to freeze all army discharges for at least three months. The latest chapter in the story seems to be a motion in Parliament demanding that some control be exerted over a tax-exempt army enterprise which has been spreading its influence after each and every coup. These days, Ankara's agenda is full of a lot of rumors -- and warnings at that. There is word of great people in great seats talking privately within the family. Telling tales of how for four decades they have served the country. Complaining of political vacuums which need to be filled. How much the country and nation is in need of them and how difficult it would be to leave their crucial positions at a time of massive crisis and when Turkey's risks and the threats to her position are on the increase. The warning is that such people may do much to stay put, and that any criticism of them could be taken as a reason for judgment "when the time comes." This is a message. One which has been delivered and heard. According to Gures, who heads a constitutional body whose existence is based solely on the sacrifices of the devoted tax payers, there are circles using the argument that "the army is not taboo," to undermine the armed forces. According to Yekta Gungor Ozden, the chief judge of the Constitutional Court, "the army is not taboo." The obvious question is who would know better in Turkey, a country run by a constitution, than the head of the Constitutional Court? Days after Gures' hard-hitting speeches on how dearly the army wanted to stay out of politics, how some circles were harping on about the fact that the army was not a taboo subject, and how there were plots against the command center of the armed forces, Turkey decided to freeze discharges of military personnel. Little could be said against such a decision, with so much talk around town. Two weeks ago, the Mehmetcik Vakfi, a foundation to care for soldiers and their families broadcast a program in which it showed families of the martyred. All businessmen and individuals were invited to donate. After all, these children are indeed dying for their country. Those wounded deserve more care and better treatment. Those who have been martyred need their families to be cared for. And so on. The program showed a youngish woman in a headband, explaining the good treatment she was getting. As a widow of martyred soldier, she was getting approximately 100 dollars every three months (about 35 dollars a month) as compensation. On Dec. 20, under pressure from the Chief of Staff, the government faced the task of taking the "absolute decision" to extend military service. It froze the discharge of conscripts. Then the bureaucracy started to work. Orders were written and distributed. All the time, not a single government official wanted to take the responsibility. All the time the ministers remained silent. No one wanted to take the burden of having to announce such a decision which would suddenly affect the life of about 540,000 soldiers and their families. Some two to three million human beings. Recently there have been reports that there is an increase in desertion from the army. The left-wing press especially, such as the daily AYDINLIK and the pro-Kurdish OZGUR GUNDEM, are playing the issue up. AYDINLIK is a newspaper which claims to be devoted to labor and human rights. OZGUR GUNDEM is known by all. The TURKISH DAILY NEWS [TDN], on the other hand, is a newspaper known for its objective and precise reporting. Thus, claims penned by AYDINLIK and OZGUR GUNDEM have been included in TDN reports as "claims." But, when questioned on the TDN, AYDINLIK and OZGUR GUNDEM reports on Tuesday, Chief of Staff spokesman Col. Dogu Silahcioglu makes a statement. "It means that the sources of bogus news have been activated as part of a concerted plan," he boldly says. Turkey shall indeed see who has the real plan and who is truly caring for the country. Turkey shall see these very soon for those with their plans will not be able to wait too long. The storm is brewing. On Wednesday, the TDN checked with the proper authorities on the conditions of those serving the Turkish Armed Forces. We wanted to know how the recent extension of military service is to affect their lives--what, for instance, the tens of thousands of soldiers whose service period have been extended will get in return. And the results... The monthly salary paid to a Turkish private--and this is for real--is still 37,000 Turkish Liras. In other words, a Turkish private gets approximately 2 dollars and a quarter every month for protecting his country, risking his life on an hourly basis. The monthly salary for a Turkish corporal is 57,000 liras and the salary for a sergeant is 75,000 liras. A Three month extension per soldier costs Turkey only about 111,000 liras in all. This excludes the accommodation and food which, naturally enough, are free. For 111,000 liras in today's Turkey (three months wages for a soldier), one can make many choices. In the three months, one could make two taxi trips in the city (and short ones at that), or buy six packs of Marlboro cigarettes, or even get two bottles of Raki. But, obviously soldiers neither need taxi trips, nor to smoke Marlboro or drink Raki. But with the 111,000 for three months, they can't buy a ticket for the Ankara-Istanbul bus. On Jan. 3, 1961--only seven months after the 1960 military intervention--the Turkish Armed Forces created a new institution. Its name is OYAK, standing for Army Mutual Assistance Establishment (or fund). OYAK was founded according to law number 205 and has flourished incredibly rapidly over the past three decades expanding more and more after each coup. 1971 was another turning point for OYAK as was 1980. Today, OYAK employs a labor force of approximately 25,000 and is listed among the largest 500 companies in Turkey. It is also a shareholder in eight major companies. OYAK's current annual turnover is reported at 5 billion dollars or seventy-five trillion liras. It is active in the automotive sector, the cement industry, Turkey's petrochemical industry, the food sector, electronics, agricultural chemicals, service industries and banking. In the last days of 1993, OYAK, acting along with its smaller shareholding Turkish investors, bought a huge share of the Turk-Boston Bank. Some claim that with this move, the Turkish Army is the second army in the world, after that of Guatemala, to own a bank. All the time, OYAK's aims were clearly cited in its articles of foundation, of which one is clearly important: "In order for members of the armed forces, who constitute a great mass, to be forced into mutual assistance and solidarity with the aim of guaranteeing a better future for themselves..." Turkish commissioned officers and petty-officers are members of OYAK. But the non-commissioned officers, who every month pay OYAK contribution money, are not. They join the army, get a salary, pay their share, which is five percent of their whole salary, and are discharged. In return, they get none of the OYAK benefits enjoyed by their superiors. Petty-officers, who also pay OYAK part of their salaries, number around 18,000 members of this fund-turned-enterprise. But there is not a single petty-officer in OYAK's management. Soldiers are not members of OYAK which has clearly become a substantial economic force in Turkey. And, privates, who die every day for their country, only get two dollars and a quarter every month for their services. Talking to an ex-general who has had much say on post-coup developments last week, the TDN found him complaining bitterly. "In our time," he says, "people would see military service as a step towards manhood. Youngsters would be sent off as conscripts with parades and ceremonies." "Now the situation is different." One of the chief characteristics of OYAK is that its membership is made up of officers from the Turkish Armed Forces, and technically it is a mutual-assistance fund. Officers, whether they like it or not, pay 10 percent of their salaries to this institution. But OYAK does not like to share. It does not share its income with the soldiers which are the mainstay of the Turkish armed forces. It does not share with the non-commissioned officers and it does not share with the "state" either. The annual turnover of this "corporation," some 75 trillion liras in total, is tax-exempt. In other words, OYAK does not pay tax on its commercial activities. There are strong laws and regulations which protect the interests and immunity of the armed forces in Turkey. Thus any criticism of this "taboo area," is regarded only as a deliberate plot to lower the morale of the armed forces. The Turkish armed forces, however, is made up of Turkish youngsters. Youngsters who are there not for the two dollars and a quarter they earn every month but for the honor of it. They are not there as "professionals," looking at the job as an opportunity to get a good salary and other benefits. Nor are they there to become shareholders in a great economic enterprise. They are there to serve their country. Defending their rights is thus to defend the principle rights of the Turkish army. Because these people are human beings, with families to care for and jobs to keep. And these people are owed an explanation if they are to be asked to risk their lives for even longer periods. Some explanation must be given. Once the decision on freezing military discharges was revealed, there arrived a "leak" of information to the Turkish press. A leak that, along with this order, all retirement and resignations from the armed forces had been frozen as well. Later, it was formally announced that this was not true. But the word was out and the denial had little meaning. For it was made public that something of that sort could happen. The Turkish public is thus prepared. For instance, with the clashes in southeast Turkey intensifying, Ankara could decide to upgrade the legal dimension of the problem and adopt decisions for national mobilization, extending the Emergency Rule throughout Turkey and even declaring Martial Law or wartime conditions. If and when this happens, then all "retirement and resignations" from the armed forces could be stopped "until a second order." Or indefinitely. Thus, expectations for retirement in August of some high level commanders would also be shelved. This would, in other words, be the result of an escalation in tension. And not if the tension is diffused. And just some footnotes, again without comment: 1. Gen. Dogan Gures, the Chief of Staff commander, will hold his office up to the end of August. In fact in August this year there will be a major change in the top echelons of the Turkish military. 2. The government last year extended Gen. Dogan Gures's term of office for a whole year according to a decree issued with the authority of the cabinet. 3. The Constitutional Court, entrusted with the duty of making sure that everything works in harmony with the 1982 constitution, abolished the authority by which Gures' term had been extended. 4. Because the necessary application with regard to Gures was not made on time, despite the court ruling that the reappointment was unconstitutional, the chief of staff remained in situ. Turkey is on a head-on collision course with Kurdish separatists in the southeast and there is an immense buildup of troops and weaponry in the region these days. Some 40,000 troops out of the current 160,000 in the region will not be discharged. Additional forces will be sent there and the manpower will increase dramatically. A military official said this week that the reason for freezing military discharges was because troops could not be transferred to the region from other parts of the country and because a professionally trained force was needed. Newspapers reported on Wednesday that in a recent clash with the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] in the remote province of Sirnak, two soldiers attached to the Turkish navy were killed. They were based in Izmir with the Naval Forces Command. They were martyred in Sirnak. Again Sabah's Zulfu Livaneli reported the same day the plight of 700 teachers who were recruited by the army. In November 1993, they were invited to join the army as privates but in the "teaching class," to aid educational schemes. Their service terms were two months only. Thus, leaving behind installment payments and in their own words, "houses in a sorry state," they joined. They joined for two months and they have now been told that they are to serve for 15 months. But this was not all. They joined the army as teachers. And all aged between 28 to 35 among the 700 were taken aside and told they were going to become commandos. They are now to serve 15 months and serve as commando soldiers fighting in the southeast. This alone shows how desperate the situation has become and how many lives it is affecting. The next stage is probably to be an escalation along with a freezing of all resignations and retirements for officers. But no one yet knows what will come after that...
