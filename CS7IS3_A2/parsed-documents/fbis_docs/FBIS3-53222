The wave of massacre of Kurdish Muslims adopts its true meaning when viewed precisely within the framework of plots by arrogance which are aimed at the dismemberment of Iraq and at creating a reliable base for the West's forces in northern Iraq. The issue took on a serious nature with the creation of a "safe haven" in Iraq. And it was within the framework of this plan that American and French forces, using Turkish support facilities, tried to dismember Iraqi Kurdistan. The formation of a parliament followed by the establishment of an independent government constituted the next phase in the series of more serious steps by arrogance to create a "second Israel" in the region. And now the Western countries and especially America feel that the Muslim Kurdish forces are obstructing their objectives and that their plans to fully dismember Kurdistan may be foiled. It is precisely because of this that during its recent talks with Jalal Talabani, Washington made the continuation of military, economic, and security assistances as well as propaganda support for Talabani contingent on getting rid of Islamic Kurdish movements and explicitly called for the uprooting of Islamic groups from northern Iraq. Turkey too has displayed a nauseating stance on this issue. On the one hand, the Ankara government feels that fanning the flames of secessionist movements in northern Iraq also affects Turkey's national security and has explicitly expressed its concern over joint U.S.-French plans in northern Iraq which specifically come within the framework of creating a safe haven in Iraqi Kurdistan and, on the other, it is tempted to gain access to Kirkuk's oil resources and to play the role of the West's gendarme in northern Iraq. Public opinion in Iraqi Kurdistan finds it difficult to understand why the Ankara government has started the most savage massacre and suppression of the Kurds in Turkey while at the same time it is being so generous in strengthening the Kurds in Iraqi Kurdistan. Moreover, the officials of the Ankara government have repeatedly used the Iraqi Kurdish leaders to achieve their goals, even during the suppression of the Kurds in Turkey. Turkey even granted Talabani a "Turkish diplomatic passport" and included him in a Turkish delegation that visited Washington for talks. Even if the Ankara government considers all these things to belong to the past and claims that it has reviewed its past policies, nevertheless the issue is that today operations by America, France, and Britain in Iraqi Kurdistan within the framework of Hammer Force are carried out with the help of Turkish support units, specifically at Incirlik base. It is now very obvious that from its very outset, the Hammer Force never intended to establish stability and balance in the region; that it has always tried to throw the region off balance, to create instability, and to establish a "second Israel" in the region; and that it has gradually implemented plans that have harmed and will continue to harm Turkey too. In addition, let us not forget that it has never been possible to establish equilibrium and stability in this sensitive area with a "hammer" and that experience has shown that any abuse of power--and in such a nauseating manner, at that--has only led and will lead to a vicious cycle of uncontrollable events in the entire region. The major point here is that once again, the Iraqi Kurds have been fooled by America and its other allies; and it is highly possible that this time too they will only realize the depth of the tragedy when it is too late and when even those who consider themselves in control of the situation in Iraqi Kurdistan will have lost control. Whatever the objectives, methods, and outcome of this disgraceful game, the view of the Islamic Republic of Iran of the incidents in Iraqi Kurdistan, which have been repeatedly pointed out by the officials of the system, can be summed up as follows: 1. The people of Iraqi Kurdistan, like the rest of the Iraqi people, have suffered from tragedies throughout the past few decades, and the solution of their problems cannot be separated from or placed outside the framework of a radical solution to the problems of Iraq. 2. Any type of solution to the problem of Iraqi Kurdistan should be sought within the framework of safeguarding the independence, territorial integrity, and sovereignty of Iraq; and naturally any type of secessionist movement, even under the pretext of saving the Iraqi people from Baghdad's pressures, is unjustifiable. 3. Any decision, movement, or step for solving the problem of the Iraqi people should come from the Iraqi people themselves and should certainly not involve political or military interventions by foreigners. If not, foreigners will get an opportunity to infiltrate the area. Today we see how the Muslim Kurds of Iraq are getting a bloodbath from other groups of Iraqi Kurds and how, within the framework of dismembering Iraqi Kurdistan, once again more people are being expelled from their homes and are facing "forced deportation"; and if they refuse, they have no guarantees that they will stay alive. All these problems and incidents once again testify to the just, correct, and strong stances of the Islamic Republic of Iran vis-a-vis the problems of Iraq--both as far as the Shiites in the South, the Kurds in the North, and people any other place in this oppressed land are concerned--and it proves that America and its allies are pursuing wretched objectives in the region and only want to exploit the Kurds and others for their own motives.
