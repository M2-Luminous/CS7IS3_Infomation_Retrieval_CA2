The UAE source said that the UAE had agreed to discuss its dispute with Iran over the three islands under the heading "pending issues" in order to "persuade Iran to discuss the question of its occupation of the three islands, but it then became evident that Iran was trying to use that label to keep the issue in flux and to dither." The source said that Iranian Interior Minister Mohammad 'Ali Besharati's recent statements in Doha were unacceptable and part of the contradictory statements made by Iranian officials from time to time. The UAE source added that "the UAE's dispute with Iran over the three islands is not a dispute over borders but a dispute over sovereignty." He said the UAE had reservations about the conclusions reached at the Paris seminar on the islands held last summer. The diplomatic source said that Iran's nonacceptance of direct dialogue on the three islands reflected the weakness of Iran's legal position on the issue of sovereignty over the islands. He said that "had Iran had any legal or historical documents, it would not have hesitated to agree to discuss the dispute directly or submit it to international legal bodies." He emphasized that the weakness of the Iranian arguments was clear in the contacts and talks held on the dispute since the failed round of negotiations between the two countries in September 1992 in Abu-Dhabi. The UAE source said that there are currently no contacts with Iran on the islands but added that the UAE has not lost all hope for the resumption of the negotiations. He noted in this connection that "the conflicting statements made by Iranian officials leave the door open for the resumption of the negotiations." He stressed that the UAE's options for raising the issue at international circles are still open and that its determination to fulfill its rights peacefully remains unchanged. On the possibility of mediation on the dispute, he said that the UAE does not accept mediations and insists on frank and direct dialogue on the issue but he emphasized that it would not object to a delegation going to Tehran if there was a sincere intention to discuss the dispute over the three islands.
