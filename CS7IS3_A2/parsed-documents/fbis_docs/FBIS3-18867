FBIS3-18867 "drweu046_i_94004" FBIS-WEU-94-046 Document Type:Daily Report 9 Mar 1994 FRANCE Government To Privatize Insurance, Computer Firms AU0903094994 Paris AFP in English 0913 GMT 9 Mar 94 AU0903094994 Paris AFP Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Paris, March 9 (AFP) -- The French Government announced Wednesday [9 March] that the insurance group Assurances Generales de France (AGF) and computer giant Bull were the next state companies in line for privatization. But the decree announcing the sell-offs made no mention of a privatization date for vehicle maker Renault, giving weight to reports that Prime Minister Edouard Balladur planned to delay that highly-symbolic sale until after next year's presidential elections. The decree, signed by Balladur and Economy Minister Edmond Alphandery and published Wednesday in the official gazette, provided no details of the timing or procedures for shedding the government's majority holdings in the two companies. A statement released by the Economy Ministry said that the sale of the loss-making Bull would probably take place in several steps, but gave no details on how the government share in the company would be placed in private hands. It said the government's holding in AGF would involve selling state-held shares on the stock market. Alphandery was scheduled to give a press conference later Wednesday morning to discuss details of the privatization. Industry Minister Gerard Longuet has repeatedly said that Renault should be privatized by the end of this year. But Balladur is reportedly concerned about the potential political fall-out from the sale, which is strongly opposed by the communist-led CGT [General Labor Confederation] union which represents most Renault workers. The government has already privatized the BNP [National Bank of Paris], Rhone-Poulenc chemical group and oil firm Elf-Aquitaine. After Wednesday's announcement, 16 firms remain on the government's sell-off list, including Renault. The French economy minister later said the government would take "whatever time we need" to privatize the computer firm Bull, in an interview Wednesday morning on French radio. He said the sell-off of Bull was not designed to "fill up state coffers. This is not our aim." "Bull must leave the state's embrace and learn to fly on its own wings," Alphandery said. "Naturally, we will take whatever time we need to carry out this privatization," he said.
