North Korea is afraid of a military strike by South Korea, Kim stressed on Tuesday [29 March]. [as published] North Korea is strong enough to defend itself. Pyongyang pleads in favor of a peaceful solution to the conflict and is not preparing for a war. However, if a war should break out, it will "spread to other regions" and end in a "big catastrophe." Kim rejected reports that his country is preparing for a war. "North Korea is a very small country and Korea is divided. How can we attack South Korea, the United States, or Japan? We do not understand the purpose of this propaganda." Yet the ambassador admitted that North Korea is in a position to produce missiles: "We have the possibility to produce missiles." However, numerous countries are able to do so. North Korea is not building nuclear weapons, he stated. In the meantime, China has apparently been successful in rejecting sanctions and in demanding talks with the Stalinist country. During his visit to the PRC, South Korean President Kim Yong-sam stated in Beijing on Tuesday that he believes the problem can be solved smoothly through dialogue and negotiations.
