DATE AND TIME: The lottery for authorization to use HSTAIC during 1995 will be held on December 6, 1994, at 11:00 a.m. ADDRESSES: The lottery will be held in the EPIC room, 7th floor, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Joan Montgomery, Staff Specialist, Import-Export Animals Staff, National Center for Import-Export, Veterinary Services, APHIS, USDA, room 765B, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782, (301) 436&hyph;8172. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The regulations in 9 CFR part 92, §§92.430, 92.431, 92.522, and 92.523 (referred to below as the regulations), set forth the conditions under which importers may qualify animals to enter the United States through the Harry S Truman Animal Import Center (HSTAIC) in Fleming Key, FL. Because the demand for quarantine space at HSTAIC has traditionally exceeded the space available, the regulations provide that a lottery will be held each year during the first 7 days of December, to determine the priority of applications for the following calendar year. Information concerning the lottery and how to submit applications were provided in a notice published in the Federal Register on August 22, 1994 (59 FR 43091, Docket 94&hyph;081&hyph;1). This notice announces a time for the lottery, and a change in the location.
