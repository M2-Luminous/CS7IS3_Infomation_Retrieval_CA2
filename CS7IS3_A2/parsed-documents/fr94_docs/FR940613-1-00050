FR940613-1-00050 FR940613-1-00006 When the holder undertakes loan work out activities, provides financial or other advice, or similar support to a financially distressed borrower, the holder will remain within the scope of the proposed security interest regulatory exemption only so long as the holder does not participate in management as provided by this proposed rule's general test. Loan work out actions that are not evidence of ``participation in management'' include, but are not limited to: Restructuring or renegotiating the terms of the security interest; requiring payment of additional rent or interest; exercising forbearance with regard to the security interest; requiring or exercising rights pursuant to an assignment of accounts or other amounts owing to an obligor; requiring or exercising rights pursuant to an escrow agreement pertaining to amounts owing to an obligor; providing specific or general financial or other advice, suggestions, counseling, or guidance; and exercising any right or remedy the holder is entitled to by law or under any warranties, covenants, conditions, representations, or promises from the borrower. (4) Foreclosure and sale or liquidation. Foreclosure and possession of property for purposes of sale or liquidation are often the only remedy the holder may have to secure performance of an obligation. The process of foreclosure and sale or liquidation of a foreclosed-on UST or UST system often results in the exclusive possession of the UST or UST system by the holder and may require or result in the holder's taking record title to the UST or UST system under the laws of some states. For purposes of this proposed rule, the term ``foreclosure or its equivalents'' includes foreclosure, purchase at foreclosure sale, acquisition or assignment of title in lieu of foreclosure, acquisition of a right to possession or title, or other agreement in settlement of the loan obligation, or any other formal or informal manner by which the holder acquires possession of the borrower's collateral for subsequent disposition in partial or full satisfaction of the underlying obligation. These actions are considered to fall within the scope of the proposed regulatory exemption as necessary incidents to holding ownership indicia primarily to protect a security interest. However, a holder is under the coverage of the proposed rule and is not considered an ``owner'' of a UST or UST system only so long as the holder's acquisition pursuant to foreclosure is reasonably necessary to ensure satisfaction or performance of the obligation, is temporary in nature, and occurs while the holder is actively seeking to sell or otherwise divest the foreclosed-on UST or UST system. To meet the requirements of the proposed rule's exemption from regulatory compliance as an ``owner'' following foreclosure, a holder must be acting consistently with the security interest exemption's requirement that the ownership indicia maintained by the holder continue to be held primarily to protect the security interest. Where a holder's actions indicate that it is not seeking to sell or liquidate the secured assets, the exemption is voided because such actions are akin to holding the asset for investment purposes. This proposed regulation describes circumstances under which a holder may avoid being considered an ``owner'' of property on which it forecloses for purposes of certain Subtitle I regulations. It is only by complying with the provisions of this proposed rule that the limited ownership rights of a security holder do not rise to the level of full ``ownership'' sufficient to make the security holder an ``owner'' of the tank, as that term is used in EPA's UST regulations. The proposed rule first provides a set of general criteria for offering an UST or UST system for sale, and when and under what circumstances an offer of purchase may or may not be rejected. In addition, even though a holder is permitted to use whatever means are appropriate and available to sell or otherwise divest itself of foreclosed-on property, as a measure of certainty this proposed rule contains an objective test that, if followed by a holder, establishes that the holder is meeting the general obligation to divest itself of a foreclosed-on UST or UST system in a reasonably expeditious manner. EPA believes that this aspect of the proposed rule is consistent with the RCRA Subtitle I security interest exemption. In general, under this proposal, a foreclosing holder must, in order to maintain consistency with the security interest exemption, seek to sell or otherwise divest itself of foreclosed-on property in a reasonably expeditious manner using whatever commercially reasonable means are available or appropriate, taking all facts and circumstances into account. A holder cannot, under the terms of the proposed rule, reject or refuse offers for the property that represent fair consideration for the asset and remain within the proposed regulatory exemption. A holder that outbids or refuses offers from parties offering fair consideration for the property establishes that the property is no longer being held primarily to protect a security interest. The terms of the bid are relevant for this purpose, and a holder is not required to accept offers that would require it to breach duties owed to other holders, the borrower, or other persons with interests in the property that are owed a legal duty. In addition, the term ``fair consideration'' refers to an all cash offer, which is intended to ensure that this proposed rule would not require a holder to accept a bid that contains unacceptable conditions, such as requirements for indemnification agreements, non-cash offers, ``bundled'' offers, etc. This proposed provision should not be read to require that a holder may accept only cash offers, however; a holder is always free to accept any offer satisfactory to the holder. The exact requirement that would be imposed by this proposed regulation is that a holder may not reject a cash offer of fair consideration for the foreclosed-on property. If it does, or if it outbids others offering fair consideration, then the holder would, under today's proposal, be considered to be an owner of the UST or UST system in the same manner as any other purchaser.
