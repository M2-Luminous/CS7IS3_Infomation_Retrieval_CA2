[Orban] I see the bloc of liberal parties to become increasingly stronger, and I do not attribute importance to the occasional excessive statements. The chairmen of the four liberal parties agreed on the strategy to be followed until the elections. From the experiences of presenting candidates, the four parties representing the bourgeois center force came to the conclusion that, together, they have a good chance to get more than half of the mandates. Therefore, it has no sense to think of a social-liberal coalition. [Farkas] Have the chairmen of the four party agreed on this? [Orban] The party chairmen agreed to use all their power to gain 50 percent of the votes, and they are advancing to a relevant political strategy. I do not know who denies what, but I think that we need time for this position to infiltrate the parties. The Fidesz is in an better position in the sense that the party presidium decided on the political strategy to follow on coalition matters before the four-party meeting, and this strategy is identical with those of the four parties. [Farkas] There is often suspicion coming from the Fidesz and the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] that the SZDSZ is approaching the socialists, while the other side is accusing you of "flirting" with the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF]. Could this lead to a split between the two leading parties of the liberal bloc? [Orban] In principle, it could. But, in my opinion, this debate is over now. In the course of our talks held last week, we accepted the guidelines to be mutually followed and, in my view, this satisfies both the Fidesz and the SZDSZ. [Farkas] At the relevant news conference, the Agrarian Federation, the Fidesz, and the Entrepreneurs' Party rejected the ideas of excluding the social-liberal coalition, but later SZDSZ leaders denied that this issue was on the agenda.... [Orban] Everyone says what he wants. Journalists were present at that news conference and they were able to hear everything; therefore, it is useless to make something out of this after the event. We said everything at that news conference and, in my opinion, the correct formulation was that there is no longer sense in thinking about a social-liberal coalition. [Farkas] In your statements made in recent weeks, you clearly excluded the possibility of a Fidesz-Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] coalition. It seems, however, that your scope of maneuvering is smaller than that of your party. To what extent is this opinion different from that of the leading bodies of the Fidesz? Can one interpret this difference as a strategic split? [Orban] This cannot be regarded as a strong difference, and I do not intend to step in the background or to resign at all. I have a clear opinion on how to solve Hungary's economic crisis. I argue in favor of this opinion and I hope that I will have a majority within the party. [Farkas] What if the cooperation of the four liberal parties does not work after all? [Orban] I do not know. In my opinion, we have no other choice, and this should be clear both to the SZDSZ and the Fidesz, as well as to the other two parties. These parties got into one camp not only through their identical programs but also through their common political interests, because every other form of cooperation only creates worse chances. This is particularly sensitive regarding the SZDSZ and the Fidesz, because these two parties were the most radical anti-communist parties four years ago, and we confronted daily those people who are still heading the MSZP. If we did this four years ago, it is impossible to be with them in a coalition. One cannot make such a turn, because the Hungarian public would not forgive us. This is equal to a situation in which a party wipes itself off the domestic political palette, and we must accept this. [Farkas] It has often been said that "the four years have been nice, we have learned a lot, but now we want to be part of the government...." Do you see a chance for that? If not, will the Fidesz be able to stand four more years in opposition? [Orban] I see chances, and this originates from the fact that the four bourgeois parties succeeded in presenting candidates. Regarding the Fidesz, I think we are moving forward, because we have gone through tests in the past four years, tests that every party can only handle with difficulty. [Farkas] On what do you base your optimism? [Orban] Opinion polls and the gathering of nomination slips show this. I think that the sympathy toward the policy represented by us is increasing and our prestige in the society is growing. We said last year that one should think in terms of a liberal center, and not in terms of a social-liberal coalition. We were accused a lot because of this, and we even lost several battles, but winning the final battle is very near. Now we must not fail and put party interests above the interests of the bourgeois center.... [Farkas] A real war of messages has evolved between you and Gyula Horn. It seems that you appear most frequently in the declarations of the MSZP chairman, and not necessarily in a positive light.... [Orban] This is not surprising. It was the same before. After a temporary fallback, Gyula Horn and his party found their old voice. Their voice resembles the tone flowing toward the Fidesz in 1988 and 1989. They spoke to us so aggressively and accusingly after 16 June 1989. In my opinion, every manifestation of the MSZP, including their videoclips, tones, and statements, speak about revenge, and this is their message to everyone, and especially to us. This tone is not new; I got used to this after 16 June 1989. The Fidesz did not get scared at that time either; nor do we think that we will get scared now.
