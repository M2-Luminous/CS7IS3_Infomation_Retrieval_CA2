The commission showed interest in the application of the press freedom in Albania and listened to opinions by press representatives of the position and the opposition present in the meeting. Expressing the desire for Albania's membership in the EU, the chairman of the Professional Reporters' Association and editor-in-chief of ALEANCA DEMOKRATIKE, Prec Zogaj, expressed the concern of his association over the Press Law passed by the parliament, describing some of its articles as "repressive." According to Mr. Zogaj, these articles "overpass the claims of the law as a means to discipline the press." Ylli Rakipi, chairman of the Reporters' League of Albania, which includes 95 per cent of all reporters in Albania, said that "there are more newspapers than reporters in Albania. The Albanian press lacks professionalism and the ethic of journalism rather than the freedom of the press. You can find in the Albanian press directs offence, sometimes going so far as threatening to death the head of state," Mr. Rakipi said. Thoma Gellci, editor-in-chief of ZERI I POPULLIT, asserted the fact that the press freedom has changed a lot as compared with the past but he laid the stress on the fact that information in newspapers that represent certain parties is under the parties' control and the presentation of the opposite opinions is not a practice. "When through my freedom I cause damage to others' freedoms then it means that there exists no democracy," a reporter of the RD [RILINDJA DEMOKRATIKE], Edi Paloka, said, adding that there is a lack of journalistic ethic in the Albanian opposition press. Director of the newspaper KOHA JONE, Nikolle Lesi, expressed his support for reporters Martin Lekaj and Aleksander Frangaj, considering their punishments as "a pressure of the state over the press organs." RTV reporters Bujar Muharremi and Zamira Koleci pointed to the fact that free press has just appeared in Albania and it needs ethic and professionalism. Rafael Floqi, an ATA reporter, concentrated on the professional weak points of the Albanian press. He said that "a totally independent press does not yet exist in Albania, because even those papers considered to be independent still express certain political tendencies. There can be no talk of the lack of press freedom," Mr. Floqi said, "when about 70 per cent of the number of the newspapers belong to the opposition." The representatives of the Ad Hoc Committee of the Council of Europe showed interest in the possibilities existing to get the information. They asked whether government forums invite representatives from all newspapers in their press conferences. In general all reporters accepted that such invitations have been made. All reporters present in the meeting replied positively a question by Mr. Lambert Kelchtermans, member of the committee, asking them whether they agreed that Albania become a member of the Council of Europe.
