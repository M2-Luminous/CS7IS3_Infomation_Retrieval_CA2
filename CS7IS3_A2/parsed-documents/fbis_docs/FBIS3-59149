Pol.": "In Paris the Hypothesis of a Withdrawal of UN Troops Is Shaking the Majority"] [Text] The debate on Bosnia took a lively turn yesterday within the majority and between the government and the deputies supporting it. The UDF [Union for French Democracy] group in the National Assembly asked that the UN Protection Forces mandate be extended "without waiting for the spring" in order to "remove the doubt of a withdrawal which is encouraging the Serbs to step up their offensive," at the very time when several RPR [Rally for the Republic] deputies are calling for the withdrawal of the Blue Helmets from Bosnia. For the time being, the UDF is demanding that the UN forces be strengthened, reinforcements sent, and the military command provided with the "legal and practical means to take action," including air cover. "Impotence in face of the unbearable killing in Bosnia can no longer be tolerated. This conflict is now a test of the truth of democratic values, of the European Union's political existence, and of the crediblity of the new NATO doctrine," the UDF added. During the defense commission meeting attended by [Defense Minister] Francois Leotard, several RPR deputies demanded either the withdrawal of the Blue Helmets in the fairly near future, or the use of military means. Those speaking in favor of withdrawal were Robert Andre Vivien (Val-de-Marne); Charles Cova (Seine-et-Marne); Pierre Lellouche (Val d'Oise), who is diplomatic adviser to Jacques Chirac; Jean-Bernard Raimond (Bouches-du-Rhone); and Robert Pandraud (Seine-Saint-Denis), a former minister, who said: "I wonder who now stands to gain from dying for Sarajevo; this is not 1914. When people want to kill each other, they kill each other, and they have been killing each other in the Balkans for centuries." Rene Galy-Dejean (Paris) and Alain Marsaud (Haute-Vienne) advocated a tough intervention. In reply to Jacques Chirac, who wondered about the possibility of combining intervention and withdrawal, Defense Minister Francois Leotard said that France is envisaging the possibility of a withdrawal, but that it must be multilateral. "We must assess the consequences," he added, "because there could be a veritable bloodbath." An operation on Serbian territory, "a step in the escalation of the war," strikes him as inconceivable. As for an intervention against the 200 Serbian batteries around Sarajevo, he thinks it would require one and a half days for the targets to be destroyed and would prompt harsh reprisals against an unprotected city.
