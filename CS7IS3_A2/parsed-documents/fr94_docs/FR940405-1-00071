FR940405-1-00071 FR940405-1-00013 Dilution ventilation offers no protection in those cases where, due to the close proximity to a smoker (e.g., contaminant point source), the nonsmoking employee may be exposed to large amounts of sidestream smoke and exhaled mainstream smoke (ETS). Due to the limitations of general ventilation, the smoke cannot be removed from the air before reaching the breathing zone of nearby employees. The carcinogenicity of ETS discounts the use of general ventilation as an engineering control for this contaminant. The major ventilation guidance document available to HVAC practioners (e.g., designers, maintenance, and operators), is Standard 62&hyph;1989 titled ``Ventilation for Acceptable Indoor Air Quality'' [Ex. 4&hyph;333]. The standard is published by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, Inc. (ASHRAE) and it specifies recommended minimum design outside air ventilation rates for 91 different applications. Based on this current ventilation standard, a typical commercial HVAC system serving general office space should prescriptively deliver 20 cubic feet per minute per person (cfm/person) of outside air to the occupied space to dilute occupant generated contaminants like carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and body odors. This ventilation rate would provide what ASHRAE defines as ``acceptable indoor air quality'' (e.g., sensory comfort) to satisfy at least 80% of the building occupants. The prescribed ventilation rates in ASHRAE Standard 62&hyph;1989 are proportional to the occupants in the space (e.g., cfm/PER PERSON) because of the presumption that the contamination produced is in proportion to the occupant density. The foreword of ASHRAE Standard 62&hyph;1989 states ``with respect to tobacco smoke and other contaminants, this standard does not, and cannot, ensure the avoidance of all possible adverse health effects, but it reflects recognized consensus criteria and guidance.'' As published, ASHRAE Standard 62&hyph;1989 did not include any summary and/or explanation documentation which would explain the basis of the consensus standard. Without this documentation, it can only be inferred that the standard was mostly based on satisfaction of sensory comfort rather than based on the control of contaminants like ETS which may contribute to adverse health effects like lung cancer and heart disease. The method of room air distribution found in most HVAC systems is a mixing system that attempts to create an environment of uniform air velocities, temperatures and humidities in the occupied zone of a room (e.g.; floor to 6 feet above floor). In this occupied zone, air velocities less than 50 feet per minute (fpm) and minimization of temperature gradients will promote occupant comfort. In a conventional mixing system where the supply air diffusers (outlets) and the return air grilles are both located in the ceiling, the air motion in the occupied zone could be characterized as ``gentle drift'' toward the ceiling where the room air is then mixed with the conditioned air being delivered to the room through the supply air diffusers [1993 ASHRAE Handbook, Ch.31]. Because of natural convection currents and thermal buoyancy forces it is common, especially during heating season, to have stagnant zones. In a mixing room air distribution system, the emphasis is on comfort. There are other room air distribution schemes which consider contaminant control and have been used in the industrial environment like displacement ventilation and unidirectional (plug-flow) airflow ventilation. In these schemes, there is an attempt to move contaminants directionally along a clean to less clean gradient. These schemes are seldom used in conventional HVAC systems due to their cost, feasibility and compromise of comfort issues. From the industrial hygiene perspective, local exhaust ventilation, specific to each source, would be the preferred and recommended method for controlling occupational exposures to contaminant point sources like ETS. Such specific ventilation is effective because the contaminant is captured or contained at its source before it is dispersed into the work environment where only ineffective general dilution ventilation is available to control exposures. A designated smoking area which is enclosed, exhausted directly to the outside, and maintained under negative pressure is sufficient to contain tobacco smoke within the designated area. Such areas could be considered an application of local exhaust ventilation because the contaminant is being exhausted from a confined source without dispersal into the general workspace. IV. Preliminary Quantitative Risk Assessment A. Introduction The determining factor in the decision to perform a quantitative risk assessment is the availability of suitable data for use in such an assessment. A wide spectrum of health effects have been associated with exposure to indoor air pollutants and ETS. These effects range from acute irritant effects to cancer. In the case of ETS, OSHA has determined that data are available to quantify two types of risk: lung cancer and heart disease. For this risk assessment, OSHA defines ``heart disease'' to be coronary heart disease excluding strokes, as defined in the Framingham study [Ex. 4&hyph;108]. In the case of indoor air pollutants, the only data available to OSHA were on specific acute health effects, such as severe headaches, excluding migraines, and other respiratory conditions, such as ``stuffy nose'', ``runny nose'', etc. OSHA is aware that there are more serious conditions such as legionellosis and hypersensitivity diseases associated with poor indoor air and suspected to be potential occupational hazards. However, the Agency currently does not have adequate data to conduct a quantitative risk assessment addressing these risks in the workplace. OSHA is continuing to develop appropriate methodology to address risk estimations for conditions related to poor indoor air quality in the workplace and is requesting input on data sources relevant to these efforts.
