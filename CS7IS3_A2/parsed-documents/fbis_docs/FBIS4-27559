Vice Finance Minister Jiro Saito told a news conference that the ministry report, issued last Friday, on revenue estimates for tax cuts and hikes had "no policy implications." "We will consider positively (on revising the estimates) if requested," Saito said in brushing off criticism that his ministry is again trying to steer debate on the tax reform, particularly in regards to the tax hike rate, maturity of stopgap bonds and fiscal streamlining. Saito said the report was just a "mechanical calculation" to serve as a basis for further discussions by a government tax panel and the ruling coalition parties. Pressed by reporters to explain why estimates for a tax hike of below 7 percent was not included in the report, Saito said, "there's no reason for us to reject if requested to calculate estimates on the basis of a 6 percent tax rate." The report, submitted upon request to the tax commission and the ruling parties, estimates net revenues in fiscal 2000 after tax cuts of 6.2 percent are extended and the current 3 percent consumption tax is raised to between 7 percent and 10 percent in April 1997. The ministry was criticized for its failure to include estimates on a tax hike of below 7 percent, a "natural" tax revenue increase and possible effects from fiscal and administrative overhauls. It was also criticized for setting conditions of redeeming stopgap bonds to 10 years and financing expected increases in welfare spending wholly with the tax hike. The stopgap bonds would fund the three-year time lag between tax cuts and hike. After reviewing the report Friday, the ruling coalition asked the ministry for estimates that include a consumption tax hike of between 4 percent and 6 percent, "natural" revenue increases and a 20-year maturity for the stopgap bonds, a ministry official said. Saito said the ministry has not decided on conditions for redeeming stopgap bonds in 10 years but said, "we want to redeem them as early as possible." He said fiscal and administrative reforms were "yet unclear with discussions still under way."
