Branded Advertising The usefulness of branded advertising to increase the sales of a particular product is also well documented. Within the private sector, companies unfailingly recognize the importance of advertising and collectively spend billions of dollars a year on advertising and promotion activities in order to generate sales. In 1992 alone, the nation's top 20 advertisers spent more than $500 million on advertising. (Advertising Age, August 29, 1993). Within the agricultural field, brand advertising is also a useful tool which has been found to benefit not only the actual brand advertiser, but the overall industry as well. Through brand advertising, handlers seek to move their own products from the shelf to the consumer. A recent study conducted by an economist at the University of California at Davis, Department of Agricultural Economics (Jason Christian, 1994) concluded that brand advertising has afforded substantial benefits to all California almond growers. In his analysis, Christian examined the market effects of brand advertising by one large almond cooperative as well as other independent handlers, between 1972 and 1992. Based on Christian's analysis, it was estimated that the average rate of return to the industry as a result of brand advertising by the cooperative was substantial. During the 1980's the average rate of return for each additional dollar spent on advertising expenditures was about $5.00. Aside from the individual brand advertiser, other handlers in the industry also benefited from the advertising because it created an increased demand for all almonds. Between 1979 and 1990, the benefits received by other almond handlers actually exceeded the returns received by the brand advertiser. Mr. Wasson also submitted materials on the effects of almond promotion on the industry, including documentation on imports and exports of almonds and statistical tables on the almond industry. A summary of the materials is as follows. Effects of Almond Promotion on the Almond Industry Aside from the studies described above, there are numerous other indications that the combined creditable and generic advertising program administered by the Almond Board has been highly successful. Statistics indicate that both the supply and demand of California almonds have increased significantly since the inception of the Almond Marketing Order's advertising and promotion program. In the early 1980's the U.S. almond crop averaged about 300 million pounds. By the early 1990's the almond crop averaged about 550 million pounds. Almonds have thus attained a level of market growth which few other agricultural commodities can claim. Significantly, grower prices for almonds have remained relatively stable throughout these years of increased production. One basic theory of economic analysis is that prices for a product will fall if supply increases without a corresponding increase in demand. The relative stability of prices within the almond industry throughout the years of increased production indicate that demand for California almonds has increased dramatically over the years. Another measure of the growing popularity of almonds can be obtained through analysis of per capita consumption. USDA figures indicate that the United States' per capita consumption of almonds is well ahead of that of any competing nuts. In 1970&hyph;71, the average American's per capita consumption of almonds was about .34 pounds per person. In 1987&hyph;88, the average per capita consumption of almonds was .58 pounds per person. By 1991&hyph;92, per capita consumption had risen to .82 pounds per person. This represents a 40% increase in per capita consumption between 1987 and 1992. Importantly, no tree nut was promoted more aggressively than almonds during this period. Additionally, the tree nut with the second largest per capita consumption between 1987 and 1992 was walnuts, at just .54 pounds per person.
