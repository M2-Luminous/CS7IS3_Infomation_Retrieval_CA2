Sam Marcy, chairman of the Workers World Party of the United States, in an article contributed to the newspaper workers world on March 31 said the United States now is in a desperate bid to make it appear that the DPRK "is promoting a criminal program overtly and covertly to become a nuclear power." He said it is entirely a matter of sovereignty for the Korean Government to decide on who should come and what he should inspect, whether it be nuclear facilities or any other things. The progressive people and working class in the United States should support the DPRK's cause of justice, he added. The Jordanian Islamic and Christian United Action Front in a statement dated March 30 denounced what the United States has been doing on the Korean peninsula as a total challenge to international law, international usage, human rights and to the interests of the people in the DPRK and the rest of Asia and to world peace. A Cuban delegate and 18 resident representatives of Dominican, Palestinian, Salvadoran and other national political parties and organizations and international organizations including the Tri-Continental People's Solidarity organization in Cuba held a joint conference in Havana on March 30 and published a joint statement, in which they called attention to the fact that the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean authorities are now driving the situation of the Korean peninsula to the brink of war on the pretext of the fictitious "nuclear issue of the North". The actual nuclear threat on the Korean peninsula comes from South Korea where U.S. forces are stationed, said the statement. It strongly urged the United States and the South Korean authorities to unconditionally and immediately give up the deployment of Patriot missiles in South Korea and the resumption of the "Team Spirit" joint military exercises. The Peruvian group for the study of works of Comrade Kim Il-song and the Portuguese Committee for Supporting the Independent and Peaceful Reunification of Korea, too, published statements urging the United States to renounce its position of "strength" and solve the issue through dialogue and negotiation.
