During those years, China started up more than 10,000 large and medium-sized basic construction projects, of which 5,000 were completed and put into operation. What about their economic efficiency? To prepare this article, I discussed the problem with many management personnel and investment experts. They all said it would be very difficult to explain the problem in a few words. Experts divided the economic benefits of fixed asset investment into projected benefits, construction benefits, and final benefits. Projected benefits refer to a process through which experts check the possibility of the success of an investment project from the stage of decisionmaking, design, completion, and commissioning of the said investment project. To determine construction benefits, one needs to check the extent of cost-saving (quality included) during construction of the investment project, as there is only input and no output during the construction period. Final benefits are the most important, because investment results are finally reflected in economic benefits following the commissioning of a project. Investment results are also reflected in whether the invested amount can be recouped ahead of schedule or on schedule and by the increase in the value of capital. Based on the division of projected, construction, and final benefits, and as far as the state's major and medium-sized projects are concerned, we can say that most of the decisions on building these projects were correct; construction of most of them was successful; their projected benefits were good or excellent; and they have played a positive role in the development of China's economy. Among them was the "156" project which was carried out many years ago under the First Five-Year Plan. Among recent cases were a number of state key projects including the Baoshan Iron and Steel Complex, Gezhou Dam, Beijing-Guangzhou Double-Track Railway, Beijing-Tianjin-Tanggu Expressway, and Yangpu Bridge. Not only were their projected benefits good, but their construction and final benefits were also satisfactory. However, wrong decisions and poor construction planning indeed contributed to many failed projects. Heavy losses begin with the completion of flawed projects. In one case, a newly built port was unable to handle oil because none was available. The result: The port was left idle most of the time. In another case, some railways were built to transport local coal, but as none was available by the time they were completed, additional railways had to be constructed to transport other provinces' coal. One locality spent $36 million on importing a set of equipment to produce methyl alcohol; but, because of the excess local production capacity for methyl alcohol and because there was no buyer for this equipment, it was left idle and became a heap of scrap metal. Regarding construction benefits, there were cases of cost overruns -- I am not talking about a 10 or 20 percent cost overrun but overruns of 100-200 percent. There were also many cases of behind-schedule and poor-quality projects. Due to various reasons, the final benefits of many projects were poor. This resulted in a failure to repay investment loans and the inability to recoup the investment amount. What are the reasons behind poor economic benefits? "This is a complex and long-standing problem," remarked one person involved in investment planning. He said the problems behind poor economic benefits for some investment projects are not new; they are age-old problems which have been discussed again and again. They include: The scrambling to set up investment projects; "feasibility reports" which tend to become "approval reports;" disregard for project appraisal consultation; failure to follow the procedures governing basic construction projects; and bid rigging. Some investment experts added the following reasons: Flip-flop decisions on investment projects; emphasis on extensive forms of enlarged production; negligence of intensive forms of enlarged production; concentration on oversupplied goods production to the neglect of production of goods in short supply; emphasis on small-scale projects to the neglect of large-scale projects; overhastiness in starting up projects; and the tendency to go slow on start-up projects. We have to admit that a micro-investment project tends to be affected and restrained by the macroeconomic environment. "Fondness for big projects" and "excessive investment" are the direct reasons that cause poor economic benefits for some investment projects. What are the adverse effects of the excessive investment scale? When many construction projects are plagued with the problem of fund supply, the state is forced to issue inordinate amounts of money on the market. Even if the state issues a large amount of money on the market, there is no certainty that it can meet the fund requirements of many construction projects. If funds are unavailable, the progress of the project will be affected, completion will be delayed, and construction benefits will be adversely affected. Fixed asset investment not only requires funds but also materials. An overly extended investment scale will lead to steel, cement, and glass shortages. When all rush to buy up materials, prices will surely rise, which will then trigger inflation. There is an objective law behind the scale of investment which does not change with changes in the people's will. The objective law dictates that construction scale be commensurate with national strength. Every year, a country may only draw a portion from the GDP or from the national income to invest in fixed assets that will not produce output within a short period. How big should this portion be? That depends on the availability of the funds at the time. All in all, when the investment rate climbs up to a certain degree, it is bound to fall to seek a balance in supply and demand. Otherwise, national economic development will be affected. Therefore, maintaining a proper investment rate, extending the cycle of fluctuation as long as possible, reducing the fluctuation rate, and avoiding "flip-flops," are the keys to raising investment benefits, and to bringing about a sustained and healthy development of the national economy. Some experts of the State Statistical Bureau believe that the proper annual investment rate for China is between 30 and 32 percent. A researcher of the Economics Research Center of the State Planning Commission has said practice since the start of reform and opening up shows that strains and even imbalance will happen in various sectors of the national economy if the annual investment rate exceeds 30 percent and the investment rate of state-owned units exceeds 20 percent. The construction of projects is separated from their productive operations, and the investment management system deals with the former only. As a result, people seek only to have a project approved, built, and completed, and they do not care about final benefits. This is another direct cause for poor economic efficiency of some investment projects. Under the "one-continuous-line" investment management system over the last several dozen years, the management of an investment project, particularly a state investment project, ends after it is checked and accepted upon completion. A leading group is responsible for the preparation, designing, engineering, and completion of a major project (large or medium-sized); and then, another leading group will be in charge of its productive operation. Such an investment management system, known as the "project before enterprise" system, objectively separates project construction from its productive operation, while the two should be integrated as one. All the shortcomings of such a practice have been shown today. Because of the separation, the project designers and builders usually do not consider the needs of enterprise production and operation. When the enterprise manager encounters a problem, he usually uses "inherent shortcomings" as an excuse to shirk his responsibility. Something unusual happens in connection with investment -- for a construction project which costs more than 50 million yuan, the budget is projected at only 49.9 million yuan so that it will be easier to get approval; and after it is approved and construction starts, people's enthusiasm drastically cools down and they do not care about its progress at all. Some people think that what is important is to get the project approved and the funds appropriated; after all, only the state is affected by profit or loss. These phenomena show that the old investment management system objectively separates anticipated benefits from engineering efficiency and final benefits, and seriously ignores the pursuit of final benefits and other objectives.
