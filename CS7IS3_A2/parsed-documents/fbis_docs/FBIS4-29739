He said that was more an expression of his hope. At the House of Councillors' Budget Committee today, Minao Hattori of the Liberal Democratic Party and others questioned Hata's remark during a wayside speech on 18 June that he believed North Korea did not actually possess nuclear arms and had no intention to produce them. They said this is in conflict with the government's official view so far. In reply, Hata explained that since North Korea claims that it has neither the capability, nor the intention to manufacture nuclear arms, his remark was really an expression of his hope. He also said he regretted that his statement could lead to misunderstanding. He indicated the government's consensus on this matter is that North Korea may have produced more plutonium than it has declared, and it would be a serious matter if such plutonium is being used to manufacture nuclear weapons.
