Five Years Ago Chinese Students Challenged the Party. And the Party Gave the Command: `Fire'"] [Excerpts] Beijing -- No posters, rallies, or speeches. There must be no breach of the bans. At exactly 1200 hours on 4 June people will stand in silence for three minutes. That will be the most fitting means of honoring the memory of those who died on Tienanmen Square. [passage omitted] Memories of the bloody internal strife are still alive. The Chinese have before their eyes another frightening image -- the disintegrating USSR. References to the unsuccessful "Russian model" figure frequently in secret publications destined for career party officials and also in statements by pro-Beijing politicians in Hong Kong. For instance, one such politician, Chu Youling, claims that, had it not proved possible to put down the troublemakers on Tienanmen Square, China would have suffered Russia's fate. "I realized that the speeches on Tienanmen Square were the fruit of student fervor and not of mature analysis," I was told by a young entrepreneur who five years ago was working as a reporter and was delighted to heed the calls to establish democracy in China. Since then he has changed dramatically, gone into business, and continually goes abroad. In his opinion, Deng Xiaoping's reforms, socialist in name but capitalist in essence, open up unlimited oportunities for the private sector to make money. Whereas, before, university graduates went to work where they were assigned, now many people can choose for themselves well-paid jobs in joint enterprises or foreign firms. During meetings with foreign journalists these young people reiterate in the wake of official propaganda that the right to material prosperity is more important than all other human rights. Nonetheless, the lessons of 1989 have not disappeared without trace. They primarily gave a huge number of people an opportunity to see the Communist Party in its true colors and showed that it is willing to spill blood when its monopoly on power is at stake. Second, the dissidents say, the glaring contradiction between liberal reforms in the economy and the preservation of the totalitarian political regime has become particularly obvious against the backdrop of those events. People see corruption and are indignant that party mandarins in the localities are exploiting their absolute power and filling their pockets at the treasury's expense. In the events of 1989 workers played a secondary role and peasants played none at all. Today they are less and less like an inert mass. Bribery and corruption among officials and conflicts over land are arousing peasant unrest in the provinces. Although overt forms of protest are prohibited by law, last year, according to the Ministry of Labor, there were 6,000 strikes and demonstrations by workers. In the opinion of Xu Lianing, a 70-year old scientist who openly declares his differences with the government, social contradictions today are more acute than in 1989. If a slump begins in the economy, as happened in the late eighties, or overt struggle flares up in the party following Deng Xiaoping's retirement, renewed upheaval cannot be ruled out. There is no democratic mechanism in the country to ensure a smooth transfer of power.
