The memorandum of understanding, a copy of which has been obtained by the GUARDIAN reveals that the Government was prepared to set up cheap loans for the Malaysians to subsidise their purchase of British defence exports. The Government would pay the difference between the banks' commercial rates and the concessionary rate it was offering, involving potential subsidies worth tens of millions of pounds. Labour and Liberal Democrat MP's expressed outrage last night. The terms of the memorandum were "absolutely monstrous," said Menzies Campbell, the Liberal Democrat defence spokesman. The funding deal is in addition to the 234 million pound aid that Britain agreed to give to Malaysia to build the Pergau dam, which was described as a bad buy by Sir Tim Lankester, permanent secretary at the Overseas Development Administration. Foreign Office ministers have already admitted that this aid was tied to a mathematical formula on the sale of arms. On funding, the agreement reads: "The total payment for any equipment procured under this (memorandum) will be provided by the Malaysian government but in the event that there is any shortfall in the funding, the United Kingdom government will assist in the arrangement of financial facilities provided by a United Kingdom bank or a group of United Kingdom banks and the United Kingdom will ensure that the interest to be charged will be at concessionary rates." The 15-part memorandum reveals that Britain was prepared to go further than the normal practice of providing spares and ensuring that defence companies offered training to foreign troops and pilots in the use of arms equipment. In this case the Government agreed to train Malaysian troops in Britain in military strategy, advising on war and defence plans. The document reveals that like the huge arms deal with Saudi Arabia, Lady Thatcher agreed to set up a unit inside the Ministry of Defence [MoD] in support of the 1 billion pound deal, and she established an MoD team in Malaysia to assist. Lady Thatcher also agreed to supply the Malaysians with a list of firms supplying arms aircraft and ships, and advising on companies the Government regarded as most reliable. The British proposed to charge the Malaysian government a sum tied to the order price of up to 10 million pounds as a management fee for its assistance in training and advice, including a down-payment of 1 million pounds within 30 days of the first order being made. Mr Campbell said: "The terms of the funding arrangements which required the British government to arrange cheap credit for the Malaysian government are absolutely monstrous. What possible justification can there be for such an arrangement unless there was a direct connection with some other financial deal?" Nick Brown, Labour MP for Newcastle upon Tyne, East, which includes the Swan Hunter shipyard which lost the bid for two Malaysian frigates to its rivals Yarrow Shipbuilders, said: "Contrary to what we were told by the Government at the time, Britain was secretly rating the bids from different companies instead of operating a level playing field." George Foulkes, Labour MP for Carrick, said: "This is absolutely outrageous. It amounts to a sweetheart deal financed by the British taxpayer." The deal has led to an order for British Aerospace Hawk trainer aircraft and two frigates from Yarrow, a GEC subsidiary. But orders for Tornado aircraft and submarines have not materialised. Last night the Foreign Office said the memorandum was confidential: "It is only for the eyes of both governments and is not a published document."
