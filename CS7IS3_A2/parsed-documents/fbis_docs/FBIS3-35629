The plan also envisages a 2.3 percent growth in industrial output and a 7.1 percent in the farming sector. Consumer production is to be increased by 5.7 percent with export revenues being planned at the level of $1.3 Bn. The cabinet is given two weeks in which to approve the volume of state orders and contracts and inform appropriate ministries, departments and local governments. Chairman of the planning, budget and price commission Andrey Pecherov told parliament that this year's government guidelines had been changed to the detriment of "market methods" though this was necessary in the emerging conditions. For his part, Acting Prime Minister Yefim Zvyagilskiy warned against fearing the administrative methods of economic management saying "no country in the world has abided without them, particularly at the time of crisis." He called on deputies to allow the National Bank to provide the government with a loan of 12 Tn karbovantsy to be repaid in the second half of this year. After four rounds of voting, the government-proposed budget was defeated. Some deputies described as utopian the government's offer of a non-deficit budget. Head of the defence and security commission Valentin Lemish said the proposed defence spending of 16.9 Tn karbovantsy or 4.8 of total expenditure did not cover the defence ministry's needs.
