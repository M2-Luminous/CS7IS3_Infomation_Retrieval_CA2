Bowing to world pressure, India pledged to open up the Kashmir valley to diplomats of Islamic countries, so vehemently refused in the past, and requested the UNHRC to appeal to Pakistan not to press the resolution. In the meantime, the Iranian permanent envoy in the UNHRC declared that his country would continue to exert pressure on India to alleviate the sufferings of the people of held Kashmir and improve the human rights situation there. On his appeal, supported by 15 other countries including China, Pakistan agreed to defer voting on its resolution for one year. Following tabling of the resolution at Geneva by Pakistan for censuring India for its violations of human rights in Kashmir the scenario kept hanging as the days progressed. There were two postponements on the vote on Pakistan's resolution and it became obvious that many of the 53 members of the UNHRC would abstain during the vote. That would not have been desirable. By deferring the vote on its resolution Pakistan has thereby gained time to persuade the abstaining countries to review their decision. The Latin American countries, in particular, had indicated that they wanted a little more time to fully grasp the various aspects of the Kashmir problem. On the urging of friendly countries Pakistan did not press for a vote, but nevertheless it has accomplished what it set out to do. By tabling the resolution at UNHRC and actively lobbying for it Pakistan has fully succeeded in highlighting the Kashmir dispute and focusing attention of the international community on the miserable human right situation prevailing in Indian occupied Kashmir. It is because of the intense diplomatic pressure Pakistan put on India that Delhi recently arranged visits by two batches of foreign diplomats to Kashmir and announced permission for a team of International Committee of Red Cross (ICRC) to visit it. Also notable is the fact that since the beginning of the current session of UNHRC at which Pakistan tabled its resolution, there has been a drastic reduction in the killings in occupied Kashmir. As Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmed Ali put it, the said resolution is very much alive and can be put up at other forums. Thus while on the one hand Pakistan has succeeded in putting India on the defensive on the human right issue in held Kashmir, on the other, it retains the diplomatic initiative in the matter.
