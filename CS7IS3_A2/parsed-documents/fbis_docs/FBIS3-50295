DANAS states that the local Croats established the province despite the opposition of the Herceg-Bosna leadership. The weekly explains that the Owen-Stoltenberg plan, which called for only a small portion of Bosanska Posavina to be given to the Bosnian Croat republic, was the greatest motive for the establishment of Bosanska Posavina's autonomy. Every Bosanska Posavina resident will agree with this, DANAS states, adding that in comparison to the Vance-Owen plan, the Owen-Stoltenberg plan "was the sheer destruction of one of the most compact Croatian territories in Bosnia-Herzegovina." In contrast to the Vance-Owen plan, which called for the Bosanski Brod, Odzak, Bosanski Samac, and Orasje municipalities, as well as parts of the Derventa, Doboj, Modrica, Gradacac, and Brcko municipalities, to be included in the Croatian-majority province, the Owen-Stoltenberg plan gave the Croats only two-and-one-half municipalities, DANAS observes. This is why the Posavina residents decided at a general assembly recently held in Slavonski Brod to "return to a kind of Vance-Owen plan." The assembly made the decision to establish the province of Bosanska Posavina incorporating the municipalities of Bosanski Brod, Bosanski Samac, Derventa, Modrica, Odzak, and Orasje and parts of Brcko, Doboj, and Gradacac. According to the 1991 census, Croats were a majority in this region, with 59.6 percent of the population, followed by Serbs with 20.5 percent and Muslims with 15.5 percent. Other nationalities made up 4.4 percent of the population. "Now that the plan for the union of Posavina municipalities into a special territorial-political body has become a reality, its supporters are not pleased to be compared to Fikret Abdic," DANAS states, adding that the reason for this is not because the founding of their province is different from that of the Autonomous Province of Western Bosnia, but because they do not want to be viewed as the creators of a conflict among the Croatian people similar to the intra-Muslim conflict in the Autonomous Province of Western Bosnia. The essential difference between the two is that the Autonomous Province of Western Bosnia has hostile relations with the Muslim leadership in Sarajevo, while Bosanska Posavina intends to maintain equally good relations with Alija Izetbegovic and Mate Boban, DANAS concludes.
