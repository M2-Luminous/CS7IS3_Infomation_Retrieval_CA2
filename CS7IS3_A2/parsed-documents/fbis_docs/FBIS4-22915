We are talking about a principally new effort. And in our peer group, it is not customary to stick your head out until the research findings are published in specialized publications. Yet the circumstances obligate us to make this known today. The hard reality is merciful both towards us and towards the dolphins.'' Yet nevertheless, I decided to start with secrets. Especially since the subject is so exciting. The colleagues know: until recently, journalists weren't allowed anywhere near the dolphin aquariums related to the Navy in one way or another. And almost all of them had such a relationship. This engendered numerous rumors, including some about the dolphins' supernatural abilities. People use to say seriously that they were being used as live mines. ``Even today, you will not be met at the installation with outstretched arms,'' according to the scientists. But this can be explained by the secrecy of the installation itself and not by the experiments with dolphins.`` Yes, they were used by the military. But certainly not for aggressive purposes. In essence, dolphins served as ``border guards''--they guarded a certain water area. Naturally, they do not have any supernatural abilities, but their intellect is highly developed. This enabled them to detect invasion by unwanted visitors. And notify us about it.'' I continued to press: ``I also heard that dolphins were stuffed with chemical preparations, that electrodes were embedded into their brain, that dolphins were turned into obedient robots.'' ``Of course not,'' the scientists respond with a smile. ``In principle, it is possible to affect the behavior of higher animals. Yet we were not interested in it. We and the dolphins are friends. And they are clever and understand everything...'' ``Only that they cannot talk.'' ``Yes, they can, in their own way.'' For many people, all dolphins ``look the same,'' just like the Chinese look to the Europeans. Yet the experts never mistake any of their pupils for others. They also state that they are just as different as you and I. They even have their own character. Some of them are stubborn, some witty, some gay, some pensive. Sometimes they want to joke. Take, for example, beautiful Buran (see figure [not reproduced]); he likes to hide in a secluded place, and when he sees a human nearby, he will throw a jellyfish at him. And in so doing, the misbehaving dolphin tries to hit you straight in the face. His friend Ritm would sometimes play dead--lie on the swimming pool bottom and wait until the worried staff dive and look for him, then he would suddenly ``come back to life'' to everybody's joy. Yet jokes do not get in the way of business. When the time comes to get to serious work, dolphins display enviable diligence. When asked the question ``Where is the 10x12 wrench?'' they will not start arguing like in a well-known joke, but will quickly bring the tool. And this is how dolphins can be tremendously useful to humans. To tell the truth, this has not been fully comprehended by people. In essence, scientists from the Moscow State University taught dolphins to find and help to lift any sunken equipment from the bottom. And people sink a lot of things: when laying pipelines and during underwater petroleum exploration, and during various types of repairs. Unfortunately, they are sinking the most valuable items and, as a rule, ``without any trace.'' They do not even send divers: it is exceedingly difficult to find the lost items. At times, the diving station is not working, sometimes it is too deep, the water is turbid, or there is not enough time. Yet this does not pose difficulty for dolphins. This has been proven by many years of experiments in the Black Sea. ``How do you explain to the dolphins what it is exactly you are trying to find?'' I asked. With dogs, e.g., you let them sniff something before sending them to search. And then you say ``Search!'' ``The details of our relations' with dolphins are our know-how. But take my word for it: dolphins can generalize what they can see. They primarily respond to the items which are distinguished from the natural background. Then they accomplish more specific tasks.'' ``And can they find lost treasures?'' ``During the time of research using dolphins, we found and lifted from the bottom more than a ton of silver, amorphous, and other archeological wonders. You should agree that in addition to the scientific aspect, it is also very interesting from the economic viewpoint. I suddenly got an idea: ``And why haven't we used dolphins to look for the Loch Ness monster?'' '' ``No problem,'' the scientists respond. ``As long as the monster is there. Dolphins are capable of staying in fresh water for a certain time without any harm to their health. Let them search. For certainty, we can also attach television cameras to them--we have also tried that too.'' ``Of course, these are exotic things. But if you are serious, there would be a lot of work for dolphins at oil and gas fields. And today, there are more and more of them further up North...'' ``I understand. Would the dolphins freeze? No. They can dive very deep and they are well protected from hypothermia by a fat layer under their skin. Moreover, it is easy to train northern dolphins--the belugas.'' Thus, Russian scientists have developed a unique training program--this is how we can tentatively refer to this process whereby any wild dolphin is turned in a nine-month period into an animal devoted to humans and capable of executing the most complicated tasks to find anything, even drowned persons. Their loyalty is so strong that when working in the open sea, the dolphins always return. No matter how they are being lured by their idol kin. This is a serious accomplishment on a world level. American forecasters thought that such problems could not be solved before 2020. There are other plans at the Moscow State University. They think there, in the form of a hypothesis at present, that it will be possible to work equally as successfully with other less ``intelligent'' animals. For example, with bats. We could certainly use their mastery of ultrasound. But... The readers are probably already getting an idea that I will have to finish this report in a rather uneventful fashion. Research by the Moscow State University biologists is no longer being financed--the money has long run out. Both for salaries and for experiments. And the enthusiasm is running out too. It seems that no one cares about our lead. And about the fact that we proposed a method of underwater search which requires almost no physical expenditures and is environmentally clean and safe. Dear businessman, you should really help the scientists. And you, oil and gas field workers, should pay careful attention. And give more help. And maybe, the government will also take an interest? It is worth it. The scientists sigh ``the problem, alas, is not simply in our salary or lost profit; we are embarrassed in front of our dolphin friends. We have no food to give to them...'' In the figure [not reproduced]: Buran is smiling and asking for food.
