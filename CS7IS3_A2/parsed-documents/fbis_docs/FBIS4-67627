These show that in December there were 105 new reports of AIDS cases bringing the cumulative total to 8,529 cases. The cumulative total of recognised HIV infections is now 21,101. New reports of HIV infection may relate to people who have recently become infected, to people infected some time before choosing to be tested, or to people first tested when they develop AIDS. Notes to Editors 1. Epidemiological surveillance of the Acquired immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) was begun at the PHLS AIDS Centre in collaboration with the Communicable Diseases and Environmental Health (Scotland) Unit [CD&EH(S)U] in 1982. Surveillance of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection, the cause of AIDS, commenced in late 1984. 2. PHLS CD&EH(S)U work in collaboration with colleagues in the Oxford Haemophilia Centre (coordinating national information on haemophiliacs) and with colleagues in the Department of Paediatric Epidemiology, Institute of Child Health. 3. AIDS case reports are compiled from voluntary confidential reports by clinicians directly to PHLS and CD&EH(S)U. A summary report is released monthly. 4. HIV infection reports are made through a voluntary confidential reporting by the microbiologists in laboratories where HIV tests are carried out. They are summarised and released with the monthly AIDS figures at the end of each quarter. 5. Due to the length and variability of the period between infection with HIV and development of AIDS (average of between 8-10 years), reports of AIDS cases do not give a picture of the current spread of HIV infection. 6. Information on deaths is based on reports to PHLS and CD&EH(S)U from clinicians, supplemented by information on death entries obtained from the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys and the Registrar General for Scotland. 7. There are many people currently being treated for disease related to HIV infection who do not yet fulfil the surveillance case definition for AIDS. Further data on AIDS is available in the PHLS Communicable Disease Report, which can be subscribed to by contacting Editor CDR, PHLS Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre, 61 Colindale Avenue, London NW9 5EQ. [Note to Readers: In following AIDS reports from the United Kingdom only editorial notes that contain new information will be published.]
