He explained that "Aleksey Kazannik is not procurator-general because his candidature was not presented to the Federation Council and was not endorsed in the post in the first place." Commenting on today's decision of the upper chamber, Satarov said that "it was not a legal but a political decision. The Federation Council interpreted the Constitution, which amounts to violating it," he stressed. According to Satarov, the situation reflects a conflict between two standards one of which is coming to replace the other." One was set by the president's decree 1400 appointing Aleksey Kazannik procurator-general, and the other is set in the Constitution, under which the procurator general must be nominated by the president and confirmed by the Federation Council. According to Satarov, Boris Yeltsin accepted Kazannik's resignation to resolve the conflict of the two norms and thus cleared space for the new constitution." Satarov thinks that this legal uncertainty, which arose in the wake of the Federation Council's move today "further complicates the struggle against crime and blocks the activity of the procurator's office."
