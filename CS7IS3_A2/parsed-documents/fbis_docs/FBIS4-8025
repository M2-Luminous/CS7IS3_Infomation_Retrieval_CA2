It said six or seven people "armed with automatic rifles" and wearing Greek military uniforms had crossed the border near Peshkepia in the southern district of Gjirokastra. Quoting a law and order ministry communique, it said that at 02:30 a.m. the Greeks had entered an army recruit training centre four kilometers (2.5 miles) from the border. Two of the attackers killed soldier Arben Gjini, 20, while the others went into a dormitory and opened fire on the sleeping soldiers. An officer, Fatmi Shehu, was killed and three other soldiers were badly wounded. Several other men sustained minor wounded. One of the attackers spoke Albanian but with the accent of the Greek minority concentrated in the south of the country, the communique said. The commando escaped and fled back to Greece. All the evidence pointed to they having come from Greece, the communique said. The Albanian foreign ministry protested at what it called a "criminal act premeditated by Greek special forces". It said the Greek government "must bear responsibility" for the attack. Sunday's incident was the most serious in recent years between Albania and Greece whose disagreement centres on the fate of the Greek Orthodox Christian minority in Albania. In July, Greece expelled around 20,000 Albanian workers following the expulsion by Tirana of an Orthodox priest alleged to have advocated unification of ethnic Greeksin southern Albania with Greece. About 200,000 Albanians are believed to be living illegally in Greece. Meanwhile in Athens the Northern Epirus Liberation Front (Malvi) claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement to the ELEVTHEROTIPIA newspaper published Monday. The group said it had been forced into the attack by the "criminal indifference of the Greek state" towards the plight of the Greek minority in Albania. Northern Epirus is the Greek nationalist name for the southern region where most of Albania's Greek minority is concentrated. The statement condemned the "conspiracy of silence which had condemned to fatalism our nationality question and our brothers in Northern Epirus." The attack was an attempt to transform the "catastrophic situation" of the Greek minority that had led to Malvi's creation, the statement said. According to Athens some 400,000 ethnic Greeks live in Albania, but Tirana puts the figure at 60,000.
