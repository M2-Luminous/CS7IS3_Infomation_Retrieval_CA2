Cook Island understanding of it is deliberately hindered by laws which make it illegal to discuss tax laws publicly, while in New Zealand, where commercial papers have been leaked, High Court orders have kept the issue out of the headlines. The head of the New Zealand First party, Winston Peters, on Wednesday accused the Cooks' government of a role in defrauding governments in Australia, Japan and New Zealand of "untold millions" in tax revenue. It was done, he said, by dual bookkeeping -- issuing certificates to foreign companies saying they had paid withholding tax in the Cooks when, in fact, they had not. He said the Cooks pocketed a share of the money the companies saved by not paying tax in their home countries. "Put simply, the government of the Cook Islands collects tax but gives it back to the favoured and malevolent few," he declared. Corrupt officials in Australia, New Zealand and the Cook Islands were responsible for the system, he charged. Peters' attack followed similar allegations made in Rarotonga, the islands' capital, on March 2 by Richard McDonald, former director of the Cooks' government auditing, and who is now an opposition candidate in general elections next Thursday. Cooks Prime Minister Sir Geoffrey Henry denies any corruption involved in his country's status as a tax haven. "Our position has been and will continue to be that there has been no false certificates issued," he said. But another politician, opposition Cooks' Alliance leader Norman George who was once in Sir Geoffrey's cabinet, made no sec@et the whole rationale of the operation was to make money by helping people not pay taxes in other countries. "The more revenue we get the easier it is on the other (Cooks) taxpayers -- we do not want to break laws to get it but if we can do it legally then it we should," George said. The ruling National Party successfully prevented Peters on 16 previous occasions from tabling papers that he says prove his claim. But this time, the party in a tactical blunder forgot to raise the necessary oral objection to his production of papers. Known as the "wine box" papers, for the way they first arrived in New Zealand, they are internal documents of Hong Kong-based European Pacific International (EPI). EPI is a mysterious organisation whose activities are closely protected by the Cook Islands laws, and it is believed to be the vehicle for encouraging and channelling corporate funds int@ the tax haven. It was founded by Australian David Lloyd who, with Sir Geoffrey, established the Cooks' offshore banking in 1981. EPI's New Zealand representative David Lloyd rebutted any suggestion of wrongdoing, saying the company had at all times worked within the laws of countries where it does business. At the same time, however, he angrily attacked Peters for tabling "confidential" documents that, he said, had been "stolen" from the company. In a further development Thursday, an arm of EPI, the European Pacific Trust Co., won a court order in Rarotonga preventing another opposition group, the Democratic Party, from using "specified documents" related to the controversy, the party said. EPI, contending that publication of the documents would do enormous harm to the Cooks, has also taken court action to gag three New Zealand media outlets from publishing them.
