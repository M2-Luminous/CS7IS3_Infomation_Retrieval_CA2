[Ljubijankic] The situation is getting worse every day. The Serbian forces have never respected their pledges, despite the international pressure on them. Acts of genocide are continuing intensively every day as well as the ethnic cleansing and the organized rape of Bosnian women in violation of all international norms and charters. The Serbs' siege of our people is continuing while the international community refuses to lift the arms embargo imposed on us so that we can defend ourselves. There are still innumerable excesses despite the efforts of the UN peacekeeping forces in Sarajevo. The UN forces have not succeeded yet in stopping the bloody battles waged by the Serbs or the violations being perpetrated against us, especially the massacres and the killing and displacement of children, women, and old people. [Al-'Ishari] Are you satisfied with the role and performance of the Islamic and Arab countries in support of the Bosnian people? What is your assessment of the role of the Egyptian forces in Sarajevo as part of the UN forces? [Ljubijankic] Yes. We have been completely satisfied with the Islamic and Arab countries' role and their support and backing for our people and our cause from the first day that the battles and events erupted here. Some Islamic countries and organizations, led by the Islamic Conference Organization, have played a major role in supporting our cause and exposing the Serbs' crimes and violations before world public opinion. Moreover, some Islamic countries hastened to give material and humanitarian aid to our forces and people. Foremost among these countries is Egypt, whose forces are participating with the UN forces. As to the Egyptian forces' role in Sarajevo, it is much admired and appreciated by the Bosnian people, who are proud of having these troops among the UN forces. [passage omitted] [Al-'Ishari] What are the reasons for your country's hesitant acceptance of the cease-fire agreements, particularly the recent ones, as demanded by the United Nations? [Ljubijankic] We have never hesitated or rejected a UN demand for a cease-fire but have always had reservations about such demands. We feared that the Serbs would legitimize their occupation of territories in Bosnia and impose the fait accompli by force through our acceptance of the recently announced truce. We rejected this and conveyed our stand to the two international meditators and the UN envoy to Sarajevo. We frankly said that our acceptance of the European peace plan is contingent on confirmation of the return of all the Bosnian refugees who have fled from their cities and houses under the pressure of Serbian attacks. The refugees' return represents one of our most important conditions for accepting the peace plan. If the refugees return, then this would mean rejection of the seizure of the territories of others by force and recognition of the Bosnians' right to their territories and cities. The problem will be solved when this is done. [passage omitted] [Al-'Ishari] Are you expecting to see peace established in Bosnia in 1994? [Ljubijankic] [passage omitted] I personally do not expect to see the peace that we are seeking achieved in 1994 so quickly and for several reasons. There are so far no clear bases or an influential power that can convince the Serbs to respond to the voice of reason and peace and sign the comprehensive peace agreement. We in Bosnia would be happy if the Serbs abandoned the notion of establishing their expansionist state by force or if a Serbian figure convinced of the need for a dialogue with the Bosnian leaders were to emerge. At the same time, we categorically reject any conditions imposed on us by force. Such a policy has proved to be a failure and will not bear fruit as some quarters believe. On the contrary, it will only stiffen our stand because right is on our side and we have not usurped the territories of others by force.
