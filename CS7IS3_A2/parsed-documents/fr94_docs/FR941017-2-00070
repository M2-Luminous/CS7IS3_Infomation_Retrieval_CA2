ACTION: Draft Statement of Policy: Extension of Comment Period. SUMMARY: On August 5, 1994 (59 FR 40058), the Nuclear Regulatory Commission published for public comment a draft proposed policy statement on the Agreement States Program. The draft policy statement establishes Agreement State program principles, and describes the respective roles and responsibilities of the NRC and the States in the administration of this program, which is authorized by Section 274 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended. Agreement States are States which have assumed regulatory authority from NRC over the possession and use of certain radioactive materials. The draft document is an ``umbrella'' policy statement which will serve as broad guidance in delineating the NRC's and the State's respective responsibilities and expectations. The comment period for this draft policy statement expired on October 4, 1994. The NRC has been requested to extend the comment period and has decided to grant the request. Therefore, the comment period has been extended. The extended comment period now expires on December 19, 1994. DATES: The comment period has been extended and now expires December 19, 1994. Comments received after this date will be considered if it is practical to do so but the Commission is able to assure consideration only for comments received before this date.
