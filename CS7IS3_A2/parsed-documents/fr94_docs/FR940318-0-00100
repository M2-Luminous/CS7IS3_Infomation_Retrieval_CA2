ACTION: Immediate final rule. SUMMARY: Mississippi has applied for final authorization of revisions to its hazardous waste program under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). Mississippi's revisions consist of the provisions contained in HSWA Cluster I except checklist 17L Corrective Action and checklist 17P Interim Status. These requirements are listed in section B of this notice. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has reviewed Mississippi's application and has made a decision, subject to public review and comment, that Mississippi's hazardous waste program revisions satisfy all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization. Thus, EPA intends to approve Mississippi's hazardous waste program revisions. Mississippi's application for program revisions is available for public review and comment. DATES: Final authorization for Mississippi's program revisions shall be effective May 17, 1994 unless EPA publishes a prior Federal Register action withdrawing this immediate final rule. All comments on Mississippi's program revision application must be received by the close of business, April 18, 1994. ADDRESSES: Copies of Mississippi's program revision application are available during 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. at the following addresses for inspection and copying: Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality, 2380 Highway 80 West, P.O.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background States with final authorization under section 3006(b) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (``RCRA'' or ``the Act''), 42 U.S.C. 6926(b), have a continuing obligation to maintain a hazardous waste program that is equivalent to, consistent with, and no less stringent than the Federal hazardous waste program. In addition, as an interim measure, the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (Pub. L. 98&hyph;616, November 8, 1984, hereinafter ``HSWA'') allows States to revise their programs to become substantially equivalent instead of equivalent to RCRA requirements promulgated under HSWA authority. States exercising the latter option receive ``interim authorization'' for the HSWA requirements under section 3006(g) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6926(g), and later apply for final authorization for the HSWA requirements. Revisions to State hazardous waste programs are necessary when Federal or State statutory or regulatory authority is modified or when certain other changes occur. Most commonly, State program revisions are necessitated by changes to EPA's regulations in 40 CFR parts 124, 260 through 268 and 270. B. Mississippi Mississippi initially received final authorization for its base RCRA program effective on June 27, 1984. Mississippi received authorization for revisions to its program on October 17, 1988, October 9, 1990, May 28, 1991, August 27, 1991, July 10, 1992, June 7, 1993, and December 20, 1993. On October 26, 1989, and November 25, 1992, Mississippi submitted a program revision application for additional program approvals. Today, Mississippi is seeking approval of its program revisions in accordance with 40 CFR 271.21(b)(3).
