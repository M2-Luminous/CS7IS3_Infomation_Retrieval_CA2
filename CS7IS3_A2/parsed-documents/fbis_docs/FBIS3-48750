We must administer social reform, improve the people's life, and apply real democracy in society. Mass motivation is the mobilization of all people's forces, not leaving anyone out, to create a force of the entire people to carry out all necessary works." (Ho Chi Minh Collected Works, Volume 5, page 299) The undertaking of making the population prosperous, the nation strong, and society civilized and just and the protection of national independence and sovereignty is the work of all people. In understanding this leading idea, at present, we must realize that the construction of a law-governed state of the people, by the people, and for the people; the economic development and the social stabilization; the harmonious combination of a strong economic development with the settlement of social issues; the combination of economic development with the strengthening of national defense and the broadening of foreign relations; the development of an internal and external open-door commodity economies to integrate into the world economy with different economic sectors under the state management; and the implementation of a multilateral and diversified foreign policy to be friends will all nations on the principles of respecting one another's national independence, sovereignty, equality, cooperation, and mutual benefits is the duty of all people. This duty requires a widespread public movement to satisfactorily carry it out. The noble and final goal of the party is to serve the people's interests. The leadership of the party is the concentration of the people's willpower, aspiration, and intelligence to outline the developing path and steps and to educate, organize, and change the mass organizations into great forces to practice the people's right to mastery and to carry out the aforementioned noble goal. The law-governed state of the people, by the people, and for the people introduces laws to regulate the political, economic, social, national defense, security, and external affairs activities for the interests of the fatherland and the public. It creates favorable conditions for the people to practice and develop their rights to mastery, improve the material and spiritual life of their families, contribute to the common undertaking of the society, achieve happiness for themselves, and respect other people's freedom and happiness. To mobilize human and natural resources to implement the party and state's policy, line, and law for the undertaking of national construction and protection, the people must be organized into different mass organizations. These organizations must really become political foundation and bases of the party, state, and public forces, working for a common interest. For that reason, the Sixth Plenum of the party Central Committee issued a resolution on the mass motivation work with a fundamental idea as follows: In the new stage of the revolution, to make the revolution the people's undertaking, the party, state, and mass organizations must achieve high results in their mass motivation work. They must not look down on any social forces. Only from the continuous perfection of the division and coordination of the mass motivation content and work scale between the party, state, and mass organizations and with the development of a combined strength from all the forces, can we create great strength for the mass motivation work. The mass motivation work is a permanent, strategic, and fundamental duty of the party. From this fundamental conception, we must think profoundly and review our practical results to clarify and unify our conceptions to revamp the work content and method of the fatherland front and mass organizations in the new stage. Thoroughly understanding this, together with the implementation of Uncle Ho's teachings and party's resolutions, the government and mass organizations have been improving the people's daily life and creating favorable conditions to generate more jobs, increase people's earnings, secure living conditions, foster patriotism, eliminate old structures, and actively contribute, build, perfect, and execute our renovation and socioeconomic policies. Our socioeconomic situation, albeit great challenges, is gaining good developing momentum and scoring important socioeconomic achievements. In 1993, most of socioeconomic targets were overfulfilled. These achievements regain the confidence in the party and its renovation undertaking from the people, making them more active in the movements for the increase of business, production, and social activities. That is the result of the satisfactory implementation of party resolutions, including the important Resolution No. 8 of the sixth party plenum. However, facing new requirements, we must continue to practically and profoundly review exemplary models to upgrade the mass motivation work to its new duties. 1. Strengthening the party leadership is an important factor to accelerate activities of the fatherland front, mass organizations, and public movements. The party performs its mass motivation work through guidelines and policies. Correct policies will create a great strength for public movements. For example, the correct policy of contractual system in agriculture has motivated peasants to increase agricultural production. The party must regularly listen to public opinions to quickly correct and amend its policies. The party considers the guidance and motivation of the public for the construction of a law-governed state of the people, by the people, and for the people is the foremost duty of the mass motivation work in the new stage. It also creates favorable conditions to motivate the public to carry out the party's political duty and line. The party chapters and members working in the state organs must concretize the party's line and resolutions into government's decisions and policies. Through work experience and training, the party assigns good citizens with good morality, a sense of professionalism, and social management skills to government positions to maintain national order and counter waste and corruption. The party directs the National Assembly elections adequately in order to choose highly qualified and competent deputies to represent the people's will and aspirations as well as the common interests of the nation as a whole. It directs the formulation and perfection of laws, regulations, policies, citizens' rights and duties, statutes, and practices at grassroots installations. It guides the establishment of administrative organs at all levels, keeping in mind the need to streamline their personnel organization to make them neat and effective and avoid overlapping work and delays, which cause obstacles and inconveniences for the people. It is necessary to make use of party papers and other party propaganda instruments to propagate the party's policies and lines among the masses and motivate everyone to implement all party resolutions. It is important to step up educational activities to promote public awareness of false arguments and foil attempts by hostile forces to distort the truth and implement their peaceful evolution strategy. The party directs the front and mass societies by helping them formulate their orientations, guidelines, objectives, and tasks. The party does not exert direct leadership over work implementation. Instead, it uses the activities of party groups and party members assigned to each organization to fulfill its leadership role and apply its resolutions to the practical action programs of the front and mass societies. Each organization should be given the chance to hold democratic discussions to decide on the content of its action program. Through their separate guidelines and control work, party committee echelons discover and develop progressive elements in production and business organizations, as well as in special task force units and mass societies. It is necessary to assign party cadres and members to oversee or take part in the activities of mass societies so as to assess the actual situations of each organization, family, and individual, and thereby work out appropriate assistance programs. The action programs of party organizations must include the orientations and tasks of mass societies. Arrangements must be made for party committee echelons and party committee secretaries to meet periodically with the people to hear grievances and resolve problems. Party members must not only take the lead in fulfilling the tasks of the units they are assigned to, but must also set a good example of high quality and ethics for members of other organizations to follow. Party members must go out of their way to serve the people and must always stand ready to direct and learn from the masses. Let them hold discussions with the people and help them make their legitimate aspirations come true. It is important to revamp party organizations; screen the contingent of party members; and get rid of opportunistic, corrupt, and deviant elements. It is necessary to put an end to unreasonable favors and privileges. Constant efforts must be made to build and develop the Ho Chi Minh Communist Youth Union. Practical measures must be taken to accelerate party-building work among the youth, and to ensure that this task receives close guidance. Party committee echelons in charge of providing guidance for mass motivation work have a fundamental duty to closely link party building -- especially the building of grass-roots party organizations -- with the building of the administration and mass organizations. Mass motivation work must be carried out in conjunction with and through the implementation of specific political tasks. 2. Our state is a law-governing state of the people, by the people, and for the people. Therefore, it has a very heavy duty toward the cause of mass motivation. President Ho Chi Minh said: "Administrative cadres, mass organization cadres, and members of the various mass organizations such as the Lien Viet [Vietnamese Alliance], the Viet Minh [Vietnamese Independence League], and others must all be responsible for mass motivation work." (Su That newspaper, 15 October 1949). President Ho put mass motivation work on top of other activities of the administration. This is because when there is a ruling party, public administration will become a main function of the state and will be carried out by means of laws and policies. In the same token, the state must carry out mass motivation mainly by means of laws and policies. These laws and policies must reflect party policies and lines and must be compatible with the people's aspirations and interests. They must become a tremendous driving force for the mass movement. The state's working mechanism must create favorable conditions and environment legislatively, economically, politically, culturally, and socially, and in terms of national security and development so the people can feel secure in doing their business and can take the initiative in developing their production and business and organizing their own material and cultural life. We must work out a correct system of laws, creating conditions for the people to carry out their production and business, broaden their branches and trades, and enrich themselves legally. Earlier, the government was anxious about finding enough food for the people to subsist on. Now it is concerned about the question of how to clear up the surplus foodgrain and how to produce high quality rice for export. The pace of house construction and of neighborhood and urban renovation among the people has been very fast, far beyond the imagination of many people. The administration must work out substantive policies and systems for various areas of work in a correct and flexible way capable of keeping the people's activities under control. The party and various mass organizations must also participate in the supervision of this issue. The state must spread explanatory propaganda on the laws so the people can clearly understand and comply with them. Satisfactorily resolving various issues -- such as the issue of "doing away with hunger and easing poverty;" the issue of maintaining public order and security; the issue of education, public health, and culture; the issue of caring for those with meritorious deeds, for the families of disabled soldiers and fallen heroes, and for retired cadres; and the issue of caring for and providing assistance to people in dire straits -- by the administration at all levels is also part of our mass motivation work. Attention must be paid to various organizations at the village, ward, and hamlet levels such as urban household groups which are the lowest organizations in close contact with the people. Such a self- governing popular organization, which controls not more than 15 families, is an appropriate and effective format which is designed to control each family and each group of families while caring for the life of people and resolving problems relating to the people in compliance with the resolutions and policies of the party Central Committee and the government. The administration must use the mass media sysem to carry out its mass motivation work. The mass media is a highly sensitive and effective tool of the party and the state for carrying out mass motivation work. We must expand our radio and television transmission signals, especially radio transmission signals, to many localities in order to bring messages of the central authority to households. The party must direct mass organizations to join with the government in satisfactorily stepping up the activities of the mass media in the right direction. Schools must be places where people are educated and trained to become educated persons with good ethical qualities. Teachers of both sexes must be active cadres in mass motivation, trying to build good people. We must bear in mind the need to improve the qualities of the education sector so it can become an effective tool for mass motivation. We must use the people's Armed Forces to carry out mass motivation work in various areas, particularly in remote and mountain areas.
