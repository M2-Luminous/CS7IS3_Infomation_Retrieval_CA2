Livshits told a press conference here today that the distinguishing feature of the situation is that the inflation rate has been relatively moderate over the past four months, which brought down the inflation expectations of the population, and no production slump was registered in the first half of June from May. "It was necessary to make full use of this circumstance," the economist stressed. Aleksandr Livshits said the reaction to the economic decrees in Moscow and the country as a whole was "restrained but positive". The decrees are not ideal, particularly those among them which call for more discipline, Livshits admitted. But few people have rejected them out right. As concerns statements about the unconstitutional character of some provisions, Livshits noted that some of the documents deal with problems which are not covered by federal legislation at all. It is possible that some provisions may be at variance with legislation but "none of the decrees transcends the boundaries of the president's message on the state of the nation which was supported by the State Duma", or the boundaries of the obligations assumed by the president and the government under the Treaty on Civic Accord. He also pointed out that the use of decrees "to boost reforms is a forced measure," but the president had "displayed patience long enough". If the State Duma steps up activity in law making, there will be no need for presidential decrees at all, Livshits said. It would be ideal to have the presidential decrees "dissolved" in subsequent federal laws. Livshits drew particular attention to the decree concerning the activity of foreign banks in Russia. He described it as "the most dramatic of them all", and the story of its preparation as "a plot for an interesting tale". The question was not whether to let foreign banks into Russia but when and what terms. There is no indicator of the most appropriate time, it is a question of political intuition. "It was necessary to sense the almost invisible edge to walk on", without infringing on the rights of either foreign or Russian banks. According to Livshits, the choice was made correctly. The decree allows five or six foreign banks, which already have licenses, to begin operations in Russia from July this year instead of January 1, 1996. As concerns new licencing, decisions on this will be made by the Central Bank of Russia, depending on the conditions one or another country provides for Russian banks. On the whole, the agrement on partnership and cooperation between Russia and the European Union, which will be signed soon, will "clear up considerably" the problem of relations with foreign banks. In the field of the taxation policy, Livshits said, a tougher tax paying discipline will be enforced ("this decree will meet with most resistance," Livshits said). All tax benefits will be annulled, and the enterprises will be prohibited from settling accounts in cash, which enable them to evade taxation.
