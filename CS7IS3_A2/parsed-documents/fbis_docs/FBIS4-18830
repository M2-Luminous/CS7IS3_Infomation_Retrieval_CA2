How is the evacuation going on? [Roussin] I would add that the prime minister is also following the situation closely. He kept very well informed from Peking, and urged us to speed up the process we have begun. The evacuation of French nationals is continuing. It began yesterday evening. Things are quite complicated. We are very worried about the situation in Kigali, but we were able to collect people in their homes, assemble them at a number of meeting points in the capital, and then transfer them to the airport along roads which our paratroopers control -- there are just over 500 of them, not 400 as you said in an earlier report. [Correspondent] Just over 150 French nationals have left Rwanda. There are about 450 left? [Roussin] Yes, 450 are left, but we will also probably have a role to play in looking after the 1,500 Belgians, the 300 Americans, and the 200 plus other Europeans. There is also a large Italian community. [Correspondent] There are just over 3,000 foreign nationals in Rwanda? [Roussin] Yes, something like that. [Correspondent] Are you confident that the French and the others be able to leave this country? [Roussin] Yes, I am confident, because the operation is working well. Our capacity allows us to evacuate the people we are assembling at the airport very quickly. We have sufficient air capacity. We have Belgian air capacity in reserve. The Americans are in Bujumbura. A plane is on its way from Italy. So we have been the spearhead of this operation, which is a protective, a security, a humanitarian operation. We are very committed to it. [Correspondent] You say this is a protective operation. The rebels have asked you to remain neutral. Will you remain neutral? [Roussin] France has always been neutral in the conflict which for years has set Hutus and Tutsis. in opposition to each other. It is thanks to us that these two ethnic groups got round the table at Arusha in Tanzania last August. We have always done everything to ensure the return of calm to Rwanda. War has broken out again, and the Rwandans will have to deal with this, stopping the massacres, ensuring the return of peace, signing a cease-fire. France will always be present if it is asked, but this action is just a security action to evacuate our compatriots. [Correspondent] If the rebels were to enter Kigali, would the French remain absolutely neutral? [Roussin] Absolutely. Our only mission is to ensure the protection and the evacuation of our compatriots. [Correspondent] You spoke of massacres. Have there really been tens of thousands of dead as has been claimed? [Roussin] There have been massacres. Information at our disposal from witnesses in Rwanda indicates that there have been massacres. [Correspondent] Thank you Michel Roussin.
