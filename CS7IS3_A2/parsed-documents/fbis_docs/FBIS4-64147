Law on International Treaties Passed in First Reading"] [Text] Yesterday the State Duma considered and passed in the first reading the draft Law on International Treaties of the Russian Federation. The draft of the same name once sparked a lengthy discussion at the Supreme Soviet, which was centered primarily on whether the parliament is entitled to ratify and annul international treaties at its discretion or whether it has necessarily to wait for the executive branch's presentation. At the time, the Supreme Soviet effectively agreed for the first time to look for a compromise with its opponents from the Foreign Ministry and the presidential main political administration, but then came 21 September. Yesterday, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Krylov told deputies about the main provisions of the draft law: for instance, about Article 15, which contains a list of international treaties subject to mandatory ratification, and Article 16, which describes the procedure for making proposals regarding ratification, and so forth. The deputies' questions to the deputy minister focused for the most part on a period of time within which draft laws on ratification must be submitted to the State Duma. An attempt was also made to find out why a number of treaties (START-2 and the Treaty with Georgia), which were signed, but not ratified, have effectively been not adhered to. Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the State Duma International Affairs Committee, delivered a co-report, saying that after some additional work on the draft law it can rather be considered a parliamentary than presidential one. Mr. Lukin recommended that the draft be approved in the first reading. He noted, however, that the draft does have drawbacks: Since the act of ratification must be formalized by a law, other authorities aside from the president and the government, the State Duma for instance, can also sponsor them; it has not been specified who in Russia can object to reservations made by other signatories to the treaties (Mr. Lukin made sure that the Federal Assembly must have the right to do so); the list of treaties subject to mandatory ratification is also far from complete. Mr. Lukin pointed out that all his concerns can be met by four amendments that the committee proposed to approve in one vote together with the draft law, which is what the State Duma did without further debate, although State Duma members who formerly were Supreme Soviet deputies vainly attempted to provoke a discussion and to raise its temperature.
