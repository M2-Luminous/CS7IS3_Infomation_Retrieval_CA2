Speaking after meeting Minister of Foreign Affairs Pik Botha, Mr Azuma said Japan regarded southern Africa as the most promising African region. South Africa was a key state and it was therefore important that the April 27 elections be a success, he said, and all parties should participate. "In that respect Japan wishes to do whatever it can to help so that can happen," Mr Azuma said. Mr Botha said he was looking forward to a further improvement in relations with Japan. Mr Azuma will also meet senior African National Congress officials and representatives of the United Nations and other international organisations during his visit to discuss roles to be played by the international community in the elections. His tour of southern African countries is the first follow-up step to be taken after the Tokyo international conference on African development last year.
