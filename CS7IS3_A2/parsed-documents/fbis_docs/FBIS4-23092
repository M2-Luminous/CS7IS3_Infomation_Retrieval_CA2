Beijing Welcomes MFN Decision, Sees Little Impact on Ties Beijing Welcomes MFN Decision, Sees Little Impact on Ties SUMMARY Although welcoming President Clinton's decision renewing China's most-favored-nation (MFN) trading status and delinking the annual MFN review from the human rights issue, Beijing has been reserved in assessing the prospects for Sino-U.S. ties, suggesting that the U.S. decision to retain sanctions and Washington's stance on human rights remain obstacles to better ties. While Beijing has indicated its willingness to work to improve bilateral relations, it has given no indication of flexibility in meeting U.S. concerns on human rights and other issues. END SUMMARY Following the pattern set during last year's MFN debate, Beijing reacted to the President's 26 May decision by issuing an authoritative Foreign Ministry statement as well as a lower-level statement by a spokesman from the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation. Although predictably "welcoming" the President's decision, the 27 May statements--which were virtually identical in content--suggested that the decision would not lead to an immediate improvement in Sino-U.S. relations (Xinhua, 27 May). Reflecting this reserved appraisal of the prospects for bilateral ties, the Foreign Ministry statement said only that the decision would create "favorable conditions" for the "further strengthening and expansion" of trade and economic ties and for the "overall growth" of the relationship. The statement went on to suggest that obstacles remain to improved Sino-U.S. relations, describing the President's decision to retain Washington's "existing sanctions" against China and what it claimed were "unwarranted charges" by the "U.S. side" concerning China's human rights situation as "detrimental" to the development of bilateral ties. The statement also reaffirmed the Chinese position, frequently voiced in PRC media before the MFN renewal decision, that while China desires better ties with the United States, the burden for improving bilateral relations rests with Washington. Pointing out that a "historic opportunity" now exists to "enhance" Sino- U.S. relations, the statement said that Beijing will "continue to make major efforts" to achieve this goal and "hopes" that the U.S. Government will adopt a "realistic and forward-looking stand" and "take concerted action to show its sincerity for enhancing relations." In particular, the statement said the relationship will enjoy "smooth and healthy progress" if both sides follow China's longstanding prescription for better relations and "strictly abide" by the "guidelines and principles" of the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques, "enhance mutual trust, reduce troubles, develop cooperation, and refrain from confrontation." Sparse Leadership Comment Perhaps reflecting some uncertainty over how to respond to the shift in the administration's China policy, Chinese leaders, unlike last year, have generally refrained from commenting on the decision. For example, meeting with the president of a U.S. securities corporation on 2 June, Premier Li Peng, according to a Xinhua account of the meeting, made no mention of the decision, even though the U.S. visitor reportedly said that his corporation was "very pleased" with the renewal of China's MFN status (2 June). Vice President Rong Yiren was also restrained in his comments on the decision at a meeting with the visitor on 2 June. He reportedly said that the decision was "wise" and "in line with the fundamental interests" of the two peoples and "beneficial to promoting Sino-U.S. trade and improving and developing" bilateral relations (Xinhua, 2 June). In keeping with this circumspect approach to the MFN decision, PRC central media have given scant attention to the President's decision. On 26 May Xinhua carried a report on the President's announcement that day which took note of the U.S. decision to ban the import of Chinese weapons and ammunition, the sanctions to be retained, as well as the administration's intention to step up "economic, cultural, and educational contacts." In the days immediately following the announcement, Xinhua reported subsequent remarks by the President explaining his decision and as well as accounts of remarks by Asian leaders and U.S. businessmen praising the decision. A 28 May commentary carried by Beijing radio's international English-language service to Western North America merely reported the President's announcement and replayed the PRC Foreign Ministry statement. Vocal Hong Kong Media PRC-owned Hong Kong media, however, have been vocal in portraying the decision as a vindication of Chinese foreign policy. A 27 May Hsin Wan Pao article, for example, suggested that China's "open and above-board approach" as well as its "opposition to U.S. pressures" had "forced the 'turn around'" in the administration's China policy and "finally solved" the "problem concerning trade" between the two countries. Similarly, a "special article" carried by Zhongguo Tongxun She, a PRC- affiliated Hong Kong-based press agency, said that the decision showed that Washington's previous policy of "using human rights to put pressure" on China had "failed," while "China's policy, 'with good reason, advantages, and restraint,' has gotten the upper hand in the present Sino-U.S. diplomatic dispute." The two PRC-owned Hong Kong dailies, Wen Wei Po and Ta Kung Pao, took a slightly different tack and discussed the potential impact of the decision on Sino-U.S. ties. A 28 May editorial in Wen Wei Po also suggested that the decision represented a vindication of China's foreign policy and noted that the President's decision to "change his hegemonist policy" and "adopt a long-range view" is an action "worth welcoming," predicting that a "comparatively pleasing trend is likely to surface in Sino-U.S. relations in the second half of the year." By contrast, Ta Kung Pao, while welcoming the decision, suggested that obstacles remain to better bilateral ties. For example, well-placed commentator Shih Chun- yu said in his 28 May column that only if the human rights issue, which he called a "hindrance to relations," is removed will the "development of Sino-U.S. relations embark on a new and easy path." A day later, veteran Ta Kung Pao commentator Kung Yao-wen took an even more pessimistic view of Sino-U.S. relations in the wake of the decision, asserting that because of continuing problems over human rights, trade, Tibet, and Taiwan, it is "unlikely that the United States will rapidly improve its ties with China." Outlook While viewing the President's decision renewing China's MFN status and delinking the annual MFN review from human rights as a positive step toward improving bilateral relations, Beijing has made it clear that China's position of opposition to U.S. efforts to aggressively address China's human rights situation remains unchanged. Moreover, because of continuing concerns about domestic stability, Beijing, buoyed by what it sees as the success of its hardline foreign policy, may be less likely to take a flexible line in addressing other issues of concern to the United States in order to improve bilateral ties.
