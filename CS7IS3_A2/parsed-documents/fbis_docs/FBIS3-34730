The court describes the uprising against the ISA as a rebellion and its perpetrators as rebels. According to a report by Bakhtar Information Agency, the leadership and officials of the Supreme Court of the ISA held a session at the headquarters of the Supreme Court yesterday. In the meeting they insisted that because the president of the ISA has been elected by the Resolution and Settlement Council, and later this election was approved under different agreements by leaders and jihadi parties or their representatives, obedience to him is the Islamic duty of all citizens of the country. As a high judicial source of the country, the Supreme Court supports the order of the president for jihad against the infamous triangle of Karmal-Dostam-Golboddin, and it asks our all faithful people to take part in this holy jihad.
