Without well planned and effective precautions, national development will be obstructed and delayed while businesses and trade with foreign countries will be adversely affected. Based on our observation, changes in three areas will take place in the near future. They are: First, the launching of the "Thaicom" satellite which, as everyone knows, will greatly benefit Thai society. Second, the introduction of an fiber optic cable into telephone service which will be tremendously beneficial to telecommunication facilities. Third, the promulgation of the new international investment and trade regulations under the "GATT" agreement in which Thailand is also a signatory. Under the "GATT" agreement, the structure and system of trade and investment will have to be significantly readjusted. It is imperative that the government clearly explain as well as give sufficient knowledge to the people so as to enable them to be fully prepared in advance to cope with possible impacts. Educational institutions should also disseminate necessary information and knowledge to their students because we will certainly be unable to avoid the consequences. Also under the "GATT" agreement, the United States will play a role in trade and investment in this country. Aside from telecommunications, the United States is likely to get more involved in other businesses. The United States particularly has been pressing for the liberalization of banking business in this country. Two events which took place in the past week gave us some hint about the U.S. stand in this connection. On 5 February, David Lambertson, U.S. ambassador to Thailand, and Colonel Chinnawut Sunthonsima, minister attached to the Prime Minister's Office, jointly opened the "Development Partnership" program under which the United States has agreed to provide 225 million baht for environmental development and AIDS prevention. [passage omitted] Another event is the 3 February announcement on the lifting of the U.S. trade embargo against Vietnam. [passage omitted] The two cited events indicate the U.S. role and expectations in Thailand and the Indochinese region. Naturally, the United States intends profit more here. However, if it is true that the United States is pressing for the liberalization of banking business to allow its commercial banks to operate in this country, the government must treat this matter as important as other major issues such as relations between the two countries. The government must work out necessary measures to cope with the situation as a result of the enforcement of the new "GATT" regulations.
