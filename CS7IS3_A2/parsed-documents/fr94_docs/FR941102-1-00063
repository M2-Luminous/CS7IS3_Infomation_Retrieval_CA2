ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: This document recommends changes in the Federal milk marketing orders for five north-central marketing areas based on industry proposals considered at a public hearing. The decision recommends adopting a plan for pricing milk on the basis of its protein and other nonfat solids, as well as butterfat, components. The proposed plan includes adjustments per hundredweight of all producer milk based on the somatic cell count of the milk. The intended effect of this rule is to better reflect the value of the nonfat solids components in the skim portion of milk. DATES: Comments are due on or before December 2, 1994.
