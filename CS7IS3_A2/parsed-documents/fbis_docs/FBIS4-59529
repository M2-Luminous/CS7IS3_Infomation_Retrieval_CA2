Days pass and the war continues to dispel the illusions of those who ignited it and believed that it would only last for some hours or two days at the most because of what the leaders of this war said at the time. The circle of destruction is widening as well as pain and suffering affecting our country and homeland all of which threaten the unity of the country and its stability. Despite the appeals of the presidents and kings of the fraternal Arab countries and the leaders of many countries in the world, in addition to the pleas of international organizations and national leaders to stop this war and submit to the language of dialogue, the influential bloody gang in Sanaa disdainfully rejected them. This is because that bloodthirsty gang continues to ignore all those appeals and initiatives and boasts about its insistence to continue the march over a river of blood and over the skulls of soldiers and citizens [words indistinct]. The Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] has shown a (?positive) response to the appeals and initiatives of brothers and friends to (?end) this war on the basis of rejecting the principle of force to settle differences. The YSP initiative announced yesterday (?calling) for the war to cease came from its realization of the gravity of bloodshed, the destruction of towns, installations and the armed forces. When the YSP politburo rejects the war, and is concerned about ending the bloodletting of people and soldiers, and responds to the appeals and initiatives of the leaders of fraternal and friendly countries, it does so not because it is weak, but because it has a profound belief in the need to prevent Yemen from suffering the continuation of this destructive and bloody war which cannot be confined to a part of the shores and mountains of Yemen. Indeed, its flames will spread to include all the towns, shores, mountains and valleys of the homeland without any exception. The YSP, as it responded to the appeals and initiatives of the leaders of states and fraternal and friendly governments who called for an end to the fighting, was fully aware that Arab countries, as well as the international community, would voice their stand with regard to those who refused to respond to the initiatives which embodied the realization of the leaders of fraternal and friendly countries about the necessity to stop this bloody war and its destructive effects on the unity and progress of Yemen. Those who believed this war would end in hours or a few days and conducted themselves accordingly in the arrogant manner of invaders and conquerors, ought to realize well that this war will not end if they want to continue it. They will bear the historic responsibility and the high price which the people and the homeland will have to pay due to their insistence in continuing this war in which nobody will be the winner. We appeal to all the good forces in Yemen and the neighboring countries, all the fraternal Arab and friendly countries and all those with consciences in the world to continue their efforts to convince the bloodthirsty to submit to reason and end the hysteria. The politburo confirms that it rejects the war and welcomes all Arab and international initiatives and appeals to end it. It will not submit to the superciliousness and arrogance of those who insist to continue the war and destroy the unity of the country under the cover of legitimacy. Those who wish to continue to ignore the appeals of reason and conscience and the necessity to stop this war must bear the responsibility of continued bloodshed, banishment of families, destruction of towns, killing of innocents, and the destruction of the Armed Forces. They must realize that if they have opted for war as a means of imposing hegemony and annexation and if they also opt to ignore the initiatives and appeals of the good forces which reject the war in Yemen, the Arab homeland, and the world, they will not be able to choose a definite place for this war and impose it on us. When war is ignited, it burns where it wills. When the spark of war is not extinguished, then that spark will change to fire and ultimately hell. Those who have committed injustice will get their just rewards. God has spoken the truth.
