FBIS4-56986 "drlat091_t_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-091 Daily Report 10 May 1994 Venezuela President Acknowledges Economic Problems President Acknowledges Economic Problems PA1105040094 Caracas EL UNIVERSAL in Spanish 10 May 94 p 1-10 PA1105040094 Caracas EL UNIVERSAL Spanish BFN [Text] During a businessmen's dinner commemorating the 50th anniversary of Fedecamaras [Venezuelan Federation of Associations and Chambers of Commerce and Industry], President Rafael Caldera said "for the private sector of the Venezuelan economy, a public official who steals money through the construction of public works is as reprehensible as a member of the private sector who purchases dollars at the Central Bank of Venezuela to resell them for an illegal profit, or he is as reprehensible as a businessman who raises prices astronomically under the pretext of inflation because this will increase social groups' exasperation." The president believes it is necessary to understand this and reach an agreement of solidarity "because when a salesman disproportionately increases prices ahead of time, based on a report that inflation may affect a specific sector of the economy, he is engaging in an act of corruption against which we must all fight." Corruption has invaded all sectors of Venezuela, and we must struggle against this, not only for its effects in the public sector but also for its effects in the private sector, he said. During the event, the president said "the country is demanding a complete reorganization of public expenses, and this entails a long, in-depth, and very serious task that must be assigned to experienced people, but they must also have a social sensibility and be aware of the country's reality." Caldera said: "It is a fact we are facing very critical economic problems, and the Fedecamaras chairman has cited a particularly critical issue: A decrease in actual income for Venezuelan families. This presents a series of questions, and people often wonder about what economic policy my administration adopted. I could answer with a quote from Simon Bolivar, the liberator: A government's excellence does not reside in its theory; instead, it must be adequate for the nature of the country in which it is implemented." He said: "We do not believe, nor do we want to believe, in the implementation of a dogmatic policy, zero orthodoxy. We are prepared to accept all the recommendations, formulas, and solutions that are adequate for the current situation, the country's nature, and its advisability for the people." The head of state added that we are trying to overcome the nearest obstacles, including the terrible fiscal deficit that has compelled us to reduce public expenditures and strive to overcome, through various formulas in our revenues sector, the deficit provoked by a drop in oil revenues. Caldera explained the reduction in public expenditures had to be implemented in a short time "with a very complex budget in whose preparation we do not participate." He mentioned the so-called Sosa Plan, which includes tax reforms and "demands a special sacrifice from our fellow citizens. We know a tax on bank debits is a transitory burden; it is like the taxes that war economies establish in certain countries. They are essential for achieving a reasonable balance in the area of fiscal expenditures." President Caldera said: We have clearly announced and sustained that position, and we said it is part of a commitment that involves all Venezuelans: the struggle against inflation, the defeat of inflation, or at least its reduction to acceptable levels. It is a primary goal and not an aim per se. The president also mentioned the need to increase domestic and foreign private investments, and added "we are aware that in order to accomplish this, we must try to create the necessary conditions to attract these investments to our country." This, he added, undoubtedly demands safety, legal as well as genuine. We are taking great steps to improve, swiftly but also efficiently, the problem of individual and property safety. This is an essential objective not only of the central government but also of the regional and municipal governments. We are also aware that one of the obstacles to investments in any country is inadequate safety as provided by the legal system. He said he intends to present an initiative before Congress that includes reforms to the Constitution, reforms "such as the one that failed last year due to parliamentary details. The initiative includes in-depth reforms to the judicial branch that will allow corporations to operate without the need for a lot of paperwork. The judicial branch will intervene when the interests of the corporations do not correspond with those of the justice system or the Venezuelan people." Likewise, the president highlighted the importance of promulgating the Concessions Law because "we have great hope in that law, and we are preparing to launch several initiatives aimed at encouraging investors to take on risks through this concession system with certain guarantees." Caldera said his government is determined to encourage an awareness of tourism "because this sector offers great opportunities to our country in every aspect." He invited investors to invest in the country's tourism resorts. Caldera cited the need for a strong and effective industrial policy and pointed to the special commission established to recommend steps to be taken by the government to orient and stimulate the industrial sector. The country is willing to proceed with the process of privatization with regard to the Venezuelan Corporation of Guayana [CVG] and other industries dependent on this corporation. We are perfectly willing to enter into joint ventures. Caldera said the government is also disposed to encouraging investments in crude oil and gas ventures that may be beneficial to the country.
