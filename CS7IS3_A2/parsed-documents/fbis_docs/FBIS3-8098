PD(FSN) [Democratic Party-National Salvation Front]: "A PDSR government supported by the opposition is possible, but only on the basis of a well-defined political pact." PDSR [Social Democracy Party of Romania]: "A PDSR monocolor government is viable, but for no longer than six months." Last week's meeting of the CDR leaders projected an original, even thrilling, alternative to the forefront of the political arena by bearing in mind the savage post-revolutionary duels between those in power and those in the opposition: the possibility of a political pact between the main parliamentary blocs -- CDR, PD(FSN), and PDSR, with a view to supporting a monocolor, reformist government of the ruling party. It is more than obvious that in the current domestic and international situation, this offer of "smoking a peace pipe" would be, from several points of view, the best solution. What remains to be seen -- after the negotiations that will soon be held -- is to what extent this can be put into practice, because Romania's very future is at stake. Here are some opinions by a few leaders of the parties involved in this question: Emil Constantinescu, CDR president: "After more than two months of so-called negotiations, the PDSR has reached the conclusion that there is nothing to change and it is proposing a new minority government. Thus we are asking ourselves where is that national interest that even Mr. Adrian Nastase places above party interests, as he says? Only after the PDSR allies had launched an utterly irresponsible blackmail campaign by attacking basic state institutions and extending their vulgar actions to those in power, actions which up to then had served their interests through attacks on the opposition, did the ruling party announce that it might consider a reformist minority government. As far as we are concerned, we are not necessarily interested in participating in government at this time, but in applying the CDR program for coming out of the crisis. The only possible way is to discuss a tangible program with precise elements and deadlines. If we reach an understanding on this, we will be able to form a new parliamentary majority to support an efficient and competent government. Every drawer is full of programs; however, there has been no political will to apply them. And as a consequence of the activity of the current government, something very serious has happened: the political infiltration of the middle echelon! Even if we now came up with a competent government, it would be difficult for it to implement its program because of this middle echelon that has taken shape. Recent differences in the leftist wing have clearly demonstrated the infiltration in this echelon of antireform-oriented people. This is one of the most serious of Romania's problems at this time." Dinu Patriciu, vice president of the Liberal Party '93: "In no way will we support a PDSR government, because our objections are linked both to the program and to the competence of those whom the PDSR can appoint to the government. When I say competence, I mean it in its broader sense, that is resulting primarily from a certain mentality. And, through its origin and political actions, the PDSR has proved that the mentality of its people does not permit them to think politically in the sense of denationalization, decentralization, debureaucratization, and destablization. We have different aims, and thus we can only have different policies. A PDSR monocolor government would be a catastrophe! As far as Professor Emil Constantinescu's statement is concerned, it is of a personal nature and in no way the result of discussions within the CDR Executive Committee. My opinion is that such a government would not have the necessary parliamentary support. Cars that drive down the middle of the street are in the way of both those on the left and those on the right. Radu Al. Timofte, PDSR senator: A PDSR minority, monocolor government is as viable as can be but not for a long time. It could not last longer than six months unless a very serious pact is concluded with the other parliamentary parties and unless this pact is observed by its signatories. Ion Diaconescu, first vice president of the National Peasant Christian Democratic Party: During the Convention, we decided not to change the attitude that we have had so far, and to preserve our uncompromising stance. We will participate in government only if the PDSR renounces its monopoly on state power. As for parliamentary support, which the CDR and PD(FSN) could grant to a PDSR minority government, I can tell you only that we will support, as we have done so far, only those laws that in our view are objective, beneficial, and reformist, and we will reject the others. Within our alliance, however, there are reservations about a possible so-called opening by the current power toward the opposition." Adrian Severin, PD vice president: "When we talk about a viable PDSR government, I think that it has to be clear that we are not referring to the current government. We will not support a government against which we have supported two censure motions and two simple motions. A minority, monocolor PDSR government -- other than the Vacaroiu government -- supported by the current opposition, that is the CDR and PD, is possible, but only on the basis of an explicit political pact that will define the national interests, the ways and means to accelerate and intensify the reform process, the way to isolate extremist political forces and stop their access to the levers of power, as well as guarantees for the operation of democratic institutions. Such a formula does not mean a political alliance between the PDSR-CDR-PD, but just a way to cooperate at a time of crisis."
