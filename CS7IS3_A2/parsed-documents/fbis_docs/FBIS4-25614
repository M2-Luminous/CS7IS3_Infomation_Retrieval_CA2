On behalf of the autonomous regional people's congress standing committee, Puqung delivered a work report in which he discussed at length the work carried out by the autonomous regional people's congress standing committee since the First Session of the Sixth Tibet Autonomous Regional People's Congress, as well as the major tasks to be carried out over the next year. The report stated: Since the First Session of the Sixth Autonomous Regional People's Congress, the autonomous regional people's congress standing committee has, in accordance with the resolution passed at that session and under the autonomous regional party committee's leadership, actively advanced the drive toward establishing a socialist market economic structure, performed its constitutional and legal functions, and made new headway in all fields of work on the basis of work carried out by previous standing committees, while focusing on the central task of economic construction. In the space of over a year, it held nine regular meetings in accordance with the law, deliberated 17 work reports, enacted six regional laws and regulations, adopted six resolutions, and appointed or removed 188 government functionaries. Last year, the autonomous regional people's congress standing committee examined and approved the "Regulations of the Tibet Autonomous Region Governing Foreigners Who Come to Tibet for Mountaineering," the "Measures of the Tibet Autonomous Region on Implementing the `Law of the People's Republic of China on Compulsory Education,'" the "Measures of the Tibet Autonomous Region on Implementing the `Organic Law (for Trial Implementation) of the People's Republic of China on Villagers' Committees,'" and the "Measures of the Tibet Autonomous Region on Implementing the `Organic Law of the People's Republic of China on Urban Residents' Committees.'" It conducted initial deliberations of the "Regulations of the Tibet Autonomous Region on the Comprehensive Management of Public Security." Moreover, it conducted a preliminary review of existing laws and regulations, and adopted resolutions on revoking regional laws and regulations which were incompatible with the developments of the times. To give more effective guidance to the elections of a new term of deputies to county and township people's congresses and to promote the construction of grass-roots political organs, the Standing Committee also adopted a "Decision on the Election Schedule of People's Deputies to County and Township People's Congresses." As a result of the elections in 1993, 6,411 deputies to county and township people's congresses were elected directly by some 1.2 million voters throughout the region. The report points out: Over the past year, deputies made a total of 94 suggestions. Of the six suggestions put on the record, five were taken care of, with the remaining one in the process of being handled. Replies were already given to deputies. In the past year, the Standing Committee actively organized deputies to conduct inspection in the vicinity and received some 40 inspection reports from them, which were of great help to the relevant departments in improving work. The report emphasizes: The Standing Committee's main tasks in 1994 are: accelerating the pace of enacting laws and striving to keep legislation abreast with the progress of reform; energetically strengthening supervision to ensure the smooth implementation of various laws, regulations, and major reform programs; stepping up publicity of the legal system to enhance the whole society's awareness of laws; and continuing to improve the Regional People's Congress' work. In the report on the work of the regional Higher People's Court, Bai Zhao said: In the past year, the regional Higher People's Court earnestly performed functions empowered by the Constitution and other laws. It accepted 3,092 cases; of these, the hearing was completed on 2,581 cases, thus dealing a harsh blow at separationists' sabotage activities, severely punishing criminal offenders who disrupted public order, striking relentlessly at serious economic crimes, and resolutely cracking down on corruption according to the law. In 1994, courts throughout the region will, with a view to stabilizing the situation and promoting economic development, fight unswervingly against separatism, continue to strike severely at various criminal offenders, step up efforts to try major and serious cases, especially economic crimes, and deepen the anticorruption drive. Moreover, in the process of readjusting economic relations, courts will earnestly safeguard the lawful rights and interests of citizens, legal persons, and other organizations. They will strictly enforce the law and raise the judicial quality so as to contribute to Tibet's economic development and social stability. In the report on the work of the regional People's Procuratorate, Lan Rifeng said: In the past year, procuratorial organs in Tibet, led by the regional party committee and the Supreme People's Procuratorate, firmly implemented the party Central Committee's guidelines on the anticorruption drive and adhered to the principle of "strictly enforcing the law and resolutely handling cases" in striking harshly at a handful of separatists and serious criminal offenders; in concentrating efforts on investigating and punishing a number of major and serious cases of embezzlement, bribery, and other economic crimes; in investigating -- according to the law -- criminal cases involving infringement of rights [qin quan 0187 2938] and malfeasance [du zhi 3460 5120]; and in strengthening the supervision over law enforcement and the improvement of the quality of procuratorial personnel; thereby making fresh contributions to safeguarding the motherland's unification, to enhancing national unity, to maintaining social stability, to safeguarding reform, opening up, and the establishment of a socialist market economy, and to promoting socialist democracy and the legal system. The report points out: This year, procuratorial organs in Tibet will continue to give top priority to harshly striking at a handful of separatists and serious criminal offenders according to the law; concentrate forces on handling major and serious cases in the anticorruption drive; continue to step up investigations and handling of "infringement of rights" and "malfeasance;" and further strengthen the functions of procuratorial organs in supervising law enforcement to ensure the correct implementation of state laws. They will also persist in improving the quality of people's procuratorates, strictly executing procuratorial duties, and raising the quality of procurators according to the law.
