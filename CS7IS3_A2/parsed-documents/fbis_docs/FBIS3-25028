The government military action in Cuito may lead UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] to leave the talks. This is another chapter in the war for the government, but for Savimbi's movement words are being replaced by the law of weapons. More details from Ana Rodrigues: [Rodrigues] [passage omitted] The government says it believed in UNITA's cease-fire declaration. But government spokesman Aldomiro Vaz da Conceicao stated that UNITA has never respected that cease-fire: [Begin Conceicao recording] UNITA already stated last year that it was declaring a unilateral cease-fire, but it has increased its offensive action against government positions and its forces since November last year. Therefore UNITA is permanently contradicting itself. [passage omitted] I have no doubt whatsoever in stating that it was UNITA that started the fighting because it had been engaged for a long time in troop maneuvers and in mobilizing its means to take the city of Cuito once and for all. [end recording] [Rodrigues] There is an exchange of accusations going on between the government and UNITA, the two sides discussing peace in Lusaka. UNITA has already stated that the talks are in jeopardy at a time when they are discussing the last point on the agenda relating to the mandate of UNAVEM [United Nations Angola Verification Mission] and the role of observers. The government is more optimistic, it says there has always been fighting and, despite that, the talks have carried on. [passage omitted]
