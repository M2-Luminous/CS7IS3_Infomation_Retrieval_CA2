The harmonizing of the taxation of interest rates is one of the goals that the Federal Government wants to implement in the second half of 1994 as a high priority. The finance minister rejected Bonn opposition demands for compensation for the tax on interest rates. Every regulation based on samples or supervision would lead to more of a substantial transfer of capital abroad than the current taxation at source. In addition, it is obvious that a form of European harmonization based on a relaxation of banking secrecy cannot be achieved. Waigel warned Oskar Lafontaine, minister-president of Saarland, against condemning the Maastricht Treaty. Lafontaine said that in view of economic developments, the Maastricht Treaty cannot be adhered to. According to Waigel, statements to that effect could deprive European governments of the courage needed to achieve the observance of the criteria that have been agreed upon for participation in economic and monetary union. However, stressed the minister, it is obvious that adherence to stability criteria is more important than observing deadlines. [passage omitted]
