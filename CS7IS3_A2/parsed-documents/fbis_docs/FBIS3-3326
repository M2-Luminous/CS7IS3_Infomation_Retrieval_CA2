The following is the full text of Wang Dan's "statement on MFN:" Foreign press circles gave wide publicity to a joint statement issued in the names of "Zhou Tuo, Wang Dan, and Min Qi" on 11 March 1994. Their reports referred to a sentence on "strongly calling on the United States to renew China's MFN status." Here I would like to solemnly clarify that this remark on MFN, particularly the word "strongly," does not represent my personal stand or attitude. Thus a correction is necessary. To clear up this misunderstanding, I am willing to make an open statement on my basic stand and attitude concerning the MFN status. My opinion follows: 1. This year the United States should renew China's MFN status, because if the United States abolishes China's MFN status, first, this could damage the economic interests of the Chinese people; second, this could be unfavorable to speeding up the introduction of market economy, whereas the vigorous introduction of market economy will fundamentally promote China's social progress; third, this could stop U.S.-Chinese economic relations, while facts have shown that these relations are effective ways to promote social progress in China; separation could cut off the channel for the United States to urge China for human rights improvement; fourth, this could discourage the enlightened leaders in the CPC from pursuing a firm reform policy and could provide a pretext for those with ulterior motives to hamper reform and opening up; fifth, this could ruin China's pro-democracy movement and aggravate the situation in which pro-democracy activists find themselves. This year is an important and crucial year in China's reform process. Any decision beneficial to promoting reform is wise and worthy of support. The international community should also notice that the Chinese Government has switched from refusal to acceptance on the human rights issue and has made some sensible moves on some aspects of human rights. This should also be encouraged. 2. In the meantime, it is also my opinion that MFN status should, naturally, be linked to the human rights issue. Not only is this the U.S. Government's moral responsibility in carrying forward global democratization process, but it is also a real issue of whether or not economic interests can be guaranteed. But there has not been a major change in China's human rights record--it is still quite far from the international community's standards. Therefore, when renewing China's MFN status for another year, the United States should also continue to maintain a close watch on China's human rights record and take relevant measures so that this effort will yield effective results. In conclusion, my appeal for renewal of China's MFN status does not mean that there has been marked improvement in China's human rights record, but I am making this appeal out of consideration for actual needs. This is my personal analysis and opinion, which are not affected by my emotions. Therefore the word "strongly" does not represent my stand or attitude. [Signed] Wang Dan, [Dated] 17 March 1994.
