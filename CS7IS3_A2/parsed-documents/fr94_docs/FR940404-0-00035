FR940404-0-00035 FR940404-0-00014 V. Environmental Impact The proposed amendment is not expected to have any adverse environmental effects. The Denver-Boulder six county nonattainment area has met the NAAQS since 1986. Current air quality is expected to be further maintained by a 9.0 psi standard. VI. Economic Impact The proposed relaxation of the 7.8 psi standard to 9.0 psi will result in a cost reduction in refining, and an increase in summertime gasoline supply levels. For each summer, this translates into approximately a 1.1 cent per gallon cost savings to consumers at the pump. VII. Administrative Requirements Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 through 612, whenever an agency is required to publish a general notice of rulemaking for any proposed or final rule, it must prepare and make available for public comment a regulatory flexibility analysis which describes the impact of the rule on small entities (i.e., small businesses, small organizations and small governmental jurisdictions). The Administrator may certify, however, that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. In such circumstances, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required. Under Section 605 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, I certify that these regulations will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. The regulatory revision is limited to the Denver-Boulder area and should have no significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. These regulations, therefore, do not require a regulatory flexibility analysis. Under Executive Order 12866, 19 the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: 19 58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993). (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; (2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order. It has been determined that this rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under the terms of Executive Order 12866 and is therefore not subject to OMB review. Specifically, this rule will not have an annual effect on the economy in excess of $100 million, have a significant adverse impact on competition, investment, employment or innovation, or result in a major price increase. In fact, as discussed above, this action will reduce the cost of compliance with Federal requirements in this area. Under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501, EPA must obtain OMB clearance for any activity that will involve collecting substantially the same information from 10 or more non-Federal respondents. This direct final rule does not create any new information requirements or contain any new information collection activities.
