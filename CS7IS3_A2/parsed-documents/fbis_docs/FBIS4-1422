We are flying around the country, and we are making excellent contact here. In fact I understand that we are in touch with Jennifer Wilson, who is in Chatsworth and has Mr. De Klerk, Mr. F.W. de Klerk, leader of the National Party there. Jennifer is that so. [De Klerk]...and every effort is being made. May of the problems are caused by the late entry of the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party], and I am sympathetic towards the problems. I am also concerned and critical where things haven't gone as they should have gone, but we must seriously consider what will the implications be if this election does not succeed. For the country it will be bad. The mood of the people is -- they want this election to succeed. I want it to succeed and all of us must go out of our way to make it succeed and I would call upon Chief Minister Buthelezi to be cooperative in that regard and to ... to advise his people to make use of tomorrow, a full polling day, which can stretch over 14, 16, 17 hours if necessary, to come and vote. The opportunity is there. [Unidentified correspondent] If other political leaders may ask for some extension for voting dates, like, tomorrow is the last day -- what would be your advise to them? [De Klerk] Well we have now made tomorrow also a public holiday to enable people who couldn't today vote -- without the problem of having to get off from work -- to do so also tomorrow. And I've been assured by Judge Kriegler and by others that I consulted, inter alia, also Mr. Mandela, that that concession, because it is a very late stage to call a public holiday, will facilitate the position of people to vote to a great extent, and with the extension of the hours, I think it will be possible for everybody to vote. [Correspondent] The other complaint from Chief Buthelezi was that in some other KwaZulu areas, in rural areas, where he has got strong support, the voting booths were not installed in those areas. Are you looking forward to have some of the voting stations -- with discussions from...[pauses] after discussing with the IEC to you have those voting booths in that... [De Klerk, interrupting] Well I've been supportive of it all along. Chief Buthelezi is of course in charge of most government buildings and semi-government buildings in KwaZulu-Natal, and I know that he said all magistrate's courts will be made available, and I have no problem if...if they open up new polling booths or if they bring in more mobile polling booths. I've received such a letter yesterday from Chief Minister Buthelezi and I asked Minister Schutte, the Minister of the Interior, to be as helpful as he can and to go out of his way. We must, if we cannot have a hundred percent-perfect election, I think we must go for having a 95-percent or a 96-percent perfect election. This is the first time ever for many people. The fact of the matter is that at a certain stage there was a lack of cooperation, although it was offered, it was very cool and very reserved from within KwaZulu, with regard to their establishment, so everything which had to be done there was almost crisis management. It had a crash course element to it, and when he entered the election he knew it would be like that, because of his late entry and because of the late full cooperation between all the instances. My attitude is, and I think that should be the attitude of all South African leaders, is that we must exhort our people to use their opportunity and we must be helpful in overcoming whatever problems are remaining with regard to the operation of the election. We must make this election succeed. [SABC correspondent Jennifer Wilson] Sir, in the meantime, our TV 1 viewers have joined us live on air. Could you repeat for us, your reaction to the Chief Minister's threat to withdraw from the elections? [De Klerk] I am deeply concerned about the threat. I don't think that any political leader should at this stage of the election make such threats. All the legal avenues will be open afterwards to contest the election for somebody who would like to. My attitude is a positive and a constructive one. There is a full day left for voting, a full evening because hours, wherever there is a need, will be extended late into the night. A full day tomorrow, and already I have been given the assurance that, if there are people outside waiting to vote at 7PM, the booths won't close. It will carry on even if it is late into the night to allow everybody to vote, and what should now be done is that all leaders should advise their followers, should actually motivate their followers to make use of this full day during which each and every South African has an opportunity to bring out his or her vote. [Wilson] We've just had a situation here where they actually ran out of stickers. So what happens if that occurs throughout the rest of the country? [De Klerk] Well, the fact is that they have proof that they are getting better because they didn't wait long for the replacements. The stickers are here, the people are voting again and they'll stay beyond the hours. Yes, it asks some sacrifice of the people who are standing in long queues and I am tremendously impressed by the way in which South Africans have shown patience. This election is the most historic event, maybe, in the history of South Africa. Let us not grouse and be difficult about the dots on the I and the strokes on the T. Let us look at the larger picture. We must make this election succeed. That is my message to my supporters. That is my call on all other political leaders, that they should also ask the same of their supporters. [Wilson] Thank you very much, Mr. President. [De Klerk] Thank you. [Unidentified correspondent] Is there any possibility of the voting being extended to Friday? [De Klerk] I think it would be very difficult to do so. If circumstances arise that there's a great percentage of the voters who have not been able to vote because of logistical problems, not because they were lazy but because of logistical problems, then one will be forced to look at it, but I think we should rather solve it through the extension of voting hours, and there's a full day left as I have said, and it can go on through to midnight tomorrow evening. Let us rather finish it now. There's a grave risk should we extend it. It has not been planned in advance -- of that also running into serious trouble -- and I've discussed this with Judge Kriegler, and he agreed with me. I discussed it with Mr. Mandela and he agreed with me that we should do our level best to avoid at all cost extension to Friday. [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. President, the ANC is already predicting a sweeping victory in all nine provinces, including the so-called marginal areas in Natal and Western Cape and northern Cape. How do you feel about the chances in Natal ... [SABC announcer Lester Venter, interrupting] Yes, indeed well we'll leave that conversation and those interviews there with Mr. de Klerk, leader of the National Party and we are crossing straightaway to Nyaka Sofako who is at an ANC press conference on the same subject.
