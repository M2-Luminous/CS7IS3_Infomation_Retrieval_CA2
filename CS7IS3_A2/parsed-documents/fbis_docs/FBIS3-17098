It will help Russian enterprises to survive. On his return from Washington, where he signed an appropriate document with the U.S. secretary of commerce, Nikolay Yegorov disclosed that over the next two years Russia will now be able to supply the United States with up to 3,000 tonnes of uranium concentrate and a considerable quantity of enriched uranium worth a total of $150 million. Previously there were no deliveries in view of the agreement imposed on Russia in 1992 whereby the export of Russian uranium was authorized only at prices that were effectively 1.5 times the world prices, the deputy minister emphasized. Now an opportunity is opening up to resume sales on U.S. markets, which will help Russian uranium-extracting enterprises to improve their position. A special feature of the new agreement is the establishment of a procedure for joint sales whereby 50 percent of the Russian deal is combined with a similar quantity of American sales, and this mixed uranium is sold to consumers. "The next two years will be especially difficult for Russia," Nikolay Yegorov said. "So the extra sources of freely convertible currency will come in very handy."
