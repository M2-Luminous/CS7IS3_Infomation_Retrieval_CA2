This point of view was expressed at a briefing today by Grigoriy Karasin, director of the information and press department of the Russian Foreign Ministry. Such measures, he stressed, can only be drafted within the framework of the UN Security Council. "Unilateral decisions in this respect will be counterproductive," the Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman stated. In his view, the normalization of the situation around Gorazde creates conditions for the resumption of efforts to achieve a political settlement of the Bosnian problem. As G. Karasin pointed out, this was the purpose of the contacts made by Vitaliy Churkin, Russia's deputy foreign minister, in London, today's meeting between Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, and other Russian diplomatic moves toward the implementation of the Russian president's initiative. According to the Russian diplomat, it was noted at yesterday's consultative meeting of the UN Security Council that "the Muslims were responsible for a provocation in the Gorazde area, but the Serbs did not respond to it." In this connection Russia again called on the UN leadership and the countries involved in the Bosnian settlement process to take all measures necessary to prevent provocations.
