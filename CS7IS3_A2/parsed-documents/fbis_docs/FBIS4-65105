He also threatened to withdraw the 6,000 French peacekeeping forces from UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] if there is no prospect of a political settlement. Speaking at John Hopkins University, Alain Juppe said the French plan envisions the gradual lifting of international sanctions against Serbia once a cease-fire has been concluded and territorial partition agreed on. Alain Juppe told U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher there is no question of spending another winter in Bosnia. Christopher remained very cautious. He reaffirmed that the aim of the United States is to obtain a cease-fire and a renewal of the peace talks between the two sides. We cannot predict precisely what will come of it, he added.
