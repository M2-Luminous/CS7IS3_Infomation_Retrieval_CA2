FBIS4-16289 "drsov073_u_94003" FBIS-SOV-94-073 Daily Report 14 Apr 1994 Latvia Urges New Delegation to Talks Urges New Delegation to Talks WS1504082594 Tallinn BNS in English 1614 GMT 14 Apr 94 WS1504082594 Tallinn BNS English BFN [Text] RIGA, Apr 14, BNS -- Deputies in the Latvian Saeima (parliament) oppositionary National Bloc said Wednesday [13 April] they wanted a new delegation for talks with Russia. The bloc also urges the parliament not to ratify the March 15 initialed agreements with Russia because they contain several norms that can be interpreted as legalization of consequences of the Soviet occupation in Latvia. These issues should be considered in an extraordinary session of the Saeima, the group said. The majority of the Latvian people dislikes the agreement on social guarantees for Russia's war pensioners in Latvia, the National Bloc said. Russian President Boris Yeltsin's directive on the setup of a military base in Latvia signals that Russia has aggressive plans in the Baltic country. In addition, none of the foreign countries, which pressed Latvia into compromise with Russia on the Skrunda radar's operation, has extended real security guarantees against possible conflicts, disputes or provocations, according to the bloc's statement. Yeltsin's decision presented the Latvian government a way out of situation because it would have had to resign if these floppy agreements were signed, said Aristids Lambergs, of the National Independence Movement faction. Lambergs claims that the country's delegation for talks with Russia should include representatives of all Saeima factions. The National Bloc proposes to convene an extraordinary plenary session to discuss the setup of the new delegation on April 20, Lambergs told BNS. The bloc's statement was signed by 16 deputies. To propose an extraordinary session, signatures of 33 deputies, or one-third of the 100-member Saeima, are needed. The National Bloc, which includes 35 MPs, hopes to get the lacking signatures until Monday. The National Bloc includes National Independence Movement, Homeland and Freedom and Christian Democrats factions.
