The agreement on the loan syndication was signed Monday at the headquarters of Dresdner Bank in Frankfurt, the Central Bank announced here Monday. Paul Sutopo, the managing director of Bank Indonesia, said that the large number of participants in the loan syndication reflected the confidence of the international banking community in Indonesia. He said that the bank had originally planned to raise only $400 million from the loan syndicate, but the syndication was oversubscribed to reach $500 million due to the larger-than expected response. "The number of banks in the loan syndication is the highest so far. We initially anticipated only around 40 participants," he said. The Central Banks press statement said members of the loan syndication, which was arranged by Chase Manhattan Asia Ltd., the Industrial Bank of Japan, Banque National de Paris, Bank of Tokyo, the Long-Term Credit Bank (LTCB), and Dresdner, included Asian banks such as Bank Bumiputera of Malaysia. It said that the loan will mature in seven years and that the interest will be paid annually. In the first two years, the interest rate will be a 5 [as published] of a percent above the London Inter-bank Offered Rate, and 7/8 [as published] above thereafter. The money is intended for use as standby reserves and will be drawn only when needed. Disbursement of the loan will be based on five days of prior notice. The Indonesian Government annually seeks standby loans outside its creditor group -- the Consultative Group on Indonesia -- to maintain its contingency foreign exchange reserves minimally at $2 billion. The standby loans, besides serving as contingency reserves in addition to the foreign and gold reserves held by Bank Indonesia to safeguard the balance of payments, usually are also used for counterpart financing for government projects funded with export credits.
