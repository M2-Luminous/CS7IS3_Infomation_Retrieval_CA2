FR940913-1-00002 FR940913-1-00001 FEDERAL RETIREMENT THRIFT INVESTMENT BOARD 5 CFR Part 1650 Methods of Withdrawing Funds From the Thrift Savings Plan AGENCY: Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Executive Director of the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board is proposing to revise regulations on spousal rights in accordance with changes made to the Federal Employees' Retirement System Act of 1986 (FERSA) by Public Law 103&hyph;226 to delete all references to former spouses and to accord all spouses of TSP participants covered by the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS) the right to a survivor annuity, unless they waive that option. DATES: Comments must be submitted on or before October 13, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments may be sent to Robert Bloom, Assistant General Counsel (Administration), Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board, 1250 H Street NW., Washington, DC 20005. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert Bloom at (202) 942&hyph;1662, FAX (202) 942&hyph;1676. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Public Law 103&hyph;226, 108 Stat. 111 (March 30, 1994), amends FERSA, 5 U.S.C. chapter 84 and section 8351, to give all TSP participants, regardless of their eligibility for basic retirement benefits, the same withdrawal options upon separation that have previously been available only to participants who separate with eligibility for basic retirement benefits. As a result, spouses of all TSP participants, regardless of the participant's eligibility for basic retirement benefits, have been provided with the same rights as those previously available to spouses of participants who were eligible for basic retirement benefits. This means that spouses of FERS participants who were previously only entitled to notice (if the participant separated without eligibility for basic retirement benefits) now have the right to a survivor annuity, unless the spouse waives that right. The required annuity is a joint life annuity with the spouse with 50 percent survivor benefits, level payments, and a no cash refund feature. As a result of this statutory change, 5 CFR 1650.17 has been revised to delete the requirement to notify the spouse with the TSP participant who is covered by FERS lacks eligibility for basic retirement benefits. Spouses of Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) participants are entitled to notice whether or not the participant separated from Federal service with eligibility for basic retirement benefits. This notice requirement was not affected by Public Law 103&hyph;226. Public Law 103&hyph;226 also eliminates the requirement to notify former spouses of FERS and CSRS participants who separate from Federal service without eligibility for basic retirement benefits that the participant is withdrawing his or her TSP account. Accordingly, all references to former spouse have been eliminated from 5 CFR part 1650, subpart G. (Because there are no longer any references to ``former spouses,'' the word ``current'' has also been eliminated wherever it appeared to describe the spouse to whom a participant is married.) This means that participants are no longer required to provide the TSP Service Office with an address for a former spouse, or, if a former spouse cannot be located, to obtain an exception to the requirement to notify a former spouse. In addition to the changes made by Public Law 103&hyph;226, other changes explain or clarify spousal rights and exceptions to those rights. Section 1650.19 is revised to delete language stating that the employee and spouse may jointly waive the survivor annuity. The participant waives the survivor annuity by electing a different withdrawal option, while it is the spouse who must explicitly sign a waiver statement. Section 1650.21 provides that the Executive Director may grant an exception to the requirement to obtain the spouse's signature or the spouse notice requirement where the participant establishes to the satisfaction of the Executive Director that the spouse's whereabouts cannot be determined. The requirement to obtain the spouse's signature on the appropriate form to waive the joint and survivor annuity is referred to as the signature requirement. The notice requirement refers to the entitlement of the spouse of a CSRS participant to notice of the participant's withdrawal election. This section is being revised to allow participants who are seeking an exception to the signature or the notice requirement based on whereabouts unknown to submit statements in lieu of affidavits or declarations in support of their requests. These statements must be made pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 1001, which provides that whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States knowingly and willfully falsifies, conceals or covers up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact, or makes any false, fictitious or fraudulent statements or representations, or makes or uses any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry, shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both. To ensure that the persons making the statements are aware of the possible penalty, §1650.21(c) requires inclusion of the following on each statement: I understand that a false statement or willful misrepresentation is punishable under Federal Law (18 U.S.C. 1001) by a fine or imprisonment or both. To ease the burden on participants further, §§1650.21 and 1650.22 are being revised to delete the requirement that the participant obtain and provide only documents bearing an original signature or which are embossed or which bear the imprint of a seal. Participants may now submit photocopies of documents. Sections 1650.21(d) and 1650.22(c) are added to explain that a withdrawal form received within one year of approval of the exception may be processed without a new exception. An exception is valid only for the spouse for whom the exception has been approved.
