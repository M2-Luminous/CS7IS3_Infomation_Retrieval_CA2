FBIS4-47781 "drafr086_b_94001" FBIS-AFR-94-086 Daily Report 2 May 1994 EAST AFRICA Djibouti Opposition Front Leaders Released From Prison Opposition Front Leaders Released From Prison LD0205160994 Paris Radio France International in French 1230 GMT 2 May 94 LD0205160994 Paris Radio France International French BFN [Text] The four leaders of the United Opposition Front of Djibouti who were arrested in Djibouti on 30 January are now free. A Djibouti tribunal sentenced them to a three-month prison term this morning. They have already been detained for three months pending their trial. The four leaders, including Cheiko, leader of the United Front, were accused of having publicly supported the armed struggle of the Front for the Restoration of Unity and Democracy. The exact terms of the bill of indictment are: Call for armed struggle, not followed by results. This sentence amounts to releasing them, since the accused have already spent three months in jail. Ghislaine Dupont asked their lawyer, Mr. Aref, if this sentence could be construed as a gesture of appeasement by the authorities. Listen to Mr. Aref's answer: [Begin Aref recording] My opinion is completely different. I believe that this sentence is an expression of unease. I say this for two reasons. The first reason is that the acts, of which they were accused, were not carried out. If my clients did actually jointly sign a resolution with other political parties in Addis Ababa, they never carried out such a provocation. Besides, they always disputed the facts. They said that their intentions and their acts were always to lead a political, a peaceful, struggle in the town of Djibouti itself. This is the first reason. The second reason is that as long as the case is covered by the secrecy of investigation, people do not know anything. When the case comes in the open, people attend the trial, whatever their opinion. They are then clearly informed of the origins and conclusions of the case. Only then can they have a precise idea more closely tied to reality. I believe that the sentence which was handed over today reflects this unease. [end recording]
