Iritel supplies the means of transmission within the national long-distance network for interconnection between the transit switching nodes of the SIP [Italian State-Owned Telephone Company] (SGT) network and between these and the national transit nodes managed by Iritel itself (for European traffic) and by Italcable (for intercontinental traffic).
