A local council president was disqualified from the electoral college on a procedural matter. Chief Justice Charles d'Imecourt called for the 57-member electoral college to reconvene on 2 March. Justice D'Imecourt also apologized for any offense he had caused for comments he had made over the opposition's boycott of the electoral college last Monday. It had boycotted because it had not been officially notified. Justice D'Imecourt had said that the boycott was a disgrace and would make Vanuatu the laughingstock of the Pacific. Following those comments, the opposition had accused him of political bias. [end recording]
