These are important documents. The National Assembly outlined major and practical measures to mobilize forces and concentrate the energy and resources of the entire country on socioeconomic construction and development and on restoring national order and discipline. It also clarified the responsibility of the National Assembly Standing Committee, government, departments, echelons, National Assembly deputies, and citizens with regard to implementing these resolutions. We have to affirm that the fight against corruption and smuggling is a continuous fight for all of society. We must be resolute in obliterating this harmful practice gradually, thus creating a healthy environment for socioeconomic development and for the construction of a law-abiding Vietnamese Government of the people, by the people, and for the people. The first task is gradually to build and perfect a uniform legal system that will concretize the party's renovation line in all fields of social life. During this session, the National Assembly passed the Law on Environmental Protection, a law amending and supplementing some articles of the Law on Organization of People's Courts, and the Law on Business Bankruptcy. These are important and necessary laws to create a legal foundation for socioeconomic development and provide a guarantee for business activities, accelerate national renovation, and protect our living environment. The National Assembly also evaluated the past legislative situation and the resolution on legislative work for 1994. It offered opinions and directions for the legislative program spanning from 1995 until the end of the official term of the Ninth National Assembly. It also outlined the draft labor code and the draft law on the state budget. The National Assembly tasked responsible organs with conducting further studies before presenting these bills at the next session. The National Assembly highly evaluated our government's 1993 foreign affairs activities, which actively contributed to the common struggle of people around the world for peace, national independence, democracy, and social progress. This was done in the spirit of Vietnam seeking friendship with all nations in the world community that are striving for peace, independence, and development. In order to develop these achievements in the future, we will accelerate the implementation of our foreign policy, which stresses independence, sovereignty, diversification of multilateral relations, and consolidation of the friendship and multi-faceted relations will all nations -- especially our neighbors, countries in Southeast Asia and the Asia-Pacific region, and international organizations. This will create more favorable conditions for our national construction and protection. Having been a victim for centuries of human rights violations committed by invading forces, our government and people are very earnest about independence and freedom. We are resolute in fully observing the fundamental rights of human beings, which are regulated by the 1992 Constitution. Dear National Assembly deputies, with a sense of national pride and in order to develop our tradition of diligence and creativeness, our entire Army and people are determined to overcome all difficulties and challenges and carry out the directions and tasks for 1994 as outlined in the National Assembly resolutions. These are: To solidify achievements made in our renovation; move ahead with industrialization and modernization; grasp opportunities for rapid acceleration of the economic development rate, so as to bring our country into a new period of development; create an important change in the fields of culture and society; maintain political stability; broaden our foreign relations; and protect our national independence, sovereignty, and integrity. In that spirit, the National Assembly calls on people and soldiers across the country as well as our overseas compatriots to unite in heart and in strength, quickly grasp opportunities, eliminate all dangers, practice thrift in production and consumption, increase development investment for material production, and mobilize their resources and abilities to make our country even more beautiful than our beloved President Ho Chi Minh hoped. Dear National Assembly deputies, the success of the Ninth National Assembly's Fourth Session is the result of the active contributions of the government, National Assembly deputies, National Assembly organs, related government organs, and voters in the country. The National Assembly sincerely thanks high-level leading comrades, revolutionary senior citizens, and former National Assembly deputies for their keen interest and their opinion during this session. It welcomes the efforts exerted by mass media agencies in their timely reflection of the National Assembly's vivid activities, which met the interests of people inside and outside the country. It thanks the wholehearted and enthusiastic contributions of all organs that provided services during this session. As we enter 1994, I warmly wish the National Assembly deputies, distinguished guests, people, and soldiers across the country -- as well as our overseas compatriots -- a new year of good health and happiness so as to record more achievements. I declare the Fourth Session of the Ninth National Assembly closed. Thank you.
