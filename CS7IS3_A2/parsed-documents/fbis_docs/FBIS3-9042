The five members are: Deputy Prime Minister for Legislative Affairs Ivan Simko; Minister of Employment, Social Affairs, and the Family Julius Brocka; Minister of Transport, Communications, and Public Works Mikulas Dzurinda; Interior Minister Ladislav Pittner; and Culture Minister Lubo Roman. Simko emphasized that even though the current cabinet's mandate is limited in time, he did not intend to merely "sit out" the term, but rather to foster new type of politics based on broad cooperation among all political forces, and to transform and oversee the legal system. Brocka described himself as "minister of the poor" in charge of a large group of people who are socially disadvantaged. But by amending a number of laws he intends to protect others as well, he said, such as by creating tax breaks for self-employed people in order to make possible an increase in activity. Dzurinda said he intended to transform and improve the country's transport and telecommunications infrastructure, and to revive certain billion-crown projects dating from the government of KDH Chairman Jan Carnogursky, who was Slovak premier from the fall of the first Meciar government in March 1991 until the creation of the second one in June 1992. Pittner said his goal was to improve the work of the police, do away with the insecurity and passivity which have recently been a trademark, and introduce modern and effective methods for fighting both common and organized crime. "We will respond to violence with violence within the spirit of the law," he said. Roman said he wanted "to create a model for cooperation in culture, to convince people that cooperating with me will pay off, and to carry this model over to all of society." Specific projects he would like to see include creating sources of financing for construction of a theater in Kosice, East Slovakia, and holding a lottery to raise money for a new building for the Slovak National Theater.
