FR940902-0-00077 FR940902-0-00010 A number of commenters encouraged a streamlining of the eligibility documentation process, including use of self-attestation. Several requested guidance on what documentation would be required for barriers. The Department has issued, in February 1993, and provided training on an eligibility documentation TAG to be used by SDA's in the eligibility determination process. This should provide clarification of these issues. The procedures in this title II, Eligibility Documentation TAG, if followed by the SDA's, will protect them from audit disallowances based on inadequate documentation. In response to several comments that the Department should stick by its guidance, the final rule clarifies the intent of the interim final rule that when it is determined that the State, SDA or service provider followed the Department's written guidance, the Grant Officer will not disallow costs related to required documentation of an individual's eligibility. Section 628.510 describes the requirements for intake, targeting and referral of applicants. During the intake process, personal data on individuals are collected and a preliminary determination regarding suitability for title II services is made. A number of commenters expressed the need for clarification of the suitability issue. Suitability for program participation is a determination, based on preliminary information, of which eligible applicants should be considered for JTPA program services. This determination is made against the backdrop of the limited availability of JTPA resources and services and the practical necessity that the JTPA program must decide which individuals fall within the 5 to 10 percent of the eligible population that can be served. It includes a determination whether an individual falls within a category targeted for service by virtue of having a ``barrier'' to employment and whether there are other programs and services reasonably available to an individual within the community. The JTPA title II program is not intended or structured to remove all barriers to employment that applicants for services may have. Therefore, the suitability determination also should consider which eligible applicants, with the provision of locally available supportive services, can best be served and benefit from JTPA participation by acquisition of educational and occupational skills or competencies and eventual employment. The regulations provide that some limited assessment activities may be undertaken, the results of which may be used in connection with a determination of suitability. A determination that an individual may be eligible but not suitable results in referrals to other sources of assistance, provision of information on other programs, or in the case of a service provider, in referral to the SDA for further consideration. In making suitability determinations, SDA's should keep in mind their obligations under applicable civil rights and equal opportunity laws. SDA's should consider advising applicants of the process and possible results of intake, assessment and suitability determinations and, particularly, that not all eligible applicants can be served. In order to focus program services on harder to serve individuals, not less than 65 percent of participants must have one or more barriers to employment, as specified at section 203(b) of the Act. SDA's may also specify an additional barrier for each of the title II&hyph;A and II&hyph;C programs. An example of an appropriate ``additional barrier'' under section 203(b)(7) of the Act was requested. In response to this request, the Department is providing several examples, however, SDA's are not limited to these and are encouraged to develop ``additional barrier'' guidelines tailored to local population and labor market needs. For communities with public housing, the Department believes that ``public housing assistance recipients'' who are otherwise income eligible would constitute an appropriate ``additional barrier''. An employment-authorized refugee might be included, as well as a displaced homemaker, or substance abuser. Finally, the Department counsels that a member of a group protected under the civil rights statutes may not be designated as having a barrier to employment solely on the basis of the characteristics that cause them to fall under the civil rights legislation. So, for example, a racial group could not be designated under the additional barrier provisions. Several commenters requested clarification of the documentation requirements for referrals in §628.510(d). The Department describes the minimum required documentation at §628.510(d) and at §628.530(c). The Department expects that SDA's will develop standardized information on programs and services available in the community. This information may be provided in written form to the eligible applicant. A record of the referral will be maintained and may take the form of an incomplete ISS. No further followup is required beyond referral. Section 628.510(d) is revised to incorporate this principle. The idea is that the SDA must assume some limited responsibility to eligible applicants who come for services even though the Act recognizes that not all will be served. The SDA should be in a better position than an individual applicant to be aware of the services available within the community and to make referrals so that the applicant can benefit from these other sources. In part, this is a principle behind recent initiatives by States, SDA's and the Department to facilitate a concept of ``one-stop'' service. In addition, §628.510(d) is amended to specifically mention referrals to Job Corps to parallel the amendment to §628.803(d)(2). This change is made to foster JTPA/Job Corps coordination.
