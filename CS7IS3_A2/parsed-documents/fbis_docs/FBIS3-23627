The example of Georgia, which has agreed to station Russian troops on its territory as a consequence of its policy of hand-wringing, testifies to the fact that the Russian Federation has set about in practice the realization of its great-power intentions, and more precisely the realization of a plan of peacekeeping activity that has been approved by neither the UN nor the CSCE. There would be no grounds for alarm if we were to be guided by the logic of official Kiev. The more so as Ukraine, with its quite powerful army, is not the Baltic republics, which are raising an international hubbub about recent statements by Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrey Kozyrev with regard to the defense of the Russian-speaking population of the former USSR. The Baltic republics have not yet recovered from the shock of this imperialist declaration. An analysis of the changes in the military-political situation in Russia that was performed on the eve of the New Year by specialists at the National Institute of Strategic Studies [NISD], however, does not instill optimism and is confirmed by recent events. Ukraine has come to be in an arc of strong pressure on more than the common border with Russia, which is 1,270 kilometers, alone; add to it the uncertain situation in Crimea, and the activation of the 14th Army of General Lebed in the Dniester region, who--while in the latest twist calling his former comrades-in-arms from the leadership of the unrecognized Dniester Republic criminals--has actually confirmed suspicions of the transformation of this part of Moldova into an area of ad hoc Russian military autonomy. The southern region of Russia is taking on greater insecurity for Ukraine after the agreement of Yeltsin and Shevardnadze on the Russian military bases on Georgian territory. Russia has up to now had a common border here with Ukraine through the Krasnodar Kray region, with access to Black Sea ports. If, as has been announced, Georgia agrees to protect external borders along with Russia, then Russia will expand considerably its naval presence on the Black Sea, notwithstanding the joint--and de facto Russian--control of the Black Sea Fleet. The elections in the Crimea have energized the Don Cossacks, who recently openly declared their claims on a portion of the territory of Ukraine. Analysts at the NISD do not rule out possible military conflicts in the future with the participation of the Don Cossacks, who feel themselves to be the defenders of the national interests of Russia. The statements by Minister Grachev regarding the conflict in Yugoslavia, and the army that Russia is creating today, also arouse no less alarm. The accelerated creation of Russian operational-strategic formations (something along the lines of the rapid-deployment forces), which have already received the name of the Mobile Forces of Russia, is attracting the particular attention of analysts. These formations, at first glance, are being formed up only for use within Russia. According to the latest reports, however, the Mobile Forces will be able to carry out assigned tasks "in any theater of military operations" as early as 1995. Russian Minister of Defense Grachev has indicated, not without satisfaction, that Russia has long dreamed of a "mighty combat fist," which could effectively restrain an enemy until the deployment of the main forces, in case of an incursion onto its territory. Doubts regarding the exclusively domestic employment of the Mobile Forces, however, are confirmed not only by the military, but also by Russian diplomats, who are trying to show the world at every opportunity that Russia is still ready to perform "specific" tasks in zones of ethnic conflicts under the aegis of the CIS or as a "peacekeeper" with the authority of the UN. The structure of the mobile forces testifies to their nature and long-term aims. Several helicopter regiments of ground-forces aviation, three battalions of marine infantry, PVO [air-defense] and communications units and fighter and bomber squadrons, as well as military-transport aviation, are subordinate to their command, for a start. All of these constitute a formation at the highest degree of readiness--the immediate-response forces. Sixty percent of the composition of the Mobile Forces is airborne-assault units, and the other forty is motorized-rifle and special forces, surface-to-air missile and helicopter units, a mobile communications center and space communications gear, fighter, bomber and military-transport aviation units, battalions of marine infantry and airborne-assault battalions. As we see, at a time when the Ukrainian people's deputies consider nuclear weapons, which cannot be physically used against any aggressor, to be a guarantee of the security of Ukraine, Russia is purposefully, as any normal nation should, and actively rebuilding its armed forces in parallel with the disarmament of Ukraine. Today, therefore, when a knot of contradictions and mutual offenses has accumulated between Russia and Ukraine, the activation of military organizational development in Russia is forcing Ukraine to define a qualitatively new conceptual framework in relations with its northern neighbor. A wager on the stability of Yeltsin could lead to the fact that Ukraine, as in the times of Khmelnytskyy, could once again step on the "pan-Slavic rake."
