The move comes after Guangzhou Mayor Li Ziliu said British companies would have no chance of winning the remaining two contracts of the rail project because of the Sino-British dispute on Hong Kong's political reform. Meanwhile, the top representative of the European Union (EU) in Hong Kong confirmed the EU had been given assurances from China that there would be no discrimination against firms from any of the union's member states because of political reasons. Etienne Reuter, head of the office of the European Commission in Hong Kong, said the EU did not see any "material consequences" from the "verbal threats" from China that it would discriminate against British traders. He said the EU had not received complaints from any British traders. He added that China's boycott against any members of the union because of political reasons would not be compatible with trade and co-operation agreements between the EU and the mainland. But Mr. Reuter said if there were evidence that China discriminated against any traders from its member countries, the union would consult China and try to come up with a solution before taking any measures against Beijing.
