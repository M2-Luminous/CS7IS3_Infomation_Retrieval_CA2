B. Yeltsin began his two-day visit to Tataria [Tatarstan] with this statement, which had to all appearances been thought out in his Kremlin office. In order that there should be no doubts as to the correctness of his chosen way of saving the federation, the president rephrased the sensational statement that he had made in Kazan in 1990 as follows: "Tatarstan has assumed as many powers under the treaty as it was able to assume. We are satisfied with what has been left to federal organs. This is the first treaty of its kind and it is important for me to see with my own eyes how it is being put into practice." There is every indication that B. Yeltsin is pleased with the result of the operation of the hard-won treaty on the delimitation of powers, which has stabilized relations between Moscow and Kazan, and intends to pay attention mainly to purely practical matters. In turn Tatarstan's President M. Shaymiyev, answering a question from your IZVESTIYA correspondent, also said: "We need to strengthen the trust that has emerged on the basis of the treaty. In my view, it (trust) does now exist, we need to set about organizing the economic relations that are normal for a market." B. Yeltsin had to demonstrate the success of the idea of national accord founded on compromise. Against the backdrop of events in the Crimea, the treaty with Tataria is seen by analysts as an example of a well-considered flexible policy. Similar treaties are being prepared for certain other regions of Russia, in particular with Kabardino-Balkaria, Krasnodar Kray, and Udmurtia. B. Yeltsin was extremely interested in the experience of crime-fighting in Naberezhnyye Chelny and the republic as a whole. (During a conversation with your IZVESTIYA correspondent [Russian Interior Minister] V. Yerin did not hide his delight at the emergency measures that have in the last year made it possible to partially curb young criminal groupings in the republic). As for local nationalists declaring Yeltsin "persona non grata" in Tatarstan, they believe that the Russian president has not kept his word that he gave in 1990 regarding Kazan's sovereignty -- M. Shaymiyev retorted with undisguised irritation: "Nothing ever pleases them." Nevertheless he reaffirmed: Official Kazan favors peace with Moscow, and window-dressing verging on insanity was organized within the framework of this policy. In this case the hurried asphalting of roads and streets is a mere bagatelle. Actions on a state scale have been organized in places where Yeltsin is staying. Homes and balconies have been cleaned, store windows have been done up, and streets blocked for days. Thousands of militia personnel have been assembled in Naberezhnyye Chelny and Kazan. Regrettably, the military have not always remembered their duty and humanity. During the afternoon of 30 May a fire broke out in an apartment block on Uprising Street where the presidential cortege was to have passed. Despite a large concentration of militia forces none of the military came to help a woman who leaped out of the blazing apartment onto the balcony. To her good fortune the personnel of a store on the first floor displayed quick thinking. They grabbed a rug off the shelf, stretched it down over the sidewalk, and the girl jumped from the fifth floor. She was taken to the hospital with serious injuries and burns. Firefighters had barely put out the flames when decorators arrived and immediately painted over the soot. Politics is still the main thing of value, not people....
