There was apparently little activity this morning. Nevertheless, President-elect Armando Calderon Sol and Ruben Zamora, the leftist coalition candidate, held a meeting which was attended by TSE magistrates. They also received a delegation led by U.S. Ambassador Alan Flanigan, Mrs. Ann Patterson of the Latin American division of the State Department, and AID officials in the country, with whom they exchanged viewpoints on El Salvador's future, the continuation of economic aid, and other aspects of our country's economic and political situation. At the end of this morning's meeting, Dr. Ruben Zamora spoke to the media about some of the points discussed during the more than two-hour-long meeting here at the Presidente Hotel. Here is an excerpt of his remarks: [Begin recording] [Zamora] The first step was this conversation we just had. It was a general exploration in which we perhaps insisted more about the issue of electoral reform. This is one of the immediate issues that must be addressed in the next few months. We also discussed other points such as the decentralization of the government, the single registry of citizens, and so forth. I would say that in the next few days we will be announcing the agenda and how this will be done. [Unidentified reporter] How much is Calderon Sol willing to work on this? [Zamora] He expressed willingness to work and he agreed with me that in order for the country to move forward, the government and the opposition must agree on such points and work together. [Reporter] Do you think [words indistinct] and that the opposition, which you make up, is being taken into account? [Zamora] I think that both for the government and the opposition, these are two elements that are absolutely essential. Today's meeting was due to an initiative taken yesterday. When we talked with Dr. Calderon Sol yesterday he said: Why don't we meet a while? I said fine. That is what we did this morning. We agreed that we will remain in touch to deal with this problem. I think this is part of democracy. There will be a government; there must always be a government, but there must also be an opposition. When there is a government without opposition, there tends to be a dictatorship. A characteristic of democracy is the existence of a government and opposition. [Reporter] Any commitments [words indistinct]? [Zamora] This was an initial conversation. The commitment was that we have to structure this agenda of concerted efforts. Some ideas were expressed about how we can do this. But since we have not agreed on this yet, we are going to see how things develop. [end recording] Jorge Shafik Handal, general coordinator of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front [FMLN], and other members of the leftist coalition formed by the MNR [National Revolutionary Movement], the Democratic Convergence, and the FMLN, were also present at the meeting. Dr. Armando Calderon Sol remains on the second floor of the hotel, where he is meeting with TSE members to complete some minor details about the documents for his inauguration.
