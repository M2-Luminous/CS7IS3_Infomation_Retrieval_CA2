The COB's nationwide meeting was supposed to continue today with the purpose of assessing the government's last salary increase offer, among other issues. However, at the request of the miners' confederation, who want to negotiate their demands with the government first, the meeting was postponed until tomorrow. This morning the COB leaders said the agreement signed between the government and the coca growers does not mean that everything has been solved. The blockades have been lifted, but the hunger strikers continue their measures. Still pending are 11 missing peasants, two deaths, 20 rural teachers under arrest, the miners' demands, and the request for a salary hike. The COB has still not answered the latest offer by the government of a 9 percent salary increase. [recorded passage indistinct] Although some sectors have accepted the government's offer, such as the health workers, the COB, during its meeting tomorrow, will continue to assess the 9 percent salary hike offered by the government. La Paz teachers have organized a protest rally for this afternoon to demand the release of the 20 rural teachers under arrest.
