A Statement of a Spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry: The Japanese authorities' hostile maneuvers against Chongnyon, a dignified overseas citizens' organization of our Republic, are reaching a grave extent these days. Some time ago, the Japanese authorities sent scores of mobile police vehicles and some 1,000 policemen who encircled and threatened the Osaka Prefectural headquarters of Chongnyon all day and kicked up a violent row, forcibly searching office rooms of the headquarters, residences of its responsible functionaries, and its affiliated organizations. Prior to this, the Japanese rightist gangsters, under the behind- the-scenes manipulation of the authorities, crowded to the central headquarters of Chongnyon and its affiliated organizations and made a reckless disturbance, chanting, "Koreans go home," and "Disband the Korean Cbongnyon." Thus debasing the dignity of the Korean residents in Japan, they even committed a crime of murdering a Chongnyon businessman. This is a hostile act of encroaching upon the sovereignty of Chongnyon and violently trampling upon the democratic national right of the Korean residents in Japan and a challenge to our Republic which cannot be overlooked. Facts show that the Japanese reactionary authorities' direct suppression of Chongnyon has begun and that their hostile policy against our Republic has reached a reckless stage. In Japan, which claims itself to be a law-governed state, the police pounced upon and kicked up a row in broad daylight against the legitimate Chongnyon organizations which they should protect. Crowding in groups, the gangsters are openly committing murder and violence, encroaching upon human rights against the Korean residents in Japan. This is really surprising. There have been numerous instances of Japanese authorities' hostile acts and suppression against Chongnyon and the Korean residents in Japan. But the incidents such as noted above have occurred for the first time since the formation of Chongnyon and are arousing an unbearable indignation of all the Korean people and the Japan-resident Koreans. We resolutely denounce the Japanese reactionary authorities' crime as part of the anti-DPRK, anti- Chongnyon maneuvers. We cannot but take a serious note of the fact that the Japanese authorities are conducting a suppression of Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan, while intentionally aggravating the situation over the fictitious nuclear issue of the DPRK at the instigation of the United States. Chongnyon is a peace-loving organization whose activities are officially recognized by the Japanese authorities and Japanese law and which enjoys the full support of many countries and organizations in the world. There is neither reason nor ground for Chongnyon to be an object of a crackdown by the Japanese authorities. Moreover, Korean compatriots in Japan are innocent Korean people who were forcibly taken to Japan and subjected to hard toil under the brutal Japanese imperialist rule, and their descendants. Therefore, special protection must be granted to them by the Japanese authorities. However, far from apologizing for and liquidating the past crimes committed against the Korean people, the Japanese authorities are engaging in the suppression of Koreans in Japan and their legitimate organizations. This is an unpardonable act. We will consider any crackdown on Chongnyon an encroachment upon the dignity and sovereignty of our Republic and resolutely counter it [kue tanhohi taeunghae nagalkosida]. The Japanese authorities should ponder over the grave consequences to be entailed by their reckless acts, immediately stop their crackdown on Chongnyon and Korean compatriots in Japan and apologize for it. We express the hope that all the progressive personages and broad sections of people in Japan and the world will continue to express support and solidarity for the righteous activities of Chongnyon for its democratic national rights and national reunification. 29 April, 1994, Pyongyang.
