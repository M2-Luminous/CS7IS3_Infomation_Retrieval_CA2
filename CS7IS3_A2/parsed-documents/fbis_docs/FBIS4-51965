A member of the House of Councillors, Hideo Den, said that the police suppression of Koreans in Japan is creating an anti-DPRK atmosphere under the pretext of "nuclear suspicion against the North" faked up by the United States. "The Japanese Government must probe the truth and apologize," he demanded. A lawyer, Shigeru Tokoi, said that the recent search reminds one of the crackdown on Koreans in Japan including the suppression of national education on the eve of the Korean war. Akira Iwai, chairman of the Japan Committee for Supporting the Independent and Peaceful Reunification of Korea, said he, as a Japanese, cannot tolerate the assault on a Korean girl student and unreasonable police search of Chongnyon when the DPRK-USA talks had collapsed and the Korean situation had become more strained. Yasusaburo Hoshino, an honourary professor at Rikkyo University, said the recent search was like a rehearsal to mobilize the "Self-Defence Forces" in Japan in case a war breaks out in the Korean peninsula. He denounced this as an unpardonable act to incite the fever of the second Korean war.
