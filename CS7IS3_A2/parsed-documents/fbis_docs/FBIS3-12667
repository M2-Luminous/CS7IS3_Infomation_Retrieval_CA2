The budget bill was presented to the Majles on 30 Azar [21 December] by 'Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani, president of the republic. Statements from the Majles and opinions expressed in the Islamic Republic's economic circles concerning the 1373 budget are focused on three basic points: the assessment of oil revenues for the coming fiscal year, Note 25 of the budget bill concerning the prices of some government services and goods, and finally the issue of foreign debt repayment. Oil Revenue The most important point of debate for the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget is naturally the question of foreign exchange revenues from crude oil exports. In the bill presented by the government, 22,000 billion rials[R] of the government's R34,000 billion in revenues, equal to $12.8 billion, is calculated based on the sale of oil. This amount, which is roughly equal to Iran's oil revenues in the current solar year, is being severely criticized by the deputies. The deputies in the majority faction of the Majles consider the revenues from the sale of oil as projected in the budget bill to be "unrealistic." Finally, after much discussion, on Sunday 10 Bahman [30 January] they decreased the figure to $10.15 billion. The note pertaining to oil revenues, which was approved by the Majles, makes no reference to the volume of exports or to the price per barrel of oil. To the figure of $10.15 billion must be added the $600 million expected from natural gas exports. We note that according to Aqazadeh, Iran's petroleum minister, oil revenues from 1 Farvardin 1372 [21 March 1993] to 30 Dey [20 January 1994] the same year reached $11.38 billion. This figure was $2.8 billion, or about 20 percent less than the projected amount. The projected figure of $12.8 billion in oil revenues in Hashemi-Rafsanjani's proposed budget was severely criticized in the last few weeks by the majority faction in the Majles. In a harsh editorial published in the newspaper RESALAT on 28 Dey [18 January], Morteza Nabavi questioned the fundamental assumptions of the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget. He wrote: The nation's general revenues for the year 1373 were projected at R33,767 billion, and this was a 42.5-percent increase over the general revenues for the current year. In view of the sharp drop in oil prices for the current year and the failure to realize this year's revenues, the outlook for oil prices in the coming year is not bright or hopeful. The failure of OPEC members to agree to reduce the production ceiling, increased oil production in the North Sea, and reduced oil extraction costs for non-OPEC nations, create an uncertain future for oil prices. In view of the above elements, Morteza Nabavi concludes that the price of oil in the year 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] will be less than $10 billion. Note 25 The second controversial point is Note 25 in the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] National Budget Bill. If approved in the form proposed by the government, there would be increases of 100 to 140 percent in the prices of some oil products. Economic circles in the IRI say that keeping prices low on oil products, which is really paying major subsidies on these products, cost the country about $10 billion in the year 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994]. In reality, the very heavy consumption of oil products in the country is caused by their very low prices, which in some cases have remained unchanged since after the revolution. For example, the price of a liter of gasoline in Iran is equivalent to 15 centimes in France, meaning one-fortieth of its price in France! This situation causes Iran's oil products to be smuggled to neighboring countries, especially Turkey, where the price of gasoline is 20 times the price in Iran. Concerning Note 25 and its consequences for Iran's economy there are two different views in the Islamic Republic's economic circles. One group says that with the increase in the price of oil products, people will not be wasteful and consequently the government can export some of what would be consumed domestically and increase its foreign exchange revenues. On the other side, opponents of Note 25 say that Iran's ability to export oil cannot be increased that much and that it would be difficult for the government to increase oil exports by decreasing domestic consumption. In this case, the only effect of increasing the price of oil products would be an explosive growth in inflation, while the effect on the nation's foreign exchange revenues would be insignificant. The Majles finally approved Note 25, but it did not accept the increase in price for oil and gas products expected by Hashemi-Rafsanjani. With 118 votes in favor, 92 votes in opposition, and 2 abstentions, the Majles rejected a proposal to reject all of Note 25, and authorized the government in 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] to increase the average price of a cubic meter of gas to R12.4, and to increase the price of a liter of the four oil products to the following maximum amounts: R80 for gasoline, R20 for kerosene, R10 for furnace oil, and R15 for gasoil, and the difference between the prices set and the prices for 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994] would be deposited into the nation's general revenue account as oil and gas product taxes. Foreign Debts The third issue, which has brought on a great struggle between the government and the Majles deputies, is the repayment of Iran's foreign debt. In its proposed budget for 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] the government assumes that $1 billion of the nation's oil revenues will be used to reduce the level of foreign commitments. The majority faction in the Majles considers this figure insignificant in view of the volume of the nation's debt, and it believes that a schedule for repaying these debts is the first and most important issue, which must be clarified before any decision is made about the 1373 budget. Ever since studying the budget bill (9 Bahman [29 January]), Mahmud Astaneh, deputy from Sarband-e Araq, as the first opponent of the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget bill, gave vigorous emphasis to the government's foreign debt. He said: It is entirely regrettable that in the year 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994] we were faced with $10 billion in unpaid debt, and in the worst form, meaning several thousand small debts to different countries, and this shows lack of management on the part of the nation's economic experts. Yet in the year 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] we will incur roughly an additional $6 billion in debts. The speaker accused the Central Bank of illegally using government assets and said: Under Note 29 of the 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994] budget bill, the Central Bank was required to act in such a way that the amount of commitments at the end of the year [20 March 1994] would be 15.72 percent less than it was at the beginning of the year [21 March 1993]. However, it was observed how the chief of the Central Bank's performance and economic revolution amounted to an auction of the dollars obtained through the sale of national capital.... The deputy from Sarband-e Araq also added: One of the most important issues with which the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget must deal is setting up a schedule for the repayment of foreign debt, and yet in its proposed budget the government is asking authorization for taking on another $5.4 billion in foreign exchange commitments. 'Adeli's Return On the other hand, Mohammad Hoseyn 'Adeli, whose position as president seems to be solidified, has again returned to the public eye, and in an interview with the English-language newspaper TEHRAN TIMES, published on 28 Dey [18 January], he claimed that "the government or the Central Bank do not owe a cent to any country or company. Rather, it is the private companies and Iran's commercial banks who have foreign debt, and even these debts are not fixed and they change over time." The chief of the Central Bank said Iran's total outstanding debt is $8 billion, and he attributed that to the failure of insurance agencies to grant coverage to Iran's mid-term and long-term credits. In response to 'Adeli's remarks, the newspaper SALAM, in its "Notes" published Sunday 3 Bahman [23 January], wrote: Really, if someone said such a thing who had no knowledge of the science of economics or banking affairs it would not be surprising, but when the Central Bank chief says such a thing, it is very surprising. We do not know whether the central banks chiefs in other countries can say such things or not, and if they do, can they still continue working at their jobs? Does he expect foreign insurance companies to pay for the Central Bank's failure to manage its foreign repayments? It is truly interesting that he says Iran does not owe a cent to any country or company, but that it is these private companies and Iran's commercial banks who have foreign debt. We ask him, from what bank have Iranian citizens gotten credit certification for their import purchases? Did they not give rial amounts equivalent to the foreign exchange to the Central Bank and other banks, and did they not establish credit certification for the purchases? In reality, before making any kind of purchase, Iranian citizens give the equivalent amount in rials to the banks and after that it is these banks who deal with the foreign companies, and no Iranian citizen is in debt for this credit, it is the banks who are in debt and we all know that the banks in Iran are government banks. That is, it is the Government of Iran that is in debt, and nothing is changed by saying such things.
