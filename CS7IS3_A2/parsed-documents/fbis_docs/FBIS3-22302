"More than 60 developing nations have ratified the convention on the Law of the Sea, and the United States and other advanced nations have said they, too, will participate. A convention will be launched encompassing all countries in the near future," Han said in his report to the National Assembly Committee on Foreign Affairs and Reunification. "The government will seek assembly ratification and preparatory work on relevant domestic laws," he said. The pact on biological diversity went into effect last year but South Korea is yet to sign it. Seoul plans to join the pact within the first half of this year, the foreign minister said.
