FR940302-1-00007 FR940302-1-00002 The value of total U.S. imports of cattle in 1992 was $1.24 billion, and the value of total U.S. imports of sheep in 1992 was about $2 million. The United States did not import any cattle or sheep from Hungary during 1992. In fact, with the exception of a small number of cattle imported from the former Czechoslovakia, no cattle or sheep were imported into the United States from any country in Europe during 1992 (USDA, Economic Research Service [ERS], ``Foreign Agricultural Trade of the United States: Calendar Year 1992 Supplement,'' 1992). Clearly, Europe is not a source of ruminants for the United States, and it is unlikely that declaring Hungary free of rinderpest and FMD would have any effect on the existing trade patterns. Due to current APHIS restrictions, the United States does not import any uncooked meat or meat products from Hungary. Total U.S. meat production in 1991 (excluding pork) was just under 10.7 million metric tons, while Hungarian meat production in 1991 reached approximately 115,000 metric tons, about 1 percent of the U.S. total (USDA, National Agricultural Statistics Service, ``Agricultural Statistics, 1992,'' 1992). Therefore, even if Hungary exported a significant portion of its meat production exclusively to the United States, which is unlikely, the effect of those exports on U.S. domestic prices or supplies would be negligible. As with the ruminants and meat products discussed above, the Department does not anticipate a major increase in exports of milk and milk products from Hungary into the United States as a result of this proposed rule. The importation into the United States of all dairy products, except for casein and other caseinates, is restricted by quotas. Although the importation of casein into the United States is not regulated by quotas, world prices of casein are competitively set. The United States does not produce casein, but does import more than half of the casein produced in the world. The regulations currently allow casein and other caseinates to be imported into the United States from countries where rinderpest or FMD exists if the importer has applied for and obtained written permission from the Administrator. The United States imported about 662 metric tons of casein from Hungary in 1992 (USDA, ERS, ``Foreign Agricultural Trade of the United States: Calendar Year 1992 Supplement,'' 1992). Declaring Hungary free of rinderpest and FMD, thus removing the requirement for written permission from the Administrator, is not expected to have any effect on the amount of casein imported into the United States from Hungary because the current restrictions do not substantially impede imports. The importation of bovine semen and cattle embryos from countries affected with rinderpest and FMD is restricted under 9 CFR part 98. Although this proposed rule would have the effect of removing certain restrictions on the importation of bovine semen and cattle embryos from Hungary, the economic effect of this proposed rule on the bovine semen and cattle embryo industries is also expected to be minimal. The United States is a net exporter of bovine semen and cattle embryos. In 1992, the value of U.S. bovine semen and cattle embryo imports was $4 million and $195,000, respectively, while the value of U.S. bovine semen and cattle embryo exports was $49.3 million and $6.8 million, respectively (USDA, ERS, ``Foreign Agricultural Trade of the United States: Calendar Year 1992 Supplement,'' 1992). Although it is likely that a few U.S. importers would be interested in importing bovine semen or cattle embryos from Hungary if this proposed rule is adopted, the amount of each that might be imported would be minimal when compared to U.S. domestic production. Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that this action would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Executive Order 12778 This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. If this proposed rule is adopted: (1) All State and local laws and regulations that are inconsistent with this rule will be preempted; (2) no retroactive effect will be given to this rule; and (3) administrative proceedings will not be required before parties may file suit in court challenging this rule. Paperwork Reduction Act In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ), the information collection or recordkeeping requirements included in this proposed rule have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and there are no new requirements. The assigned OMB control number is 0579&hyph;0015. List of Subjects in 9 CFR Part 94 Animal diseases, Imports, Livestock, Meat and meat products, Milk, Poultry and poultry products, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Accordingly, 9 CFR part 94 would be amended as follows: PART 94_RINDERPEST, FOOT-AND-MOUTH DISEASE, FOWL PEST (FOWL PLAGUE), VELOGENIC VISCEROTROPIC NEWCASTLE DISEASE, AFRICAN SWINE FEVER, HOG CHOLERA, AND BOVINE SPONGIFORM ENCEPHALOPATHY: PROHIBITED AND RESTRICTED IMPORTATIONS
