FR941202-1-00010 FR941202-1-00002 (b) Instructions and Equations for the Total Annual Loan Cost Rate (b)(5) Number of Unit-Periods Between Two Given Dates The proposed total annual loan cost rates are based on a proposed assumption that the reverse mortgage transaction begins on the first day of the month in which consummation is estimated to occur. The total annual loan cost rates are good faith estimates based on a number of assumptions. The Board believes that using fractional unit-periods required under Appendix J for calculating APRs is unnecessary for these disclosures, and has not incorporated many definitions relating to time intervals. (b)(8) Solution of General Equation by Iteration Process Rather than restate the iteration process required to be used in determining total annual loan cost rates under the appendix, the Board has referred lenders to Appendix J of this regulation for the procedures to be followed. The Board solicits comment on whether this is sufficient guidance to reverse mortgage lenders. (b)(9) Assumption for Discretionary Cash Advances Some reverse mortgage transactions permit consumers to control when advances are received. The proposed regulation requires creditors to use a special assumption for calculating the total annual loan cost rate in this case. Creditors must assume that 50 percent of the amount of the credit line is advanced when the consumer becomes obligated under the transaction (at the interest rate then in effect) and that no further advances are made during the remaining term. The Board believes this assumption is appropriate for reverse mortgage credit lines, given that the amount and timing of advances (thus, the estimated interest owed) are within the consumer's control. The proposal also is consistent with Appendix D's requirements for an estimated interest figure when the amount and timing of construction loan advances are unknown, as well as with HUD's HECM program. Creditors would follow this approach for estimating interest on open-end reverse mortgage credit lines. Once the interest figure is determined, creditors would use the general equation in section (b)(8) of this appendix to calculate the total annual loan cost rate. (b)(10) Assumption for Variable-Rate Reverse Mortgage Transactions Regulation Z provides that to calculate the APR, creditors offering variable-rate transactions must base disclosures on the initial interest rate and not assume the rate will increase. The Board proposes to adopt the same convention for calculating total annual loan cost rates. The Board notes, however, that HUD's HECM program requires creditors to assume an ``expected average mortgage interest rate'' or ``expected interest rate'' instead of the initial rate. The convention required by HUD reflects an average of long-term U.S. Treasury securities and results in a rate that is generally higher than the initial rate. The Board solicits comments on the benefits to consumers and burdens to creditors if creditors offering variable-rate reverse mortgage transactions were required to use both HUD's and the proposed assumptions to compute total annual loan cost rates. (b)(11) Assumption for Closing Costs The proposed regulation requires creditors to assume all closing and other consumer costs are financed by the creditor. These costs are generally financed as a part of the transaction, and the Board believes the proposed assumption provides uniformity. (c) Examples of Total Annual Loan Cost Rate Computations Three examples are provided to assist creditors in calculating the total annual loan cost rate. The Board solicits comment on whether other examples should be provided, and if so, what should be illustrated. (d) Reverse Mortgage Model Form and Sample Form The proposed regulation requires that the matrix be accompanied by a disclosure substantially similar to the model form in this paragraph. Reverse mortgages are complicated transactions, and the Board believes a uniform disclosure would enhance consumer understanding of the proposed transaction and promote informed comparison shopping. The proposed model form and sample form are placed in this appendix, because they apply to both open-end and closed-end reverse mortgage transactions. This avoids publishing the forms twice, in Appendix G (Open-end model forms and clauses) and Appendix H (Closed-end model forms and clauses). Appendix L_Assumed Loan Periods for Calculation of Total Annual Loan Cost Rates As stated previously, the law requires the total annual loan cost rate disclosures for reverse mortgage transactions to be based on three assumed loan periods, as determined by the Board. The proposed regulation tracks the assumed loan period requirements of HUD's HECM program (two years, a period equal to the youngest consumer's life expectancy, and a period 1.4 times that consumer's life expectancy).
