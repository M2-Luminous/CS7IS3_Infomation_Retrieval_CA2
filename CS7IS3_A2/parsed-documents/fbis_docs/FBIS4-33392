In a clear reference to [Former President] Julio Maria Sanguinetti and [Montevideo Mayor] Tabare Vazquez, whose names he did not mention, De Posadas said the promises they made regarding subsidies "are cheap and lying demagoguery because neither of them has the slightest intention of fulfilling their promises." Speaking on the radio program "New Time for Everyone," De Posadas said "the development of the sugar industry in Uruguay...is irreversible and those who made those promises to the Bella Union people are lying." Sanguinetti and Tabare Vazquez visited Bella Union and questioned the government policy. De Posadas said: "One of them is new to lying. The other is older but, despite the promises he made in Bella Union to help the sugar cane producers and sugar industry, during his administration he allowed the sugar beet industry to collapse without implementing any measures. One must remember this." Ignacio De Posadas spoke about the university conflict, saying it is being "politicized, radicalized, and lied about." He questioned the "unrealistic terms" with which salary demands are being made. He said: "If the 6-percent wage increase authorized by Congress is granted, or if any other increase is granted, the quality of Uruguayan education will remain exactly the same." De Posadas said that while students showed great imagination in their marches and their demonstrations, "they filed away the deans' university reform proposals, thus avoiding a discussion on their future. No effort is being made to really solve the problem."
