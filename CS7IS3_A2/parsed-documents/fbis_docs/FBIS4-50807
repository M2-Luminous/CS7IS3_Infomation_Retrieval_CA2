Xu Qing, deputy secretary of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and director of the State Council Office for Checking Unhealthy Tendencies in Business Activities, pointed out: The work of correcting the irregularity of spending public funds on sightseeing tours abroad has a good momentum, but the task remains very arduous. All localities and departments should take a further step to formulate measures, improve and strictly enforce rules and regulations, perpetuate the correction results, prevent a comeback, and strive for remarkable new interim achievements this year. State Councillor Li Guixian and Hou Zongbin, deputy secretary of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, attended the forum and expressed their views on the matter. Others present at the meeting included Li Shizhong, State Council deputy secretary-general; Xia Daosheng, State Council Foreign Affairs Office deputy director; and responsible persons of the Foreign Ministry, the Public Security Ministry, and nine other departments which have the authority to approve overseas travel requests, as well as the responsible persons of the departments of which more personnel are involved in overseas travel on official business. Xu Qing said in his speech: Generally speaking, all localities and departments, attaching importance to this matter, have worked in accordance with the central authorities' instructions and seriously reexamined those overseas travels which were actually sightseeing trips in disguised form made by officials at government expense since 1 July 1992. Some provinces and municipalities have sternly dealt with problems discovered through the reexamination. At the same time, they have stopped and canceled a number of unnecessary overseas official business study tours and training activities. However, the progress of the work is uneven. Other localities and departments are not as serious and meticulous in reexamining overseas travels, nor are they sternly dealing with discovered problems. In some organizations and localities, the practice of making overseas sightseeing trips in disguised form at government expense remains unchanged. Some localities and organizations are still organizing government-funded inter-regional or inter-departmental overseas sightseeing tours. Xu Qing put forward a three-point view on this year's work: -- It is necessary to continue doing a good job in screening the overseas travels which were actually sightseeing trips in disguised form made by officials at government expense since 1 July 1992, and to stop the unhealthy tendency of making such trips. No locality nor department is permitted to organize government-funded overseas sightseeing tours under any pretext. Anyone who makes an overseas sightseeing trip in disguised form at government expense should be required to pay the "three expenses [san fei 0005 6316]" and be dealt with seriously. To deal with the travel regulations violators, we must not merely warn them not to repeat the violation. -- To stop the unauthorized overseas sightseeing trips, we should take both stopgap and radical measures this year. The stress of the work should be put on stopping unhealthy tendencies, enforcing discipline, and preventing a comeback. First, we should get at the root of the problem. In particular, the central government organs should proceed from strictly formulating official business overseas travel plan and examine official travel requests in a responsible way. Second, we should closely watch the applications for travel to popular destinations and resolutely reduce excessive overseas travels. Third, we should stop any government-funded overseas travels processed through the tourism department and improve the control of overseas training activities by the proper departments. Fourth, it is necessary to improve rules and regulations and the procedures for examining and approving overseas travel applications. -- It is necessary to step up supervision and inspection, and to accept the supervision by the masses. Any organizations or individuals who violate the travel regulations should be placed on file for investigation and sternly dealt with. The responsible persons of the State Science and Technology Commission, the National Tourism Administration, and the State Bureau of Foreign Experts Affairs delivered reports at the meeting on their efforts to correct the irregularity of overseas sightseeing tours at government expense.
