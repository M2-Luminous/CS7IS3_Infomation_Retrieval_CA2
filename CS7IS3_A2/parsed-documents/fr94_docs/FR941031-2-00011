FR941031-2-00011 FR941031-2-00008 Foreign-Trade Zones Board [Docket 32&hyph;94] Proposed Foreign-Trade Zone; Anniston, AL (Birmingham Customs Port of Entry); Application and Public Hearing An application has been submitted to the Foreign-Trade Zones Board (the Board) by the Anniston-Calhoun County Airport Commission (an Alabama public corporation), requesting authority to establish a general-purpose foreign-trade zone in Anniston, Alabama, adjacent to the Birmingham Customs port of entry. The application was submitted pursuant to the provisions of the Foreign-Trade Zones Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 81a-81u), and the regulations of the Board (15 CFR part 400). It was formally filed on October 18, 1994. The applicant is authorized to make the proposal under Act No. 77&hyph;498, Section 33&hyph;1&hyph;30 of the Code of Alabama, 1975, as amended. The proposed zone would be the second general-purpose zone in the Birmingham Customs port of entry area. The existing zone, FTZ 98, Birmingham, was authorized in 1984 (Grantee: City of Birmingham, Alabama, Board Order 247, 49 F.R. 19367, 5/7/84). The proposed foreign-trade zone site covers the Anniston Metropolitan Airport complex (563 acres), which is 90 miles west of Atlanta and 60 miles east of Birmingham. The airport complex includes air cargo facilities and an industrial park. It is owned by the City of Anniston and operated by the Airport Commission. The application contains evidence of the need for zone services in the Anniston area. Several firms have indicated an interest in using zone procedures for warehousing/distribution of such items as automotive equipment, electrical and electronic supplies, food and related products, and machinery. Specific manufacturing approvals are not being sought at this time. Requests would be made to the Board on a case-by-case basis. In accordance with the Board's regulations (as revised, 56 FR 50790&hyph;50808, 10&hyph;8&hyph;91), a member of the FTZ Staff has been designated examiner to investigate the application and report to the Board.
