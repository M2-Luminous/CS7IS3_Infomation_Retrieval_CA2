FR940822-1-00037 FR940822-1-00006 (i) Prepayment as described ยง30.35(f)(1); (ii) Surety method, insurance, or other guarantee method as described in ยง30.35(f)(2); or (iii) Statement of intent in the case of Federal, State, or local government licensees, as described in ยง30.35(f)(4). This provision has been included to assure that mechanisms have been established as necessary to ensure the continued effectiveness of the controls that may be used to meet the dose limit. The ongoing effectiveness of the restrictions will not necessarily be the responsibility of the former licensee but could be vested in other organizations, local governments, etc., which would continue cognizance of the action. This responsibility could include periodic monitoring, overviews of site access restrictions, or other activities that might be necessary to support the proposed controls. Under this provision, the amount of financial assurance that would be needed will be determined on a site-specific basis, taking into account the proposed restrictions, and the recommendations of the Site-Specific Advisory Board. (4) Residual radioactivity at the site has been reduced so that if the site were released for unrestricted use, the TEDE from residual radioactivity to the average member of the critical group is as low as reasonably achievable and would not reasonably be expected to exceed 100 mrem (1 mSv) per year. This limit coincides with the NRC dose limit for public exposure in 10 CFR Part 20. This final condition is premised on the assumption that circumstances could develop under which the restrictions, such as land use or deed restrictions, might no longer be effective in limiting the exposure scenarios. If, for example, a restriction against residential or agricultural use were no longer effective in preventing those uses of the land, then the assumptions about the exposure of the critical group would no longer be valid. While this is not assumed to occur for planning purposes, the Commission believes it is appropriate to have a ``safety net'' to prevent exposures in excess of the public dose limits. The development of this provision also has the effect of requiring that some remediation be conducted at the site, rather than simply allowing a licensee to develop a series of restrictions. The Commission believes it appropriate that basic measures be taken to reduce the risk and dose that could result from a site and that the public dose limits form the minimum acceptable level of protection that should be provided in the unlikely event that restrictions are not effective in reducing the magnitude and scenarios of exposure. The Commission specifically solicits public comment on the adequacy of the 100 mrem (1 mSv) per year value as the ``safety net'' to prevent exposures in excess of the public dose limits in the event that all site restrictions fail. The recommendations of the ICRP and NCRP, as well as Draft Federal Guidance being developed by the EPA, suggest constraining the dose to members of the public from any single source to less than 100 mrem/y as a way to ensure that the total public dose from all sources does not exceed 100 mrem/y. The Commission has followed this principle in establishing the dose limit for decommissioning. However, in the case of the ``safety net'', the Commission does not believe that fractionation would be necessary for the following reasons: (1) The 100 mrem/y cap, although being equivalent to the dose limit for members of the public, represents a small fraction of the 500 mrem/y dose that the Draft Federal Guidance suggests is acceptable for members of the public in unusual circumstances. The Commission believes that failure of all site restrictions at decommissioned sites is a highly unlikely event. (2) The 100 mrem/y value applies to the peak dose during the first 1000 years. For most radioisotopes, this peak dose occurs in the first year and diminishes over time due to radioactive decay. This decay provides an additional margin of safety which is equivalent to an a priori fractionation of the limit. (3) The 100 mrem/y value is less than the value selected for controlling intruder scenarios for other types of facilities where some type on institutional control (e.g. government ownership) is contemplated. However, the Commission is soliciting suggestions for alternatives to the proposed safety net, including the use of some fraction of 100 mrem/y (e.g., 75 mrem/y) as the safety net. The Commission is particularly interested in the relative merits of selecting a fraction of the routine public dose limit in light of the required conservatism in the calculation of the dose, and the rationale for selecting some particular fraction. The Commission is also soliciting comments on the relative benefits and impacts of the Commission's proposed safety net and proposed options, including comments on the number of facilities that could be impacted by selection of alternative values. The Commission recognizes there may be unusual circumstances in which the licensee may wish to seek an exemption from one or more of the provisions of this subpart. For example, the licensee may feel it is unnecessary to clean up a site to the requirements for unrestricted release because the site is contained within a larger area where use will be restricted for the foreseeable future. The Commission believes these rare circumstances can adequately be handled under existing provisions in ยง20.2301 which provides opportunity for the licensee to request an exemption from any of the provisions of 10 CFR Part 20. The Commission also recognizes there may be special environmental or cultural issues associated with a particular decommissioning action which would require more stringent implementation of the requirements in this subpart. For example, there may be social or cultural issues that have to be considered because the site is on or contiguous to historical sites or Native American lands which contain religious or sacred areas. However, the Commission believes these issues can best be handled on a site-by-site basis as part of the licensing process and, in most cases, would be taken into consideration when establishing ALARA residual radioactivity levels for a site. The Commission does not believe that further reductions in dose would be necessary to meet social or cultural issues if the limit for unrestricted use is achieved and ALARA has been applied. Where necessary, the provisions for public comment and for a Site-Specific Advisory Board will provide a mechanism for local citizens and other affected parties to be directly involved in addressing these issues.
