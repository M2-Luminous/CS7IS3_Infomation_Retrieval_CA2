There is rioting in Nabulus and Gaza, as well as in the Jabalyah refugee camp. Over 40 Gazans were wounded in rioting this morning. In Jericho and Ramallah, police stations were stoned and the IDF responded with fire and tear gas. In Jabalyah, a terrorist tried to throw explosives, but they blew up in his hands. Four border policemen were also wounded in the territories this morning. The IDF spokesman said the forces have been beefed up in the territories. Thousands of Muslim worshipers are still congregated on Jerusalem's Temple Mount, and many of them rioted and hurled stones at police forces, the media, and the Western Wall. The police used tear gas to stop the stone throwing. Large police forces are concentrated around the Temple Mount to prevent the rioting from expanding. Seven policemen were hurt in clashes on the Temple Mount. Our correspondent Aviv Bushinsky reports that it seems that there are casualties among the Muslim worshipers on the Temple Mount. There was also a riot by Muslim worshipers near Nabulus Gate. These worshipers were eventually dispersed and some of them detained.

In the meeting, the settlement leaders called on Major General Mufaz, the IDF commander in Judaea and Samaria, to step up the protection and safeguarding of Jewish residents in the territories.
