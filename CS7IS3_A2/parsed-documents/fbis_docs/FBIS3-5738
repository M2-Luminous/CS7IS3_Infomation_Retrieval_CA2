"Our doors are still open," Ranariddh told reporters after he and Second Prime Minister Hun Sen held talks with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. "No negotiations, but we are ready to talk," Ranariddh said, adding that the Khmer Rouge "have to be more reasonable." Ranariddh and Hun Sen arrived in Tokyo on Wednesday to attend a two-day international conference on aid to Cambodia which began Thursday. In his address to the conference, Ranariddh urged the international community "to help...solve the question of the Khmer Rouge as best it can" by seeing to it that the provisions of the October 1991 Paris peace agreements on Cambodia are strictly implemented. In a barb clearly aimed at neighboring Thailand, which has been repeatedly accused by the Cambodian Government of allowing the Khmer Rouge sanctuary across the border, Ranariddh urged all signatories of the Paris agreements to fully respect them. Ranariddh's father King Norodom Sihanouk, in a message read out at the conference, held out an olive branch to the Khmer Rouge, saying that "the door remains open to the most moderate elements and I do not despair of their future integration, there being an irresistible spirit towards total national reconciliation." Christopher warned in his address that considering that the Khmer Rouge has not yet disarmed, "the future of democracy in Cambodia can hardly be taken for granted."
