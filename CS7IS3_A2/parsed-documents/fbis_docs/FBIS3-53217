The subsequent meetings that resulted in the signing of cooperation protocols and, in some cases, of agreements indicate that these two contiguous provinces have frequent and close exchanges. It can be stated that economic and commercial moves have been initiated and are continuing but that these moves are not as dynamic as had been envisaged. The reason for this slow pace is the political situation in Afghanistan, especially in its central government. The government has not been able to establish a security framework and is still grappling with acute political problems, which is why it is paying less attention to economic issues. On the other hand, the political fervor is not the same all over Afghanistan. There is more stability in Herat Province than there is in the capital, which is why economic and commercial relations with Khorasan are at the present level and are expected to expand. To become better acquainted with the current relations between Herat and Khorasan, our correspondent interviewed Engineer Ahmadi, the director general of the Economic Affairs Department of the Khorasan Governorate, and we draw our readers' attention to the detailed text of this interview: [EQTESAD-E KHORASAN] Could you please tell us about the economic protocols [preceding word in English] signed between the Provinces of Herat and Khorasan and to what extent they have been implemented? What results have been achieved so far? [Ahmadi] I should say that the economic protocols were signed to activate commercial relations in the private sector and that the trading companies in these provinces have become active. This is borne out by the customs statistics, and the exchange of commodities is continuing. Some of these agreements are based on offering technical and engineering services, as well as technological training and research matters, such as reconstruction of industrial and agricultural installations, planning, revival of fields, and repair of water sources. Some work has been done on this matter. A report on this subject has been submitted to the relevant officials and the necessary allocations have been made. These plans will be implemented as soon as the other side expresses its willingness to provide funds and designate the necessary backing. Of course, some of the agreements regarding the provision of free development services, pharmaceuticals, and pesticides for plant diseases and seed-yielding plants have been implemented. [EQTESAD-E KHORASAN] What is the situation on the transit of goods between Herat and Khorasan Provinces? [Ahmadi] The agreement on the transit of goods between the two countries expired last year and it took quite a while to extend it, but this was eventually done with the cooperation of Khorasan officials. Fortunately, it was approved in the Islamic Majles and the transit of goods continues between the two countries. The ingress and egress routes of these goods do not face any legal problems and traffic is continuing. [EQTESAD-E KHORASAN] There was mention of the establishment of joint border markets in the agreements between the provinces of Herat and Khorasan. Will this happen in the near future? [Ahmadi] Yes. It was mentioned in the agreements that joint border markets would be set up on the border in Eslam-qal'eh and Do Gharun and an agreement was signed on this matter. We have repeatedly expressed our willingness on the subject but Herat officials have stated that their final concurrence depends on approval by Kabul officials, and no results have been announced so far. However, there is no problem on our side. As soon as the other side expresses its willingness, we will be ready to set up the border market. We have set up border stores in Do Gharun unilaterally, which are very active and sell items required by returning Afghan refugees at reasonable prices to expedite the return of the refugees and to cater to their needs. These stores are relatively prosperous. [EQTESAD-E KHORASAN] Do the economic agreements only include Herat Province or do they encompass the other parts of Afghanistan as well? [Ahmadi] No. The agreements are not exclusively for Herat Province and Iranian traders are active in other parts of Afghanistan as well. Some of our transportation companies have succeeded in setting up offices in Herat and the exchange of goods with Herat, Heyratan, and Mazar-e Sharif continues. [EQTESAD-E KHORASAN] In the current conditions prevailing in Afghanistan, do you think that the necessary security exists regarding industrial and commercial investment? [Ahmadi] Of course, the economic officials of the two countries have announced their readiness to implement some of the protocols, such as putting the installations in Herat into operation, or joint investment in industrial and agricultural projects. We are optimistic that conditions will soon be conducive to their implementation. Afghanistan is currently in a transitional state and is moving from one set of circumstances to another, while the government is seeking to consolidate its position. It has to compile a new set of regulations and needs coordination. For this reason the implementation of new accords is being pursued with greater caution. As I stated earlier, since we opened our offices of representation our relations have flourished and, God willing, this will be a precursor to the implementation of agreements. It would be more expedient to act after reviewing the situation and the current circumstances. [EQTESAD-E KHORASAN] How far has the repair and renovation of highways progressed? [Ahmadi] According to the latest reports from the governorate's technical office, the road has been paved and is ready for asphalting. [preceding word in English] A segment of it had been scheduled for asphalting but it was postponed, probably because of the onset of cold weather and the need for a survey by the contractors. [EQTESAD-E KHORASAN] It has been decided that Khorasan Province would hold an industrial and trade exhibition in Herat Province. Could you elaborate on that? [Ahmadi] Regarding the forging of economic relations with neighboring countries, we consider the convening of trade and industrial exhibitions as the first step toward progress in this path, whether it is for the sale of goods or for the exchange of expertise. It was for this purpose that Khorasan Province announced its readiness to set up an exhibition in Herat Province a year ago. As soon as the go-ahead is given, and the other side is ready, we will immediately hold the exhibition. [EQTESAD-E KHORASAN] Have any measures been taken on banking relations? [Ahmadi] Some officials visited Herat to discuss the establishment of a branch of Saderat Bank and talks were held on the subject. We still await the other side's concurrence and we hope that a branch of the bank will be set up in Herat. [EQTESAD-E KHORASAN] Thank you very much.
