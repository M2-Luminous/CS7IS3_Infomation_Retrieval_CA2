At a 24 December news conference, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa apologized to the public for his failure to enact the political reform bills before the end of the year. Meanwhile, he failed to make clear-cut remarks on economic measures and did not indicate a concrete vision for the economy. Most of the people understand that political reform and economic measures are difficult issues which the Liberal Democratic Party has left unsolved and the new coalition administration cannot easily solve. Nevertheless, Prime Minister Hosokawa's recent remarks were unclear and not as frank as those made when he was inaugurated as prime minister. If the prime minister cannot speak in his "own" words, the public support rate for his administration will continue to drop. Amid the economic recession, this is a chilly situation. At the news conference, the prime minister first mentioned economic pump-priming measures. Most of the people must have strained their ears when the prime minister was explaining six economic measures after stating that he "was seriously concerned about the current economic situation." However, he did not refer to income tax reduction -- which is considered to be the most important issue at this point -- until the last of the six measures. Moreover, the prime minister did not indicate a concrete scale or timing for implementing income tax cuts. As the first five measures, the prime minister cited the following: promoting deregulation in areas that will produce immediate results; compiling a third supplementary budget for the current fiscal year in consideration of improvement of living conditions as well as promotion of research and development activities; helping those concerned with agriculture or small industries; implementing a total employment assistance program; and devising measures that will increase the liquidity of land. All of these are nothing new. Moreover, a package of those economic measures will have no great impact on the current economy. We cannot help wondering whether the prime minister has recognized the current situation of the worst post-war recession in which the supply-and-demand gap has reached 30 trillion yen. It has been said that the prime minister is considering a plan to reduce income tax by more than 6 trillion yen. However, at the news conference, the prime minister showed a cautious stance, stating that income tax cuts will be decided "in consideration of Tax Commission recommendations and the Hiraiwa [chairman of the Federation of Economic Organizations of Japan, Keidanren] Economic Reform Council report," and that "the decision should not be made hastily and the decision will be made by the time the fiscal 1994 budget is compiled." The prime minister's remarks made after fall seem to reflect the complicated management of the coalition of seven parties and one parliamentary group. It seems that in the field of economic policies, the prime minister has been strongly influenced by the Finance Ministry, which places importance on financial balance. It is regrettable that the prime minister's lilting actions have begun to make a poor show. What we strongly hope for the prime minister is to positively fulfill the leadership from his position as the highest politician. We hope the prime minister will play a more positive role in coordinating opinions within the coalition administration. When the leader serves as Kuroko [a Kabuki stagehand dressed in black to be inconspicuous, who assists actors in various ways during the performance], it is impossible to consolidate the unity of the coalition administration. Under the current circumstances, it is unforgivable to delay carrying out political reform. The serious, prolonged economic recession remains at the bottom. All possible measures should be taken to pull the sluggish economy from the bottom. The prime minister said: "We cannot choose the easy way of issuing deficit-covering national bonds." If that is the case, the prime minister should clarify what measures can be taken to secure revenue sources for implementing income tax cuts. While the prime minister is considering ideas of "making 1994 the first year for promoting deregulation" or of "setting up an economic measures council for dealing with revenue sources for tax cuts," actual business activities are being conducted to seek the way out of the recession. As a matter of course, the political vacuum is unforgivable. We would like the prime minister, in his capacity as the top politician, to clearly indicate his own scenario for carrying out political reform and revitalizing the economy.
