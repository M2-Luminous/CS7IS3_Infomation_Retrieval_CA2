He noted on this occasion that during his first year in office, he had said that a true state of law had not developed in Venezuela and that the citizens remained vulnerable, lacking efficient institutions to protect them. He emphasized that while reorganizing his department, autonomy for the Office of the Attorney General was achieved, and now neither the executive branch, the political parties, nor economic pressure groups are able to exert any influence upon it. In connection with the battle against corruption, he said that pioneering work was done. The results achieved included the prosecution of a president of the Republic in office and his consequent removal from government office. In this connection, the courts issued about 700 arrest warrants between 1989 and 1993, and they ordered civil prosecution in cases involving crimes against public property amounting to more than a billion bolivares. In connection with the Recadi case and the export bonds alone, about 6,000 prosecutions were initiated by the Office of the Comptroller, and a total of 228 arrest warrants were obtained. On this point, this official said that "it is absolutely essential to encourage the proper participation on the part of each of the sectors and bodies involved in the decisive battle being waged against the scourge of corruption. The task is not a simple one. It is possible to combat this evil. It can be reduced to much smaller dimensions if this problem is approached on an integral basis, with sincerity, and with an iron determination on the part of all to reduce it." [passage omitted] The defense of human rights as a factor limiting the exercise of power, and in particular, the civil and political rights whose enjoyment and exercise are basic to the survival of the state, merit separate consideration. The comptroller general pointed out that defense of the civil and political rights of the citizens is vital to the maintenance of a solid democratic system. He believes that reflection upon the two military uprisings in 1992 is necessary, since it has been a consistent requirement of the administration that the military authorities allow inspectors access to the military penal establishments so that they can verify that the human rights of the citizens subject to this jurisdiction are being respected. It has been established that there have been violations of the laws pertaining to citizens' rights by agents of the various police bodies. This official did not fail to note the actions of the agents of state security against the journalists investigating the origins of these incidents, and it was for this reason that he appealed to the MRI [Ministry of the Interior] to ensure respect for the right to free information. On the penitentiary issue, it was noted that the level of external and internal security at penal establishments has a direct effect on the exercise by the inmates of their human rights. [passage omitted] Economic Rights It is the opinion of the comptroller general that the Office of the Attorney General should be expanded with a view to undertaking the defense of the economic rights of the citizens. He emphasized that this need has become more obvious in view of the government intervention in the Banco Latino. "This shows how basic it is for an institution like the Office of the Attorney General to be concerned with the defense and oversight of the economic rights of the citizens." The comptroller general warned that the intensity of the battle against corruption must be maintained, because in large part the progress that has been made has to do with public opinion and the role played by the media, since they have joined as allies in this struggle. He believes that it is necessary to undertake more profound actions to recover the illicit funds that are located outside the national territory. These actions should include civil suits for the recovery of more than a billion bolivares in order to effect restitution for the losses caused to the public assets. This can be done, he said, if the actions and legal mechanisms for pursuing investigations abroad are coordinated.
