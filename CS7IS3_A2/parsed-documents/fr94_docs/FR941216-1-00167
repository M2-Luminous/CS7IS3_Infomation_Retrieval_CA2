ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) proposes to approve Illinois' May 18, 1994, request to repeal the Stage II vapor recovery control requirements in the Illinois State Implementation Plan for ozone in the East St. Louis (Metro-East) ozone nonattainment area which consists of three Illinois counties: Madison , Monroe and St. Clair. In the final rules section of this Federal Register , the USEPA is approving this action as a direct final rule without prior proposal because USEPA views this as a noncontroversial action and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the approval is set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to that direct final rule, no further activity is contemplated in relation to this proposed rule. If USEPA receives adverse comments, the direct final rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on the proposed rule. USEPA will not institute a second comment period on this action. Any parties interested in commenting on this notice should do so at this time. DATES: Comments on this proposed rule must be received on or before January 17, 1995. ADDRESSES: Written comments should be mailed to: J. Elmer Bortzer, Chief, Regulation Development Section, Regulation Development Branch (AR18&hyph;J), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 5, 77 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois 60604.
