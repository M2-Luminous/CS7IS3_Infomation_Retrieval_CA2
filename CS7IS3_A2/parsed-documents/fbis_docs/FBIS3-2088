The main purpose was to simplify it, unify tax rates, fairly share tax burdens, and create an environment for comparatively fair competition inside and outside enterprises according to the requirements of the market economy. However, shortly after the adoption of the new tax system, many manufacturers raised the prices of their products, and many wholesalers and retail shops also "followed suit," thus causing price disorder. In January and February, prices increased by an average of over 20 percent. This caused resentments among the masses. The authorities could not but decided to adopt price control measures as of 1 March. Reportedly, this year's taxation reform included the following four main points: First, reforming enterprise income taxes. In the past, different tax rates were applied to different types of enterprises. For example, the tax rate for foreign-funded enterprises was 33 percent, while the tax rate for state-owned enterprises was 55 percent. Thus, the state-owned enterprises were situated in an unfavorable position in market competition. After taxation reform, a unified tax rate of 33 percent was applied to all enterprises regardless of their ownership nature. Second, reforming circulation taxes. The original unified industrial and commercial taxes levied on foreign-funded enterprises were removed, and new circulation taxes, including value-added, consumption, and business taxes, were established and applied to all domestic-funded and foreign-funded enterprises. Third, reforming individual income taxes. For Chinese citizens, the part of personal income above 800 yuan per month is taxable; for non-mainland citizens, the part of personal income is that above $550 per month. It is a six-tiered progressive taxation system. The tax rate for the bottom tier is 5 percent and for the top tier 40 percent. Fourth, reforming other taxes. This included the imposition of land value-added taxes, securities transaction taxes, inheritance and gift taxes, and urban maintenance and construction taxes. According to an official in the State Administration of Taxation, after the completion of the taxation reforms, China's industrial and commercial taxes will decreased from 33 taxes in the past to 17, and the tax structure will become more reasonable. This will be conducive to the establishment of a market economic structure. The authorities repeatedly stated that taxation reform was just a structural adjustment. With the exception of a very small number of enterprises, the tax burden on enterprises would not increase. However, after the adoption of the new taxation system, the prices of many commodities increased immediately. Statistics show that in January, the prices of consumer goods in 35 large and medium-sized cities increased by 23.3 percent over the same period of last year. The prices of many commodities in Guangdong increased by 22 to 39 percent over the same period of last year. Some enterprises in Fujian even added a 17-percent tax to the enhanced prices. Ordinary people were naturally discontented with this situation, and complaints could be heard everywhere. According to a survey, the recent price hikes were mainly attributed to two reasons. First, some tax payers did not completely understand the new taxation system, and thought the value-added taxes meant that an amount equal to 13 percent or 17 percent of original prices would be added; and some even thought that a 17-percent value-added tax would be levied on every link of commodity circulation. Second, some tax payers took advantage of this opportunity to reap higher profits by raising prices. While facing the situation of price hikes, the tax department has more clearly explained the new taxation system, and in late February, the State Planning Commission and the State Administration of Taxation jointly issued a "Circular on the Necessity of Keeping Prices Stable After the Reform of the Taxation System" which stressed: "The difference between purchase prices and sale prices (calculated according to the current tax-included prices) for all consumer goods and producer goods (including chemical fertilizer, pesticide, and other farm production materials) must be kept unchanged in all wholesale and retail links. All taxes will be levied within the difference rate. No enterprise and unit can expand the difference rate without authorization." The circular also announced: "Severe disciplinary action should be taken to immediately correct the practice of changing the prices of commodities subject to prices fixed by the state without the approval of the price control department and the practice of raising prices without authorization in order to reap higher profits by taking advantage of taxation reform or doing this because of misunderstanding the new taxation system." Because the price hikes were not checked, the government then issued another decree, ordering that shops in the whole country must sell goods at prices approved by the authorities; otherwise, they may be fined up to 10,000 yuan. Then, the government announced that price controls will be exercised on 24 commodities which are people's daily necessities, and organized inspecting personnel to check shops in order to stabilize prices in the shortest possible period of time.
