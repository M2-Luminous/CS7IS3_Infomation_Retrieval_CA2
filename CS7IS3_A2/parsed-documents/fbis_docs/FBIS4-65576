Generally speaking, the next government will have to pursue the same policy as the current one, but that is scarcely what Lipponen's and Ehrnrooth's listeners had been expecting, writes Bo Stenstrom. Things went as many people had suspected they would -- on the same day that Social Democratic Party leader Paavo Lipponen and mining consultant Casimir Ehrnrooth were speaking at the People's Palace, the number of unemployed dropped by 30,000, and had it not been for the farmers' and forest owners' MTK [Agricultural Producers Association], there would have been no devil to attack. Excluding the attack on the MTK, the message by both Lipponen and Ehrnrooth seemed objective and responsible. But that was scarcely what their listeners had been expecting. It is true that Lipponen talked about speedy and selective economic stimulation and rapid tax relief as a way of increasing consumption. But he did not say what should be stimulated or by how much. It should be noted that the SDP leader favored an austere finance policy during the next election period in order to get the deficit in the national economy under control. And he said that the public economy's share of the gross national product was extremely high. There will not be enough room for investments in such an environment, Lipponen said. That is what Aho, Viinanen, Korkman, Koroma, and others are in the habit of saying. Is tax relief the answer? Lipponen said quite rightly that it is not sensible to postpone all tax relief until the economy improves -- an upswing that, incidentally, will probably occur sooner than the current indicators show. He also pointed out that there is no possibility of major tax changes, but at the same time, he said that we must look for opportunities to widen the tax base. That sounds hopeful -- but wait until Lipponen, who may end up as prime minister after the election, states specifically what is going to be taxed or what is going to be subjected to higher taxes and how much higher those taxes will be. That is something he ought to be talking about in plenty of time before the election. When Ehrnrooth talks about the MTK and timber prices, he is in the highest degree a party to the proceeding. It is not an easy matter to raise timber prices, but it should also be remembered that timber prices fell 40 percent before being increased by 15 percent. It is estimated that the export industry will earn about 2.5 billion markkas more thanks to the VAT [valued-added tax] reform this summer, and in connection with both the decision on nuclear power and that on the EU [European Union], the lumber industry has clearly stated that if the right decisions are not made, it will move abroad. And no one can guarantee the opposite no matter what happens. So there may be the sound of clinking glass in the house if it accuses others of "blackmail." Regardless of the MTK, more and more forest land is coming to be owned by someone other than farmers and MTK members. Many of those owners are average supporters of the SDP and Lipponen. Unlike the farmers, they cannot cut timber themselves and can scarcely afford to sell their forest property at a loss. Ehrnrooth was right about a lot of other things. The more pressure and even the more unforeseeable international effects we are exposed to (exchange rates and interest rates, for example), the more important it is that there be continuity and predictability in the economic policy over the long term. It would be ridiculous to claim that the current government ought to have continued the Blue-Red government's policy just for the sake of continuity -- even beyond the first budget, which it inherited -- after the bottom fell out completely. On the other hand, there is much in Lipponen's and Ehrnrooth's message to indicate that it should be possible to form a government across the center line after the election. The government should commit itself to a program extending into the following election period and based on the labor market, so that we do not squander the economic upswing through devastating inflation. If membership in the EU becomes a reality on the first of next year, Lipponen knows as well as Aho or Salolainen that that will put further pressure on the national economy. If someone is likely to become prime minister next spring, he does not need to learn from Siberia as long as there are public opinion polls. It remains to be seen whether the presidential election tactics will be repeated in such a way that Lipponen represents the indispensable prime minister approach while others take care of painting the current government in dark colors and building castles in the air for the future.
