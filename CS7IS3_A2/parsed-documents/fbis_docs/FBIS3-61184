The present Statute shall set forth conditions and procedures for the issuance of permits to recruit foreign labor in the Russian Federation, as well as certificates of the right to labor activities on the territory of the Russian Federation to foreign citizens. 2. The issuance of permits to recruit foreign labor (henceforth referred to as permits) and the monitoring of their use shall be effected by the Federal Migration Service of Russia on the suggestions of the organs of executive power of republics belonging to the Russian Federation, krays, oblasts, the autonomous oblast, autonomous okrugs, and cities with federal status. 3. The permits shall establish quotas for the recruitment of a certain number of foreign citizens, as a whole and by professional groups, who are hired by employers to work on the territories of republics belonging to the Russian Federation, krays, oblasts, the autonomous oblast, autonomous okrugs, and cities with federal status. 4. The permits may be issued to Russian legal entities, enterprises with foreign investment operating on the territory of the Russian Federation, as well as particular Russian and foreign individuals and stateless persons who reside on the territory of the Russian Federation and use the labor of hired employees in their personal economic units (henceforth referred to as employers). In the process, the duration of professional activities of the recruited foreign citizens shall not exceed the duration of validity of the permit. 5. An employer shall submit the following to the Federal Migration Service of Russia in order to obtain a permit: a petition; a proposal (findings) by the relevant organs of executive power of a republic belonging to the Russian Federation, kray, oblast, autonomous oblast, autonomous okrug, or city with federal status, substantiating the feasibility of the recruitment and use of foreign labor by the employer; a draft labor contract, or other documents, confirming a preliminary agreement with foreign citizens, or partners from abroad, concerning the intention and terms for the recruitment of foreign employees. In the process, the terms, wages, and occupational safety for foreign citizens, and their social welfare and insurance, shall be governed by the norms of the legislation of the Russian Federation, taking into account the specifics envisioned by state-to-state and government-to-government agreements of the Russian Federation with foreign countries. Enterprises, offices, and organizations reporting to the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation shall also submit, in order to receive permits, statements of consent by the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation for the recruitment of foreign employees. 6. Proposals (findings) by organs of executive power of republics belonging to the Russian Federation, krays, oblasts, the autonomous oblast, autonomous okrugs, and cities with federal status, concerning the recruitment of foreign labor by employers shall be based on the principle of the priority right of Russian citizens to fill vacant jobs, and shall be prepared taking into account the availability of equivalent labor on the territory in question and the absence of an opportunity to redistribute labor resources from other regions of the country, the provision of equal terms and wages for foreign employees compared to the citizens of the Russian Federation, and the prevention of any unfavorable impact on the employment conditions for Russian citizens due to the hiring of foreign citizens. 7. Decisions to issue permits shall be made by the Federal Migration Service of Russia within 30 days of the filing of the documents envisioned in point 5 of the present statute by the employer. If an expert review is required in order to make a decision, the decision shall be made within 15 days after the receipt of expert findings, but no later than 45 days from the date of the filing of the documents indicated. A substantiated denial of the issuance of a permit shall be forwarded, in writing, to the employer within five days after the decision to deny the issuance of a permit is made. 8. As a rule, permits shall be issued for a term of up to one year. Based on a substantiated request from an employer, the effect of a permit may be extended after it expires, but for no longer than one year. When the validity of a permit is extended, a fee in the amount envisioned for the issuance of a permit shall be collected from the employer. 9. A permit shall not be transferred to other employers. Foreign employees recruited on the basis of the permit may not be transferred to work for another employer. 10. A permit shall indicate: the name of the organ issuing the permit, the name and address of the employer to whom the permit has been issued and information on its state registration, the territory on which the permit applies, the number and breakdown of the recruited employees by profession, their country of origin or regular residence, grounds for the issuance of the permit, its duration of validity, and other data in keeping with the format given in Appendix No. 1. A permit shall be signed by the executive official empowered by the chief of the Federal Migration Service of Russia, and is certified with a seal. 11. Employers who have received permits to recruit foreign labor must, within one month, forward to the Federal Migration Service of Russia information on the signing of labor contracts with foreign employees on the basis of the permits. 12. In the event that an employer violates the conditions of the present statute indicated in the permit, as well as the legislation of the Russian Federation, as a result of which the rights of foreign employees are infringed upon, the Federal Migration Service may suspend the effect of the permit until the violations that have been allowed to occur are rectified, or give instructions to rectify them by a certain date. In the event of a failure to rectify the violations before the specified date, the permit may be revoked by a decision of the Federal Migration Service of Russia. An employer may be deprived of the right to use a permit, without notice, for an action, or a failure to act, that results in the danger of death for people or injury to their health. 13. An issued permit shall cease to be valid, regardless of the expiration of the term for which it was issued, in the event that an employer discontinues his economic operations or implements measures to reduce the number or authorized complement of employees. 14. A foreign citizen who has entered the Russian Federation with a view to engaging in professional activities may work for hire on the territory of the Russian Federation only if he holds a certificate of the right to labor activities issued in his name on the basis of a permit received by the employer, in keeping with the format given in Appendix No. 2. In cases envisaged by point 16 of the present statute, certificates of the right to labor activities in the territory of the Russian Federation shall be issued to foreign citizens without permits being processed. 15. Certificates of the right to labor activities shall be issued to foreign citizens working as hired labor for an employer within the limits of the number of recruited foreign labor established in a permit, as well as in the cases envisioned by point 16 of the present statute, by the territorial organs of the Federal Migration Service of Russia, in response to a petition in keeping with the format given in Appendix No. 3, provided that a foreign citizen agrees. 16. Foreign citizens from among highly skilled specialists shall be recruited on the basis of the certificate of the right to labor activities without permits being processed in the event of being hired by employers to work at enterprises with foreign investment operating on the territory of the Russian Federation in the positions of enterprise managers, their deputies, and chiefs of divisions (including separate divisions) of these enterprises. 17. The Federal Migration Service of Russia shall forward, to the relevant diplomatic missions and consular establishments of the Russian Federation abroad, information concerning the permits issued, which shall constitute grounds for the receipt, by foreign citizens, of the entry and exit visas with the right to be hired for work. 18. The compulsory procedures for the issuance of permits, as well as certificates of the right to labor activities, established by the present statute shall not apply to foreign citizens who, in keeping with the legislation of the Russian Federation: have been officially recognized as refugees; permanently reside on the territory of the Russian Federation; have been granted asylum on the territory of the Russian Federation; have filed petitions to be granted refugee status and have been issued temporary residence permits.
