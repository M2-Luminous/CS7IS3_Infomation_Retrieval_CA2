Following a number of delays and what appeared to be considerable reluctance on the part of the head of state, President Nino Vieira, to endorse the electoral process, a census was finally held last month. An electoral list has been drawn up and a new date, Sunday July 3, has been fixed. The election campaign officially opens today, but it seems campaigning has not got off to a good start. I asked the British honorary consul in Bissau, John Van Marnan, who is an observer of the electoral process, if he thought the parties were ready for electioneering. [Begin recording] [Van Marnan] Most of them are....[pauses] The thing is that, apparently, there are already rich parties and poor parties, and some of the rich parties consider themselves to be big parties. There is a subsidy of state worth a total of $400,000 to be divided among the parties, and they desperately need the funds to actually start the campaign. As far as I know, the government hasn't paid this money yet, but I have information that payment will be made on Monday [13 June] or Tuesday next week. The parties will need vehicles, and transport, and bicycles, and all that to meet the electorate, and it is already a small setback on the campaign because of the lack of funds that the campaign can't really start today. [Martin] And which parties are asking for more money? When you refer to rich parties and poor parties, who are the ones you think are rich and who are the ones who are demanding more facilities? [Van Marnan] Well, as far as I know, the PCD [expansion unknown] party, for example, is supported. The president of the PCD party is a big businessman in Bissau. So, probably, a lot of private money is pumped into this party. Also, Guinea-Bissau Resistance-Bafata Movement has a fairly strong support, as far as people say, from the Guineans living in Portugal. The PAIGC [African Party for the Independence of Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde] doesn't seem to have too many lacks of funds. On the other hand, the smaller parties that lived off contributions from their friends, they really have difficulties to get ends meet as far as money is concerned. [sentence as heard]. [Martin] Who is going to resolve the issue of the money? Is it up to the National Electoral Commission? [Van Marnan] Well, I know there is going to be an emergency meeting on Monday to decide how to divide the $400,000 made available by the government, and it seems the most logical division of the money will be that everybody sort of receives the same amount. [Martin] You suggested that the PAIGC, the ruling party, were in a strong position. Obviously, they have been in government and they have a certain hold on the administrative structures in the country. Are there any other reasons why you feel that they are strong? [Van Marnan] Well, we just watch television, and we see that every time there is a public speech by the president, there are an awful lot of people there, and the whole town is already covered by big posters of head of the president and Vote for Nino Vieira, and that also gives the impression that they have done a lot already, and it gives an impression of being there, while many of the other parties haven't put any poster up yet. (?Also) I have seen Bafata posters and I have seen PCD posters, and there is this other independent candidate for the presidency, (Carlos Gomez), and he is there with big posters, but from all the others I haven't seen anything yet.
