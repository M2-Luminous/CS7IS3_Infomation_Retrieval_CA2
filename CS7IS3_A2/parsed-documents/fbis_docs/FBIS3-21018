They claim: "It is a one-off problem relating to a part failure or a machining accident for one of the components in the third stage." Nevertheless, Ariane's third stage, based on the use of a cryotechnical engine that is extremely difficult to master since it is fueled by a mixture of liquid hydrogen and oxygen at minus 251 degrees Celsius and minus 184 degrees Celsius respectively, is really the "ill-fated" part of the launcher, since it has led to four of the six failed flights. The initial technical data once again clearly points the finger at this third stage, and more specifically its engine. After several operations engineers spoke at Kourou of a "loss of pressure" when the failure occurred, the theory was postulated of a failed roller bearing in the engine's turbopump. It seems that initial flight data analyses soon showed the bearing to be heating up. This would have led to it blocking and prematurely stopping the turbopump injecting hydrogen and oxygen into the combustion chamber. Weighing some 30 kg, this turbopump is without doubt the most fragile Ariane component. It delivers 400 kilowatts of power, the same as a high speed train, and rotates at 63,000 rpm. Throughout its 600 seconds of operation in normal flight it has to undergo extreme stress, and is less than 50 cm from temperatures of minus 251 degrees Celsius at the hydrogen injection point and plus 1,500 degrees Celsius in the combustion chamber. Without re-examining the design of the engine itself, it is clear that even the slightest machining error or flaw in the alloys can have devastating consequences.
