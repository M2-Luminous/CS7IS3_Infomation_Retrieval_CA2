Judging from the contents, except for calling on the three conflicting factions to resume talks within two weeks and work hard to reach a cease-fire agreement for a period of four months, which are new, the present proposal basically reiterated the position on the issues of delimiting the boundaries in B-H, lifting sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and so on, as contained in the original peace plan proposed by the European Union. However, the fact that the U.S. position has obviously moved closer to the European Union's plan is the largest progress that has been made. As everybody knows, involvement of the big powers was a factor of the outbreak of conflict in B-H and the fact that peace efforts for the area have been repeatedly frustrated lies primarily in the diverse policies adopted by the big powers because of their different interest considerations. Now, the big powers have put forward a common plan after all. Even though it is still very difficult to put it into practice, people hope that it will be a good beginning for the political solution of the conflicts in B-H. Sensible Voices In his speech in the U.S. Senate on 16 May, Senate Minority Leader, Republican Senator Dole said: "The President should immediately announce that he will unconditionally extend the most favored nation [MFN] status to China." He also stressed that the President "should frankly say what we, the great majority of people, have known for a long time: The practice of linking trade with human rights will not work. This policy has gone bust." Meanwhile, 106 congressmen signed a joint letter to Clinton on 17 May, urging him to extend the MFN status to China. As 3 June draws near, the day on which U.S. President Clinton will make his decision on this issue, the intelligent voices from men of insight in the government and the public have become louder and louder. Strictly speaking, a nation's conditions and policies on human rights are its own internal affairs, while MFN treatment is a kind of specific term to facilitate trade exchanges between two sovereign states. In fact, there is no connection between these two things. As disclosed by a U.S. newspaper, the findings of a survey conducted by the U.S. administration show that if the MFN status to China is revoked, it could cause losses of between $10 and $13 billion to China and the United States. It is no wonder that U.S. Treasury Secretary Bentsen repeatedly said that the MFN issue is of paramount importance to both China and the United States and that it must be handled prudently. Where Does the Difficulty in the Syria-Israel Talks Lie? U.S. State Secretary Christopher was again on his shuttle tour of the Middle East from 15 to 18 May, the second time this month. After the talks on autonomy between the PLO and Israel had succeeded and a final agreement on implementing the autonomy was signed, the U.S. side wished very much to strike while the iron was hot and push the Middle East peace process further forward. But, the answer as to whether or not a new breakthrough can be made in the Arab-Israeli talks rests with Syria. Therefore, Christopher went to Syria a second time. Judging from the situation revealed by the various sides, however, though the talks have touched on substantive issues, it is not an easy job to actually resolve the problem. In fact, compared with the Palestinian issue, the contradiction between Syria and Israel is much less complex and difficult. The crucial point lies in the fact that the hostile mentality caused by the confrontation between the two sides for many years is so intense that they cannot trust each other. Without mutual trust, it will be very difficult to achieve any results in the talks and to realize the goal of peaceful coexistence between the two sides.
