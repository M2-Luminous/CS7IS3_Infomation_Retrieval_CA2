FBIS4-48192 "drafr094_a_94018" FBIS-AFR-94-094 Daily Report 14 May 1994 CENTRAL AFRICA Rwanda UN Official on Contacts With RPF, Government UN Official on Contacts With RPF, Government LD1405163694 Paris Radio France International in French 1230 GMT 14 May 94 LD1405163694 Paris Radio France International French BFN [Excerpts] Jose Ayala Lasso, the high commissioner for human rights [name and title as received], visited the Rwandan capital Kigali this week. During his visit he held talks with the rebel leader, Paul Kagame, and met senior army and government officials. Jose Ayala Lasso succeeded in obtaining the commitment of the various parties to enable the departure of the 20,000 civilians who detained like hostages at Kigali's stadium or at the Mille Collines Hotel. Assane Diop asked Jose Ayala Lasso where these civilians could take refuge if these commitments were respected: [Begin recording] [Lasso] This will have to be one of the factors under consideration since they will not only need guarantees concerning their personal safety to leave, but they will also have to go to a place where they will be safe. All this must be considered, assessed, planned, and implemented. [Diop] Would it be in Rwanda or in neighboring countries? [Lasso] This will depend on these people. Some want to leave for a foreign country. However, all this must be assessed in conjunction with the means at our disposal to guarantee safety, and also with the possibility to move within the country. [Diop] Would the United Nations be ready to pay for the costs of displacing so many people inside or outside Rwanda? [Lasso] I have no doubt that the high commissioner for refugees or other UN agencies will be able to support this scheme. [passage omitted] [Diop] Beyond obtaining the freedom of these hostages you have also attempted to obtain a cease-fire. You have met senior Rwandan military and government officials, did you also meet senior RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] officials? [Lasso] I met General Kagame of the RPF. I did not go there with the idea to negotiate or to put forward a cease-fire. I went there to bring my message as high commissioner for human rights, that is: Stop the violence, respect the rights of all and everyone. Obviously, all this is closely tied to the cease-fire and it is only for this and in this context that I said that it was necessary for both parties to take measures to reach an agreement for a cease- fire. [Diop] Did the rebels commit themselves to sparing lives? [Lasso] The rebels say that a cease-fire does not necessarily imply an end to the violence, because massacres have gone on even during the cease-fire. They believe that the cease-fire must be included in a process that should, first, be aimed at ending violence. Naturally when they say that, they are accusing the other party. The same position, with some slightly different nuances, is being held by government soldiers. [passage omitted] [end recording]
