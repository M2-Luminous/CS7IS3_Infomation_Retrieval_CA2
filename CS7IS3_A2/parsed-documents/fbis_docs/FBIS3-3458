Speaking on achievements of the NPC session at a reception for Chinese and overseas reporters this afternoon, Premier Li said that the NPC session has adopted his government work report, affirmed the work of the government last year, approved principles and tasks for this year's work, and passed a budget law. What is more important, the premier said, is that NPC deputies unanimously stand for the principle of "seizing development opportunities, deepening reform, expanding opening to the outside world, promoting development and maintaining stability." The principle is a guideline for all work this year, he said. NPC deputies have reached "unprecedented consensus" on the need to correctly handle relations among reform, development and stability, he said. The second session of the Eighth NPC and the Second Session of the Eighth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference have provided "a reliable guarantee for the fulfillment of various tasks this year," he said. The NPC session also demonstrated a democratic style of work. Leaders of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee and the State Council joined many provincial-level delegations in discussions, exchanged views on state affairs with deputies, and heard criticisms and suggestions from them, he said. "Both the number of meetings and contacts have set a record," he said. "In short, this is a session marked by democracy, pragmatism, unity and progress."
