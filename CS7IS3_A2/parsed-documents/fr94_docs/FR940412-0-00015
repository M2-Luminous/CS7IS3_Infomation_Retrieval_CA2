FR940412-0-00015 FR940412-0-00005 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Research and Special Programs Administration 49 CFR Part 190, 192, 193, and 195 RIN 2137&hyph;AB71 [Docket No. PS&hyph;126; Amdts. 190&hyph;5, 192&hyph;72, 193&hyph;9, 195&hyph;50] Passage of Instrumented Internal Inspection Devices AGENCY: Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This final rule amends the gas, hazardous liquid and carbon dioxide pipeline safety regulations to require that certain new and replacement pipelines be designed and constructed to accommodate the passage of instrumented internal inspection devices (smart pigs). This action was taken in response to a mandate in the Pipeline Safety Reauthorization Act of 1988. The intended effect of these amended regulations is to improve the safety of gas, hazardous liquid and carbon dioxide pipelines by permitting their inspection by ``smart pigs'' using the latest technology for detecting and recording abnormalities in the pipe wall. EFFECTIVE DATE: The effective date of this final rule is May 12, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Albert C. Garnett, (202) 366&hyph;2036 regarding the subject matter of this amendment or the Docket Unit, (202) 366&hyph;5046 regarding copies of this amendment or other material in the docket. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Notice of Proposed Rulemaking RSPA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) on November 20, 1992 (57 FR 54745) proposing that new and replacement gas transmission lines and new and replacement hazardous liquid pipelines and carbon dioxide pipelines be designed and constructed to accommodate the passage of instrumented internal inspection devices. However, the rules would not apply to specific installations for which such design and construction would be impracticable. In addition, the NPRM proposed a procedure for operators seeking an administrative ruling on any rule in parts 192, 193 and 195 in which the administrator is authorized to make a finding or approval. The NPRM was issued in response to Congressional mandates in sections 108(b) and 207(b) of the Pipeline Safety Reauthorization Act of 1988 (hereinafter ``Reauthorization Act'') (Pub. L. 100&hyph;561; Oct. 31, 1988). Section 108(b) of the Reauthorization Act amended section 3 of the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 (NGPSA) by adding subsection (g), ``Instrumented Internal Inspection Devices'' (49 app. U.S.C. 1672). This new subsection requires the Secretary of Transportation to establish regulations requiring that: (1) The design and construction of new [gas] transmission facilities, and (2) when replacement of existing transmission facilities or equipment is required, the replacement of such existing facilities, be carried out, to the extent practicable, in a manner so as to accommodate the passage through such transmission facilities of instrumented internal inspection devices (commonly referred to as ``smart pigs''). Section 207(b) of the Reauthorization Act amended section 203 of the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act of 1979 (HLPSA) (49 app. U.S.C. 2002) to require that DOT establish similar regulations with respect to pipeline facilities subject to the HLPSA. Future Rulemaking Involving Smart Pigs The Pipeline Safety Act of 1992 (hereinafter ``PLSA of 1992'') (Pub. L. 102&hyph;508; Oct. 24, 1992) in sections 103 and 203 amended the NGPSA and the HLPSA, respectively, by requiring the Secretary of Transportation to issue regulations that require the periodic inspection of gas transmission facilities and hazardous liquid pipelines in high-density population areas, and hazardous liquid pipelines in environmentally sensitive areas or crossing navigable waterways. In response to these mandates, RSPA will issue an NPRM proposing to prescribe the circumstances, if any, under which such inspections would be conducted with smart pigs. In those circumstances under which an inspection by a smart pig would not be required, RSPA is mandated to require the use of an inspection method that is at least as effective as the use of smart pigs in providing for the safety of the pipeline. Regulations In the NPRM, RSPA proposed to require all future new and replacement gas transmission lines subject to 49 CFR part 192 and hazardous liquid and carbon dioxide pipelines subject to 49 CFR part 195 to be designed and constructed to accommodate the passage of smart pigs, except where impracticable. For the purposes of this rulemaking, RSPA proposed that it would be impracticable to require the accommodation of smart pigs under the following categories of piping: Manifolds, station piping (such as compressor stations, pump stations, metering stations or regulator stations), cross-overs, and fittings providing branch line junctures (such as tees and other lateral connections). Additionally, the NPRM proposed to allow pipeline operators to petition (minimum 90 days in advance) the Administrator, in a particular case, for a finding that design or construction to accommodate a smart pig would be impracticable. Advisory Committees The Technical Pipeline Safety Standards Committee (TPSSC) and the Technical Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Standards Committee (THLPSSC) have been established by statute to evaluate pipeline safety regulations. The TPSSC and the THLPSSC met in joint session in Washington, DC on August 3, 1993, and considered the NPRM. Both committees accepted the NPRM as feasible, reasonable, and practicable with the incorporation of several changes. RSPA's disposition of the advisory committees' recommendations are discussed below. Discussion of Comments RSPA received public comments on the proposed rule change from 48 pipeline operators, seven pipeline-related associations, three state/Federal agencies, and one consulting engineer. The following discussion explains how RSPA considered the advisory committees' positions and the public comments on the proposed regulations in developing the final rule. Low Stress Pipelines Twenty-three commenters indicated that the rule should except pipelines in which the internal operating pressure results in low stress in the pipe wall. Many commenters argued that since gas transmission lines are not subject to certain pipeline safety regulations (§§192.609, 192.711 & 192.713) if they operate at or below 40 percent of the specified minimum yield strength (SMYS), that this rule should similarly not apply to these same transmission lines. The TPSSC also recommended that piping operating at a stress level of 40 percent of SMYS or less be excepted.
