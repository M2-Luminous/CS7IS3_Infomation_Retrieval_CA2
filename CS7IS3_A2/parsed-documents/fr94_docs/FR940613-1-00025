FR940613-1-00025 FR940613-1-00003 Several commenters suggested that the FDIC have oversight authority of State Savings Bank mutual-to-stock conversions, but with prescribed limitations. For example, a national banking industry trade group noted that it ``deplores instances in which it can be demonstrated that insiders involved in mutual-to-stock conversions received benefits so large that they bear no reasonable relationship to the institution's performance *␣*␣* Unjustifiable windfall profits, depletion of capital without concern for safety and soundness and manipulation of the value of the institution to benefit limited interests are practices that deserve close scrutiny and action by the appropriate authorities *␣*␣* In responding to these issues, the FDIC should act quickly and decisively in concert with the state authorities.'' The trade group further commented that the ``cornerstone'' for the FDIC's response to issues arising from the mutual-to-stock conversion issue is the state regulatory authorities. One state thrift regulator expressed support for FDIC oversight of conversions if such involvement assures ``reasonableness and relative uniformity of benefits for both state- and OTS-regulated institutions *␣*␣* and allows state variation from OTS requirements if such variations benefit the institution and the depositors.'' One mutual savings bank noted that the FDIC should focus on broad safety-and-soundness issues and that detailed regulations, like the OTS', are not necessary. Another state mutual savings bank said that the FDIC should be involved in conversion oversight, but only in terms of setting minimum standards rather than superseding state regulation. Many savings banks in Massachusetts and a banking trade association in that state commented that the FDIC should issue conversion regulations similar to the OTS and Massachusetts mutual-to-stock conversion regulations, noting that the FDIC has broad statutory authority to regulate issues that affect safety and soundness. They noted that the FDIC's focus should be to eliminate abuses in stock evaluation, depositor disclosures, depositors' ability to purchase stock at conversion and insider compensation programs. They also asserted that state statutory and regulatory conversion rules should not be superseded by federal law. One mutual savings bank noted that promulgating federal laws or regulations ``should not be allowed when it is determined that state requirements are generally consistent or more stringent than existing federal rules.'' Some commenters contended that state regulation was sufficient in the area of mutual-to-stock conversions and that the Interim Rule is not necessary. One mutual savings bank asserted that the ``averments made by the FDIC in support of the Interim Rule that it is needed for safety and soundness reasons and to protect the interest of depositors are without merit and are being offered only to support continued federal intrusion into issues which are primarily the concern of state law and regulation.'' One state mutual savings bank stated that the ``proposed policy statement is overkill'' and that ``state regulation can handle insider abuse issues.'' One state banking and thrift regulator asserted that state regulators are not to blame for insider abuses in conversions and that ``states' rights should not be tramped on.'' The regulator suggested that a committee of state and federal regulators work together to address issues and concerns. All those who commented on the issue expressed objection to Congressional legislation to address current issues in mutual-to-stock conversions. One mutual savings bank commented that ``if the FDIC does not act, Congress will_in an uninformed manner.'' Another mutual savings bank noted that ``regulation is far preferable than legislation.'' A national banking industry trade group noted that the ``FDIC has full statutory authority in the conversion area to ensure the integrity of the conversion process and no new legislation is necessary to address these issues.''
