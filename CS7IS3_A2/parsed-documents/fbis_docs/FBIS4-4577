Moving quickly through the airport, Ranariddh said only that the trip, on which he was accompanied by his wife, had been a private visit. The joint ministers of defence, Generals Tie Banh and Tea Chamrat, returned from a four-day trip in Hanoi to strengthen military ties. Tie Banh said Vietnam had congratulated the Royal Cambodian army for capturing Pailin. He denied a Thai newspaper report which said Thursday that the two ministers had appealed to Hanoi for ammunition and weapons. "We went there only to improve our good relations with our neighbors," he said. "Our trip was not concerned with politics or ammunitions supplies. It was a friendly visit." [passage omitted]
