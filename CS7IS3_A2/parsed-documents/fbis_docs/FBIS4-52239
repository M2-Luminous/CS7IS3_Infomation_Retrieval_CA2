Sison said yesterday. In a statement sent from his base in Utrecht, The Netherlands, Sison said Lagman need not worry about being executed by former comrades in the Communist Party of the Philippines [CPP] because agents of the military and anti-communist forces are likely to get to him first and blame the New People's Army [NPA] for his death. According to Sison, he has information that Lagman, former chief of the Manila-Rizal Committee of the CPP, was part of a plan hatched in December last year to form a national coordinating board for an anti-communist "united front." Lagman, however, backed out of the plan and "torpedoed" it, earning the ire of the military and anti-communist forces who had designed the plan, Sison said. "In my opinion, Lagman has more to fear from the military and his fellow contras. They are capable of eliminating him and then holding the New People's Army responsible," said Sison. Sison also belittled a warning by Lagman that should there be a communist arrest order for him, his men will kill Sison in Utrecht. "I should thank Lagman for unwittingly confirming the assassination plot designed by the military and such renegades as Arturo Tabara, Romulo Kintanar, and Antonio Cabardo," said Sison. "I now laugh it (death threat) off because since the first time he (Lagman) had made the threat, precautionary measures have been adopted on my part," he added. The Revolutionary Council of Trade Unions (RCTU), an underground labor organization, said there is yet no order for the arrest of Lagman, although charges will be filed against him before so-called people's court. The RCTU also said in a statement that the so-called split in the communist movement is nothing but a "breakaway of some elements hostile to the ongoing rectification movement led by the CPP." "The media hype and distortions about the revolutionary underground is unduly creating an atmosphere of animosity that could endanger the lives of comrades," the statement said. The RCTU also clarified that the CPP never issued any hit list for the summary executions of breakaway rebel leaders Lagman, Kintanar, Tabara, and Ricardo Reyes. "There are no such hit lists, only charges that have still to be duly processed in the revolutionary courts," the group said. According to Sison, Lagman faces possible death in the hands of the NPA only if he resists arrest and "continues to be armed and dangerous." Sison also said Lagman should not fear trial by a people's court because his former comrades assure him of due process. Lagman, in a telephone interview with INQUIRER dared former comrades to "come and get me." He said if any armed partisan tried to arrest him, he and his men will retaliate against Sison in Utrecht. "We will not retaliate against Sison's men here. We will hit the head itself in Utrecht," said Lagman.
