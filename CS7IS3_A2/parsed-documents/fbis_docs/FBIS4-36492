Speaking at a meeting held at the Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ), Dr. al-Majali said the government was also seeking reform in its public administration system and improve the performance of employees. Dr. al-Majali's statement came less than 24 hours after the government's announcement that the 437,000 serving government workers, military personnel and pensioners will get a raise of 10 percent that would not be less than JD [Jordanian dinars] 10 per month. The increase takes effect on July 1, 1994. Finance Minister Sami Qammuh said the decision was taken to give the civil servants a raise "within the government's financial means." But, he added, a special committee of experts is continuing to study other measures intended to improve government employees' conditions and raise their efficiency and performance. Mr. Qammuh told a press conference on Sunday that the government hoped the committee would end its study and submit recommendations to the govenrment in the next few months. Another committee had been entrusted with studying matters related to state-owned lands on which govenrment housing units could be set up to benefit government employees, he said. This committee would be given long-term soft loans provided by the state, the minister said. Mr. Qammuh said that while the 10 percent increase benefits government civil and military personnel and the pensioners, employees excelling in their performance would be granted other allowances depending on the degree of their progress and their production. Mr. Qammuh said the economy was moving ahead "with firm strides towards further growth and stability." Economic indicators in the first few months of this year point to continuing economic growth in various sectors of production and service despite the "wait-and-see situation in view of the prevailing circumstances in the region," Mr. Qammuh said. "We hope to see all Jordan's economic objectives achieved with the completion of the economic restructuring programme agreed on with the International Monetary Fund (IMF)," the minister said, adding that the accomplishments of the past two years had exceeded expectations. Mr. Qammuh said that exports rose from JD 213 million in the first four months of 1993 to JD 292 million in the first quarter of this year and imports declined from JD 697 million in the first four months of 1993 to JD 644 million in the same period of 1994. The deficit in the fiscal budget has narrowed from JD 69 million to JD 21.7 million in the first four months of this year, largely due to a decline in expenditure and a rise in revenues, the minister said. Mr. Qammuh said that an upsurge in the construction business provides another indicator of the improvement of the general economic situation. In the first four months of last year 2,889 building licences were issued against 4,232 in the same period of this year while the area built during this period this year amounted to nearly a million square metres, up from 635,000 square metres in the same period of last year, the minister said. Mr. Qammuh noted that intial issues in Amman Financial Market (AFM) in the first four months of 1994 amounted to JD 79.2 million compared to JD 48.1 million in the same period of 1993. Mr. Qammuh said the government expects Jordan to achieve a 5.5 percent growth at current fixed prices in the gross domestic product (GDP). Inflation, he said, is expected at five percent. A reduction in the fiscal budget by 6.4 percent over the 1993 figures is also expected. A reduction in the budget deficit from 6.4 percent of the gross domestic product in 1993 to 5.4 percent this year is also expected, Mr. Qammuh said. The government expects a reduction of the deficit in the current balance of payments from JD 648 million in 1993 to JD 546 million this year, he said.
