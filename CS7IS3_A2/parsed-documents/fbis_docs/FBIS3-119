On his way to addressing a special three-day parliamentary session, he told pressmen that the South African Government still had more to give in the negotiations and wanted to give more. "Time will tell". South Africa had reached the end of one chapter of negotiations, after which "fundamental negotiations will still take place", which was neither good nor bad news. He felt the constitutional and electoral amendments to be considered by Parliament in the special session addressed the core of the matters about which negotiations had been conducted. But "you can bring a horse to water but you can't make it drink". On Tuesday's scheduled talks between ANC [African National Congress] President Mr Nelson Mandela and IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] head Dr Mangosuthu Buthelezi, he said: "I hope it goes well". The two leaders should have met more often before now.
