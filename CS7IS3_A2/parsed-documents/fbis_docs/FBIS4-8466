An ultranationalist Greek group, the self-styled "MAVI" (Northern Epirus Liberation Front), has claimed responsibility for the victims -- two dead and three wounded -- at the Albanian military barracks. The motives behind the massacre are explained in a communique sent last Sunday evening by the previously entirely unknown MAVI to the Athens newspaper ELEFTEROTHYPIA, well-known as the leading mouthpiece of Greek nationalist circles. The link between the slogans shouted by the members of the terrorist group and the motives behind this serious incident have also become entirely clear. According to the ultranationalist group, the attack was a response to "the criminal indifference of the Greek state," which, according to them, "has failed to act properly to prevent the expulsion of Greeks from Albanian territory, thus helping Tirana in its ultimate objective of eliminating the Greek element from Albania. Our action was intended to change the disastrous attitude of the Greek Government toward Vorioepiros [Northern Epirus]," the communique concludes. The news of the serious border incident prompted a wave of protest from the Albanian authorities and political forces. In a statement addressed to the international community, an Albanian Foreign Ministry spokesman held the Greek Government responsible for the attack: "It is beyond all doubt that the attack was prepared by special Greek forces." President Berisha and Prime Minister Meksi also responded with indignation. Meanwhile, the Albanian ambassador in Athens was urgently recalled to Tirana on Monday for consultations. Kastriot Robo, first secretary of the Albanian Embassy, confirmed this news, calling the incident "very serious and unprecedented." For their part, the Greek authorities have disclaimed all responsibility for Sunday's attack. Athens spokesman Evangelos Venizelos called the charges in the Albanian Foreign Ministry's protest note groundless. "Greece will not accept any provocation or charge without documentary evidence. Greece is against any kind of act of violence." Just a week earlier, the Greek Government had addressed a warning to Tirana, reminding the Albanian capital of the "inviolable nature" of the rights of the Greek minority, who are "indissolubly" tied to Greece. The Greek press has to some extent left Sunday's news in the shade. Some newspapers, such as the progovernment Athens daily TA NEA, have even put forward a theory that this was an action by "the Albanian mafia." Only LAIKO VRIMA, the newspaper of the Greek minority in Albania, has come out against the attack. A letter sent urgently by its editorial board to President Sali Berisha expresses sorrow over the victims of the tragedy. Greek nationalism and the problem of Northern Epirus have in the past led to a deterioration in relations between the two countries, but the incident last Sunday was the most serious since the fighting on the border in August 1949. Greek nationalist groups have for a long time been agitating for the union of "Vorioepiros" with Greece. Greek political figures, including former ministers such as Sotiris Kouvelas, have called this area "unliberated territory." Sebastianos, the Orthodox bishop of Konitsa, has had a radio station with five repeaters installed at the border; these send nationalist messages to the Greek minority in Albania. All this activity has not led to the slightest response from the Greek authorities, which are on the contrary always ready to make a fuss about the "irredentist propaganda" of neighboring countries such as Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], Turkey, and Albania.
