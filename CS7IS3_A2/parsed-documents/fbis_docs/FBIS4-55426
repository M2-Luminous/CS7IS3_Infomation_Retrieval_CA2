Something similar is now taking place in Zagreb, where a new political formation has split off from the party of President Tudjman. Gyorgyi Orban has spoken to its leader, Stipe Mesic, who was, incidentally, the last head of state of the former Yugoslavia. [Begin recording] [Orban] Why did the founders of the ruling Croatian Democratic Community [HDZ] leave the party? What were you dissatisfied with? [Mesic speaking in Croatian, with superimposed translation] The HDZ has fulfilled its historical task. We, the founders of the party, together with the HDZ, led the country out of communism and laid the foundations of the democratic system. But the present-day structure of the HDZ is no longer suited to today's challenges, which need answers to the problems of creating the new Croatian state. First, the party is becoming more and more bureaucratic in its organization and structure, and the party is directed from a center, to be more precise, from the office of the president of the republic. Second, Croatia's policy on Bosnia-Herzegovina is two-faced. For public opinion they pretend to favor a united Bosnia-Herzegovina, whereas in fact those forces within the party which support a splinter state, the so-called Herzeg-Bosna, are becoming stronger. Gojko Susak, who is the defense minister and the party's deputy chairman, is in daily telephone contact with those in Herzeg-Bosna who sparked off the Croatian-Muslim battles. What all this means in practice is that we are playing an active part in doing ourselves harm. For if the breakup of Bosnia-Herzegovina does come about, then the probability of Croatia's territorial integrity ever being attained will diminish. We are also critical of the way the president of the republic directs the bodies of authority. From his office he tries simultaneously to influence the work of parliament, the government, the courts, and other important institutions. [Orban] What are the chances of maintaining the balance in parliament in the wake of your departure from the government party? Can we expect an opposition majority? [Mesic] There is a hard campaign going on against us, of the kind that has not been experienced since the darkest period of Bolshevism. Those who want to go over to the Independent Democrats are exposed to great pressure. One by one they are being forced, virtually daily, to withdraw or even not to leave the government party. It is not only civil servants surrounding the president of the republic, but also the president himself, who try to talk these deputies out of joining us. As for what kind of power balance emerges in parliament, that is difficult to predict. Anything could happen. But it is impossible to alter the facts which led to the departure of the Independent Democrats. It is my conviction that opinions can only be influenced for a short time with methods such as these. [Orban] You are the chairman of the [Croatian] Assembly, that is to say parliament. Josip Manolic, who likewise left the ruling party, is chairman of the upper house. What will happen now with your functions? Can you keep them, and could this crisis lead to the calling of early parliamentary elections? [Mesic] Your question goes to the heart of the problem. The head of state is constantly alluding to democracy, but I feel that he does not understand its essence [words indistinct]. Because to take steps, with telephone calls, to ensure the dismissal of the speaker of the upper house cannot really be described as a democratic method. The question is not whether the speakers of the lower and upper houses of parliament remain in their posts, but what kind of power relations will develop in parliament. Parliamentary statuses cannot be changed from the presidential office. One has to sit around the table and state that the power relations have changed since the last parliamentary elections and that the functions have to be redistributed. It is not only the Independent Democrats that have been set up since the elections of two years ago; other parliamentary parties, such as the Peasant Party, or the Istrian Democratic Alliance, have also split into several factions. So, it is not a question of dismissals but of a redistribution of roles. [Orban] What kind of future are the Independent Democrats offering to the Croatians? What would you do differently? For example, what kind of policy would the new party conduct vis-a-vis Bosnia-Herzegovina or the Croatian Serbs? [Mesic] I believe that a division of Bosnia-Herzegovina is unthinkable, because then it would be impossible ever again to restore the territorial integrity of Croatia. The Croatian Independent Democratic Party wishes to conduct open politics in the issue of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Its view is that the Bosnian Serbs must at all events be involved in the talks aimed at reaching a settlement. We want a Croatia that is a democratic civic state, which protects all its citizens, respects human rights, and guarantees the rights of the nationalities living on its territory. Croatia wishes to cooperate with its neighbors; it will not erect a Berlin wall along its borders. So, we would like to create a Croatia which fully accords with democratic norms. [end recording]
