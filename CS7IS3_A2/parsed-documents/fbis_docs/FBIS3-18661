Roumbanis] [Excerpt] Greek Alternate Foreign Minister Theodhoros Pangalos yesterday described the Ankara regime as "far worse than a dictatorship." He also said that Turkey was never a state of justice, and in some cases imitates and exceeds Hitler's policies. Speaking at the presentation of a book about the Greeks of Istanbul by Alexandros Alavanos, Coalition of the Left and Progress deputy, the Greek alternate foreign minister launched an all-out attack against Turkey for its violation of human rights and its expansionist policy, for which Cyprus is now paying in the most tragic way. At the beginning, both the Greek alternate foreign minister and the author referred to the history of the famous 1964 secret decree, with which the Ankara government prohibits the Greeks living in Istanbul from transferring their properties and confiscates the property. In 1980, another law was added to that decree, prohibiting the execution of wills for the Greeks living in Istanbul. Both men stressed that even though these decrees are contrary to the association agreement between the European Union and Turkey, they are still in effect. They said the issue will now be brought to the attention of the European Union. Pangalos noted that the 1964 decree was inspired by a similar decree Hitler issued in 1935 that was used to confiscate property belonging to Jews. [passage omitted]
