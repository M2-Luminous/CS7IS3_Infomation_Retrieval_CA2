Answering this request, a PUNR delegation led by Ioan Gavra [vice president of the PUNR and of the Chamber of Deputies] met yesterday morning with Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu, whom the members of the delegation asked to order the dismissal of current Agriculture Minister Ioan Oancea as soon as possible. The PUNR's reasons for this request were the data and conclusions of the report of the anticorruption commission and other indications that the PUNR got hold of in various ways. According to Gavra's declarations, the prime minister allegedly accepted the accusations formulated by the PUNR as justified. The two sides that participated in yesterday's dialogue agreed that Oancea's dismissal would be opportune even before the report on actions of corruption would be discussed in the plenary meeting of the two chambers of the Romanian Parliament. The participants in the meeting of the PUNR Standing Bureau also told us that during the Wednesday evening meeting, the participants proposed that Senator Viorel Salagean should be appointed as leader of the group in charge of reorganizing the Bucharest branch of the party. Considering that he declined this mission, Cornel Brahas received the respective task. Through this appointment -- which might also imply his appointment to the position of president of the Bucharest branch of the party -- the PUNR leaders wished to contradict rumors regarding Brahas' so-called dissidence.
