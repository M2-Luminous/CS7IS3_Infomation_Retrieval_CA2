The ceasefire would come into effect April 4, and withdrawal of forces would begin the following day, it said. Heavy weapons would be pulled back up to 20 kilometres (12 miles) and infantry 1,000 metres on each side. The statement was issued after a ceasefire accord was signed at the end of negotiations that began Tuesday [29 March] in the Russian Embassy here and lasted most of the night. "The parties signing this document agree that all armed hostilities between the parties should end immediately, and that a ceasefire on all contact lines existing between the parties on 29 March 1994 (...) should be fully respected from 0900 hours 4 April 1994," it said. "Not later than 0900 hours 5 April 1994, all indirect fire weapons shall be deployed out of range of the Lines of Separation: mortars and AA-guns not less than 10 kilometres, artillery and tanks not less than 20 kilometres. Not later than 0900 hours on 8 April 1994, all units on the Contact Line shall be separated. The separation will be based on a mutual withdrawal not less than 1,000 metres from the Contact Line to their respective line of separation." The ceasefire will be monitored by the United Nations Protection Force for the former Yugoslavia (UNPROFOR) and the European Union Monitoring Commission, the statement added. The talks, brokered by Russian envoy Vitaliy Churkin, had resumed here Tuesday after a week-long break. The first since the conflict erupted two years ago, they had broken off on March 22 after failing to reach an agreement. The negotiations were aimed solely at forging a ceasefire between the two sides, the Croatian government and the rebel Serbs who have proclaimed a separatist republic, the Serb republic of Krajina (RSK), on roughly a quarter of Croatian territory. The spokesman for the international conference on the former Yugoslavia, John Mills, said earlier the negotiators, armed with 35 detailed maps, were working out sector by sector how to pull back their forces from the front lines. They were assisted by senior officers of UNPROFOR, which intends to send buffer units into the resulting no man's land two kilometres (2,000 yards) across.
