Proskurov, SILSKI VISTI correspondent, Zaporizhzhya Oblast: "They Are Patching Okhrim's Overcoat"] [Text] The farmers of Zaporizhzhya Oblast have completed sowing early grain crops and and other pulse crops on an area of 236,000 hectares. In addition, they had to resow winter crops on 168,000 hectares. But a great deal of work has yet to be done -- some 700,000 hectares of late crops still need to be sown. They have already begun sowing feed and sugar beets in the southern regions of the oblast, and the fields are being preapred for planting corn. "Before spring began, there was a great deal of panic that the farms would not manage to sow their fields," said I. Kostenko, the chairman of the Shevchenko Collective Farm in Zaporizhzhya Rayon. "But these dire predictions have not come true -- work in the fields is continuing. We even sowed our early grain crops in two shifts, but the devil take such work. We're short of the most essential things but cannot buy them. Actually, the farm is doing quite well, but nonpayment by the state has put it on file [i.e., left it in debt], and now the bank takes every kopeck that is deposited in our account towards paying off our debts. We recently received 60 million karbovantsi for buying spare parts, but all we heard was the rustle of this money disappearing at the bank. The state should probably give some thought to arranging for this money to go directly to suppliers rather than into the collective farm's account." That is not the only thing that the state needs to think about. It has introduced a so-called commodities credit on goods to be produced in 1994 and applies this credit to supply the farms with fuel, fertilizer, and herbicides. This has helped the farmers in the busy spring season. But while it provides gasoline and diesel fuel, the state has completely forgotten to include lubricants. "You can howl in despair, for all the good it will do you," complains A. Klymenko, the chairman of the Druzhba Collective Farm in Tokmak Rayon. "Right now, we don't have a problem with fuel, but we can't take our equipment into the fields without lubricants. Dealers are asking 30 million karbovantsi per metric ton. And where are we to get the money when the processing enterprises owe us one billion karbovantsi? A lack of funds is preventing us from buying suger beet seed, and we did not stock up on top quality spring grain seed. We are still waiting for the mineral fertilizer promised us by contract." Here, as at many other farms, spare parts are a problem. According to A. Klymenko, the rayahropostach [rayon agricultural supply center ?] has spare parts, but it requires advance payment because it has received no directive from above to issue spare parts on credit. The farmers are doing whatever they can to solve their problems. They are siphoning off lubricants from combine engines. They remove working parts and assemblies from tractors that are not needed in the fields at a given moment. In short, they are patching Okhrim's overcoat. But how much longer can it last?
