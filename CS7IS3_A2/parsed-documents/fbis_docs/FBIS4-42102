At the end of the meeting in Havana of the joint commission on economic and industrial cooperation, the agreement was signed by Ernesto Melendez, the Cuban minister for foreign investment and economic cooperation, and Apolonio Ruiz Ligero, the Spanish secretary of state for foreign trade. The most important aspect of the agreement is that it establishes measures to stimulate and protect investment. It provides for arbitration and conciliation mechanisms and has a very positive psychological effect, said the Spanish representative, who stressed that the aim is to encourage sectors other than the tourist industry because Cuba could become a highly attractive country for the Spanish economy.
