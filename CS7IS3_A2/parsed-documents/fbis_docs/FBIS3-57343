At the same time, the President said that Baku was opposed to war and still committed to a peaceful solution to the conflict. However, the Armenian army continues aggression against Azerbaijan by launching new offensives, he said. Aliyev pledged commitment to further efforts for a negotiated settlement to the conflict saying appropriate contacts were under way to this end including Armenia. But he warned against further Armenian aggression saying his country would have no other option but to recover lost territory by force if that was not stopped. The President called on Yerevan to relinquish the occupied territories of its own accord, withdraw its troops and respect the sovereignty and integrity of Azerbaijan. The war will end if the Armenian government fulfils those conditions, Aliyev said.
