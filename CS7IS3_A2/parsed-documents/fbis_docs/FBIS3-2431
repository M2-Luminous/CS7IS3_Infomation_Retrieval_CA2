She is now in Japan to commemorate the publication of Japanese edition of her book: My Father, Deng Xiaoping. [Video shows Sakurai sitting face to face with Deng Rong] [Sakurai] You resemble your father. Your face is round and your brow is broad. You resemble your father. [Deng] [Laughter] I resemble my father a bit but not completely. I have my mother's eyes and eyebrows and my father's nose, mouth, and chin. I told my father that I am more good-looking than he is. [laughter] [video shows Deng Xiaoping holding Deng Rong in his lap when she was a child] [Sakurai] We saw Mr. Deng Xiaping on the New Year's Day by the lunar calendar for the first time in one year. How is your father's health? [Deng] Generally speaking, he is in fairly good health [shen ti zhuang kuang bi jiao hao di]. Specifically, for a man at the ripe old age of 90, his condition can be described in English as perfect [the preceding word rendered in English]; that is his current health condition is remarkable [heng chu se]. What is important is that he is not ill; however, because he is at the advanced age of 90, his health and overall physical condition are naturally not as good as two or five years ago. There is an old Chinese saying that when a man gets old, his feet are the first to age. Therefore, he does not walk as fast as before. [video shows Deng Rong accompanying her father on New Year's Day] [Sakurai] What is Mr. Deng Xiaoping's dream or hope? [Deng] My father is a statesman, and his greatest concerns are none other than major domestic affairs and international political and economic matters. However, because he has retired, he has begun to pay heed to his grandchildren's report cards. If their academic performance was not so good, he would make comments in order to show that he was concerned about his grandchildren's studies in his capacity as a grandfather. My father is a bridge enthusiast who plays bridge three or four times a week but not every night. [laughter] Before he retired, he played twice a week. After he retired.... [pauses] We spent this winter in Shanghai, where he invited his bridge partners so that they could play bridge everyday, not three or four times a week. After he returned to Beijing, they reduced the frequency, to three or four times, because they live quite far apart. [Sakurai] Mrs. Deng, you just said your father's feet have become weak, but he walks three km every day. [Deng's response not heard]
